3684583,kernel of Haagerup tensor product of maps,"Haagerup tensor product $\otimes_{\rm h}$ is both injective and projective. Pisier, Gilles , Introduction to operator space theory, London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series 294. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (ISBN 0-521-81165-1/pbk). vii, 478Â p. (2003). ZBL1093.46001 . Can the following be true? Let $q_i : E_i \rightarrow F_i$ be complete quotient maps of operator spaces. Then \begin{equation}
{\rm Ker} \, q_1 \otimes_{\rm h} q_2 = {\rm Ker} \, q_1 \otimes_{\rm h} E_2 + E_1 \otimes_{\rm h} {\rm Ker} \, q_2.
\end{equation} I have some hints which tilt me towards believing it is true. Denote by U the operator space on the right. Then $U \subset {\rm Ker} \, q_1 \otimes_{\rm h} q_2$ . Then the product map drops to a map on $(E_1 \otimes_{\rm h} E_2)/U$ and we need to prove that this map is injective. As for the algebraic tensor product, one finds an inverse map from $F_1 \otimes_{\rm h} F_2 \simeq E_1/{\rm Ker}\, q_1 \otimes_{\rm h} E_2/{\rm Ker} \, q_2$ to $(E_1 \otimes_{\rm h} E_2)/U$ . For this one starts from the bilinear map: $(\hat e_1,\hat e_2) \mapsto \widehat{e_1 \otimes e_2}$ , where the hats are the obvious classes. It is well defined and completely bounded. Hence it defines a linear map on the Haagerup product. Then one checks that it is the inverse map we looked for. I am hesitant because this implies $(E \otimes_{\rm h} F)/(G \otimes_{\rm h} F) \simeq (E/G) \otimes_{\rm h} F$ for any sub-space $G$ of $E$ .","['tensor-products', 'operator-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'operator-algebras']"
3684606,Prove that a stochastic process cannot have continuous paths,"Consider the following problem. Suppose that a stochastic process $V$ satisfies the conditions below $t_1 \neq t_2$ implies that $V(t_1)$ and $V(t_2)$ are independent. $\{V(t)\}$ is stationary, i.e. the (joint) distribution of $\{V(t_1+t),\dots,V(t_k+t)\}$ does not depend on $t$ . $\mathbb{E}[V(t)] = 0$ for all $t$ . Prove that $V(t)$ cannot have continuous paths. The hint says to consider $E[|V(t,N)-V(s,N)|^2]$ where $$

3684763,"What is the significance of the term ""separable"" in the context of countability properties?","In the context of topological spaces, I see the following major countability properties: A space is: ""separable"" iff it has a countable dense subset ""second countable"" iff if has a countable basis ""first countable"" iff the neighbourhood system of every point has a countable local basis.

The question I have is: ""separable"" into what, exactly? By which I mean to say: what is the thinking behind calling such a condition ""separable""?

3685110,"Given $f$ holomorphic, which are the necessary conditions on $\phi$ in order to make $\phi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1}$ holomorphic?","It is well known that $\bar f(\bar z)$ is holomorphic whenever f is. I was wondering how to generalize this fact... Let $f: \Omega \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be holomorphic and $\phi: \mathbb{C} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be an homeomorphism where $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is open. We need the exsistence of the limit $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{\phi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1}(z_0 + h) - \phi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1}(z_0)}{h}$ , if $\phi$ is Frechet differentiable this is equivalent to asking for the existence of $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{D\phi(f \circ \phi^{-1}(z_0))[f'(\phi^{-1}(z_0))\cdot D\phi^{-1}(z_0)[h]]}{h}$ . I've then found the following sufficient conditions: i) $\phi(z + w) = \phi(z) + \eta(w)$ ii) $\eta(z \cdot w) = \psi(z) \cdot \eta(w)$ Where $\eta,\psi: \mathbb{C} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ and $\eta$ is an homeomorphism. Then $\forall z_0 \in \mathbb{C}.$ $D\phi(z_0)$ exists and $D\phi(z_0) = \eta$ thus $\forall y_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ . $D\phi^{-1}(y_0) = \eta^{-1}$ . Moreover we have $D\phi(f \circ \phi^{-1}(z_0))[f'(\phi^{-1}(z_0))\cdot D\phi^{-1}(z_0)[h]] = \eta(f'(\phi^{-1}(z_0)) \cdot \eta^{-1}(h)) = \psi(f'(\phi^{-1}(z_0))) \cdot h$ , thus the limit exists and has value $\psi(f'(\phi^{-1}(z_0)))$ As an example we can take $\phi(z) = \alpha z + \beta$ with $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb(C)$ , then $\eta(z) = \alpha z$ and $\psi(z) = z$ thus $(\phi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1})'(z_0) = f'(\frac{z_0}{\alpha} - \frac{\beta}{\alpha})$ and sure enough if we use the standard method to evaluate this derivative we get the same resut. Conditions i) and ii) above are then sufficient, are they necessary too?

3685145,Construct a circle tangent to sides $BC$ and $CD$ and s.t. its meetings with the diagonal $BD$ are tangent points from tangents draw from point $A$,"Given square $ABCD$ I want to construct (with ruler and compass) the circle in the interior of the square such that it is tangent to sides $BC$ and $CD$ and such that it's meetings with the diagonal $BD$ are tangent points from tangents draw from point $A$ : It is clear that the center of the circle must lie in $AC$ . I tried finding some cyclic quad somewhere and I failed miserably. I then thought about puting $K$ in hyperbola with focii $A$ and the center $O$ of the square. Then again $K$ lies outside the segment $A O .$ This problem is hard because we would think of looking at the locus of the centers of circles such that the meetings of the circle with line $BD$ are the tangents from $A$ . But that this locus is exactly the same as the locus of the centers of the circles tangent to $CD$ and $BC$ : line $AC$ . The proof is simple: as the tangents from $A$ must have the same lenght the meetings $M$ and $N$ of $BD$ with the circles must be reflections of each other with respect to the center $O$ of the square $ABCD$ thus the center of the circle must lie in line $AO$ which is line $AC$ . The real geometric constrain is between the distance of the centers (all of which lie on line $AC$ ) to point $A$ and the radius of the circles. Let $P$ be in line segment $OC$ . $PA = x$ $r$ the radius of the circle centered at $P$ . $a=AB$ we have that $r^2 = x^2 - x \frac{a\sqrt2}2$ and $x = a\frac{\sqrt2}4 + \sqrt{r^2+\frac{a^2}8}$ and these weird relations are the ""locus"" that I desire to work with.","['euclidean-geometry', 'geometry', 'geometric-construction']"

3685507,Ideals prime to the conductor in the ideal class group of an order,"Let $K$ be a number field, $\mathcal{O}_K$ its ring of integers and $\mathcal{O}$ an order in $K$ .
I'm going through the proof for the formula linking the cardinality of the class group $Cl(\mathcal{O})$ to that of the class group $Cl(\mathcal{O}_K)$ . I'm following the proof given here by Keith Conrad. At the end of page 11 he makes the following statement: From the proof that $Cl(\mathcal{O})\longrightarrow Cl(\mathcal{O}_K)$ is surjective, we can represent each ideal class in $Cl(\mathcal{O})$ by an ideal $\mathfrak{b}$ of $\mathcal{O}$ which is relatively prime to the conductor $\mathfrak{c}$ and the fact that $Cl(\mathcal{O})\longrightarrow Cl(\mathcal{O}_K)$ is surjective is Theorem 5.1, which uses the fact that the same statement is true in the maximal order $\mathcal{O}_K$ . However, although I can easily prove the statement for $\mathcal{O}_K$ using unique factorization and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, I can't really see how this implies that the same statement is true for $\mathcal{O}$ . From the proof of Theorem 5.1 I can see that every coset of the kernel of the map $\psi:Cl(\mathcal{O})\longrightarrow Cl(\mathcal{O}_K)$ contains a class verifying the statement (just take $\mathfrak{a}$ in any class of $Cl(\mathcal{O}_K)$ such that $\mathfrak{a}$ is prime to the conductor and consider $\mathfrak{a}\cap\mathcal{O}$ ), and if I could use the explicit description of $\ker(\psi)$ which Conrad gives soon after that statement, then the statement would follow easily, as is done here on MathOverflow. However this description depends on the statement itself, so we can't use it.
So I guess I'm probably missing some trivial step, but I can't really see that, hence even hints are really appreciated. Edit: The statement in the question is also mentioned by Pete L. Clark here , in the last 3 lines. The reference is Neukirch, but I can't find this claim in his book. Moreover I'm wondering wheter this question is more appropriate for MathOverflow, since I've only seen this claim in MO posts so far. Edit 2: I've just found another claim which implies the aforementioned statement. It is Proposition 20.13 from these notes by Pete L. Clark: Let $R$ be a Dedekind domain, $I$ a fractional ideal of $R$ and $J$ a nonzero integral ideal of $R$ . Then there exists $a\in I$ such that $aI^{-1}+J=R$ . This is stated for Dedekind domains, but it seems to me that the proof given in the notes should still work even if $R$ is a non-maximal order, provided that we assume $I$ to be invertible. Indeed, using the same notations as in the original proof, there should be finitely many distinct prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_1,...,\mathfrak{p}_r$ containing $J$ , because if $\mathfrak{p}\supseteq J$ , then $\mathfrak{p}$ is minimal on $J$ , since $\dim R=1$ , and in a noetherian ring there are finitely many minimal prime ideals on each ideal. Moreover $I\mathfrak{p}_1\cdots\mathfrak{p}_n\subsetneq I\mathfrak{p}_1\cdots\mathfrak{p}_{i-1}\mathfrak{p}_{i+1}\cdots\mathfrak{p}_n$ for all $1\leq i\leq r$ , for otherwise, using the invertibility of $I$ , we would find $\mathfrak{p}_1\cdots\mathfrak{p}_n=\mathfrak{p}_1\cdots\mathfrak{p}_{i-1}\mathfrak{p}_{i+1}\cdots\mathfrak{p}_n$ , and considering that these are comaximal ideals, this implies $\mathfrak{p}_i\supseteq\mathfrak{p}_j$ for some $j\neq i$ ,  which is clearly impossible. Then the rest of the proof should work without any modification. This is quite different from the proof I had found for the maximal order, since that proof relied too much on unique factorization to be extended to the non-maximal case. Although this should solve my question, I'm not closing it since I'm still interested in knowing if there is a way to prove the statement in non-maximal orders as a consequence of the fact that the same property holds true in the maximal order, which is what K. Conrad seemed to suggest in his notes. Moreover it would be nice if someone could confirm that what I wrote above is correct.","['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

3685839,Is the KatÄtov extension of $\Bbb N$ zero-dimensional?,"I take $X=\kappa\Bbb N$ to be $\Bbb N\cup\{p:p \text{ is a free ultrafilter on }\Bbb N\}$ .  Each singleton in $\Bbb N$ is open and a local base at any free ultrafilter $p$ is given by $\{\{p\}\cup A:A\in p\}$ . Is X zero-dimensional? In other words, is it true that each point of $X$ has a neighborhood basis of clopen sets? It is claimed for example here that each basic open set $\{p\}\cup A$ is clopen. I am not sure about this claim, as it seems that from basic properties of ultrafilters one can prove it is not the case. Fact: Given an infinite subset $A$ of $\Bbb N$ there is a free ultrafilter containing $A$ . (Take the set of all cofinite subsets of $A$ .  That forms a filter basis that generates a free filter on $\Bbb N$ .  Any ultrafilter that extends that filter will be a free ultrafilter containing $A$ .) Now take a free ultrafilter $p\in X$ and an (open) neighborhood $U=\{p\}\cup A$ with $A\in p$ .  I claim that $U$ is never closed in $X$ . $A$ must be infinite because $p$ is free.  Partition $A$ into two infinite sets: $A=B\cup C$ . By standard ultrafilter properties exactly one of the two subsets, say $B$ , must be in $p$ .  By the Fact above, there is an ultrafilter $q$ containing $C$ , and $q$ is necessarily distinct from $p$ .  This $q$ is in the closure of $U$ .  Indeed, take any neighborhood $\{q\}\cup D$ with $D\in q$ . $D\cap C\in q$ so $D\cap C$ is not empty and $D$ meets $A$ , so any neighborhood of $q$ meets $U$ .  This shows that $U$ is not clopen. Can you see anything wrong with this argument?

I can see why if we had a relatively prime solution $(p,q)$ , we would have infinitely many of them (take $(p, q + knp)$ for $k \in \mathbb Z$ ; the gcd of this pair does not depend on $k$ ). So the claim would be proven if I could also show that the existence of any solution $(p,q)$ implies the existence of a relatively prime one. In the spirit of the relatively prime case above, I tried considering the set $(p - kb, q + ka)$ with $k \in \mathbb Z$ , but I'm not sure how the gcd of the pair varies with $k$ .

So, we can do cases. ${\bf Case 1.}$ If $x_n \to x$ , then for any $\epsilon > 0$ one can take $N$ so that for all $n > N$ (in particular, for $n=n_1$ ) we have $|x_{n_1} - x|  < \epsilon $ Applying the definition again with $\epsilon = |x_{n_1} - x| > 0$ and taking $n = n_2 > n_1 > N$ we observe that $|x_{n_2} - x| < |x_{n_1} - x| $ Now, choose $\epsilon = |x_{n_2} - x| > 0$ and take $N > 0$ so that for all $n_3 > n_2 > n_1 > N$ one has $|x_{n_3} - x | < |x_{n_2} - x | $ If we continue in this fashion, we observe that for $n_k > n_{k-1} > ... > n_1$ we have $x_{n_1} < x_{n_2} < .... < x_{n_k} $ . In particular $(x_{n_k})$ is a monotone subsequence of $(x_n)$ ${\bf Case2.}$ Suppose $x_n$ not converges to $x$ . We know $\exists $ some $\epsilon > 0$ and some subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ so that $|x_{n_k}-x| \geq \epsilon$ $\forall k \in \mathbb{N}$ So, notice that $x_{n_k} - x \geq \epsilon \implies x_{n_k} \geq x + \epsilon $ . Also, $x_{n_{k+1} } - x < - \epsilon \implies -x_{n_{k+1}} >-x+\epsilon $ So that $x_{n_k} - x_{n_{k-1}} \geq 2 \epsilon > 0 $ so that $x_{n_k} > x_{n_{k+1}} $ and thus the subsequence is monotone.

\{0,1\}^2 &= \{0,1\} \times \{0,1\} \\

\end{align} Question 2: With the notation we mean $``$$(x_1,x_2)$ is an element of the set $\{0,1\}^2$$``$ , so we can write: $$
(x_1,x_2)\in \{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)\}

To do this, we notice that $$\int_Q \frac{xy}{x^2+y^2}dxdy < \infty \iff \int_S \frac{xy}{x^2+y^2}dxdy<\infty$$ where $S=\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 | x\geq0, y\geq 0, x^2+y^2\leq1\}$ and this is clear because the difference between $\int_Q f(x,y)dxdy$ and $\int_S f(x,y)dxdy$ is a proper integral.

3686425,"Regarding equivalent definitions of Euclidean Submanifolds in Gallot, Hulin and Lafontaine's book Riemannian Geometry","In the book Riemannian Geometry by Gallot, Hulin and Lafontaine, a proposition which characterises equivalent definitions of submanifolds is given as follows: 1.3 Proposition The following are equivalent: i) $M$ is a $C^p$ submanifold of dimension $n$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ . ii) For any $x$ in $M$ , there exist open neighbourhoods $U$ and $V$ of $x$ and $0$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ respectively, and a $C^p$ diffeomorphism $f : U\to V$ such that $f(U \cap M)=V \cap (R^n \times \{0\})$ . iii) For any $x$ in $M$ , there exist a neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ , a neighbourhood $\Omega$ of $0$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ , and a $C^p$ map $g: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ such that $( \Omega, g)$ is a local parametrization of $M \cap U$ around $x$ (that is $g$ is an homeomorphism from $\Omega$ onto $M \cap U$ and $g'(0)$ is injective). I am trying to show that iii) implies ii) and I think that I am nearly there except I am having trouble with the following detail. I will first summarise my problem and then fill in the details. In brief, my main problem in going from iii) to ii) is that to make my proof work I seemed to also require that $g(0)=x$ . (Whereas in contrast the authors have just required that $g$ is an homeomorphism from $\Omega$ onto $M \cap U$ and $g'(0)$ is injective). The details of what I attempted are as follows: (Attempted) Proof that iii) $\implies$ ii). Fix $x \in M$ and let $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ satisfy the conditions of iii). Therefore we have a neighbourhood $W$ of $x$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ , a neighbourhood $\Omega$ of $0$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ , and a $C^p$ map $g: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ such that $g$ is an homeomorphism from $\Omega$ onto $M \cap W$ and $g'(0)$ is injective. Since the Jacobian matrix $g'(0)$ or $Dg$ (at $0$ ), which has $n+k$ rows and $n$ columns, is injective 
  (in this case rank $n$ ), that means that all of its $n$ columns are linearly independent. Therefore we could 'complete' or 'fill out' this matrix up to a full square matrix which has rank $n+k$ (i.e. nonsingular). The filled out matrix is: \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_2} & \dots \frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_n} & a_{11} & \dots  & a_{1k} \\
\frac{\partial g_2}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial g_2}{\partial x_2} & \dots \frac{\partial g_2}{\partial x_n} & a_{21} & \dots  & a_{2k} \\
\frac{\partial g_3}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial g_3}{\partial x_2} & \dots \frac{\partial g_3}{\partial x_n} & a_{31} & \dots  & a_{3k} \\
   \vdots & \vdots & \vdots &\vdots & \dots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial g_n}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial g_n}{\partial x_2} & \dots \frac{\partial g_n}{\partial x_n} & a_{n1} & \dots  & a_{nk} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots &\vdots & \dots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial g_{n+k}}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial g_{n+k}}{\partial x_2} & \dots \frac{\partial g_{n+k}}{\partial x_n} & a_{(n+k)1} & \dots  & a_{(n+k)k}
\end{bmatrix} With this in mind we can define a new function $h : \Omega \times \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ by: $h_1=g_1(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) + a_{11} x_{n+1} + a_{12} x_{n+2} + ... + a_{1k} x_{n+k}$ etc. Then $Dh$ at $0$ is just the matrix above. Therefore, by the inverse function theorem, there is a neighbourhood $V$ of $0$ such that $h$ carries $V$ in a one to one fashion onto an open set $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ and we can guarantee that $h(0)$ (which is equal to $g(0)$ ) is in $U$ . This is where I think my problem arises. Although the original $W$ contained $x$ , I can't seem to guarantee that $U$ contains $x$ because the whole process to show that $U$ exists has relied upon the inverse function theorem, which could return a smaller open set than $W$ . Therefore I am not certain I am on the correct track, but apart from this little detail, if I could assume that $g(0)=x$ , I think this would all work. Help would be much appreciated as I am attempting to self-learn with no mathematical contacts at the moment.","['differential', 'manifolds', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

As the problem suggests, we can take a Cartan subalgebra $H$ and root system $\Phi$ so that $L=H\oplus(\oplus_{\alpha\in\Phi}L_\alpha)$ where $$L_\alpha=\{x\in L:(\forall h\in H)\ [h,x]=\alpha(h)x\}$$ As shown in Humphreys' Introduction to Lie Algebras, every $L_\alpha$ has dimension $1$ , so $\dim(L)=\dim(H)+\vert\Phi\vert$ . I know $\Phi$ spans $H^*$ , so $\dim(H)\leq\vert\Phi\vert$ . Furthermore, I know that for any $\alpha\in\Phi$ , the only multiples of $\alpha$ in $\Phi$ are $\alpha$ and $-\alpha$ . Since $\mathbb{C}$ has characteristic $0$ , this implies $\vert\Phi\vert$ is even. Finally, another fact which may be useful is that given nonzero vectors $x_\alpha\in L_\alpha$ and $y_\alpha\in L_{-\alpha}$ , if we take $h_\alpha=[x_\alpha,y_\alpha]\in H$ , then $x_\alpha$ , $y_\alpha$ , and $h_\alpha$ span a three-dimensional subspace of $L$ isomorphic to $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ . However, I am not sure how to connect these pieces to give the desired conclusion. As a follow-up question, would the claim still be true if I replaced the field with an arbitrary field of characteristic $0$ , or is it also necessary for the field to be algebraically closed?","['semisimple-lie-algebras', 'abstract-algebra', 'lie-algebras', 'root-systems']"
3686625,Finding the expected value of coin flip experiment (Dark Souls problem),"I'm trying to find the formula for an expected value, but testing has shown that my formula is incorrect. Can you find either a closed form or recursive formula for the expected values in this experiment, and explain how you found that formula? The Game You have $n$ coins labelled $1$ through $n$ . We will label the set of coins $[n]$ . We have a function $f$ that maps coin $i$ to the probability coin $i$ lands heads. A coin landing heads is a success. A coin landing tails is a failure. We start with flipping coin $1$ . If coin $1$ lands heads, we move on to coin $2$ . If coin $1$ lands tails, we start over with coin 1. On coin $i$ , if coin $i$ lands heads, we move on to coin $i+1$ . If coin $i$ lands tails, we return to coin $1$ . If we land heads on coin $n$ , we win and the game ends. The Variables and Counters We will be keeping track of $n$ variables $\{ X_1, X_2, \ldots , X_n \}$ . Each of these will count some, but not all, of the times we fail coin $n$ . To make the explanation easier, we will treat these as counters in an algorithm, and their final values will be the random variables. If we flip heads on coin $i$ , we do nothing. If we flip tails on coin $i$ , one of two things happens. If the last coin we failed, $j$ , appeared later than $i$ (that is, $j > i$ ), then we reset all counters $\{ X_1, X_2, \ldots , X_n \}$ to $0$ and then set $X_i=1$ . If the last coin we failed, $j$ , appeared earlier than or is equal to $i$ (that is, $j \leq i$ ), then we increment $X_i$ by $1$ and move back to coin $1$ as described in the rules. Edit: If we have not failed a coin previously, then we do $(2)$ . That is, we increment $X_i$ by $1$ and move back to coin $1$ without changing any other counters. The Problem We want to find the expected value of each $X_i$ after successfully flipping heads on coin $n$ . My Solution It's hard to put my solution in math terms, because my solution is wrong. I write the expansion $$E(X_i) = 0*P(X_i = 0) + 1*P(X_i = 1) +  2*P(X_i = 2) + 3*P(X_i = 3) + \ldots \text{.}\tag{1}$$ My intuition then leads me to say $$P(X_i=k+1) = P(X_i=k)*(1-f(i))*\prod_{j = 1}^{j=i-1}f(j)\text{.}\tag{2}$$ The above, $(2)$ , is probably wrong, but here is the intuition. $(1-f(i))$ represents the probability of an extra failed flip of coin $i$ at a particular point in the game followed by successful coin-flips on coins $1$ through $i-1$ represented by the term $\prod_{j = 1}^{j=i-1}f(j)$ . For notational convenience, we set $x=(1-f(i))*\prod_{j = 1}^{j=i-1}f(j)$ . We can then use $P(X_i =0) + P(X_i=1) + P(X_i=2) +\ldots = 1$ to find that $$P(X_i=k)= (1-x)*x^{k} \tag{3}$$ and then $$\mathbb{E}(X_i) = \frac{x}{1-x}\text{.}\tag{4}$$ Displays $(3)$ and $(4)$ are just algebra, and even if there is a typo, I'm fairly certain that is not where the problem lies. Data If $n=5$ and $f(i)=.5$ for all $i$ , then some approximations of the expected values are $\mathbb{E}(X_1) = 1.56902$ , $\mathbb{E}(X_2)= .4036$ , $\mathbb{E}(X_3)= .15541$ , $\mathbb{E}(X_4)= .06952$ , and $\mathbb{E}(X_5)= .03185$ . These were found by running experiments in C++. I provide these so you can test your formulas against the actual values. My formula in display $(4)$ will give you values $\mathbb{E}(X_2)= \frac{1}{3}$ , $\mathbb{E}(X_3)= \frac{1}{7}$ , $\mathbb{E}(X_4)= \frac{1}{15}$ , and $\mathbb{E}(X_5)= \frac{1}{31}$ . Note I really don't care about $\mathbb{E}(X_1)$ , so my rules, formula, and data may not all match up for that case.","['expected-value', 'probability']"

When the particle hits a ""wall"", it emits a sound $i$ when $x=0$ and a sound $a$ when $x=X$ , with $X$ the lenght of the 1D box, it emits the sound $0$ otherwise. For example, we could ""hear"" $(i, 0, 0, 0, i, 0, 0, 0,0, a, 0, 0, 0, 0, i)$ . By hypothesis, the particle must start and finish at $x=0$ . I know that these kind of trajectories can be well described with Dyck paths (here, all Dyck paths have the same probability to happen). For now, I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the averages $I_n(X)$ and $A_n(X)$ of $i$ 's and $a$ 's as a function of the lenght X. If X=1, the only path we can have is $(i, a, i, a, ..., a, i)$ , so if $n$ is big enough, we have $I_n(1)$ = $A_n(1)$ = $\frac{1}{2}$ If X=2, for $n$ big enough, I find by drawing that $I_n(2)$ = $A_n(2)$ = $\frac{1}{4}$ , and 50% of silence How can I proove this and more important, how can I figure out for all $X$ ?
The only pattern I can see here is $I_n(X)$ = $A_n(X)$ = $\frac{1}{2Cat(X)}$ but I'm pretty sure this is stupid. Here Cat(X) is the $X$ th Catalan number. Any help about how to structurate my ideas would be awesome. Have a good day!","['random-walk', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

3687106,Visualizing derivative of a matrix-valued function of a matrix variable,"Apologies if this is not at an appropriate level for this site or if it's too broad/scrambled of a question, but I was wondering how best to visualize a matrix-valued function of a matrix variable? For some context: in my single variable calculus class, we were taught that the derivative of $f(x)$ at a point $x = a$ is $f'(a)\in\mathbb{R}$ . This represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f(x)\vert_{x = a}$ . The equation of this tangent line is $y = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)$ , and this is the best linear approximation of $f(x)$ near $x = a$ . In my analysis class, we were taught that the derivative of a map $f:U\to F$ , where $U\subseteq E$ is open, $x\in U$ , and $E,F$ are complete normed linear spaces, is a continuous linear map $\lambda=f'(x):E\to F$ satisfying $$f(x+h)-f(x)=f'(x)(h)+|h|\psi(h) $$ with $\lim_{h\to 0}\psi(h)=0$ and $\psi(0)=0.$ There is no confusion here. This definition is in accordance with our definition from single variable calculus, it's a special case as expected, where the standard matrix of this linear transformation (in the one dimensional case) is the $1\times 1$ matrix $[f'(a)]$ . If we consider the special case of our scenario where $E$ and $F$ are Euclidean spaces rather than arbitrary complete normed linear spaces, i.e. for $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ at a point $a \in \mathbb{R}^n$ then the derivative $Df(a)$ is an $m\times n$ matrix $Df(a) = \left[\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}( a)\right]$ , or the Jacobian of $f$ at $a$ . On our exam, we were asked to compute the derivative of $f:M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\to M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R}) $ given by $f(x)=x^3$ . This was a fairly straightforward computational task, however I have been stuck about how to visualize/understand my answer. I know you could just say that $M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ are isomorphic as complete normed linear spaces, so think of it in terms of the framework that has already been established. My question is: I know how to visualize/conceptualize this exam question when $f$ is a real-valued function of a real variable, but in the case from the exam is there a way to understand it in terms of what a linear map actually does (some combination of rotation and scaling) or where the vectors that comprise the matrix live with respect to the function (in some tangent subspace would be my intuition, but I'm not sure since I don't have that level of background in such a subject)? Is there a meaningful way to answer/subject to address my question or is the whole matter moot since even for a $3\times 3$ matrix, that would correspond to a function of $9$ variables, which we cannot visualize?","['visualization', 'real-analysis', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'derivatives']"

3687237,First sheaf cohomology of closed 1-forms on a homogeneous space,"Given a smooth quasi-projective variety $X$ over $\mathbb C$ , is there a good way to compute the first sheaf cohomologiy $H^1(X,\Omega_{X,cl}^1)$ of closed 1-forms $\Omega_{X,cl}^1$ ? What I'm mostly interested in is the case where $X = G/P$ is a homogeneous space of an algebraic group $G$ , where $P$ is a closed subgroup. 
The case where $G$ is reductive and $P$ is a parabolic subgroup (so $X$ is projective) is my primary concern, but it'll be nice if a description for all algebraic groups can be found. Motivation: $H^1(X,\Omega_{X,cl}^1)$ parametrizes all twisted sheaves of differential operators on $X$ . Some thoughts in the case where $G$ is reductive and $P = B$ is a Borel subgroup that may or may not help: We know $H^i(X,\Omega_X^1) = 0$ if $i \neq 1$ and is $\mathbb{C}^{\mathrm{rank} G}$ if $i =1$ . So the long exact sequence induced by $0 \to \Omega_{X,cl}^1 \to \Omega_X^1 \to \Omega_X^1/\Omega_{X,cl}^1 \to 0$ reduces to $$0 \to H^0(X,\Omega_X^1/\Omega_{X,cl}^1) \to H^1(X,\Omega_{X,cl}^1) \to H^1(X,\Omega_X^1) \to H^1(X,\Omega_X^1/\Omega_{X,cl}^1) \to H^2(X,\Omega_{X,cl}^1) \to 0,$$ but we need more knowledge of cohomologies of $\Omega_X^1/\Omega_{X,cl}^1$ to proceed. Homogeneous twisted sheaves of differential operators (htdo) are parametrized by $\mathfrak{b}/[\mathfrak{b},\mathfrak{b}]$ which has dimension $\mathrm{rank}G$ . Therefore $H^1(X,\Omega_{X,cl}^1) \to H^1(X,\Omega_X^1)$ cannot be a proper injection. If we view $X$ as the variety of all Borel subalgebras of $\mathfrak g$ , and let $\mathcal{N} \subset \mathcal{B} \subset X \times \mathfrak g$ to be subbundles of $X \times \mathfrak g$ whose fibers at a point $x$ (which corresponds to a Borel subalgebra $\mathfrak b_x$ ) are $[\mathfrak{b}_x,\mathfrak{b}_x]$ and $\mathfrak b_x$ , respectively, then we have an exact sequence of vector bundles $0 \to \mathcal B \to X \times \mathfrak g \to TX \to 0$ and the corresponding sequence $0 \to \mathfrak b^\circ \to \mathfrak g^\circ \to \mathcal T_X \to 0$ of sheaves; similarly if $\mathfrak n^\circ$ is the sheaf of $\mathcal N$ then $$\Omega_X^1 \cong \mathfrak n^\circ = \big\{\sum_i h_i \otimes \xi_i \in \mathcal O_X \otimes_{\mathbb C} \mathfrak  g = \mathfrak g^\circ \mid  \sum_i h_i(x) \otimes \xi_i \in [\mathfrak{b}_x,\mathfrak{b}_x] \big\}.$$ Translating the pairing $\mathcal T_X \otimes_{\mathcal O_X} \Omega_X^1 \to \mathcal O_X$ and the definition of exterior derivative on $\Omega_X^1$ , one can write down a condition for a section $\sum_i h_i \otimes \xi_i \in \mathfrak n^\circ$ to be closed, namely that for any $\eta_1,\eta_2 \in \mathfrak g$ (viewed also as global vector fields on $X$ ), the function $$\sum_i \Big(  B(\xi_i,\eta_2) \eta_1(h_i) -  B(\xi_i,\eta_1) \eta_2(h_i) - B(\xi_i,[\eta_1,\eta_2]) h_i \Big) \in \mathcal O_X$$ vanish, where $B(-,-)$ is the Killing form.

How likely are you to succeed in consecutively drawing higher for a given starting number & number of iterations? Somebody said to add my thoughts to the question! We've had a lot (my brother and i are trying to solve it!) so wait just a few minutes while I write it all out! So first we tried by thinking about some easy cases. Lets say you only wanted 3 consecutive higher draws. If you drew a king or a queen you're done right off the bat, the odds of that are 8/52. If you drew a Jack, you have to get the sequence of JQK to succeed. That's $4/52* 4/51*4/50$ . From this we can't yet establish too much, but we found a general way to answer this problem for three draws. If you start with a Jack, there is one way, a 10 in three ways, a 9 in six ways, an 8 in 10 ways... each drop in card number adds one more positive outcome than the last drop did (K-Q added zero, Q-J added one, J-10 added two, 10-9 added three etc).  So the equation is $1(4/52 * 4/51 * 4/50) + 3(4/52 * 4/51 * 4/50) + 6(4/52 * 4/51 * 4/50)... + 66(4/52 * 4/51 * 4/50)$ . (<- if we aren't mistaken) Around here is where we have gotten stuck as brute force gets more difficult and we don't yet have an overarching formula to apply. Any ideas of where to go from here to apply this to higher numbers of draws? BIG EDIT (unless we're super wrong... not 100% sure of proper math notation)
Okay... so our thought process from where we left off is as follows: If we're drawing four cards instead of three, the sum is the same except the 66 term is lobbed off (because the 1,3,6,10... series starts a number lower [in the case of 4 cards, you can't draw a jack first] and ends at the same place, thereby eliminating one term) and the inside term gains 4/49 (signifying the probability of another drawn card). The equation would be: $1(4/52 * 4/51 * 4/50 * 4/49) + 3(4/52 * 4/51 * 4/50 * 4/49) + 6(4/52 * 4/51 * 4/50 * 4/49)... + 55(4/52 * 4/51 * 4/50 * 4/49)$ . Notice the similarities between the equation for drawing three cards and drawing four. From this, we derived the (hopefully correct) formula for any number of draws.
let x = number of cards you want to draw. 
let y = the value of the first card drawn.
Note: in the following, $n_{-1} = 0$ $$\sum_{n=0}^{14-x}((n + n_{n-1} +1)*(\prod_{n=0}^{x}(4/(52-n))))$$ Posting for now, any questions will be addressed after we eat dinner.",['probability']

It is usually the case that a minimizer of some given energy functional defined on $H^1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ is known to be continuous (or even $C^2(\mathbb{R}^2))$ . I want to know the behavior of this minimizer at infinity. If $u \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2),$ then is known $\liminf_{|x| \to \infty} u(x) = 0.$ But it cannot say $\limsup_{|x| \to \infty} u(x) = 0$ since counterexamples exist. If we assume $u \in H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for some $\epsilon > 0,$ then the classical Morrey's inequality can imply uniform H\""older continuity of $u.$ So we can conclude $\limsup_{|x| \to \infty} u(x) = 0$ via proof by contradiction. So my problem is about the case $\epsilon = 0.$ That is, when $$u \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^2) \cap C(\mathbb{R}^2),$$ is it true that $$\limsup_{|x| \to \infty} u(x) = 0?$$ Using proof by contradiction, I think this should be true. Here is my non-rigorous argument. Assume not, then there are $\epsilon > 0$ and $x_n \in \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $|x_n| \to \infty$ and $|u(x_n)| \geq 2\epsilon.$ By the continuity, there is $r_n > 0$ such that $|u(x)| \geq \epsilon$ for all $x \in B(x_n, r_n).$ Since $u \in L^2, r_n \to 0$ as $n \to \infty.$ I think non-rigorously that $$ \int_{B(x_n, r_n)} |\nabla u|^2 \gtrsim \int_{B(x_n, r_n)} (\frac{\epsilon}{r_n})^2 = \epsilon^2$$ for large $n$ and $$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^2} |\nabla u|^2 \geq \sum_{n\,\text{is large}} \int_{B(x_n, r_n)} |\nabla u|^2.
$$ So they imply a contradiction $\int_{\mathbb{R}^2} |\nabla u|^2 = \infty$ I appreciate any discussion.

The book says: ""Since it is desirable that the length of the interval be as small as possible and since the standard normal distribution is symmetrical around the origin, it turns out that the minimum length interval must also be symmetric around the origin"", but I don't understand this.","['statistics', 'confidence-interval', 'probability']"
3687703,"What is the reason for the term ""zero dimensional"" in the context of topology?","A topological space is zero dimensional if, and only if, it has a basis consisting of sets which are both open and closed (that is, ""clopen""). This definition is according to ""Counterexamples in Topology"" by Steen and Seebach, 2nd ed. 1978. I see that ""zero dimensional"" is tied in with various levels of being ""disconnected"", e.g. extremally disconnected, totally separated, totally, disconnected, scattered, etc. (although the property of being ""zero dimensional"" is itself strictly independent of all disconnectivity properties). I understand (vaguely) the concept of a ""dimension"" in the context of manifolds: a space of $n$ dimensions has a boundary of $n - 1$ dimensions. I also note that a set is clopen if, and only if, it has no boundary. So would that be the basis of this terminology? Is there a source which states this definitively?",['general-topology']

3687823,Generalization of Kolmogorov precompactness criterion,"In the book Elements in functional analysis from Hirsch and Lacombe, the Kolmogorov precompactness criterion for families of $L^p$ functions is stated as follows: Theorem : Let $H \subseteq L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ , with $p \in [1,\infty)$ . Then $H$ is precompact if and only if the following conditions hold: $H$ is bounded w.r.t. the norm $||\cdot||_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)}$ ; $\lim_{R \to +\infty} \sup_{f \in H} \int_{B_R^c} |f(x)|^p dx = 0$ , where $B_R^c$ denotes the complement in $\mathbb{R}^d$ of the ball of radius $R$ ; $\lim_{|a| \to 0} \sup_{f \in H} ||\tau_af-f||_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)}=0$ , where $\tau_a$ denotes the translation operator . Now, I think that one can modify a little bit this statement in order to make it valid also when we consider families of functions in $L^p(\Omega)$ , where $\Omega$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ : Claim : Let $\Omega$ be an open set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ , let $p \in [1,\infty)$ , and let $H \subseteq L^p(\Omega)$ . For all $R > 0$ , define $$\Omega_R = \{x \in \Omega: \text{dist}(x, {\Omega}^c) > \frac{1}{R}\} \cap B(0,R)$$ Then $H$ is precompact if and only id the following holds $H$ is bounded w.r.t. the norm $||\cdot||_{L^p(\Omega)}$ ; $\lim_{R \to +\infty} \sup_{f \in H} \int_{\Omega \setminus \Omega_R} |f(x)|^p dx = 0$ ; $\lim_{|a| \to 0} \sup_{f \in H} ||\tau_af-f||_{L^p(\Omega_R)}=0$ for all $R >0$ . I'm trying to prove this last equivalence using the theorem I've written above. So far this is my strategy: First, notice that we can look at $L^p(\Omega)$ as a subset of $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ extending every function $f$ in $L^p(\Omega)$ to a function $\tilde{f}$ in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ in this way: $$\tilde{f}(x) =\begin{cases} 
      f(x) & x \in \Omega \\
      0 & \text{otherwise} 
   \end{cases}$$ Then $H$ is precompact in $L^p(\Omega)$ if and only if it's precompact in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ . If I prove that conditions 1,2,3 of the claim are equivalent to conditions 1,2,3 of the theorem, I'm done. Condition 1 is easy, but I can't really see how conditions 2 and 3 of the theorem should be equivalent to conditions 2 and 3 of the claim.

Let $H$ be a proper subgroup of $G$ . Show that there exists $g$ $\in$ $G \setminus H$ such that $gHg^{-1}=H$ . I tried to use a counting argument. Let's assume by contradiction that it isn't true. So, for every $g$ $\in$ $G \setminus H$ , $gHg^{-1}$ is not $H$ . We know that conjugation is also a subgroup of $G$ , so $gHg^{-1}$ is a different subgroup of order $p^k$ where $|G|=p^n$ and $n>k$ . Now, we can see that each conjugation as above is different if $g_1 \neq g_2h$ , since if $g_1Hg_1^{-1} = g_2Hg_2^{-1}$ then we can get $g_2^{-1}g_1Hg_1^{-1}g_2=H$ and clearly, from what's given, $g_2^{-1}g_1 \in H$ .

The right hand side becomes a sum over $a,b$ so that $a+b\equiv 0 \pmod{2}$ , and $a+b\ne 0$ subject to the same constraint of $a+b\ge 0$ . So, it looks like the right hand side reads $h^{0,0}$ .

However since $E/\mathbb F_p$ is anomalous, Smart attack gives us a simple solution: After lifting the curve to $E/\mathbb Q_p$ , let $\tilde P,\tilde Q$ be the lifted points of $P,Q$ respectively, then we have $p\tilde P,p\tilde Q,k\tilde P-\tilde Q\in E_1$ since $E/\mathbb F_p$ is of order $p$ . Furthermore, since $k\psi(p\tilde P)-\psi(p\tilde Q)=p\psi(k\tilde P-\tilde Q)=0$ , we get that $k=\frac{\psi(p\tilde Q)}{\psi(p\tilde P)}\pmod p$ , which is pretty simple to compute.

This is noted in the Smart attack 's paper, where he notes that for 'canonical lifts', such points exist, and 'canonical lifts' occur at a frequency of $\frac1p$ . An example of such a lift can be found at the crypto SE question why the Smart attack fails for a particular lift .

Some examples of 'canonical lifts': The curve, $y^2=x^3+3x+5$ over $\mathbb F_7$ , has the following 'canonical lifts' when lifted to $\mathbb Q_7$ , for $m,n>0,m,n\in\mathbb Z$ and $p=7$ : $$y^2=x^3+\left(3+0p+mp^2\right)x+\left(5+3p+np^2\right)$$ $$y^2=x^3+\left(3+1p+mp^2\right)x+\left(5+2p+np^2\right)$$ $$y^2=x^3+\left(3+2p+mp^2\right)x+\left(5+1p+np^2\right)$$ $$y^2=x^3+\left(3+3p+mp^2\right)x+\left(5+0p+np^2\right)$$ $$y^2=x^3+\left(3+4p+mp^2\right)x+\left(5+6p+np^2\right)$$ $$y^2=x^3+\left(3+5p+mp^2\right)x+\left(5+5p+np^2\right)$$ $$y^2=x^3+\left(3+6p+mp^2\right)x+\left(5+4p+np^2\right)$$ In general(as far as I can tell by direct computation), one finds $p$ 'canonical lifts' mod $p^2$ for any anomalous curves, which satisfies the $\frac1p$ probability that Smart gave. About the 'canonical lift'(from comments) If the Frobenius endomorphism $f\in\text{End}\left(E/\overline{\mathbb F_p}\right)$ lifts to a endomorphism $\tilde f\in\text{End}\left(E/\overline{\mathbb Q_p}\right)$ , then this is the 'canonical lift' that Smart is referring to, which is less strict than requiring $\text{End}\left(E/\overline{\mathbb F_p}\right)\cong\text{End}\left(E/\overline{\mathbb Q_p}\right)$ . Since $\left|E/\mathbb F_p\right|=p$ , the dual of $f$ , $f^*$ has kernel $E/\mathbb F_p$ and is separable, which implies the dual of $\tilde f$ , $\tilde f^*$ , has a kernel of order $p$ , which is precisely the $p$ -torsion elements of $E/\mathbb Q_p$ , and is the torsion group $\left(E/\mathbb Q_p\right)_\text{tors}$ of this curve, hence $E_0\cong E_1\times\left(E/\mathbb Q_p\right)_\text{tors}$ , hence $pE_0=pE_1$ and $p\tilde P\in E_2$ , causing the attack to fail.","['cryptography', 'p-adic-number-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves']"
3688572,Every not empty finite subset of a totally ordered set has a maximum and minimum,"Theorem Let be $(X,\le)$ a totally ordered set: then for any not empty finite subset $A$ of $X$ there exist the maximum  element and minimum element. proof . Let be $(X,\le)$ a totally ordered set and we prove by induction that any not empty finite subset $A$ of $X$ has a minimum element. Since $X$ is a totally ordered set, previously we observe that any its subset $Y$ (finite or infinite) is a chain. Obviously any subset $A$ of one element $a$ has trivially a minimum.
So we suppose that any subset of $n$ elements has a minimum element and then  we consider a subset $A$ of $n+1$ elements: since $A$ is finite there exists a bijection $\phi$ from $A$ onto some natural number $m$ , that is the successor of $n$ , and so we can organize the elements of $A$ in a finite succession, that is $A=\{a_1,...,a_{n+1}\}$ . Now we consider the subset $B=\{a_h\in A:h\le n\}$ : obviously $X$ is a subset of $A$ that has $n$ element and so it has a minimum element $b$ ; so since $A=B\cup\{a_{n+1}\}$ and since $A$ is a chain (remember what before we observed), it must be or $a_{n+1}\le b$ or $b<a_{n+1}$ and so for the transitivity property of the order relation $\le$ in any case $A$ has a minimum element. So now we only have to prove that any not empty finite subset $A$ of $X$ has a maximum element. So we consider the inverse relation $\preccurlyeq$ defined as $x\preccurlyeq y\iff y\le x$ for any $x,y\in X$ : clearly $\preccurlyeq$ is a total order, since indeed $\le$ is a total order, and any minimum in $\preccurlyeq$ is a maximum in $\le$ and so since any not empty finite subset $A$ has a minimum in $\preccurlyeq$ it follows that any not empty finite subset in $\le$ has a maximum element. So we concluded the proof. Is my proof correct? If not how prove the theorem? Could someone help me, please?","['elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory', 'induction', 'solution-verification']"
3688580,Show that S is an embedded $k$-submanifold of $M$,"Assume $M$ is a smooth manifold and $S$ is a subset of $M$ such that each point $p\in S$ has a neighborhood $U \subseteq M$ such that $S\cap U$ is an embedded $k$ -submanifold of $U$ . I want to show that from this it follows that $S$ is also an embedded $k$ -submanifold of $M$ . Until now I tried to exploit the $k$ -slice condition for embedded submanifolds $S\cap U$ of $U$ in order to construct a smooth chart $(V,\phi)$ of $M$ such that $V\cap S$ is a $k$ -slice of $V$ , i.e. to show that also $S$ satisfies the $k$ -slice condition and is therefore an embedded submanifold. But haven't succeeded yet. Can someone help and give me a hint how to approach this problem? Definition of a $k$ -submanifold:
A subset $S$ of $M$ is called embedded submanifold of dimension $k$ if for each $p\in S$ there a smooth chart $(U,\phi)$ of $M$ such that $p\in U$ and $U\cap S$ is a $k$ -slice of $U$ . Edit: Here are some details on my approach so far.
We know that $$\forall p \in S ~\exists U \subseteq \mathcal{U}_M(p):~ U\cap S \text{ embedded }~k\text{-submanifold of } U $$ $$\Rightarrow \forall p \in S ~\exists U \subseteq \mathcal{U}_M(p)~\forall q\in U\cap S~\exists (V,\phi) \text{ smooth chart of } U \text{ with } q\in V:$$ $$ U\cap S\cap V ~k\text{-slice of } V $$ But since $V$ is a coordinate neighborhood of $U$ , i.e. $V\subseteq U$ , and as noted in the comments $V$ is also a coordinate neighborhood of $M$ , we have $$\forall p \in S ~\exists U \subseteq \mathcal{U}_M(p)~\forall q\in U\cap S~\exists (V,\phi) \text{ smooth chart of } M\text{ with } q\in V:$$ $$ S\cap V ~k\text{-slice of } V $$ But since $p\in U\cap S$ we also find a smooth chart $(V,\phi)$ of $M$ with $p\in V$ , such that $S\cap V$ is a $k$ -slice of $V$ . Which means that by the definition above we know that $S$ is an embedded $k$ -submanifold of $M$ .","['smooth-manifolds', 'solution-verification', 'manifolds', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

3688632,Proving $R_{ij;m}=g^{kl} R_{ikjl;m}$.,"In the coordinate $\{x^i\}$ , the Riemann curvature tensor can be written as $$
R=R_{ijkl}\,dx^i\otimes dx^j\otimes dx^k \otimes dx^l
$$ and the Ricci curvature can be written as $$\text{Ric}=R_{ij}\,dx^i\otimes dx^j$$ where $R_{ij}=g^{kl} R_{kilj}\,$ .
  Prove that $$R_{ij;m}=g^{kl} R_{ikjl;m}$$ where $$\theta_{i_1i_2\cdots i_s;m}=\left(D_{\partial_m}\theta\right)(\partial_{i_1},\cdots,\partial_{i_s})\,.$$ My attempt I got a hint to prove $$R_{jk;m} = (g^{il}R_{ijkl})_{;m} =  g^{il}{}_{;m}R_{ijkl} + g^{il}R_{ijkl;m} = g^{il}R_{ijkl;m}\tag{1}$$ and $$g^{il}{}_{;m}=0 \,.\tag{2}$$ As for $(2)$ , I am not sure what the meaning of $g^{il}{}_{;m}$ is.
I thought that $$
g^{il}{}_{;m}=\left(D_{\partial_m}\,\check g\right)(dx^i,dx^l)
$$ where $\check g(\alpha,\beta)=g(\alpha^\sharp, \beta^\sharp)$ is the dual metric in which $\sharp$ denotes the musical isomorphism .
Am I right? I can prove that $Dg=0$ and hence $g_{ij;k}=0$ . I hope to use this to prove $(2)$ , and I tried to take advantage of $g^{il}g_{lj}=\delta^i_j$ . And then I guess that $$(g^{il}g_{lj})_{;m}=g^{il}{}_{;m}g_{lj}+g^{il}g_{lj;m}$$ but I don't know whether this is right, and I don't know how to get $(1)$ . They are similar and seem like leibniz rule. Could we conclude that? Any help would be highly appreciated!","['curvature', 'manifolds', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
