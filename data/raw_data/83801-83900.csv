1096336,Verify my induction proof for Balanced Ternary expressions,"In first place I apologize if you find a grammatical error, my English is not too good for now, but I'm work on it. That also goes for errors in my question (this is my first post). I encounter the following problem on internet: Use induction to proof that all integer can be written in the form  $$\sum_{i} \pm3^i$$  where the exponents $i$ are distinct non-negative integers. My proof goes like that: let $P(k):=$ any integer in the interval $[-\sum_{i=0}^k 3^i, \sum_{i=0}^k 3^i]$ can be written as following $\sum_{i=0}^k a_i3^i$ (as a ternary balanced expression)  where $a_i\in\{-1,0,1\}$ $$\text{Proof by induction}$$ If $k=0$ then for $P(k)$ we have the following interval [-1,1] and we can write $-1$ as $-1(3^0)$, $0$ as $0(3^0)$, $1$ as $1(3^0)$ For now let assume that $P(k)$ holds. So for $P(k+1)$ we have the interval $[-\sum_{i=0}^{k+1} 3^i, \sum_{i=0}^{k+1} 3^i]$ How we are assuming that we can write any integer using the expression above in the range of $[-\frac{3^{k+1}-1}{2}, \frac{3^{k+1}-1}{2}]$ we only have to show that for any integer in the following intervals, the proposition holds: (1) $\frac{3^{k+1}-1}{2}<n\le\frac{3^{(k+1)+1}-1}{2}$ (2) $-\frac{3^{(k+1)+1}-1}{2}<n\le-\frac{3^{k+1}-1}{2}$ But that is quite easy, because if you have $3^{k+1}$ we only have to subtract one number from $0$ to $\frac{3^{k+1}-1}{2}-1$ or add one number from $1$ to $\frac{3^{k+1}-1}{2}$, the same goes for $-3^{k+1}$ but using the range $[0, \frac{3^{k+1}-1}{2}]$ for subtraction, and the range $[1, \frac{3^{k+1}-1}{2}-1]$ for addition. So a number in those ranges fits well into our induction hypothesis, in the end we are going to have a ternary balanced expression. QED","['induction', 'discrete-mathematics', 'proof-verification']"

1096521,Ring of formal power series over a principal ideal domain is a unique factorisation domain,"An exercise in my algebra course book asks to prove that if $R$ is a PID , then $R[[x]]$ is a UFD , where $R[[x]]$ is the ring of formal power series over $R$. After some failed attempts at  proving the ACC I visited Wikipedia, which comments : If $R$ is Noetherian, then so is $R[[x]]$; this is a version of the Hilbert basis theorem. This is very useful, as $R$ is a PID and hence Noetherian. Unfortunately we only saw (without proof) Hilbert's basis theorem in the form If $R$ is Noetherian, then so is $R[x]$. I'm not sure how to conclude the Noetherianity of $R[[x]]$ from this. I know that $R[x]$ is a UFD because $R$ is (we saw this without proof), and have been trying to conclude the ACC in $R[[x]]$ from the ACC in $R[x]$, without success. I can prove the ACC if $R$ is a field, because then every $a_kx^k+a_{k+1}x^{k+1}+\cdots$ with $a_k\neq0$ is associate with $x^k$, hence every ideal is of the form $(x^k)$. (In fact this readily proves that $R[[x]]$ is a UFD.) If $R$ is not a field, say it has some non-invertible element $r$, then there are many more ideals such as $(r)$ or $(r+x)$. I'm also facing difficulties at identifying the irreducible elements of $R[[x]]$. (I wish to prove that they are all primes in order to conclude the uniqueness of factorisation.) I have figured that they either take the form $ux+Px^2$ for some unit $u\in R^\times$ and some $P\in R[[x]]$ or have a non-zero constant term which is not invertible in $R$. The elements of the form $ux+Px^2$ are indeed primes, the difficulty lies in those with non-zero constant term.

1096588,Rigorous proof of the recursion method to compute expectations in probability.,"When solving expectation problems in probability, people sometime use recursive argument, but I have never seen a proof that this argument always works. For example, what is the expected number of rolls of a fair six sided die until you roll ""1""? The recursive method says, 1) You have a $1/6$ probability of rolling ""1"" on the first roll and a $5/6$ chance of rolling the other five numbers. 2) If you roll any of the other five numbers you have to start over again, but now you start at roll 1 to try and get your ""1"". If E is the expected number of rolls to get ""1"", the recursive method says, $E = (1/6)*(1 roll) + (5/6)*[(E + 1) rolls]$ So, $E = (1/6) + (5/6)(E + 1)$ and solving for $E$ we get $E  = 6$. There are also recursion methods for things like ""What is the expected number of flips of 2 sided coin to get two consecutive heads"", and other such problems involving questions like ""how many rolls/flips/etc. to get somethings"". My question is: Is there a rigorous mathematical proof that such recursion methods always work? By rigorous I mean please start with the definition of expectation as the integral of the random var. over its sample space. From this definition, can you prove the recursion method? Even if you prove it for a specific example that would be OK too. The issue I am having is that the recursion method seems ""intuitive"" (it could be rigorous, but no book has proved it that I've read!) and I do not see where the definition of expectation (as an integral) is used in the method.  The recursion method seems to be ""trick"" books discuss, but never relate to the definition of expectation as the integral of the function.","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

Var(X_t | X_0 = x_0) = \frac{\sigma ^2 \left(1-e^{-\frac{2 \mu  t}{\theta }}\right)}{2 \mu },\quad \forall t > 0

subject to a boundary value $u(x,T) = U(x)$ Taking the limit: Define the stochastic process $X^*_t$ as the limit of this process as $\theta \to 0$.  Naively taking the limit, (if it limit exists?),
$$
Var(X^*_t | X^*_0 = x^*_0) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2 \mu},\quad \forall t > 0
$$ This appears to show that the process is IID in the sense of $X_t \perp X_{\tau}$ for any $t \neq \tau$.  This also appears to coincide with multiplying the KFE by $\theta$ and then taking the limit, which shows the pdf is asymptotically an ODE and independent of time.
$$
\frac{d (x p(x))}{d x } = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\sigma^2}{\mu}\frac{d^2 p(x)}{d x^2 }
$$ What happens to the conditional expectation with the Feynman-Kac formula is less clear.  Multiplying by $\theta$ and taking the limit, it appears that most of the terms drop out, leaving us with an ODE not connected to the discounting or $f(\cdot)$
$$
\frac{d u(x)}{d x } = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\sigma^2}{\mu}\frac{d^2 u(x)}{d x^2 }
$$
which doesn't seem to be meaningful.  Applying the boundary value, doesn't this say that $u(x,t) = U(x)$ for all $t$? Question 1: Does the limit of this stochastic process exist? Question 2: Is this stochastic process measurable?  Does the strange form that the naive application of the Feynman-Kac formula takes suggest that it is only defined for trivial functions? Question 3: It sure looks like we can't really take the limit directly and solve expectations.  Is there a different(and better) way to take this limit, maybe along the lines of a rapidly mean reverting stochastic process and singular perturbations for small $\theta$? https://www.princeton.edu/~sircar/Public/ARTICLES/fpss3.9.pdf ADDED: It seems like the answer to the latter part of the problem may be that the $X^*_t$ process cannot be measurable.  To see this: let $P(x,t | x_0)$ be the CDF of $X^*_t$ given $X_0$ for $t \geq 0$.  (Note: I am pretty sure taking the limit that this becomes normal, and $P(x,t | x_0) \sim N(0, \frac{\sigma^2}{2 \mu}),\quad \forall t > 0,\, \forall x_0$ As this is independent of $t$, this means that (1) $\sup\{X_{t}\} = \sup\{N(0, \frac{\sigma^2}{2 \mu})\} = \infty$ for any $t > 0$ and (2) $\inf\{X_{t}\} = \inf\{N(0, \frac{\sigma^2}{2 \mu})\} = -\infty$ for any $t > 0$.  Since these are true for arbitrarily small $t$, there is no way to take an integral over time and have the $\inf$ and $\sup$ converge (or the Lebesgue equivalent).  I believe this rough description generalizes to show the non-existence of any continuous time IID process that is both measureable and non-deterministic","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-integrals']"

(3 answers) Closed 5 years ago . Is $\mathbf Q(\sqrt 2,\sqrt 3,\sqrt 5)=\mathbf Q(\sqrt 2+\sqrt 3+\sqrt 5)$? Say $L=\mathbf Q(\sqrt 2,\sqrt 3,\sqrt 5)$ and $K=\mathbf Q(\sqrt 2+\sqrt 3+\sqrt 5)$. It is easy to show that $\mathbf Q(\sqrt 2,\sqrt 3)=\mathbf Q(\sqrt 2+\sqrt 3)$.
Also, $[L:\mathbf Q]=8$. If we assume that $L\neq K$, then we will have $[K:\mathbf Q]=4$.
The reason for this is that $K(\sqrt 5)=L$. Now since $K$ is a superfield of $\mathbf Q$, and $[\mathbf Q(\sqrt 5):\mathbf Q]=2$, we have $[K(\sqrt 5):K]\leq 2$. Since we have assume that $K\neq L$, we must have $[K(\sqrt 5):K]=2$.
By the tower law, $[K(\sqrt 5):K][K:\mathbf Q]=[K(\sqrt 5):\mathbf Q]=[L:\mathbf Q]=8$, giving $[K:\mathbf Q]=4$. I am not able to make any further progress.

This is example 6.10 from chapter VII of Conway's A Course in Functional Analysis. Let $\{\alpha_n \}_{n=1}^\infty \subset l^\infty$. For $1 \le p \le \infty$, define the bounded linear operator $A: l^p \to l^p$ by $Ax(n) = \alpha_n x(n)$ for all $x \in l^p$. It's not too difficult to show that the spectrum of $A$, denoted by $\sigma(A)$, equals $\text{cl} \left(\{\alpha_n\}_{n=1}^\infty\right)$. Suppose now that, for some index $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $\alpha_k$ is an isolated point with respect to the subspace topology on $\sigma(A)$. Then the singleton $\{\alpha_k\}$ is a clopen set in $\sigma(A)$. And we can find a smooth contour $\Gamma$ that winds once around $\{\alpha_k\}$ but not around $\sigma(A)\setminus \{\alpha_k\}$. According to the Riesz functional calculus, we may define a new bounded operator on $l^p$ by: $$E( \alpha_k; A) = \int_\Gamma (z - A)^{-1} dz.$$ And by proposition 4.11 earlier in the chapter, $E(\alpha_k ; A)$ is a idempotent. That is $E(\alpha_k ; A) \circ E(\alpha_k ; A) = E(\alpha_k ; A)$. Now, I think I understand this example so far. But then, Conway goes on to claim that $E(\alpha_k ; A)$ is equal the operator $P: l^p \to l^p $ defined  by $Px(n) = \chi_{N_k}(n)x(n)$ where $\chi_{N_k}$ is the characteristic function (defined on $\mathbb{N}$) of $N_k = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : \alpha_n = \alpha_k \}$. I'm not able to show why $E(\alpha_k ; A) = P$ as claimed. This is equality is puzzling me because I am not sure how to get started with the operator $\int_\Gamma (z - A)^{-1} dz$. Is there a trick that I could use to explicitly compute $\left( \int_\Gamma (z - A)^{-1} dz \right) x$ for arbitrary $x \in l^p$? I think the only useful observation I have made to this point is that it's clear $P$ is an idempotent (as it must be if we are to have $P = E(\alpha_k ; A)$).

1097187,Series convergence question from baby Rudin.,"Suppose, $a_n>0$, $s_n=a_1+\cdots +a_n$, and $\sum a_n$ diverges.  Prove that
  $$\frac{a_{N+1}}{s_{N+1}}+\cdots\frac{a_{N+k}}{s_{N+k}}\ge 1-\frac{s_N}{s_{N+k}}$$
  and deduce that $\sum\frac{a_n}{s_n}$ diverges. Looking for a verification of my proof. $$\begin{align}
\sum_{m=1}^k\frac{a_{N+m}}{s_{N+m}} &\ge\frac{1}{s_{N+k}}\sum_{m=1}^ka_{N+m}\\
& ={s_{N+k}-s_N\over s_{N+k}}\\
& = 1-\frac{s_N}{s_{N+k}}.
\end{align}$$ Let $0<\epsilon<1$. Since, $\lim_{k\to\infty}1-\frac{s_N}{s_{N+k}}=1$,
there is a $K\ge 1$, such that $k\ge K\implies 1-\left(1-\frac{s_N}{s_{N+k}}\right)<\epsilon$; that is $\frac{s_N}{s_{N+k}}<\epsilon$. So, it has been shown that there is an $\epsilon>0$ such that for all $N\ge 1$,
$\sum_{m=1}^k\frac{a_{N+m}}{s_{N+m}}>1-\epsilon$. Therefore the series does not meet the Cauchy criterion and diverges.","['sequences-and-series', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"

1097247,Is the limit a function?,"We're aware of the existence of the limit in the context of calculus, e.g. where $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, we may have:
$$\lim_{x\to z} f(x) = y$$ My question is whether it is valid to see the limit as a function. A limit takes two inputs: $f$, a function, and $z$, the value at which we take the limit of the function. These two inputs are a tuple $(f,z)$ where the first coordinate of the tuple is a function from some function space $F$[1] and the second coordinate is from $\mathbb{R}\cup[-\infty,+\infty]$, at least in standard one-variable calculus in the real numbers. So, instead of writing $\lim_{x\to z} f(x) = y$, I could write $\lim(f,z) = y$. Specifically, I want to claim that $\lim$ is a function such that $\lim : F \times ((\mathbb{R}\cup[-\infty,+\infty])\setminus N) \to \mathbb{R}\cup[-\infty,+\infty]$, where $N$ is the set of values in the extended reals for which we cannot take that particular limit, so we conveniently exclude them. The last part in particular may not read too well, but I hope that the point is clear: I'm asking if it is possible to call a limit a function that maps a (function, value) tuple to some image. [1] Matthew Leingang pointed out that different $f$ will have different $N$, which makes it hard to generally define an $F$ to suit an $N$. This is problematic for defining the domain of the limit, so I propose to define $F=\{f\}$, i.e. we define $F$ as containing only the particular function we're interested in taking the limit of.","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"
1097248,Finding the Probability of a Sequence of Numbers in Materials Testing,"There are $n$ numbers on a wheel. For this example, let's say $n = 20$. You are going to spin $x$ times.

What formula can I use to find the probability of having the same number occur 4 times and a different number occur 3 times? Or the odds that 7 different numbers will occur? Or the odds that 3 numbers are the same, 2 numbers are the same, 2 more numbers are the same? etc. The numbers do not have to be in order or consecutive and all 20 numbers can occur each spin. My thought is this is a complex equation that can simply be solved. Also, what are the odds that all 7 numbers are in the bottom half, bottom quarter, middle quarter, etc. of the numbers?

I've run into a problem in converting between other classes of numbers (specifically, rational numbers), and surreals. In an attempt to write a function that converts a rational number into a surreal number, I've noted a few things: Not all rational numbers have finite representations as surreal numbers (in fact, I believe any rational number that is represented fractionally with a denominator that is not a power of 2 fails in this respect); I'm willing to ignore these for now The function is likely to be defined recursively, like most operations on or concerning surreal numbers I have already defined addition, multiplication, negation (and by extension subtraction), and a function that converts an integer into a surreal number I would use division of two surreal numbers obtained via integer conversion (the numerator and denominator of the rational number), except that I'm having trouble defining division without already having defined division (simply a quirk with how surreal number division is defined) I've glanced briefly through ""the book"" on the topic of surreal numbers ( On Numbers and Game s by John H. Conway), and while he mentions that the rational numbers are fully contained within the surreals (as are all ordered fields), the only thing he noted that I found that looks something like a conversion equation is the following: If x is a rational number whose denominator divides $2^n$, then $x = \{x-(1/2)^n|x+(1/2)^n\}$ This seems circularly defined, and unsuitable for an algorithm (at least, as far as I have tried to use it, though that could simply be inexperience).

1097390,Does independence of events depend upon underlying probability model?,"Consider a sample space of two coin tosses = $\{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$. Suppose that the coin is fair and therefore every outcome has probability $\frac{1}{4}$. Now, consider another probability model where the coin is biased and head occurs with probability $\frac{3}{4}$. In this model the corresponding probabilities = $\{\frac{9}{16}, \frac{3}{16}, \frac{3}{16}, \frac{1}{16}\}$. Definition of independence $P(A \cup B) = P(A)P(B)$ Event $A$ = first coin toss results in head        = $\{HT, HH\}$ Event $B$ = both coin toss results in same outcome = $\{HH, TT\}$ First model: $P(A) = P(\{HT,HH\}) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$ $P(B) = P(\{HH,TT\}) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$ $P(A \cup B) = P(\{HH\}) = \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2} = P(A)P(B)$ Therefore, in this probability model events $A$ and $B$ are independent. Second model : $P(A) = P(\{HT,HH\}) = \frac{3}{16} + \frac{9}{16} = \frac{12}{16}$ $P(B) = P(\{HH,TT\}) = \frac{9}{16} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{10}{16}$ $P(A \cup B) = P(\{HH\}) = \frac{9}{16}$ which is not equal to $P(A)P(B) = \frac{15}{32}$ Therefore, in this probability model events $A$ and $B$ are not independent Thus, independence of the events depend upon the underlying probability model.

1097757,Is the usual proof of $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac {\sin(x)}{x} = 1$ an honest proof?,"In a lot of textbooks on Calculus a proof that $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac {\sin(x)}{x} = 1$ is the following: Comparing the areas of triangles $ABC, ABD$ and  circular sector, you get:
$$
\sin(x)<x<\tan(x)
$$
from what you have:
$$
\cos(x)<\frac {\sin(x)}{x}<1
$$
from which immidiately follows that $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac {\sin(x)}{x} = 1$ Don't you think that this kind of proof is not honest. I mean, in the proof we use the fact that the area of sector is $\frac12xr^2$. This formula comes from integrating (an ""infinite"" sum of ""infinitesimal"" triangles' areas). So, roughly speaking, we somehow implicitly use that the length of ""infinitesimal"" chord $BC$ is equal to the length of ""infinitesimal"" arch $rx$, which is equivalent that $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac {\sin(x)}{x} = 1$.

1097759,Double integral: How to switch to polar coordinates with a difficult domain,"i have this double integral:
$$
I=\int \int_{R} (x+y),\;\;  R=\left \{ (x,y):\frac{x^{2}}{3} \leq y\leq 3,\; -1\leq x\leq 3\right \}
$$ and this is the domain of integration NOT in polar coordinates: i don't see any radial simmetry, so how can i switch to polar coordinates? EDIT:
the question is: What's the best way to handle such problems, when you're asked to switch in polar coordinates but with a ""not-radial like"" domain?",['multivariable-calculus']
1097775,Quadratic SDE solution,"I have this SDE $dX_t=[a+bX_t+sX_t(1-X_t)]dt+\frac{1}{2}X_t(1-X_t)dW_t, \, X_0=0,$ where $a,b \in(0,1)$ and let's say that $s$ is a real constant (it's actually a function of $X$, but I think I can get around that and it makes this a bit simpler). I would like to find an explicit solution to this if there is one. So far I have not been very successful in my search. If I eliminate the stochastic part, I get something that is reducible to a linear equation and has a relatively nice explicit solution. But that only gives me a lower bound for the mean of this process and that is much less than I need. Obviously, if I eliminate the quadratic part, this is easily solvable, but again that is not what I need. I welcome any suggestions or references to the literature where a solution could be found. Thanks! EDIT: Without the stochastic part, I have a Ricatti ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccati_equation ) equation which can be quite easily solved as I already mentioned. Now, it seems that what I have here is more or less a stochastic version of the Ricatti equation. Does anyone know any good literature on Ricatti SDEs? EDIT 2: Something one can definitely do is to use an Ito-Taylor expansion. This greatly simplifies things and since the approximation should (I still have to really carefully read through the theory, so don't take my word for granted) weakly converge to the original equation, I can make statements about the distribution of the process $X$ (which is in fact what I actually needed in the first place). This is not an answer to the original question (hence the edit instead of an answer), but perhaps it could be a useful hint to someone who faces a similar problem (or a way for me to let you correct me if I am wrong).","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-differential-equations']"
1097779,Calculate Angle between Two Intersecting Line Segments,"Need some help/direction, haven't had trig in several decades. On a 2 dimensional grid, I have two line segments. The first line Segment always starts at the origin $(0,0)$ , and extends to $(1,0)$ along the $X$ -axis. The second line Segment intersects the first at the origin, and can extend to potentially anywhere within $(-1,-1)$ to $(1,1)$ . I need to always calculate the angle to the right of the first segment... If this is already addressed in another post, please comment me the link. UPDATE I will have a single input of $(x,y)$ for the end of the 2nd segment... so segment $A$ would be $(0,0)$ â $ (1,0)$ and segment $B$ would be $(0,0)$ â $(x,y)$ where $(x,y)$ can be anywhere inside $(-1,-1)$ and $(1,1)$ assuming that the scale is $0.1$ . Let me know If I can provide any additional information that will help. UPDATE OK... assuming that the first segment is running along the $Y$ -axis... $A(0,0)$ and $B(0,1)$ And the second segment is running from $A(0,0)$ to $C(.4,.4)$ with a scale of .2.... $$\theta= \tan^{-1}{\dfrac{.4}{.4}}= 45$$ If I change C to $C(.4,-.4)$ I get. $$\theta= \tan^{-1}{\dfrac{.4}{-.4}}= -45$$ Do I have to manually compensate for the quadrant because this seems to calculate based specifically on the axis... I would expect the 2nd one to come up as 135 degrees from the positive Y Axis... What am I missing? Just for posterity... If I had $C(-0.4,-0.1)$ I would expect the result for the angle from the positive Y axis to this line segment to be roughly 255 degrees... $$\theta= \tan^{-1}{\dfrac{.4}{-.1}}= 75.9637$$ Plus 180 from starting at the positive Y axis....",['trigonometry']

""A subset, say, X, of a Banach space( or normed linear space ) is weakly compact iff any sequence of X has a subsequence converging weakly to some element in X"", is this statement right?

1097837,Real/Complex differentials forms,"Given $f:\Bbb C^{n}\to\Bbb C$ identified with $f:\Bbb R^{2n}\to\Bbb C$, in a book I read that
$$
\partial_x f\,dx+\partial_yf\,dy=\partial_zf\,dz+\partial_{\bar z}f\,d\bar z
$$
and that this could be rewritten as
$$
df=\partial f+\bar{\partial}f
$$
and this last equation defines $\partial f$ and $\bar{\partial}f$. My problem is to write explicitly the last two objects. Now $\partial_x:=(\partial_{x_1},\dots,\partial_{x_n})$ and $dx:=(dx_1,\dots,dx_n)$ and so on for the other variables. Hence we can think at $\partial_x f\,dx$ as a scalar product between $\partial_x f$ and the formal vector $dx$. In this way, writing formally $dz=dx+idy$ and $d\bar z=dx-idy$ we deduce easily the first equation. However I would like to write explicitly both its sides. LHS it's obviously $df$ (just a computation). Now it would be nice to write explicitly even RHS, in order to understand how to define properly $\partial f$ and $\bar{\partial}f$. We know that $\partial_z=\frac12(\partial_x-i\partial_y)$ and $\partial_\bar z=\frac12(\partial_x+i\partial_y)$. My problem is to understand how $dz$ works. We can assume wlog $n=1$. As a differential form, $dx$ is a covector: $dx=(1,0)$ and similarly for $dy=(0,1)$. What about $dz$? We know it's equal to $dx+idy=(1,0)+i(0,1)$, but the ""ambient"" in which $dz$ lives is 1-dim covector. I think the point is inside the last observation. The only way to obtain the first equality directly is to write $dz=(1,-1)$ and $d\bar z=(1,1)$, i.e. $i(0,1)=(0,-1)$. How can this be possibile? I need someone shading lights on this!
