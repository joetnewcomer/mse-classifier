868834,Littlewood's orbital joke,"In A Mathematician's Miscellany , Littlewood offers this item: To determine the orbit of a planet or comet 3 observations, each of
  two (angular) co-ordinates and the time t, suffice. It is actually the
  case that to any set of observations (point the telescope anyhow at
  any 3 times) an orbit  corresponds. Imagine a speck on the telescope's
  object glass ; this satisfies the observations, and it also describes 
  an orbit (that of the earth). Now (some sordid details being taken for
  granted) the equations for the elements of the  orbit are reducible to
  the solution of an equation of the 8th degree. This has accordingly
  one real root. But since the degree is even it must have a second real
  root. This to all intents rigorous argument is a test of taste. Incidentally
  the joke is in the mathematics, not merely about it. Can you please explain the joke?","['geometry', 'classical-mechanics']"

I am looking for the easiest (elementary) proof that $\mathbb R$ is infinite dimensional as a $\mathbb Q$-vector space, without using cardinality. It should be understandable at highschool level. So I guess the question could be reformulated as: what is the easiest infinite family of reals that can be showed to be independent ? So far square roots of primes seems a good candidate, but the proof is still a little intricate, is it the easiest possible ?

868951,Notation in Terry Tao's exposition on the PNT,"The exposition I'm talking about can be found here (page 6): http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/preprints/Expository/prime.dvi Essentialy, Tao proves the prime number theorem in the elementary way, although in disguised form. I have been looking at this for a while now and I still have some problems understanding the notation The definition of convolution of measures is the following, let $\mu_1, \mu_2$ be two measures, then their convolution $\mu_1 * \mu_2$ is defined as $\int f(x) (\mu_1 * \mu_2)(x)=\iint f(x+y) \mu_1(x) \mu_2(y)$ I can see that if you take an arithmetical functions $f(n)$ that you can define a measure $M_f(x)=\sum_n \frac{1}{n} f(n) \delta(x - \log n)$, (where $\delta$ denotes the Dirac Delta measure). Also if $f(n),g(n)$ are arithmetical functions then the Dirichlet convolution is related to the convolution of measures since $M_f M_g=\sum_n \sum_m \frac{1}{nm} f(n) g(m) \delta (x - \log n) \delta(x- \log m)$
and now substituing $r=nm$ $=\sum_r \frac{1}{r} \delta(x- \log r) \sum_{d|r} f(d) g(r/d)$ $=\sum_r \frac{1}{r} \delta(x- \log r) (f\#g)(r) $ Where $\#$ denotes Dirichlet convolution. What I dont really grasp is mostly his notation, what does he mean with $ H(x) \mathrm{d}x * H(x) \mathrm{d}x =x H(x) \mathrm{d}x$ (H(x) is simply $\mathbb{1}_{[0,\infty]})$. EDIT: Specifically, I'm trying to prove that the map $\phi: A \to C \\f \mapsto M_f$ from the algebra of arithmetical functions with Dirichlet convolution and addition to the algebra of measures with convolution of measures and addition is an algebra homomorphism. Why does the fact that $M_f M_g=M_{f \#g}$ imply that $\int u(x) (M_f * M_g)(x) = \int u(x) M_{f \# g}(x)$ Also his asymptotic notation I dont really understand, but it is most likely the same problem, what does he mean with this? $M_\mu * H(x) \mathrm{d}x=O(1)H(x) \mathrm{d} x$ Does this mean that $\int \mathbb{1}_{[0,x]} (M_\mu * H(x) \mathrm{d} x)=\mathrm{O}(x)$ ? I have taken undergraduate measure theory, but I have not seen this type of notation before (we used Measures, Integrals and Martingales by Rene L. Schilling). As a follow up question, I wonder why he used $\delta(x- \log n)$ instead of $\delta(x-n)$, i.e. why he uses the log integers instead of the integers, I feel like this might be a convergence problem, but it isn't really explained in his exposition.","['measure-theory', 'analytic-number-theory']"
868990,Complete intersections are connected,"I have been stuck on this exercise in Vakil's notes (and moved on hoping it would come to me later), and it seems to be useful for other results (for example, when expressing curves as complete intersections). Can somebody tell me what I'm missing? In 18.6.Q, Vakil asks to show that, if $X$ is a complete intersection in projective space of positive dimension, then $h^{0}(X,\mathscr{O}_X)=1$. The obvious thing to try is use induction, say $X$ is a complete intersection and $D$ is an effective cartier divisor on $X$, and consider
\begin{align*}
0\rightarrow \mathscr{O}_X(-D)\rightarrow \mathscr{O}_X\rightarrow \mathscr{O}_{D}\rightarrow 0
\end{align*}
and take the long exact sequence in cohomology and hope that it shows $H^{0}(X,\mathscr{O}_X)\rightarrow H^{0}(X,\mathscr{O}_D)$ is surjective, but I don't see how to proceed. It's possible I'm just being stupid since I'm working in isolation. For what it's worth, Exercise 18.5.B seems to ask us to show that an effective ample divisor on a projective scheme with dimension at least 2 (and with enough assumptions to use Serre duality) is connected. Vakil says to first reduce to the case of very ample by taking a tensor power and then show $h^0=1$ by taking the long exact sequence and applying Serre duality and Serre vanishing, but to my uneducated mind, it seems like the current task is even more general. I don't even know how to compute $h^0$ before taking the tensor power, but it seems like the current exercise would imply it is 1.

868999,The dual space of locally integrable function space,"I'm strongly interested in dual spaces. I learned the dual spaces of $L^p$ , $L^{\infty}$ , $C(X)$ and $M(X)$ . I wonder the dual space of locally integrable function space in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . The topology on $L_{loc}^1$ is generated by seminorms $$p_{K}(f-f_{0})=\int_{K}|f-f_{0}| \ dx $$ where $K$ is a compact set. I believe that this is standard topology of $L_{loc}^1$ . I have some observations. Observation 1. Define $$L(f)=\int_{\mathbb R} f(x) \ g(x) \ \chi_{K}(x) \ dx$$ where $K$ is a compact set, $f \in L_{loc}^1$ , $g \in L^\infty$ and $\chi_{K}$ is the characteristic function of $K$ . Then $L$ is a continuous linear functional. Obeservation 2. If $f \mapsto L(f)=\int f(x) \ g(x) \ dx$ is a linear functional, then $g$ should be of the form of $h \ \chi_{K}$ for some $h \in L^\infty$ and some compact $K$ . The above observation can be proved by using reductio ad absurdum. By the observations, I guess that $(L_{loc}^1)^*$ is the following space $$\{ \chi_{K}\ g : g \in L^\infty, \text{ compact } K \}$$ Is it true? If not, what is the counterexample?, and is there any reference about dual space of $L_{loc}^1$ ?","['functional-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'analysis', 'lp-spaces']"
869004,Chow group of zero cycles of a product,"I have been starting to learn about about chow groups. I don't know much yet, so hopefully the following is trivial: :-) For a smooth (projective, if you like) variety $X$ over a field $k$ I will write $CH_n(X)$ for the Chow group of $n$-cycles up to rational equivalence. One of the first things one learns is that these groups in general in no sense satisfy the/a Künneth formula. However, I have been wondering if this might be true in dimension zero, or at least what could be said in this case. Note that the projections $X_1 \times X_2 \to X_i$ are flat (over a field) so we get a natural map $CH_i(X_1) \otimes CH_j(X_2) \to CH_{i+j}(X_1 \times X_2)$ (flat pullback together with intersection product). Künneth formulas compare the left and right hand side of these maps. To simplify things (and preclude some arithmetic peculiarities I do not want to focus on), assume that $k = \overline{k}$ is algebraically closed. Then $CH_0(X)$ is the quotient of the free abelian group on the rational points of $X$ by rational equivalence. It follows that $CH_0(X_1) \otimes CH_0(X_2) \to CH_0(X_1 \times X_2)$ is surjective. My question: What can be said about the kernel of this map? I have a feeling that assuming $X_1, X_2$ proper may help. Indeed the equivalence relation on zero-cycles has to do with closed integral curves $C \subset X_1 \times X_2.$ The projections $p_i: X_1 \times X_2 \to X_i$ are closed and so $p_i(C)$ is either a point or a closed curve. Presumably the new relations come from the case when $p_i(C)$ are both true curves ... not sure how to proceed.",['algebraic-geometry']

He's smarter than me so I found some software that did that (scikits.bootstrap==0.3.1 for python in a pandas environment), computed my bootstrapping confidence intervals and used them to put error bars on my graph. What I want to know is WHY exactly bootstrapping is more appropriate than standard error in this case? I understand that bootstrapping works by creating many alternative versions of your sample by sampling-with-replacement and computing some descriptive statistics on that large population of hypothetical samples but I don't understand when and why you should use it instead of using the standard error.

869106,"What is the ""Logistic Regression""? I cannot have a unified concept.","I have a question about logistic regression.
Recently, I interested in logistic regression for modeling some classification problem.
So I tried to study logistic regression with two books, ""Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation"" (Train) and ""Applied Logistic Regression"" (Hosmer and Lmeshow). To clarify my question, I picked two logit model examples from those books. Household's choice between a gas and an electric heating system (binary logit)
Let the subscripts $g$ and $e$ denote gas and electric, $PP$ and $OC$ are the purchase price and operating cost, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are scalar parameters. Then the probability that the household choose gas heating is $$P_g = \frac{e^{\beta_1PP_g+\beta_2OC_g}}{e^{\beta_1PP_g+\beta_2OC_g}+e^{\beta_1PP_e+\beta_2OC_e}}$$ Relationship between age and the presence or absence of CHD (binary logit)
Let $x$ be the age, the subscripts $0$ and $1$ denote absence and presence of the CHD and $\beta_1^0$, $\beta_2^0$, $\beta_1^1$ and $\beta_2^1$ are scalar parameters. Then the probability that a $x$ years old person has a CHD is $$P_1 = \frac{e^{\beta_1^1+\beta_2^1x}}{e^{\beta_1^1+\beta_2^1x}+e^{\beta_1^0+\beta_2^0x}}$$
(Although the model needs two scalar parameters to be estimated, I wrote the formula in this form to clarify the question) I am familiar with the logistic regression showed in the second example. The indepedent variable (age in this example) included in both choices (or classes), and of course, the value of independent variable is same for different classes. And there are coefficients for each class and each independent variable which has to be estimated, and those coefficients are different for different classes. However, the model of the first example has variables which are different for each choice ($PP_e$, $PP_g$, $OC_e$ and $OC_g$), and the coefficients are same between choices. Roughly, I can understand two models separately, but I cannot build the unified concept of the logistic regression. They seems like different for me. For example, many of textbook and materials provide the (multinomial) logistic regression formula, which contain independent variables and the coefficients (which are different for each class). With this formula, I can understand the second example. But can this formula incorporate the situation showed in the first example? In other words, does this formula have the variable which are different for each class? Please help me to understand logistic regression.

This is part of exercise I.4.8 in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry: Show that any variety of positive dimension over $k $ has the same cardinality as $ k $. Hints: Do $\mathbb{A}^{n} $ and $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ first. Then for any $ X $, use induction on the dimension $ n $. Use (4.9) to make $ X $ birational to a hypersurface $ H \subset\mathbb{P}^{n+1 }$. Use (Ex. 3.7) to show that the projection of $  H$ to $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ from a point not on $ H$ is finite-to-one and surjective. So far I successfully showed this result for $ \mathbb{A}^{ n} $ and $ \mathbb{P}^{ n} $. For the general case, since $ X$ sits in a projective space, we have $|X | \le | k| $. To show the opposite inquality, $ X $ has an affine open subset $ U $of positive dimension. Hence there is a nonconstant polynomial as a regular function on $ U $. If I show that this polynomial is surjective, I'm done. I'm unable to show this so far. I'm interested in completing my approach. If it's hopeless or too difficult, I'm fine with a solution following the hint of the book. Thank you",['algebraic-geometry']

869143,Using a helical vector field to foliate $\mathbb{R}^3$,"Having finished an introductory course to GR as part of my physics undergrad degree, I decided to look at some differential geometry over the summer, and picked up Schutz's Geometrical methods of mathematical physics. On page 82 (in case you have access to the book), in a section on foliation, the author introduces a helical vector field: $\frac{\mathrm{dx}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda} = -\sin \lambda,
\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda} = \cos \lambda,
\frac{\mathrm{dz}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda} = 1
$ The integral curves of this field are helices, which appear to form a congruence over the manifold. Their equations are $x-x_0 = \cos\lambda, y-y_0 = \sin\lambda, z=\lambda$. Now, the author says, this vector field, together with the x-basis vector field (so I guess that's $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ at every point of the manifold), form a family of surfaces, each point in $\mathbb{R}^3$ being on one, so it foliates the manifold. However, the helical vector field, plus the z-basis vector field, do not together form a submanifold. The author specifically writes: ""The plane defined by the two at any point is not tangent to the 'next' spiral curve above or below it."" This has me confused - what does he mean? I thought that I should calculate the Lie brackets for each of the two pairs; they will foliate the manifold if their Lie brackets at all points are linear combinations of the two fields at that point (is that right?). However, I get that for neither pair does this condition hold. In the first case, I have $\overline{V} = -\sin\lambda\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \cos\lambda\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial}{\partial z},\\
\overline{X} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\\
\left[\overline{V},\overline{X}\right] = (\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \sin\lambda)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\cos\lambda)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}
$ Even without explicitly evaluating $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\sin\lambda$ etc. I can already tell that the bracket is not tangent to a surface defined by the helix and x-axis vector fields, as the two tangent vectors at any point are $\overline{V}$ and $\overline{X}$, and the Lie bracket is just not a linear combination of them (except for points where the $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ coefficient vanishes). In the second case, the situation is very similar, up to a rescaling factor. So there are my questions: was I correct in looking at the Lie brackets of the helical vector field and the x-axis (z-axis) vector field to check whether they define a foliation, and if so, how does one get the correct Lie bracket, as I seem to be getting the wrong one!

The only proofs i've seen to far all use the assumption that the boundary $\partial \Omega$ is smooth. Because than we have enough regularity for the eigenfunctions to be in $C^2(\overline{\Omega})$ and can show by using the strong Maximum-Principle , that we can assume the corresponding eigenfunctions of the first eigenvalue to be strict positive.

$$\frac{dh}{dt} = ?$$
$$V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h$$ I would like to isolate the volume formula in regards to h (that's not the right terminology is it?) so I used related triangles to discover: $$\frac{r}{h} = \frac{5}{14}$$
$$r = \frac{5h}{14}$$ I plug that back into the volume equation and get:
$$V = \frac{25\pi h^2}{588}$$ I use implicit differentiation to render:
$$\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{25\pi h^2}{196}*\frac{dh}{dt}$$ I plug in the values for $\frac{dv}{dt}$ and height to render: $$\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{-98}{225\pi}$$ Part B Now I'm trying to find $\frac{dr}{dt}$ I use related triangles again but this time I render: $$h = \frac{14r}{5}$$ I plug that into my volume formula to get:

Note $x=1/2(x+\bar{x})+1/2(x-\bar{x})\ \ \ (*)$  and $\overline{x-\bar{x}}=-(x-\bar{x})$ and $x+\bar{x} \in F_0$. So there exists $a$ such that $\bar{a}=-a$ and $a \not \in F_0$.

Since $\bar{a}=-a$, we get $k=a^2\in F_0$, and $a^{-1}=k^{-1}a \in K$. Now $\overline{ab}=\bar{a}\bar{b}=(-a)(-b)=ab$, we get $l=ab\in F_0$, and $b=la^{-1} \in K$. Hence $K=F$ and then $|F:F_0|=2$.

That would mean all coherent sheaves on $X$ of rank $r$ are locally free, I don't quite believe that.

870043,Jordan measure zero discontinuities a necessary condition for integrability,"The following theorem is well known: Theorem: A function $f: [a,b] \to \mathbb R$ is Riemann integrable if and only if its set of discontinuities has Lebesgue measure zero. Now if we change Riemann integrable to Lebesgue integrable, this theorem is false since $\chi_{\mathbb Q}$ is Lebesgue integrable and has full measure discontinuities. We also know that if we change Lebesgue measure to Jordan measure, then having Jordan zero-measure discontinuities is sufficient for integrability. My question: Does every Riemann integrable function necessarily have zero Jordan measure discontinuities?","['measure-theory', 'calculus', 'integration']"

870122,For which angles is inequality true,My problem is from Israel Gelfand's Trigonometry textbook. Page 48. Exercise 6: a) For which angles $\alpha$ is $\sin^4\alpha-\cos^4\alpha > \sin^2\alpha-\cos^2\alpha$ ? b) For which angles $\alpha$ is $\sin^4\alpha-\cos^4\alpha \geq \sin^2\alpha-\cos^2\alpha$ ? The attempt at a solution: I know that $$\sin^4\alpha-\cos^4\alpha=(\sin\alpha-\cos\alpha)(\sin\alpha+\cos\alpha)(\sin^2\alpha+\cos^2\alpha)=(\sin\alpha-\cos\alpha)(\sin\alpha+\cos\alpha)=\sin^2\alpha-\cos^2\alpha$$ Is this even correct?

870142,Find $\delta >0$ such that $\int_E |f| d\mu < \epsilon$ whenever $\mu(E)<\delta$,"I am studying for a qualifying exam, and I am struggling with this problem since $f$ is not necessarily integrable. Let $(X,\Sigma, \mu)$ be a measure space and let
$$\mathcal{L}(\mu) = \{ \text{ measurable } f \quad| \quad  \chi_Ef \in L^1(\mu) \text{ whenever } \mu(E)<\infty\}.$$
Show that for any $f\in \mathcal{L}(\mu)$ and any $\epsilon >0$ there is $\delta >0$ such that $\int_E|f| d\mu < \epsilon$ whenever $\mu(E)< \delta$. A technique I've used in other similar problems is to define $A_n = \{ x\in X \, | \, 1/n \leq |f(x)| \leq n \}$ and let $A = \displaystyle \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n$. We can also define $A_0 = \{ x\in X \,|\, f(x) = 0\}$ and $A_\infty= \{x\in X\, | \, |f(x)| = \infty\}$. The part where I'm stuck is now that 
$$\int_X|f|d\mu = \int_{A_0} |f|d\mu + \int_{A} |f| d\mu + \int_{A_\infty} |f|d\mu$$
where the first term on the right is zero, and I want the last term on the right to be zero. Is there another way to go about this problem? Explanations are helpful to me since I'm studying and I don't want to confuse myself further. Thanks!","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
