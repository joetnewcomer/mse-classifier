1013261,Computing cohomology of the sheaf $\mathcal{End}(T_{\mathbb{P}^2})$ restricted to a curve,"Characteristic of the basic field is zero in this question. Let $E \subset \mathbb{P}^2$ be a smooth elliptic curve. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the vector bundle on $E$ obtained as restriction to $E$ of the sheaf of endomorphisms of $T_{\mathbb{P}^2}$ 
$$
\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{End}(T_{\mathbb{P}^2})\big|_E.
$$
I want to compute dimensions of cohomology groups of $\mathcal{F}$. First of all, Riemann-Roch formula for elliptic curve says $\operatorname{deg}(\mathcal{F})=\chi(\mathcal{F})$.
Noting that
$$
\mathcal{F} \cong T_{\mathbb{P}^2}|_E \otimes T_{\mathbb{P}^2}^\vee \big|_E
$$
we get $\operatorname{deg}(\mathcal{F})=0$, therefore $\operatorname{dim}H^0(E,\mathcal{F})=\operatorname{dim}H^1(E,\mathcal{F})$. Next observation. The trace map $\operatorname{tr}:\mathcal{End}(T_{\mathbb{P}^2}) \to \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2}$
gives a short exact sequence
$$
0 \to \operatorname{ker}(tr) \to \mathcal{End}(T_{\mathbb{P}^2}) \to \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2} \to 0,
$$
that always splits. It means that vector bundle $\mathcal{F}$ is decomposible and have a summand $\mathcal{O}_E$. Therefore $\operatorname{dim}H^0(E,\mathcal{F})=\operatorname{dim}H^1(E,\mathcal{F}) \geq 1$.

1013407,Definitions of Lebesgue integral,"I know the definition , from A.N. Kolmogorov and S.V. Fomin's Элементы теории функций и функционального анализа , of Lebesgue integral of measurable function $f:X\to \mathbb{C}$ on $X,\mu(X)<\infty$ as the limit$$\int_X fd\mu:=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_Xf_nd\mu=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^\infty y_{n,k}\mu(A_{n,k})$$where $\{f_n\}$ is a sequence of simple, i.e. taking countably many (not necessarily finitely) values $y_{n,k}$ for $k=1,2,\ldots$, functions $f_n:X\to\mathbb{C}$ uniformly converging to $f$, and $\{y_{n,k}\}=f_n(A_{n,k})$ where $\forall i\ne j\quad A_{n,i}\cap A_{n,j}=\emptyset$. If $\mu$ is not finite but is $\sigma$-finite with $X=\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty X_j$, $X_1\subset X_2\subset\ldots$ then $\int_{X}fd\mu:=\lim_j\int_{X_j}fd\mu$ if such limit exists for any sequence $\{X_j\}$ (said to be exhaustive ) such that $X=\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty X_j$, $X_1\subset X_2\subset\ldots$. I read other authors defining the Lebesgue integral for non-negative functions $g:X\to[0,+\infty]$, where $\mu(X)\le\infty$, by using simple non-negative functions $s_i$ taking only finitely many values on measurable sets $A_i$ in the following way:$$\int_X gd\mu:=\sup\Bigg\{\sum_i s_i\mu(A_i):\forall x\in X\quad s_i(x)\le g(x)\Bigg\}$$ and in general in the following way, provided that $\int_X|f|d\mu<\infty$:$$\int_Xfd\mu:=\int_X \text{Re}f_+d\mu-\int_X \text{Re}f_-d\mu+i\Bigg(\int_X \text{Im}f_+d\mu-\int_X \text{Im}f_-d\mu\Bigg)$$
where subscript $\pm$ is used to define $g_+(x):=\max\{g(x),0\}$ and $g_-(x):=-\min\{g(x),0\}$ for any measurable function $g$. I have not been able to find more about it, since the texts that are available to me all use Kolmogorov-Fomin's definition, but I am convinced that such definitions are equivalent. From what I know -I have finished Kolmogorov-Fomin's Элементы теории функций и функционального анализа , which significantly overlaps with Introductory Real Analysis by the same authors- I would say that it would be enough to prove the equivalence for non-negative functions $g:X\to[0,+\infty)$. If they are equivalent, how can it be proved? I have not been able to use what I know, Kolmogorov-Fomin's content, to prove it: is a much more advanced knowledge necessary? I have tried by using the density in $L^1(X)$ of the set of measurabe functions taking finitely many values on finite measure sets, and also the fact that, if $\mu(X_j)<\infty$ and $\{s_k\}$, with $s_k:X_j\to\mathbb{C}$, converges to $g:X_j\to\mathbb{C}$ in the metric of $L^1(X_j)$, then a subsequence of $\{s_k\}$ uniformly converges to $g$, but I have not been able to prove the equivalence of the two definitions.

1013692,What group is $(\mathbb{Z}/24\mathbb{Z})^{*}$ isomorphic to,"I want to determine which group $(\mathbb{Z}/24\mathbb{Z})^{*}$ is isomorphic to. $\mathbb{Z}/24\mathbb{Z}$ contains the 24 residue classes $z + 24\mathbb{Z}$ of the division mod 24. For brevity, I will identify them with $z$, so $\mathbb{Z}/24\mathbb{Z} = \{ 0, 1, ..., 23\}$. For $(\mathbb{Z}/24\mathbb{Z})^{*}$, I have the definition $\{z \in \mathbb{Z}/24\mathbb{Z}\,\,|\,\, \exists z^{-1}\in\mathbb{Z}/24\mathbb{Z}: zz^{-1}=1\}$ with the usual multiplication. So $((\mathbb{Z}/24\mathbb{Z})^{*}, \times)$ is a group. What I get is $(\mathbb{Z}/24\mathbb{Z})^{*} = \{1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23 \}$. My reasoning is this: $0$ is out because we can't satisfy $0z=1$. Therefore, all divisors of 24 are out. $9,15,16,20,21$ violate the uniqueness of the neutral element because they don't change by squaring. $10,14,18,22$ yield divisors of $24$ by squaring. This is kind of clumsy. Is there a faster way to notice that only the primes are contained in $(\mathbb{Z}/24\mathbb{Z})^{*}$? In order to determine which group $(\mathbb{Z}/24\mathbb{Z})^{*}$ is isomorphic to, I calculated the order of each element which is two. Again, is there an easy way to see that primes are always of order two in such groups? Another group, where all elements are of order two is $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$. I conjecture that two groups are isomorphic if (and only if) their elements are of the same order but I don't see how to prove this. In my special case, I could calculate the Cayley table of both groups and define the homomorphism by explicitly stating which element gets assigned to which but maybe there's an easier and more general way to prove this? I already got a hint that I should use the fact that there are 16 subgroups of $(\mathbb{Z}/24\mathbb{Z})^{*}$ but I don't see where this gets me unless I can prove that $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ is the only group of order 8 with 16 subgroups also.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

1013922,Constructing an $\epsilon$-net of $l_2$ unit ball,"I am interested in probabilistic or explicit ways to construct an $\epsilon$ -net of the $l_2$ unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ . I know that, for every $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists an $\epsilon$ -net $\mathcal{N}_{\epsilon}$ for the unit sphere in $d$ dimensions such that $$
M\triangleq\left|\mathcal{N}_{\epsilon}\right|
\le \left( 1+\frac{2}{\epsilon}\right)^{d}.
$$ (Lemma 5.2 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3027 )
To my understanding, the aforementioned bound holds for an $\epsilon$ -net of the entire ball, not only the sphere. In the case of the sphere, we can construct an $\epsilon$ -net with high probability, 
by drawing a sufficient number ( $O(M\log{M})$ ) of independent random vectors according to a Gaussian distribution $N(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})$ , and normalizing the length to $1$ .
I believe that one way to get an $\epsilon$ -net for the ball,
would be to repeat the above procedure $O(1/\epsilon)$ times, for all spheres of radii $\epsilon, 2\epsilon,3\epsilon, \dots, 1$ .
The union of the $\epsilon$ -nets, should be able to cover the ball.
However, it would require $\tilde{O}\left((1+2/{\epsilon})^{d+1}\right)$ points (ignoring the logarithmic factor). Is there a simple way to construct an $\epsilon$ -net for the unit ball directly, $\textit{i.e.}$ , without constructing nets for multiple spheres? Is there way to achieve the bound on $\left|\mathcal{N}_{\epsilon}\right|$ (possibly up to logarithmic factors)?

Sol: Assume that G has the following two simple paths: (u,..P1..,v)

  If this circuit has no  repeated edges, then the proof is complete. Otherwise, let (x,y) be the first  edge that occurs in P1 and is repeated in P2. In this case, the circuit can be  represented as

I've tried coming up with a proof, and when that didn't really yield anything $($just the scattered thoughts I have below$)$, I searched online for a reference to a proof, to no avail. Can anyone provide a proof or a reference to one? Does a proof even exist via schemes, or was this someone trolling me? Would this question be a better fit on MathOverflow? Here are my thoughts so far on such a proof, if it were to exist. The standard linear algebraic $($or in context of ""modern"" frameworks, the ""$p$-adic""$)$ formulation of the irreducibility of cyclotomic polynomials is as follows. Theorem. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The degree of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)/\mathbb{Q}$ is $[\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n):\mathbb{Q}] = \phi(n)$. This is saying is that the vector space generated by the powers of $\zeta_n$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is of dimension $\phi(n)$. The most important case in the proof is where $n = p$, where one shows that the $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$ has dimension $p-1$. This is done by showing $$\dim_\mathbb{Q}(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)) = \dim_\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]) = \dim_{\mathbb{F}_p}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]/p),$$and that $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_p}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]/p) = p-1$. Now, the purpose of scheme theory is to make geometry out of rings. In the case of this elusive proof, I imagine the scheme theoretic perspective claims that the extension of rings $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]/\mathbb{Z}$ is like a ramified cover of topological spaces. One imagines $\mathbb{Z}$ as space populated by its primes, and similarly for $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]$. The scheme theoretic restatement of the above theorem is that this is a connected cover of degree $\phi(n)$. In the standard proof of the linear algebraic formulation above one sees this by looking above the prime $p$, where one sees ""nilpotency"" of order $p-1$, which implies that the cover must have degree $p-1$. Is this viable? Should I use some sort of monodromy or something? $($But that's harder to make sense of in the arithmetic setting...$)$","['number-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'cyclotomic-polynomials', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'reference-request']"

So I take the transformation to cylindrical coordinates:

x&=r\cos\theta,\\

Also I would like to know the equation of the curve of intersection between the cylinder and the paraboloid, but don't know how to do it.

  Prove that all maximal solutions for $\dot{x}=f(t,x)$ are defined in $\mathbb{R}$ ; what happens if $f$ is bounded? I believe that the Picard–Lindelöf theorem is the way to go, but I don't know how to prove that $f$ satisfies the Lipschitz condition. In order to use it, if I understand correctly, I should prove that $v$ is bounded for every $t$ in a neighborhood of $(t_0,x_0)$ being the last a solution for the differential equation. If $\dot{x}=f(t,x)$ then $x(t)=\displaystyle\int f(t,x)dt$ . Considering the hypothesis, $$\displaystyle{||x||\leq\int||f(t,x)||dt\leq\int v(t) ||x||dt}\\1\leq\int||f(t,x)||dt\leq\int v(t)dt$$ which doesn't seem useful at all.... First update Alright, let's try it this way: The goal is to show that we always have a is defined in $\mathbb{R}$ for any IVP. Suppose $(t_0,x_0)$ is a maximal solution for $\dot{x}=f(t,x)$ with $x(t_0)=a$ , then I should prove that exists an interval $[t_0-c,t_0+c]$ in which the solution exists. $v$ is continuos, then for any $t_0$ we can pick $c$ and $[t_0-c,t_0+c]$ will be be bounded. Define $K=\operatorname{max}\{v(t):t\in [t_0-c,t_0+c]\}$ . Then $f$ is Lipschitz for every $(t,x)\in [t_0-c,t_0+c]\times \mathbb{R}^n$ , this is, $||f(t,x)||\leq v(t)||x||\leq K ||x||\;\forall (t,x)\in [t_0-c,t_0+c]\times\mathbb{R}^n$ By the Picard-Lindelöf theorem, the IVP has an unique maximal solution. And $t_0,c$ were arbitrary, can I conclude that all maximal solutions are defined? Second update Looking about extensibility I found these notes about differential equation. The extensibility theorem and the corollary seem to be enough to prove that the solutions exists for all $\mathbb{R}$ . I'll quote both here: Suppose that $f$ is $C^1$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ .  Denote the unique solution by $x(t)$ and suppose $J:=(a,b)$ is the maximal interval of existence. Theorem 1.20 (Extensibility Theorem): For each compact set $K\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ there is a $t\in J$ such that $x(t)\notin K$ ;  thus, $$\lim_{t\to b^-}|x(t)|=\lim_{t\to a^+}|x(t)|=+\infty .$$ Corollary 1.21: Without loss of generality, if $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n$ is continuous, then the solutions to $\dot{x}=f(x)$ , $x(0)=x_0$ exist $\forall t\in \mathbb{R}$ .

All matrices with complex entries have Jordan canonical forms.
If matrices are similar, they have the same Jordan canonical form. This is what I've tried:
Let $g(t) = {t^3} - 2{t^2} + t$. Then $g(A) = 0$. So, $p(t)$, the minimal polynomial of $A$, can be: $t, t-1, {(t-1)^2}, t(t-1), t{(t-1)^2}$. Now, I think that we classify all the matrices as similar to one of: $\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0\\0&0&0\\0&0&0\end{bmatrix}$, $\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}$, $\begin{bmatrix}1&1&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}$,

But you can do the same with hyperbolas: $$f(x,y)={{x^2}\over9}–{{y^2}\over4}$$ And you can do the same with ellipses, which are essentially the inverse of a hyperbola: $$f(x,y)={{x^2}\over9}+{{y^2}\over4}$$ To me, those two are functions, as is the original quadratic. True, the latter two fail the vertical line test, but so what? You give it an input value and you get an output value. Why are these not functions?","['conic-sections', 'functions']"

1014991,My (divergent) summation of the zetas with sets of cofactors give systematically errors of simple integer differences. What am I missing?,"This is a ""fiddling"" in a small project of mine with which I'm concerned from time to time for three years now . I try to focus on the core of the problem, please ask if more context is needed. Consider the divergent series 
$$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty {(-1)^{k-1} \over k }\zeta(-k) \underset{\mathcal N}{=} s_1 = -0.081061466...   $$
Here the symbol ""$\underset{\mathcal N}{=} $"" means, that I did that sum by the Noerlund-summation-method using 64 terms. The value which I expect by some other derivation which I'll explain below is $ -\zeta(0)' = 0.91893853 $ which differs exactly by 1. More context: the coefficients at the zetas are taken just from the matrix of Stirling-numbers of the first kind, denote them simply as $s1_{r,c}$ , so the defition stems really from:
$$ \sum_{r=1}^\infty s1_{r,1} \cdot {1! \over r! }\zeta(-r) \underset{\mathcal N}{=} s_1  $$ Next consider the divergent series taken from the next column in the Stirling matrix:
$$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty s1_{k,2} \cdot { 2! \over k! }\zeta(-k) \underset{\mathcal N}{=} s_2 = -0.006356455...   $$
The value which I expect by the other derivation is $ \zeta(0)'' = -2.00635645591... $ which differs (relatively near) by $2!$. (The difference can be made smaller by taking more terms for the Noerlund-summation) To make things short, I'm doing the dotproduct
$$ Z \cdot S1 \underset{\mathcal N}{=} Y $$
where the infinite rowvector $Z$ contains the consecutive zetas $\zeta(0),\zeta(-1),\zeta(-2), ...$ and $S1$ is the matrix containing the Stirlingnumbers first kind, scaled by factorials such that
$$ S1_{r,c} = s1_{r,c} \cdot { c!\over r!} $$
getting the result-vector $Y$ which deviates from my expected result of derivatives  $ \zeta(0)^{(c)}$ by factorials such that
$$ Y[c]= (-1)^c \cdot (\zeta(0)^{(c)} + c!) $$ The problem is connected with that of the Ramanujan-summation of the series of like powers of logarithms:
$$ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \log(1+k)^c \underset{\mathcal Z}{=}  (-1)^c \cdot \zeta(0)^{(c)} $$
where I get (by ""$\mathcal  Z $"" eta-regularization) the ""magic constants"" having the same values as I described above and which deviate by the expected values for that sums (by the signed $\zeta(0)$-derivatives) exactly the factorials.
