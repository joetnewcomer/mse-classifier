3006595,Prove $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)^2}(2H_{2k}+H_k)=\frac{\pi^3}{32}-2G\ln2$,"How to prove $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)^2}(2H_{2k}+H_k)\stackrel ?=\frac{\pi^3}{32}-2G\ln2,$$ where $G$ is the Catalan's constant. Attempt For the first sum, $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)^2}H_{2k}=\Re\left\{\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{i^k}{(k+1)^2}H_{k}\right\},$$ which can be evaluated by using the formula in this post : $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{H_n}{n^2}\, x^n=\zeta(3)+\frac{\ln(1-x)^2\ln(x)}{2}+\ln(1-x)\operatorname{Li}_2(1-x)+\operatorname{Li}_3(x)-\operatorname{Li}_3(1-x),$$ but we cannot apply the similar approach to the second sum $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)^2}H_k.$$ Then, I tried to write the sum as $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)^2}\int_0^1\frac{2x^{2k}+x^k-3}{x-1}~\mathrm dx$$ and it become more complicated. Edit: Are we able to evaluate the sum directly (avoid calculating integrals and  polylogs as much as possible)? The integral given by @Jack D'Aurizio is a bit complicated ( see this post ).","['harmonic-numbers', 'closed-form', 'sequences-and-series']"

3006644,"If $A$ is invertible and $r^{\text{Gelf}}(BA^{-1}) < 1$, then $(A - B)$ is invertible.","Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a unital Banach algebra and define $r^{\text{Gelf}}(A) = \lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty} \| A^n \|^{1/n}$ .

I need to show that if $A$ is invertible and $B$ is such that $r^{\text{Gelf}}(BA^{-1}) < 1$ , then $(A - B)$ is invertible. What I did is the following: consider the element $C = A^{-1} + A^{-1}\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}(BA^{-1})^n$ . This is known as the Neumann series. If this series converges, it follows from a direct computation that $(A - B)^{-1} = C$ , but I am struggling to show that this series in fact converges.

3006675,Prove that $\overline{\pi}(C) = S_0^1$ if $\text{ess} \sup S_1^1 = \infty$ and $\text{ess}\inf S_1^1 = 0$,"Exercise : We consider a financial market of one period $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P},S^0,S^1)$ , where the sample space $\Omega$ is finite and the $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathcal{F} = 2^\Omega$ . Furthermore, $S^0$ is the risk-free asset with initial value $S_0^0 = 1$ at time $t=0$ and interest rate $r>-1$ (which means that $S_1^0 = 1+r)$ and $S^1$ is the risky asset with initial value $S_0^1 >0$ at time $t=0$ and value $S_1^1$ at time $t=1$ which is a random variable.

3006687,Quasi-Chinese Remainder Theorem for modules,"Let $R$ be a ring. The Chinese Remainder Theorem asserts that if $J_1,\ldots,J_n\lhd R$ are bilateral coprime ideals (i.e. $J_i+J_k=R,\ \forall i\neq k$ ) then the map $$\varphi:a\in R\longmapsto (a+J_1,\dots,a+J_n)\in R/J_1\oplus\dots\oplus R/J_n $$ is a surjective ring morphism, such that $$\ker (\varphi)=\displaystyle \bigcap _{1\leq i\leq n} J_i.$$ Thus we have a ring isomorphism (and thus an $R$ -module isomorphism) $$R/\bigcap_{1\leq i\leq n} J_i\simeq R/J_1\oplus\dots\oplus R/J_n.$$ In the proof the fact that the ideals are bilateral is used not only to make sense of the ring quotient $R/J_i$ . 
So I’m wondering whether I could extend the theorem in order to obtain a module isomorphism instead of a ring one in the following sense: Let $R$ be a non-commutative ring (the commutative case is in fact the Chinese Remainder Theorem itself) and $J_1,\dots,J_n\subset R$ be left ideals such that $J_i+J_k=R$ if $i\neq k$ . Let $R/J_i$ be the quotient module of $R$ modulo the left $R$ -submodule $J_i$ . Then the mapping $\varphi$ (defined above) is a surjective $R$ -module morphism. The problem arose in trying to prove (or disprove) that any finite dimensional $k$ -algebra has only a finite number of simple left modules up to isomorphism. If the module-generalisation theorem holds, then I have proved this fact.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'representation-theory', 'modules']"

3006711,Geometry of the set of coefficients such that monic polynomials have roots within unit disk,"We let $\pi$ be the bijection between coefficients of the real monic polynomials to the real monic polynomials. Let $a\in \mathbb R^n$ be fixed vector. Then \begin{align*}
\pi(a) = t^n + a_{n-1} t^{n-1} + \dots + a_0. \\
\end{align*} Now denote the set $$ \Delta = \{ x\in \mathbb R^n: \pi(x) \text{ has roots in the open unit disk of } \mathbb C\}.$$ It can be shown $\Delta$ is a path-connected set by Vieta's formula (maybe slightly modified for the real case). Let us consider a line (1-dim subspace) in $\mathbb R^n$ , $L = \alpha b$ where $\alpha \in \mathbb R$ and $b \in \mathbb R^n$ is fixed. Clearly $L \cap \Delta$ is nonempty since $0 \in L \cap \Delta$ . I am trying to determine the number of connected components of $L \cap \Delta$ . We shall assume $n > 2$ . If $n=1$ , $L \cap \Delta$ is clearly connected. For $n=2$ , if I am not mistaken, the paper by Fell https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102779366#ui-tabs-1 asserts that convex combination of real monic polynomials of the same degree with roots in the unit disk remains in the unit disk (Theorem 4). This allows us to construct a path between any $x \in L \cap \Delta$ and $0 \in \mathbb R^n$ and so $L \cap \Delta$ is connected. Edit: The question was initially unclear in the sense: I didn't know whether $L \cap \Delta$ is connected.  @Jean-Claude Arbaut gave nice numerical examples and plot to show that the set is not connected. I rewarded a bounty and started a new one to see whether there is some bound of the number of connected components. I would reward the bounty to any bound or if the number of connected components could be unbounded.","['path-connected', 'algebraic-geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'polynomials', 'general-topology']"

3006750,Two definitions of a projective morphism,"In Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry, page 103, a morphism $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is said to be projective if it factors as a closed immersion $X \rightarrow {\bf P}^n_Y$ followed by the projection ${\bf P}^n_Y \rightarrow Y$ . As noted there, EGA II, 5.5 has another definition,
namely $f$ is projective if it factors as a closed immersion $X \rightarrow {\bf P}(\cal E)$ followed by the projection map, where $\cal E$ is finite-type quasi-coherent ${\cal O}_Y$ -module. Hartshorne states without proof nor reference that the two definitions ""are equivalent in case $Y$ itself is quasi-projective over an affine scheme"".

3006807,How do you reflect a graph about an arbitrary line for a precalculus student?,"Here's a question one of my precalculus students asked me, paraphrased for clarity: You know how if you have the line $y=x$ , and you want to reflect the graph of a function $f(x)$ across it, you can just switch the $y$ and $x$ in the equation of the function (since you're just finding $f^{-1}$ if it exists). What if you wanted to reflect a graph about something like $y=2x$ instead? Or $y=2x-3$ ? Is there some trick analogous to ""switch the $x$ and the $y$ "" to find the equation of this reflected curve? My trouble is that I don't have an explanation that would be particularly good for a precalulus student. Is there an elegant way to explain to a precalculus student how to do this that looks analogous to the ""switch $x$ and $y$ "" trick? Here are the approaches to reflecting a curve about a line that I know, that I think are a bit too heavy for this student. Do some vector-calculus looking stuff: To reflect the graph of $f$ across $y=mx+b$ , you translate the $y$ values by $b$ to make the line go through the origin, look at the projection of a point on the translated graph onto the normal vector $\langle -m,1 \rangle$ of the line, use the projection to reflect the graph, then translate back by $-b$ . I can calculate this for the student, but I don't think the formula will look memorable, and certainly won't be a clean ""trick."" Right now I'm leaning towards showing the student a nice picture of this without any calculations. I'll probably type this up in detail as an answer sometime unless someone has a better suggestion. Talk about reflection matrices : a reflection about a line in the $xy$ -plane with an angle of $\theta$ with the $x$ -axis is given by multiplication by the matrix $$\begin{pmatrix}\cos2\theta&\sin2\theta\\\sin2\theta&-\cos2\theta\end{pmatrix}\,,$$ then the case where $\theta = \pi/4$ , where you're reflecting about the line $y=x$ , corresponds to the matrix $$\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}\,,$$ which just switches the $x$ and the $y$ coordinates of the graph. But then introducing matrices as linear transformations, and explaining why that matrix corresponds to reflections, would be tough.","['reflection', 'algebra-precalculus']"
3006822,"Upper bound for certain number of colorings of $(2k,k^2)$-graph $G$","Let $G$ be a graph with $2k$ vertices and $k^2$ edges, $k\geq 1$ , such that $G$ contains $K_{k-i, k+i}$ as a subgraph, where $0\leq i \leq k-1$ . Suppose that the complete bipartite subgraph $K_{k-i, k+i}$ has a bipartition $A_1\cup A_2$ , where $|A_1|=k-i$ and $|A_2|=k+i$ . We define $$P(G, A_1, A_2, 5)=\{ \text{$5$-(vertex) colorings of $G$ such that every vertex of $A_1$ is color $1$ or $2$ and every vertex of $A_2$ is color $3,4$, or $5$}  \}.$$ I want to show that for any such graph $G$ we have $$P(G, A_1, A_2, 5) \leq 6^k.$$ ***If for whatever reason the bound $6^k$ is too small, I am also content with obtaining an upper bound of $6^k+ o(6^k)$ . I thought that perhaps I could prove this claim by induction on $0\leq i\leq k-i$ . One nice observation I have made is that the parameter $P(G, A_1, A_2, 5)$ satisfies a deletion-contraction identity, just as the chromatic polynomial does. That is, $$P(G, A_1, A_2, 5)=P(G-e, A_1, A_2, 5)-P(G/e, A_1, A_2, 5),$$ for any $e\in E(G)$ . Alright, so here is my base case: Suppose $i=1$ . Then $K_{k-1,k+1}$ is a subgraph of $G$ which means that there is one edge $e$ in $G$ whose vertex ends are both in $A_1$ or both in $A_2$ . Case 1: Both ends of $e$ are in $A_1$ . We have $$P(G, A_1, A_2, 5)=P(G-e, A_1, A_2, 5)-P(G/e, A_1, A_2, 5)$$ $$=2^{k-1}3^{k+1}-2^{k-2}3^{k+1} $$ $$=2^{k-2}3^{k+1}=6^k(3/4)<6^k.$$ Case 2: Both ends of $e$ are in $A_2$ . We have $$P(G, A_1, A_2, 5)=P(G-e, A_1, A_2, 5)-P(G/e, A_1, A_2, 5)$$ $$=2^{k-1}3^{k+1}-2^{k-1}3^{k} $$ $$=2^{k-1}3^{k}(3-1)=6^k.$$ Thus, the bound holds when $i=1$ . I am struggling a lot with the inductive case. If I know that $K_{k-i, k+i}$ is a subgraph of $G$ then there are $i^2$ edges in $G$ that are not in $K_{k-i, k+i}$ . Each of these edges must have both ends in $A_1$ or in $A_2$ . I can't seem to get the inductive hypothesis to ""pop out"". Any help is immensely appreciated. Thank you.","['graph-theory', 'combinatorics', 'extremal-combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

3006941,Defining an unusual subspace of $c_0$,"This is going to be a long post, so I'm giving a description first: I recently came across the following exercise: Let $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ be a measure space. If $(f_n)\subset L^p(\mu)$ and $f\in L^p(\mu)$ , $p\geq 1$ , such that $\|f_n-f\|_p\leq n^{-c}$ with $c>1/p$ , prove that $f_n\to f$ a.e. on $X$ .  The solution is not a big deal, but leads to an interesting question: which rates are good enough for convergence in norm to imply convergence a.e.? Recall that with no further assumptions, convergence in norm only implies the existence of a subsequence that converges a.e. Anyway, the following definition is necessary: Define $\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ as the set $$gr^p(\mu):=\{(a_n)\in c_0|\text{ for all } (f_n)\subset L^p(\mu): \big{(}\forall n\in\mathbb{N}: \|f_n\|_p\leq |a_n|\big{)}\implies f_n\to0\text{ a.e.}\}$$ What I would like is to describe this set. My progress is the following: 1) For any measure space and any $p\geq 1$ it is $(0)\in\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ , therefore this set is never empty. 2) If $(a_n)\in\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ and $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$ then $\lambda\cdot(a_n)\in\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ . Indeed, if $\lambda=0$ it is obvious; otherwise if $(f_n)\subset L^p(\mu)$ with $\|f_n\|_p\leq|\lambda a_n|$ for all $n$ we have that $\displaystyle{\|\frac{1}{\lambda}f_n\|_p\leq|a_n|}$ for all $n$ therefore $\frac{1}{\lambda}f_n\to 0$ a.e. which is true iff $f_n\to 0$ a.e. 3) For any measure space, $\ell^p\subset\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ . Let $(a_n)\in\ell^p$ and $(f_n)\subset L^p(\mu)$ with $\|f_n\|_p\leq|a_n|$ for all $n$ . We have $\displaystyle{\int_X|f_n|^pd\mu\leq|a_n|^p}$ for all $n$ and by summing and using the Monotone convergence theorem we have that $\displaystyle{\int_X\sum_{n}|f_n|^pd\mu\leq\|(a_n)\|_{\ell^p}<\infty}$ , therefore the series $\sum_n|f_n|^p$ converges a.e. hence $|f_n|^p\to0$ a.e. which implies $f_n\to 0$ a.e. 4) In any measure space, if $(a_n)\in\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ and $(a_{n_k})\subset(a_n)$ , we have $(a_{n_k})\in\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ . Let $(a_{n_k})\subset(a_n)\in\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ and $(f_k)\subset L^p(\mu)$ s.t. for all $k$ it is $\|f_k\|_p\leq |a_{n_k}|$ ; Define $g_n$ as $0$ if $n\not\in\{n_k: k\in\mathbb{N}\}$ and $g_{n_k}=f_k$ for all $k$ . Then $\|g_n\|_p\leq |a_n|$ for all $n$ , hence $g_n\to 0$ a.e. which of course implies $f_k\to0$ a.e. 5) $\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ is a linear subspace of $c_0$ . We need only to prove that it is closed under addition. Let $(a_n),(b_n)\in\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ and $(f_n)\subset L^p(\mu)$ with $\|f_n\|_p\leq|a_n+b_n|$ for all $n$ . We partition $\mathbb{N}$ in $S=\{n: a_n=0\}$ and its complement $\mathbb{N}-S$ . Case 1: $S$ is an infinite set. By 4), $(b_n)_{n\in S}\in\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ and $\|f_n\|_p\leq|b_n|$ for all $n$ in $S$ ; therefore the subsequence $(f_n)_{n\in S}$ converges a.e. to $0$ . Now for $n\not\in S$ we can find $\lambda_n\in\mathbb{C}$ such that $b_n=\lambda_n\cdot a_n$ . We have to deal with two sub-cases: Sub-case 1: There exists $M>0$ s.t. for all $n\in\mathbb{N}-S$ it is $|\lambda_n|\leq M$ . In this sub-case, for $n\not\in S$ we have $\|f_n\|_p\leq |a_n|+|b_n|\leq (1+M)|b_n|$ . But $(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}-S}\in\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ by 4), and by 2) we have $((1+M)b_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}-S}\in\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ . Hence $(f_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}-S}$ converges to $0$ a.e. Sub-case 2: $|\lambda_n|\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$ through $\mathbb{N}-S$ (note that if $\mathbb{N}-S$ is finite we are automatically in sub-case 1). We can find $n_0\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n\geq n_0$ and $n\not\in S$ it is $|\lambda_n|>1$ . For those $n$ it is $a_n=\frac{1}{\lambda_n}b_n$ therefore $\|f_n\|_p\leq|1+1/\lambda_n|\cdot|b_n|\leq2|b_n|$ ; now since $(b_n)_{n\geq n_0, n\in\mathbb{N}-S}\in\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ it is $(f_n)_{n\geq n_0, n\in\mathbb{N}-S}\to0$ a.e. and we are done. Case 2: S is finite; we can do exactly what we did in the two sub-cases above for $\mathbb{N}-S$ and we are done. Anyway , my questions to the community are these: Are these spaces any interesting in your opinion? What would be a good norm for these spaces? I can't think of anything that is of interest. In this post I prove that for a series of Dirac point-mass measures the space $\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ is the entire $c_0$ for all $p$ and that for the measure space $(\mathbb{R}^d, \mathcal{L}^d, \lambda_d)$ the space $\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ is only $\ell^p$ . EDIT : An easy argument that shows that $\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ is not closed under the supremum norm, unless $\text{gr}^p(\mu)=c_0$ : obviously $c_{00}\subset\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ , where $c_{00}$ denotes the subspace of sequences that are eventually $0$ . Thus $\text{gr}^p(\mu)$ is dense in $c_0$ with the supremum norm.","['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

It claims that for random data point clouds in high-dimensional spaces, there will be ""many"" hubs -- that is, points that are within k nearest neighbors of many other points. We define, for each point $x$ , the number $N_k(x)$ to be the number of other points $y$ such that $x$ belongs to $k$ nearest members of $y$ . Radonovic claims that $N_k(x)$ has approximately normal distribution for random point clouds in low dimensional manifolds, but a highly skewed distribution with long right-tail in high dimensions. Radonovic illustrates this with uniformly distributed points in $[0,1]^N$ . I tried to reproduce some of that in Python and came to a surprising observation. While the $N_k(x)$ distribution is indeed skewed in high dimensions when generating uniform point cloud in the cube and using the Euclidean distance function, I didn't observe this when generating uniform point clouds in the sphere . Experiment with a cube (uniformly generated 2000 points in $[0,1]^{500}$ ) The same experiment with a sphere (uniformly generated 2000 points in $S^{500}$ ) My intuition is that there should be no difference between hub-histograms in an $n$ -cube or an $n$ -sphere, because this hubeness seems to be a local phenomenon. Unless I have some stupid mistake in the code , my intuition seems to be wrong. Generating more points, I think I could see some skewness in the sphere as well, but only very slightly, if at all.

Longer version of the question: Consider the following paths on $C(n)$ : $$ \gamma_{r,s} : [0,1]\to C(n), \quad t \mapsto [\zeta^r(1-t)^{1/n}:\zeta^st^{1/n}:1],$$ where $\zeta$ is a primitive $n-$ th root of unity and $r,s \in \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ . One can combine them to obtain cycles $$ \Delta_{r,s} := [\gamma_{0,s}-\gamma_{r,s}+\gamma_{r,0}-\gamma_{-r,0} + \gamma_{-r,-s}-\gamma_{0,-s}] \in H_1(C(n),\mathbb{Q})^-$$ that are anti-invariant under complex conjugation (that's what the $^-$ stands for), meaning that $\overline{\Delta_{r,s}}=-\Delta_{r,s}$ . My aim is to show that the $\Delta_{r,s}$ span $H_1(C(n),\mathbb{Q})^-$ , which has dimension equal to the genus $$g=\dfrac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}.$$ There are in principle enough elements. It's true that $\Delta_{r,0}=\Delta_{0,s}=0$ and that $\Delta_{-r,-s}=-\Delta_{r,s}$ and that $\Delta_{\frac{n}{2},\frac{n}{2}}=0$ for $n$ even, but one could in principle still find up to $$\left\lfloor  \frac{(n-1)^2}{2} \right\rfloor \ge g$$ cycles among the $\Delta_{r,s}$ , and based on computer calculations I have reason to believe that they actually span $H_1(C(n),\mathbb{Q})^-$ . But I would like to prove it. So I either need a direct argument or, if I can find a basis of $H_1(C(n),\mathbb{Q})$ , I could try to express the $\Delta_{r,s}$ in terms of this basis and see what comes out. The problem is that I do not have a nice way to visualize paths on the curve and describe them with explicit formulas. Ideas: Of course one can take the standard basis on the compact Riemann surface with $g$ holes, but then to go from there to the concrete case of $C(n)$ probably requires complicated formulas (I honestly would have no idea how to do it). Find a basis of $H_1(C(n),\mathbb{Q})$ by induction. The cases with $n=1,2$ have trivial homology, so we just need the step. But it's difficult to do it without an idea for an explicit formula. Look at the Jacobian $J(n)$ . It has the same homology as $C(n)$ . It can be contructed as $$ J(n) = \frac{\left(\Omega^{1}_{C(n)}\right)^*}{\Lambda},$$ i.e., as the dual of global holomorphic differential $1-$ forms on $C(n)$ quotiented by the span $\Lambda$ of the functionals on $\Omega^{1}_{C(n)}$ of the form $\lambda = \int_{[c]} \cdot$ for some $[c] \in H_1(C(n),\mathbb{Q})$ . $\Omega^{1}_{C(n)}$ is a complex vector space of dimension $g$ , so if one finds a basis one can view $J(n)$ as $\mathbb{C}^g$ quotient a lattice, and cycles might be easier to describe there. And maybe, if one finds a basis of the homology of $J(n)$ , its pullback via the Abel-Jacobi map $C(n) \to J(n)$ to $C(n)$ is again a basis and one can do something. But I am not sure about many points here.","['algebraic-curves', 'riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'homology-cohomology']"

If we let $a,b$ be numbers satisfying the above relation, then we know that $$\frac{db}{b}\ln\bigg(\frac{b^3+1}{b^2+1}\bigg)=\frac{da}{a}\ln\bigg(\frac{a^3+1}{a^2+1}\bigg)$$ ...but this is not useful since the chance of an antiderivative existing is slim. Can anyone find such $a,b$ ? Inspired by this question. NOTE: Because the antiderivative of the integrand can be expressed in terms of dilogarithms, the problem is equivalent to finding distinct real algebraic numbers $a,b$ satisfying $$\frac{\text{Li}_2(-b^3)}{3}+\frac{\text{Li}_2(-b^2)}{2}=\frac{\text{Li}_2(-a^3)}{3}+\frac{\text{Li}_2(-a^2)}{2}$$","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'bounds-of-integration']"

Last thing is that $GCD(x,y)|LCM(x,y)$ . Using all this I tried to solve the first exercise: $a)$ First two obvious pairs are $x=15, y=150$ and $y=15, x=150$ . Now neither of the numbers can be bigger than $150$ or smaller than $15$ . So we are looking for numbers in the range $15-150$ that satisfy $x \cdot y = 15 \cdot 150$ Another such pair is $(x,y)=(30,75), \ (x,y)=(75,30)$ . Similarly for $b)$ we find that the only possible values are permutations of the set { $120,1320$ } and in $c)$ since $100$ does not divide $990$ no such numbers exist. Now exercise 2 is what made me think there is actually another connection I'm not quite aware of since now it's about arbitrary prime numbers and the previous method doesn't work anymore.

3008198,Combinatorial or polyhedral description for tropicalization of the positive subset of a real linear subspace,"I had two questions: one regarding a definition of tropicalized linear subspaces, and the second about how to find similar characterizations for the logarithmic limit set of the positive subset of a linear subspace. I've been reading Maclagan and Sturmfel's ""Introduction to Tropical Geometry"", and in Chapter 4.1 and 4.2,  they discuss the tropicalization of linear spaces. For a valued field $K$ , given $n+1$ column vectors $\textbf{b}_i \in K^{d+1}$ , for $n>d$ , they define a matrix $\textbf{B}$ whose columns are the $\textbf{b}_i$ , and later on define a tropicalized linear space associated to $\textbf{B}$ via the tropical basis formed by the linear polynomials whose supports correspond to circuits of $\textbf{B}$ . In Chapter 4.2, they also characterize $trop(L)$ in terms of $\textbf{B}$ 's associated matroid's flats and polyhedra. While the book defines a hyperplane arrangement associated to $\textbf{B}$ , I didn't intuitively understand its connection to the eventual tropical linear space. If I were to reinterpret, I feel like the rows of $\textbf{B}$ span a $d+1$ -linear subspace $L \subset K^{n+1}$ , and the tropicalized linear space defined by $\textbf{B}$ in the book is the tropicalization of $L$ . So first, if this is incorrect, how would spanning vectors of a linear subspace $L$ , relate to its tropicalization as a variety? My main question: following the perspective that the tropicalization of a variety, as a set, corresponds to taking the logarithmic limit of that set (via Maslov dequantization), take the intersection of a real linear subspace $L^+ \equiv L \cap \mathbb{R}_{>0}^n $ , and its logarithmic limit set $trop(L^+)$ . What are the combinatorial (e.g. linear forms related to circuits) or polyhedral (e.g. the flats of the matroid) descriptions of the support of $trop(L^+)$ ? Where should I look to get a better understanding? My endgoal is to describe $trop(L^+)$ given a spanning set of $L$ .

If I had: g(x) = 4 int g(int x) { returns 4; } that is again a linear mapping of the integer domain to the integer codomain, with range of size 1. I am not sure if this is mathematically correct to say so but if I had: h() = 5 int h() { return 5; } that takes no input, thus there an empty domain, but the codomain is still integers and the range is of size 1. Is there a special term for this? this is coming from the idea that: int i = 5; and int h() { return 5; } are the 'same'. Thus if there is a term to describe the function h, it can describe what 'i' is.

This is the square $Q_0$ . 3) Starting from $A$ take a point $A_1$ at the first intersection of $AB$ with a line of the grid. And do the same starting from  the other points $B,C,D$ finding the points $B_1,C_1,D_1$ . 4) connect the points $A_1, B_1,C_1,D_1$ , so that we have a new square $Q_1$ . 5) redo the same points $3$ and $4$ and find the square $Q_2$ and so  again... The result is a sequence $S_n$ of squares whose sides, orientation, and number of different elements depend from $n$ . The figures show the construction for $n=2$ , and for $n=3$ . Note that it seems that the sequence $S_2$ has infinite different elements that converge to a square of the grid, but $S_3$ has a finite number of different elements. So a first question is: How we can prove that the number of different elements of $S_n$ is finite or not and, if finite, what is this number? A second question is to find the length of the last square in the sequence, or the limit of the lengths if the sequence has infinite different elements.

3008548,Increasing function on R that is discontinuous on the rationals,"The question (Folland's Real Analysis, 3.5.30) asks to produce an increasing function on $\mathbb{R}$ whose set of discontinuities is the rationals. My train of thought is as follows: Let $f_0$ be the identity. We want to create a jump at every rational number, while keeping the function increasing. Create $f_1$ by cutting $f_0$ at each integer, and halving the slope of each resulting line segment, fixing the left endpoints. This results in a sort of slanted stair that is still increasing and discontinuous exactly at the integers. Given $f_{n-1}$ , we create $f_n$ by cutting each segment of $f_{n-1}$ into $n$ parts and halving the slope of each resulting segment, again fixing the left endpoints. Note: this is equivalent to making cuts at all rational points $\frac{m}{n!}$ at the $n^\text{th}$ step, with $m$ and $n$ not necessarily coprime. The limit of such sequence of functions exists. It's easy to prove that any rational point is eventually a left endpoint, and is thus kept fixed by all successive functions in the sequence. For an irrational point $x$ we can make two sequences $a_n$ and $b_n$ of rationals converging from the left and right respectively, such that $a_n=\frac{m}{n!}<x$ and $b_n=\frac{m+1}{n!}>x$ . Given $\epsilon$ , we can then choose $N$ large enough with $a_N$ and $b_N$ on the same segment of $f_{N-1}$ (so the jump from $f_{N-1}(a_N)$ to $f_{N-1}(b_N)$ is small), with this jump being less than $\epsilon$ . Since we can pinpoint the value of $f_n(x)$ between arbitrarily close values, the limit $f(x)=\lim_n f_n(x)$ exists. It's clear that the function is discontinuous at all rationals since it is constructed to be, and it is increasing since each $f_n$ is increasing. Can I say that $f$ is continuous at each irrational? My gut feeling is that, since any $\delta$ -ball around an irrational contains a rational to the left and one to the right, we cannot necessarily say $f$ is continuous there. However we know by theorem 3.23 in the book that the set of discontinuities of an increasing function is countable. Is there a contradiction somewhere? If so, can the construction be tweaked or is a different construction necessary? Thank you.",['real-analysis']

I've noticed successive derivatives of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ also seem to exhibit analogous results.

Next, what is the proof exactly? Here is my attempt. Let $n \in \mathbb N$ . Choose $p$ to be the intersection. Let $U$ be any neighborhood of $p$ in $M$ . For some reason , $V$ is an open ball namely $V=B(0,\varepsilon)$ . Let $\varphi: U \to V$ be a map. For some reason $\varphi(p)=0$ . If $\varphi$ were a homeomorphism, then $\varphi_R: U \setminus p \to B(0,\varepsilon) \setminus 0$ is a homeomorphism too , but this is a contradiction because of the facts about components. Tu does not give equivalent definitions of locally Euclidean so far, so is this one ball is enough? I checked the appendices, and I did not find any such convention that ""open set in $\mathbb R^n$ "" means element of basis of open balls. Why is $V=B(0,\varepsilon)$ ? Why is $\varphi(p)=0$ ? Here is what I did instead. Is this correct? Let $n \in \mathbb N$ . Choose $p$ to be the intersection. Let $U$ be any neighborhood of $p$ in $M$ . Case 1: $V$ is an open ball, $V=B(x,\varepsilon)$ for some $x \in \mathbb R^n$ , not necessarily the origin. Let $\varphi: U \to V$ be a map. If $\varphi$ were a homeomorphism, then $\varphi_R: U \setminus p \to B \setminus \varphi(p)$ , where $\varphi(p)$ is not necessarily $0$ or $x$ , is a homeomorphism too, but this is a contradiction because of the facts about components. Case 2: $V$ is an open set but not an open ball. I don't know this! (See the next question) How do we show the cross is not locally Euclidean for any open set $V$ in $\mathbb R^n$ ? $V$ is the union of basis elements, each of which are open balls and each of which are homeomorphic to a single open ball (because of what would be Part Two of this ). I am now thinking about arcs or edges , so I know I am overthinking: I think we can show the cross is not locally Euclidean for any $V$ if any space $Y$ which is the union of open subspaces $\{A_{\alpha}\}$ and each $A_{\alpha}$ of which is homeomorphic to a single space $X$ , is itself homeomorphic to $X$ , and I think that would be true by pasting lemma, but I don't know how to address the part where $f=g$ on the intersections.

My approach: For any random child, if it has $k$ siblings, it implies that its parent had $k+1$ children. Hence, if $S =$ no. of siblings and if $C =$ no. of children I'm not sure how to proceed after this. I tried evaluating the mean of S, by computing I'm not sure where I'm going wrong and how to proceed. EDIT:
Found an answer in one of the solution manuals. Basically, The probability of choosing a child that has $j$ siblings is the fraction of total children that have $j$ siblings. Now, if $Z$ is the total number of families, hence the total no. of children would be $\lambda Z$ . Also, if $P(j+1)$ is the probability that a family has $j+1$ children, then the no. of families with $j+1$ children is $Z \cdot P(j+1)$ . Also, each of this family has $(j+1)$ children, each of whom have $j$ siblings. Hence, there are in total children each having $j$ siblings. This divided by total number of children gives the fraction of children with $j$ siblings, i.e. Clearly my answer is wrong in the first step itself. However I'm not able to articulate why the initial step is incorrect.","['poisson-distribution', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

3008926,Jacobians of reducible curves,"Let $C$ be a connected, reduced but reducible projective curve over an algebraically closed field. Denote by $\pi:\tilde{C}\to C$ its normalisation. There are two standard references for computing $J(C)=\rm{Pic}^0(C)$ , namely Harris-Morrison's 'Moduli of Curves' section 5.B and Bosch-Lütkebohmert-Raynaud's 'Néron Models' section 9.2. I am happy with the computations of the Jacobian for the node, the cusp and for compact type curves, but am experiencing some confusion applying the occasionally unclear text of the above references to more complicated cases. Take for example the case of three distinct smooth rational curves meeting at one point - i.e. a star-shaped cubic in $\mathbb{P}^2$ . The arithmetic genus is one (as it's a plane cubic) whereas the normalisation consists of three disjoint $\mathbb{P}^1$ 's. For any $C$ as in the first paragraph we have an induced exact sequence $$0\to\mathcal{O}^*_C\to\pi_*\mathcal{O}^*_{\tilde{C}}\to F\to0$$ where $F$ is a torsion sheaf supported on the singular locus of $C$ . Harris-Morrison in exercise 5.11(2) give a formula for computing how many $\mathbb{G}_m$ and $\mathbb{G}_a$ factors the sheaf $F$ comprises of. In their notation, if $C$ is the star-shaped cubic with singularity $p$ , one finds $b=2$ as the number of branches is 3, whereas $\dim(\pi_*\mathcal{O}^*_{\tilde{C}}/\mathcal{O}^*_C)_p$ should be ''the contribution at $p$ to the difference in arithmetic genus between $C$ and $\tilde{C}$ ''. This would imply $a+b=1$ meaning $a=-1$ which is already confusing and my first point in need of clarification. Moving on under the assumption $a=0$ though, the cohomology of the above sequence gives $$0\to\mathbb{G}_m\to\mathbb{G}_m^3\to\rm{H}^0(F)\to J(C)\to J(\tilde{C})\to 0.$$ $J(\tilde{C})=0$ as it consists of disjoint rational curves whereas the above computation gives $\rm{H}^0(F)=\mathbb{G}_m^2$ . This leads to $J(C)=0$ by a dimension count from the sequence. This is at odds with my expectation that the Jacobian of $C$ should be one dimensional. Some further comments: A further way to see that $\rm{H}^0(F)=\mathbb{G}_m^2$ in the above example is the following. The stalk at $p$ of the first short exact sequence above is as follows: the middle group is generated by three functions $f_1,f_2,f_3$ , each defined on a neighbourhood of a preimage of $p$ on each of the $\mathbb{P}^1$ 's of the normalisation, and it contains $\mathcal{O}^*_{C,p}$ those functions so that $f_1(p)=f_2(p)=f_3(p)$ . The quotient $F_p$ should then be given by $(\frac{f_1(p)}{f_2(p)}, \frac{f_2(p)}{f_3(p)})$ ie $\mathbb{G}_m^2$ - although there may be a mistake here. Unraveling Propositions 9 and 10 (and the definition of the intermediate curve $X'$ ) in the 'Néron Models' section, one expects copies of $\mathbb{G}_a$ to appear in $F$ whenever the singularity admits a resolution which is a homeomorphism (eg a cusp) in the sense that there's only one preimage. Whenever this is not the case, we expect a copy of $\mathbb{G}_m$ in $F$ for the number of branches at the singularity, minus 1 (the long sequence in the middle of p249).",['algebraic-geometry']
3008929,Manifolds of zero dimension and $\mathbb R^0$?,"Tu Manifolds Section 5.4 Example 5.13 ( Manifolds of dimension zero ). In a manifold of dimension zero, every singleton subset is homeomorphic to $\mathbb R^0$ and so is open. Thus, a zero-dimensional manifold is a discrete set. By second countability, this discrete set must be countable. Why exactly is the manifold $M$ discrete? I actually proved that the singleton subsets are open in their components but was not able to show they are open in $M$ itself. Here is what I have done thus far: Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with dimension zero, which means by definition that all of the connected components of $M$ 's topological manifold (see here ) $\{C_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in J}$ have dimension zero. Let $\alpha \in J$ . $C_{\alpha}$ has dimension zero, which means by definition (see here ) that $\forall p \in C_{\alpha}, \exists$ homeomorphism $\varphi: U \to V$ for some $U$ , a neighborhood of $p$ in $C_{\alpha}$ and some $V$ , an open subset of $\mathbb R^0=\{0\}$ . $V$ is either $\{0\}$ or $\emptyset$ . Since $U$ contains $p$ , $U \ne \emptyset$ . Hence, $V \ne \emptyset$ because from nothing comes nothing , so $V=\mathbb R^0=\{0\}$ . Sets that are homeomorphic to singletons are singletons. Therefore, $U$ is a singleton containing p, so $U=\{p\}$ . Therefore, we have $\forall p \in M, \exists$ unique $\alpha \in J: \{p\}$ is open in $C_{\alpha}$ . I remember the connected components $C_{\alpha}$ are: closed in $M$ not necessarily open in $M$ . open in $M$ if $J$ is finite. I know $\{p\}$ is open in one of the connected components of $M$ . How do we arrive at the conclusion that $\{p\}$ is open in $M$ itself?","['connectedness', 'smooth-manifolds', 'manifolds', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

Also before in the text book before this exercise there is a proposition that states that if $t \in G$ is an involution with $m = |C_{G} (t) | $ , then $C_{G} (t) $ is a proper subgroup of $G$ and $ |G | \leq ( \frac{1}{2} m(m+1) ) ! $ .","['group-theory', 'finite-groups']"

3009163,Degree of polynomial interpolating the primes,"The polynomial $p_3(x)$ passes through the points $(1,2), (2,3), (3,5)$ , where $2,3,5$ are the first three primes: $$
p_3(x) = \frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{x}{2}+2 \;.
$$ Similarly, one can form an interpolating polynomial $p_n(x)$ that
passes through the first $n$ primes.
For example: $$
p_5(x) = \frac{x^4}{8}-\frac{17
   x^3}{12}+\frac{47
   x^2}{8}-\frac{103 x}{12}+6 \;.
$$ One can check that \begin{eqnarray}
p_5(1) &=& 2 \\
p_5(2) &=& 3 \\
p_5(3) &=& 5 \\
p_5(4) &=& 7 \\
p_5(5) &=& 11 \;.
\end{eqnarray} My question is: Q . Is the degree of $p_n(x)$ ever strictly less than $n{-}1$ , for any $n$ ? The answer to Q is positive if a ""coincidence"" occurs,
such that a smaller degree
polynomial captures those $n$ prime points.
Do such coincidences ever occur?","['number-theory', 'polynomials', 'prime-numbers']"

Even though $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{k}{\frac{C\sqrt{n}}{n(n+1)}}$ converges and $\frac{C\sqrt{k}}{k+1}$ approaches to $0$ for $k\rightarrow\infty$ , but they do not imply the series $\sum\limits^{\infty}_{n=1}{\frac{a_n}{n}}$ converges.

3009225,"If $A\cong B$, then $A\otimes C\cong B\otimes C$.","I think this is kind of true, since $\square\otimes C$ is a functor, so it preserves the isomorphism. But what if we consider the example, $\mathbb{Z}\otimes\mathbb{Z}_2$ is not isomorphic to $2\mathbb{Z}\otimes\mathbb{Z}_2$ . Because the latter is trivial while the first is not. We can also consider the exact sequences: $$0\to\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}_2\to0,$$ where the first map is simply multiple by 2,
and $$0\to2\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}_2\to0,$$ where the first map is the inclusion.
If we tensor by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ we will get $$\mathbb{Z}_2\to\mathbb{Z}_2\to\mathbb{Z}_2\to0$$ and $$(0\to)X\to\mathbb{Z}_2\to\mathbb{Z}_2\to0$$ respectively. Apparently, the first one is the famous counterexample of non-left-exactness of tensor product. But the second one we just inject a submodule (ideal) to the whole module (ring). If $r\otimes m$ is 0 in $\mathbb{Z}\otimes\mathbb{Z}_2$ , then apparently it is 0 in $2\mathbb{Z}\otimes\mathbb{Z}_2$ . So we have the left exactness of the tensor product. This is again weird, since the two exact sequences are isomorphic (by wiki), why do I have different result?","['abstract-algebra', 'modules']"

3009469,About the Hasse-Weil zeta function of modular curves,"It is an important philosophy in the Langlands program that (roughly) the zeta function of a Shimura variety can be written as a product of L-functions of automorphic representations. The first evidence, also the most simplest example I think, is the classical result of Eichler and Shimura that (roughly) the zeta function of a modular curve is a product of L-functions of certain cusp forms. In their proof a key ingredient is the Eichler-Shimura relation relating the Hecke operator and the Frobenius map through the reduction mod $p$ at good primes. Later on Langlands in the Antwerp proceedings did similar things by comparing the Lefschetz and Selberg trace formulas to count points on the reduction mod $p$ , which is referred as the Langlands-Kottwitz method later, which has many related works (generalizations, etc). Now my problem is, I am not majoring in arithmetic stuff, yet I am very interested in this topic, I just wondered is there any reference demonstrating the simplest examples by using modern language? I think I can get a flavor of this subject by learning the most simplest examples such as modular curves, but I found the language in the original paper (Langland’s Antwerp 1972) is somehow too old. So is there any new reference reformulating them with some more advanced language, for example in terms of schemes, etale cohomology, shimura varieties, etc? I am avoiding learning the general theory of shimura varieties directly because it is much too heavy, actually I would like to use modular curve case as an inspiring example for learning the general shimura varieties. So is that possible to do that? By the way, in the series of Peter Scholze’s first three papers, the first paper named “The Langlands-Kottwitz approach for modular curves”, of course this paper is too difficult for me, so is it possible for me to know what he did, what is the difference between his work and the classical results on modular curves mentioned above, and what advanced knowledge do I need to finally understand his work?

3009584,Definition of manifolds as submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^m$,"I'm having trouble understanding the definition of coordinate charts of manifolds given in the book ""Analysis II"" by Herbert Amann and Joachim Escher. They define manifolds as submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^m$ (which is equivalent to the abstract aproach by the Whitney embedding theorem right?). The definition of a submanifold I learned is: Let $M$ be an $m$ -dimensional manifold. We say that a subset $L \subseteq M$ is a submanifold of $M$ of dimension $n$ , if for every point $p \in L$ there exists an adapted chart $\phi: U \rightarrow V' \times V''$ with $U \subseteq L$ open in $L$ , $V' \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ open in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $V'' \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{m-n}$ open in $\mathbb{R}^{m-n}$ such that $\phi (U \cap L) = V' \times \{0\}$ with $0 \in \mathbb{R}^{m-n}$ Then $L$ becomes an $n$ -dimensional manifold of itself with the smooth atlas induced by the restricted charts $\phi : U \cap L \rightarrow V'$ . The authors of the book define a submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^m$ as follows A subset $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$ is called an $n$ -dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^m$ if for every point $p \in L$ there exists an open set $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$ containing $p$ and an open subset $V\subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$ together with a diffeomorphism $\phi$ from $U$ to $V$ such that $\phi(M \cap U)=V \cap (\mathbb{R}^n \times \{0\})$ with $0 \in \mathbb{R}^{m-n}$ . ,which directly coincides with the book's definition if one views $\mathbb{R}^m$ as an $m$ -dimensional manifold with the smooth atlas induced by the universal chart $(\mathbb{R}^m, id)$ .
Then the authors define coordinate charts of an $n$ -dimensional submanifold $L$ of $\mathbb{R}^m$ around a point $p \in L$ as follows Let $\phi: U \rightarrow V$ be a homeomorphism from an open set $U \subseteq L$ in the subspace topology containing $p$ to an open subset $V$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $ i_M \ \circ \ \phi ^{-1}$ is a $C^\infty$ -immersion, where $i_M$ is the cannonical injection from $L$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ . How is this equivalent to the restricted charts given in the first definition? Why does $ i_M \ \circ \ \phi^{-1}$ need to be an immersion? I'm really having trouble connecting the abstract aproach to manifolds to the way of defining manifolds as submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^m$ . What's a good way to  think about the approach taken by the book?","['definition', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
