832657,First-term approximation for singular perturbation of ODE (with two turning points),"I'm reading ""Introduction to Perturbation Methods"" by Mark Holmes, and I came across an exercise that I don't know how to approach. As I decided to independently read this book, I have no friends/classmates/teachers with whom I can discuss this subject. The exercise reads as follows (ex. 2.47): Consider the problem
$$\epsilon y'' -(x-a)(x-b)y' - x(y-1) = 0, \text{ for } 0<x<1$$
with the boundary conditions $y(0)=-2$ and $y(1)=2$.
The numerical solution in the case $a=1/4$, $b=3/4$ and $\epsilon = 10^{-4}$ is shown below.
Based on this information, derive a first-term approximation of the solution for arbitrary $0<a<b<1$. I'll be more than happy if you just tell me/direct me on how to solve the problem for the particular case $a=1/4$, $b=3/4$. -EDIT- Looking at the graph and after skimming through a lot of books, I think there's an interior boundary layer at $x=1/4$ and another boundary layer at $x=1$. I found the outer solution, valid in $0 \leq x<1/4$, to be:
$$\tag{1} y_{\text{out}}=1 - 3 \left( \frac{3}{3-4x} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}} \sqrt{1-4x}$$ I still have to find/guess the boundary layer thickness at $x=1/4$ and compute an inner solution. Then, it somehow seems that this boundary layer will ""connect"" the outer solution (1) to the solution $y(x)=1$, which will then be connected to the boundary layer at $x=1$.
I'd appreciate any help/insight on how to proceed.","['asymptotics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'perturbation-theory', 'real-analysis']"

833132,Multiplicative inverse of $0$,"If I'm not mistaken, in a ring with identity, the additive identity cannot have a multiplicative inverse. I'm trying to prove this. Here's my attempt so far: Suppose $0\cdot a=1$
$$0\cdot a=1$$
$$0\cdot (a + n) = 0\cdot a + 0\cdot n$$ It's easy to see here that if $n$ were a positive integer (same works for negative):

$$0\cdot a + 0\cdot (1 + 1 + 1+\cdots )$$
$$0 \cdot a + 0 + 0 + 0 + \dots = 0\cdot a$$

If $a$ is some whole number of multiplicative inverses summed together, then this is a contradiction. This hinges on the assumption that $n$ is some integer multiple of the multiplicative unit, which it may not be. This also got me thinking about whether the distributivity of multiplication over addition is discretized in whole terms (you can only use operators with whole numbers of terms) or whether the concept of distrubitivity actually goes deeper than this.

833179,Covariant derivative in cylindrical coordinates,"I am confused by the Wolfram article on cylindrical coordinates .

833181,Green's function for $\frac{\partial}{\partial\bar{z}}$,"I've read some complex analysis texts and often there is some appeals to Green's theorems when proving facts about contour integrals of holomorphic functions yet there seems to be a lack of appeals to Green's functions (at least explicitly). We know that for a holomorphic function $f$, we have $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{z}} = 0$$ and also that $$f(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma} \frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\,d\zeta,$$ where $\gamma$ is a circular contour around $z$ (with a winding number of one). Given the duality between partial differential operators and integral operators, this has made me a bit curious as to what the Green's function for $\dfrac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}}$ is (when one restricts to holomorphic functions). Intuitively, I would hazard to guess that the Green's function is related to $\dfrac{1}{z}$ based on the above observations but I haven't figured out a way to show this. Solving $$\frac{\partial}{\partial\bar{z}}G = \delta(z)$$ for $G$ seems to be a bit of a tall task. Distributions seem to be a little bit complicated on $\mathbb{C}$.

833261,Need help understanding a certain vector integral identity (Stokes' theorem corollary),"The Vector Integral page on the Wolfram mathworld website lists as eq.(4) the following vector integral identity: If
  $$\mathbf{F}:=\mathbf{c}\,F,$$

  $$\int_{C}F\,ds=\int_{S}d\mathbf{a}\times\nabla\mathbf{F}.$$ It seems clear from context that $\mathbf{c}$ is supposed to be a constant vector, though the page doesn't explicitly list this as a condition. Try as I might, I can't wrap my head around this integral. In fact, it looks like patent nonsense to me, since on the LHS we have a scalar line integral (that is, the line-element $ds$ is a scalar) of a scalar field resulting in a scalar value, while the integral on the RHS looks to me like it must be a 2nd rank tensor.

Thus, rings with $1$ automatically must have commutative addition. So, are there interesting, necessarily non-unital, ""rings"" with noncommutative addition?

833434,Why is a straight line the shortest distance between two points?,"The first application I was shown of the calculus of variations was proving that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Define a functional measuring the length of a curve between two points:
$$
I(y) = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \sqrt{1 + (y')^2}\, dx,
$$
apply the Euler-Langrange equation, and Bob's your uncle. So far so good, but then I started thinking: That functional was derived by splitting the curve into (infinitesimal) - wait for it - straight lines, and summing them up their lengths, and each length was defined as being the Euclidean distance between its endpoints*. As such, it seems to me that the proof, while correct, is rather meaningless. It's an obvious consequence of the facts that (a) the Euclidean norm satisfies the triangle inequality and (b) the length of a curve was defined as a sum of Euclidean norms. Getting slightly philosophical, I would conjecture that proving that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line is looking at things the wrong way round. Perhaps a better way would be to say that Euclidean geometry was designed to conform to our sensory experience of the physical world: the length of string joining two points is minimized by stretching the string, and at that point, it happens to look/feel straight. I'm just wondering whether people would agree with this, and hoping that I may get some additional or deeper insights. Perhaps an interesting question to ask to try to go deeper would be: why does a stretched string look and feel straight ? *: To illustrate my point further, imagine we had chosen to define the length of a line as the Manhattan distance between its endpoints. We could integrate again, and this time it would turn out that the length of any curve between two points is the Manhattan distance between those points.","['geometry', 'calculus', 'soft-question']"

833471,Where does one use holomorphicity in the proof of Goursat's theorem?,"Goursat's theorem: Let $f : U \to \mathbb{C}$ be a function that is holomorphic on the open set $U$. If $T$ is a triangle in $U$ and $\gamma$ is some smooth parametrization of that triangle, then $\int_{\gamma} f = 0$. My question: Is this no longer true if I replace holomorphic with differentiable? The proof I am reading proceeds by dividing $T$ into quarter triangles, and arguing that the integral over $T$ must be bounded above by 4 times the integral of one of the quarter triangles. The argument proceeds by induction to show that this bound forces the integral over $T$ to vanish. There seems to be only one place where the assumption that $f$ is holomorphic is used - namely, we use it to write $f(z) = f(z_0) + f'(z_0)h + h \phi(h)$, with $h = (z - z_0)$ $\phi(h)$ converging to zero as $h \to 0$. Let $T^n$ be the $nth$ triangle chosen in the typical method of proof. $p^n$ denotes its perimeter, and $d^n$ the diameter. Supposing that $f$ was merely $R^2$ differentiable, I can create a similar expression: $f(z) = f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(h) + |h| \phi(h)$, and conclude that $\int_{T^n} f(z) =  \int_{T^n} (f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(h)) + \int_{T^n} (|h| \phi(h))$. I want to claim that  $(f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(h))$ has a primitive since it is the sum of a constant function and a linear function (however, I think that the constant part has no primitive, since it is a vector and not scalar, so it is not the derivitive of $""f(z_0) x""$ - this is wrong, see below), so that we are left with $\int_{T^n} f(z) = \int_{T^n} (|h| \phi(h)) \leq \sup (|h| \phi(h)) p^{(n)}$ ($p^n$ is the perimeter of $T^n$). Since $\sup |h| \phi(h) \leq d^n \sup \phi(h)$, it seems like the same exact proof goes through as in the holomorphic case.

To be specific, we consider two different cases: You can only switch people who are sitting next to each other. You can switch any two people, no matter where they are on the table. The small cases are relatively simple: if we denote the answer in case 1 and 2 for a given value of $n$ as $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ respectively, then we have $f(x)=g(x)=0$ for $x=1, 2, 3$, $f(4)=g(4)=1$.

833742,Finding a rational number which is simply normal to relatively prime bases,"Let $n\ge 2\in\mathbb Z$.

Now, when we represent a rational number $0\lt p\lt 1$ as a base-$n$-decimal $(0.a_1a_2a_3\cdots)_n$, let's consider the following condition. Condition : For every $0\le k\le n-1$, $$\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{|\{i|1\le i\le N,a_{i}=k\}|}{N}=\frac 1n.$$ I've been interested in finding a rational number $0\lt p\lt 1$ which satisfies the condition for a $n$. For example, we can see $p=2/3$ satisfies the condition for $n=2$ because it is $(0.\overline{10})_2$. However, finding a $p$ which satisfies the condition for two or more $n$ seems difficult. We can see $p=21/26$ satisfies the condition for $n=2,3$ because it is $(0.1\overline{100111011000})_2$ and $(0.\overline{210})_3.$ However, I cannot find any $p$ for two $n$ other than $n=2,3$. Then, here is my first question. Question 1 : Does there exist a rational number $0\lt p\lt 1$ which satisfies the condition for two $n$ other than $n=2,3$ where the two $n$ are relatively prime? In addition to this, the following questions seem very difficult. Question 2 : Does there exist a rational number $0\lt p\lt 1$ which satisfies the condition for three $n$ where any two of the three $n$ are relatively prime? Question 3 : Do there exist infinitely many rational numbers $0\lt p\lt 1$ which satisfy the condition for two $n$ where the two $n$ are relatively prime? How about the cases for three or more $n$? Can anyone help? Edit : As user level1807, who solved the question 1 and 2, points out, this is the question about the number which is simply normal to relatively prime bases. So, the question 3, which has not been solved yet, can be said as Question 3 : Do there exist infinitely many rational numbers $0\lt p\lt 1$ which are simply normal to two relatively prime bases?

Question: Express the area of ​​the intersection of the two disks with the distances $d$, $r_1$ and  $r_2$. My proof : I call $ A $ and $ B $ the points of intersection of the two disks  and $C$ is the intersection point of $d$ and $AB$ ($O_1C=x$). I selected a landmark $\mathcal R (O, \vec e_x , \vec e_y )$ such that $O_1$ is centered at $(0,0)$ and $(d, 0)$ for $O_2$ The equation of the two circles are $x^2+y^2=r_1^2$ and $(x-d)^2=y^2=r_2^2$.

834065,"Can a group have a subset that is stable under all automorphisms, but not under inverse?","The title really says it all. For any group $G$ the map $g\mapsto g^{-1}$ gives a (canonical) isomorphism from $G$ to the opposite group $G^\mathrm{op}$; this marks a difference with for instance non-commutative rings where the two might not be isomorphic. As a consequence there is for instance no fundamental difference between studying left and right group actions, even for a fixed group$~G$. So while groups cannot be in any manner ""naturally left-handed"", whatever that might be construed to mean, there is still the potential possibility of being able to point to some ""chiral"" subset of the group, a subset that might have some relation to the group without being in the same relation to the opposite group. It is quite evident that notions such as normaliser or centraliser applied to some (set of) elements will never yield such subset; indeed anything that is a subgroup will not do because it is closed under inverse. Which brought me to my question: Can a group $G$ have a subset closed under the action of $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$, but not under the map $g\mapsto g^{-1}$? Since one has in particular the inner automorphisms, one need only consider unions of conjugacy classes. I can see no reason why this should be impossible, but it is also hard to construct an example. For Abelian groups $g\mapsto g^{-1}$ is an automorphism, so no luck here On the other hand most symmetric groups have trivial outer automorphism groups; however here every $g$ is conjugate to $g^{-1}$, no luck either In alternating groups a conjugacy class of $S_n$ might fall apart, an an element might not be conjugate to its inverse; the two conjugacy classes would still however be related by an outer automorphism (coming from $S_n$) In $GL(n,K)$ most elements are not conjugate to their inverse; however there is an obvious out automorphism of transpose-inverse, and every invertible matrix is similar to its transpose (due to the theory of f.g. modules over a PID, leading to classification of similarity by invariant factors). Most ""natural"" subgroups of $GL(n,K)$ would suffer from the same ""outer automorphism"" phenomenon as alternating groups do, so they do not look promising. That's where I am now; I unfortunately do not know a lot of examples where I know enough to easily see whether I can find such subsets. Maybe a good candidate is the general linear group over a skew field (division ring), since the result of similarity to one's transpose does not hold there, as far as I know. But I don't know enough about automorphisms of these groups to known whether they are good candidates.",['group-theory']

representing a continuous ""object"" as a collection of points is
inherently contrived (with a negative connotation). Immediately we
run into the paradox that a point has no volume, and yet a collection
of many points has volume. The notion of Lebesgue measure attempts to resolve this essential
tension by allowing only countable additivity of the measure.  But it
does so only by disallowing certain operations (uncountable sums)
that intuitively seem reasonable. As such, it is an indispensable
tool, but it remains contrived on some level. My friend countered by saying that uncountable additivity doesn't really make sense anyway, since any uncountable sum that converges must have co-countably many terms zero. I would say I am still on the fence about this discussion. He makes a good point, but after all, it is exactly the addition of uncountably many zeros that I am concerned with, so the notion that co-countably many of the terms must be zero may not be a decisive objection.","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'soft-question']"

834250,Continuity of sin(1/x),"I'm dealing with the continuity of $\sin(\frac{1}{x})$.
I think that I have a proof but I'm not sure if it's right!
Here is my proof: We take the functions $g(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ and $h(x)=\sin(x)$, now we see that: $g(x)$ is continuous in the open interval $(-\infty,0) \cup (0,\infty)$ because it's defined for every $x \in R$ except in $x=0$.
On the other hand $h(x)$ is continuous all over reals. So it's also continuous in $(-\infty,0) \cup (0,\infty)$, then by the fact that the composition of two continuous functions is continuous  we conclude  $(hog)(x)=h(g(x))=\sin(\frac{1}{x})$ is also continuous in $(-\infty,0) \cup (0,\infty)$, so it's continuous all over reals except in $x=0$. Am I right?! I'm not interested in other proofs because I have seen them, but I want to know if this is right! Thanks!",['analysis']
834279,"Ahlfors' extension of Riemann mapping function, proof clarification","In the Ahlfors' Complex Analysis chapter about the Riemann Mapping Theorem section 6.1.3, page 233, he states and proves this theorem: Theorem 3. Suppose that the boundary of a simply connected region $\Omega$ contains a line segment $\gamma$ as a one-sided free boundary arc. Then the [Riemann mapping] function $f(z)$ which maps $\Omega$ onto the unit disk can be extended to a function which is analytic and one-to-one on $\Omega \cup \gamma$. The image of $\gamma$ is an arc $\gamma'$ on the unit circle. In this particular context by ""free boundary arc"" he means an open interval $a < x < b$ of the real line. I understand the proof of the existence of the extension: use the version of Schwarz reflection which only requires continuity of $\text{Re} \log f(z)$ at the boundary. What I don't understand is his argument that $f$ is injective on $\gamma$. Here's how it goes: We note further that $f'(z) \ne 0$ on $\gamma$. Indeed, $f'(x_0) = 0$ wold imply that $f(x_0)$ were a multiple value, in which case the two subarcs of $\gamma$ that meet at $x_0$ would be mapped on arcs that form an angle $\pi/n$ with $n \ge 2$; this is clearly impossible. If, for instance, the upper half disks are in $\Omega$, then
  $$\partial \log |f| / \partial y = - \ \partial \arg f / \partial x < 0$$
  on $\gamma$, and $\arg f$ moves constantly in the same direction. This proves that the mapping is one-to-one on $\gamma$. My attempt to clarify: In order to show that $f'(x_0)$ is not zero, I figured that if it were, we could factor $f(z)-f(x_0) = [(z-x_0)g(z)]^n$ where $g(x_0) \ne 0$. I think if you pick the right arc in the domain $\Omega \cup \gamma$, the image of that arc contains a point outside the closed unit disk. Even if $f'(x) \ne 0$ on $\gamma$, I still don't see why the image of $\gamma$ can't ""wrap all the way around the circle"" and come back to the same point, and so be locally injective without being globally one-to-one. Any help is greatly appreciated.",['complex-analysis']
834288,Find all $3\times3$ square matrices which commute with any $3\times3$ upper triangular matrix. [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : A linear operator commuting with all such operators is a scalar multiple of the identity. (10 answers) Closed 6 years ago . I'm not sure how to proceed. Let us find all possible solutions for the matrix $A$ which commutes with any other matrix $X$. In other words: $$AX=XA$$ Stating the matrix multiplication explicitly we can conclude that for any $i,j\in\{1,2,3\}$: $$\sum_{n=1}^3 A_{i,n} X_{n,j} = \sum_{n=1}^3 X_{i,n} A_{n,j}$$ At this point I do not know what to do anymore.

834312,Strange definition of Ergodicity,"In an engineering course, a stationary process was defined to be ergodic if for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and for any bounded (measurable) function of $k+1$ variables we have $$\lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N g(X_n,\dots,X_{n+k})\overset{\text{a.s}}{=}Eg(X_n,\dots,X_{n+k})$$
From the little I've read about ergodic theory, this does not seem familiar, nor does it seem to fit into the ergodic hierarchy I know, i.e ergodic, weak mixing, strong mixing etc.
It seems like a different property than ergodicity in the sense of the Birkhoff ergodic theorem. Here the boundedness of $g$ means the property would be equivalent only for indicator $g$'s (because of DCT I think). On the other hand, any $k$-tuple of $X_i$'s is allowed..
Also, is there an insightful bit of intuition for this property as there are for normal ergodicity, and mixing? Thanks in advance!","['probability-theory', 'ergodic-theory']"
834321,Is there a simpler/better proof of this simple trigonometric property?,"The sine function has the following nice property : for any
$x,y$, we have $\sin(x)+\sin(y)=\sin(x+y)$ iff at least one of
$x,y,x+y$ is $0$ modulo $2\pi$. I sketch below my current proof of it, which I find somewhat 
unsatisfying. Does anyone know a better proof ? Let $\xi=\sin(x)$ and $\eta=\sin(y)$. Then 
$\sin(x+y)=\xi\cos(y)+\eta\cos(x)$, so $$
\begin{array}{lcl}
\sin^2(x+y)&=&\xi^2(1-\eta^2)+\eta^2(1-\xi^2)+2\xi\eta\cos(x)\cos(y) \\
&=& \xi^2+\eta^2-2\eta^2\xi^2+2\xi\eta\cos(x)\cos(y)
\end{array} \tag{1}$$ Whence $$
\big(\sin^2(x+y)-(\xi^2+\eta^2-2\eta^2\xi^2)\big)^2=
4(\xi\eta)^2(1-\xi^2)(1-\eta^2) \tag{2}
$$ If $\sin(x)+\sin(y)=\sin(x+y)$, it follows then that $A(\xi,\eta)=0$
where $$
\begin{array}{lcl}
A(\xi,\eta)&=&\big((\xi+\eta)^2-(\xi^2+\eta^2-2\eta^2\xi^2)\big)^2-
4(\xi\eta)^2(1-\xi^2)(1-\eta^2) \\
&=& \big(2\xi\eta-2\eta^2\xi^2\big)^2-
4(\xi\eta)^2(1-\xi^2)(1-\eta^2) \\
&=& \big(2\xi\eta\big(1-\eta\xi\big)\big)^2-
4(\xi\eta)^2(1-\xi^2)(1-\eta^2) \\
&=& 4(\xi\eta)^2 \Bigg(\big(1-\eta\xi\big)^2-(1-\xi^2)(1-\eta^2) \Bigg) \\
&=& 4(\xi\eta)^2 \Bigg(\big(1-2\eta\xi+\eta^2\xi^2\big)-\big(1-\xi^2-\eta^2+\eta^2\xi^2\big) \Bigg) \\
&=& 4(\xi\eta)^2 \big(\xi-\eta\big)^2 \\
\end{array} \tag{3}$$ So one of $\xi,\eta,\xi-\eta$ must be zero. A little more case analysis then shows
that in the end one of $x,y,x+y$ must be
zero modulo $2\pi$ as wished.",['trigonometry']
