188933,Why do we need to learn integration techniques?,"After a lifetime of approaching math the wrong way, I took two college math courses this quarter with a newfound zest for math.  These classes are integral calc and multivariable calc. Integral calc started out okay, learning about Riemann sums and the Fundamental Theorem of calculus.  But instead of spending a great deal of time gaining the intuition behind these things, we jumped into integration technique after integration technique. Why on EARTH would we need to memorize and regurgitate a bunch of integration methods on toy problems for 6 weeks?  It's absolutely bizarre.  I'm not taking this at some random JC either, this is at a top research university.  This class is single-handedly destroying my enthusiasm for calculus. When we have software that can do much more difficult integrals than we can with pencil and paper, why would we waste time memorizing Trig substitutions or integration by partial sums?  Doesn't that just make it a glorified algebra class?","['education', 'calculus', 'integration', 'soft-question']"
188938,"Why do hyperbolic ""trig"" functions seem to be encountered rarely?","Hyperbolic ""trig"" functions such as $\sinh$, $\cosh$, have close analogies with regular trig functions such as $\sin$ and $\cos$. Yet the hyperbolic versions seem to be encountered relatively rarely. (My frame of reference is that of someone with college freshman/sophomore, but not advanced math.) Why is that? Is it because the hyperbolic versions of these functions are less common/useful than the circular versions? Can you do the ""usual"" applications (Taylor series, Fourier series) with hyperbolic functions as you can with trigonometric? I'm not a professional mathematician. I've had three semesters of calculus and one of linear algebra/differential equations, and ""barely"" know about hyperbolic functions. The question is with that frame of reference.",['trigonometry']
188963,"""Cut"" (hexagon-like) Reuleaux triangle area","Let me start by giving the reason my question: as part of a 3D printer I'm building ( Rostock ), I'm trying to figure out the work area of the printer. The printer consists of 3 arms, each attached at the points of an equilateral triangle. Each arm can rotate in every direction in front of its attachment point, so the reachable area of each arm is a half circle. The work area of the printer is the intersection of each of these half circles. My question is: how does one calculate the area of the ""cut"" (hexagon-like) Reuleaux triangle that appears once the length of the arms becomes longer than the distance between the points of the equilateral triangle? I realize this might be quite vague, so I've attached two pictures. In the first, the arm reach is short and the intersection is a Reuleaux triangle. In the second, the arms are longer and the ""cut"" (hexagon-like) Reuleaux triangle appears. It's the area of this shape that I'm trying to calculate.

188972,Why complete measure spaces? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Why do we essentially need complete measure space? (5 answers) Closed 9 years ago . This is a longstanding confusion of mine without a clear answer. Why do we complete measure spaces? Certainly, it is nice to have the property that if some set is of measure zero, then a smaller set also should be so. However, when I looked up the mathematical literature, I am unable to find a single theorem that works better for complete measures. So, the only reasons in support of completing the measure seem to be: 1)., it agrees with our intuition of what can be neglected, 2)., the Caratheodory extension process automatically gives a complete measure. I was also surprised to realize that in probablity theory, very little use is made of the Lebesgue $\sigma$-algebra. Almost always the Borel $\sigma$-algebra is used. This prominence of Borel $\sigma$-algebras also seems to be the case in ergodic theory, where one considers for instance the space of all probability measures on a given measurable space(usually equipped with a Borel $\sigma$-algebra), and the null sets might differ from one measure to other(for example, consider Dirac measures concentrated at different points). So, what are some better mathematical reasons to argue for complete measures? Are there some theorems that I do not know, which are true only for complete measures? There ought to be some, to give credence to all W. Rudin's going-on about the process of completing a measure being as significant in analysis, if not more than, the process of completing the rationals into the real numbers. One can readily find a number of theorems in analysis that would break without the least upper bound property of real numbers. Such does not seem to be the case with completing the measure space, with a superficial look.",['measure-theory']

189036,Kelly criterion for multiple gambles,"Kelly says you should invest $x\%$ of your bankroll in a gamble: $$x = \frac{pE-1}{p-1}$$ where $p$ is the probability of winning and $E$ is the expected payoff multiplier if you win (i.e. $E$ times how much you bet). But lets say you have two options to invest in: One that has high risk and high payoff potential and another one that's absolutely safe, but only pays very little (e.g., FDIC insured bank account). Is there a formula for this case? I was thinking to subtract the yield of the absolutely safe instrument from the expected payoff of the high risk venture and then just using the formula above. EDIT: I found the formula: [pE-(1+r)]/[E-(1+r)] where r is the interest rate",['probability']
189046,A couple of asymptotics exercises,"Recently I've been following the chapter on asymptotics in Concrete Mathematics . The subject matter of it is relatively new to me though and I'm having some difficulties dealing with asymptotic quantities, as I'm still trying to sort out the fundamentals. What follows are a few sample exercises from the aforementioned book and my attempts at solving them: 9.2 Which function grows faster: $n^{\ln n}$ or $(\ln n)^n$ $n^{\ln \ln \ln n}$ or $(\ln n)!$ $(n!)!$ or $((n-1)!)!(n-1)!^{n!}$ $F^2_{\lceil H_n \rceil}$ or $H_{F_n}$ (here $F_n$ denotes the $n$th element of the Fibonacci sequence, while $H_n$ is the $n$th harmonic number) In order to formally justify that either function is little-$o$ of the other one, I'd show that their quotient converges to $0$ as $n$ approaches $\infty$. This has let me prove that $n^{\ln n} = e^{(\ln n)^2} \prec e^{n \ln c} $
$\prec e^{n \ln\ln n} $
$= (\ln n)^n$. I don't know how to approach the other pairs of functions though. Those involving the Pi function (I don't have any experience in dealing with it) or sequences don't seem to be as straightforward as the first example. 9.13 Evaluate $(n + 2 + O(n^{-1}))^n$ with relative error $O(n^{-1})$. Ok, so I'm working towards expressing the formula in the form $f(n)(1 + O(n^{-1}))$. \begin{equation} \begin{split}
(n + 2 + O(n^{-1})) &= (n(1 + 2n^{-1} + O(n^{-2})))^n = n^n(1 + 2n^{-1} + O(n^{-2}))^n \\
&= n^n \exp(n(\ln(1 + 2n^{-1} + O(n^{-2}))) \\
&= n^n \exp(n(2n^{-1} + O(n^{-2}))) \hspace{12pt} \text{// by the $ln(1+z)$ approx.}\\
&= n^n \exp(2 + O(n^{-1}))) = n^n e^2 e^{O(n^{-1})} \\
&= n^n e^2 (1 + O(n^{-1})) \hspace{12pt} \text{// by the $e^x$ approx.}
\end{split} \end{equation} Are all these transformations legal and correct? From what I know, we can apply an asymptotic expansion (as in $\ln(1 + z)$ in this case) when $z \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Am I right in concluding, that an approximated expression with the absolute error that doesn't converge to $0$ cannot be expanded this way (e.g. $ln(1 + n^{-1} + O(n))$)? 9.14 Prove that $(n + a)^{n + b} = n^{n + b}e^{a}(1 + a(b - \dfrac{a}{2})n^{-1} + O(n^{-2}))$. I transform the LHS so as to make it easier to compare with what we have on the RHS. \begin{equation} \begin{split}
(n+a)^{n+b} &= (n(1 + \dfrac{a}{n}))^{n+b} = n^{n+b}(1 + \dfrac{a}{n})^{n+b} = n^{n+b} \exp((n+b) \ln(1 + \dfrac{a}{n})) \\
&= n^{n+b}exp((n+b)(\dfrac{a}{n} - \dfrac{a^2}{2n^2} + O((n^{-3}))) \hspace{12pt} \text{// by the $ln(1+z)$ approx.} \\
&= n^{n+b} \exp(a - \dfrac{a^2}{2n} + O(n^{-2}) + \dfrac{ab}{n} - \dfrac{a^2b}{2n^2} + O(n^{-3})) \\
&= n^{n+b} e^a \exp(\dfrac{-a^2}{2n} + \dfrac{ab}{n} - \dfrac{a^2b}{2n^2} + O(n^{-2}))\\
&= \ldots
\end{split} \end{equation} (First I'd like to make sure that the step from the 3rd to the 4th line is formally correct - is it enough to say that $O(n^{-3}) \subset O(n^{-2})$)? Anyway, I don't really know how to move from here. One attempt would be to use the $e^z$ expansion, but the result doesn't look very nice. Or I have made a mistake I can't yet see. It looks like I've written a pretty long post. :) I know some of my questions may sound trivial (or there may be some basic mistakes above), but I'm trying to make head and tail of that whole asymptotics and need a little assistance :)","['asymptotics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

189134,an injective immersion between two compact manifold of same dimension,"$f:M\rightarrow N$ be a injective immersion, where $M$ and $N$ are same dimensional manifold with out boundary, we need to show $f$ is a covering map. what I tried is, $df_x:T_x(M)\rightarrow T_{f(x)}(N)$ is injective and as $M$ and $N$ has the same dimension the map is isomorphism of vector spaces.Hence $f$ is surjective submersion also. So every point of $M$ is a regular value for $f$, now as $M$ is compact $f^{-1}(y)$ is finite, ingeneral I guess $f$ will become a proper map right?
Now take any neighborhood $U$,of $y$, can I just say that $f^{-1}(U)$ is disjoint union of neighborhoods around the points $x_1,\dots,x_k$ where $f^{-1}(y)=\{x_1,\dots,x_k\}$? and $f$ maps homeomorphically those neighborhoods onot $U$?

Note that most of the generators are binomials - and there exists effective (or at least, more effective) algorithms for decomposing binomial ideals. Is this possible to use somehow? So how did this ideal come about? Well, it all started with a triangulated simplicial 3-sphere, which give rise to a monomial ideal. (Specifially, $x_1\cdots x_n$ is in the ideal iff $x_1\cdots x_n$ is not a face of the sphere) Then we try to perturb this ideal and look at the deformation space. Now, there are results saying that smoothings (in the sense of deformation theory) of the sphere give rise to interesting varieties, for example Calabi-Yau varieties. In my case, we know there's a deformation to the Grassmannian $G(3,6)$ . Anyways - I used a Macaulay2 package by Nathan Ilten to start computing the deformation space. The large ideal above consists of the initial terms of the generators of this space (so I guess this is in some sense the tangent space). What I'm looking for is a yes/no-answer whether this is a feasible task, and if so, what strategies I may use.","['commutative-algebra', 'ideals', 'algebraic-geometry', 'macaulay2']"
189223,Asymmetric Normal Probability Distribution,"I'm looking for a continuous probability distribution a little bit like the normal distribution but asymmetric.
In my opinion this distribution applies to phenomenons related to response time in environments marked by resource contention. Examples I have in mind are: In real life : the time it takes for my bus to go from my home to my office in the morning. In average it's around 15 minutes. However the way this duration varies each side of the mean value is asymmetric: it can hardly be 10 minutes less than the average but can easily take 10 minutes more. In computer capacity planning (which is the real domain where I want to use it ;-).  One transaction needs to take place in 5 seconds (average) but my QoS constraint is that 90% of the time it takes less than 15 seconds. Here is a diagram to illustrate my ideal distribution. In this last example I could approximate the distribution to a Gaussian distribution and decide that 90% is roughly equivalent to a 1.5 standard deviation. However I'm curious to know whether there is probability distribution more adapted to my problem. The end goal is to deduce what percentage of my resources should be free (e.g. each CPU core should in average be at least 50% free, disk controllers bandwidth should be 50% free, etc) in order to satisfy the 90% threshold constraints. Edit I'm adding more information here because I'm not convinced that the Log-Normal distribution fits the bill. Going back to the example of my Bus journey, there is a minimum travel time which depends on propagation law limits (dictated by highway code or physics). Similarly in a computer system, when my request runs unhampered by concurrent usage of the available physical resource, one can probably observe consistently close response times.  I term this minimum latency and I ascribe the variations above this minimum latency time to other concurrent requests in real life. The important thing here is that when contention increases, mean, median and mode values all increase when $\sigma$ increases. Here is another diagram to illustrate what I mean. So it looks like the Rayleigh distribution seems closer to what I need.  However it also looks like it lacks some kind of ""$\mu$"" parameter since I have three sizing conditions to satisfy: average response time: 5s . In the CDF when the cumulated probability = 0.9 then the response time is 15s .","['normal-distribution', 'probability']"

Now, I have to restart Buchberger's algorithm because I have changed the ideal representation and compute $S(f_1',f_2'), S(f_1',f_3') \dots$. Usually $\langle f_1',f_2',f_3' \rangle$ is a valid Gröber basis already. But to compute the three (or more) S-Polynomials takes a lot of time. Is there are a  (fast computable) criteria to check whether a given basis is already a Gröbner-Basis and to abort the computation?","['groebner-basis', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

189287,Proof for Heine Borel theorem,"I am trying to prove the Heine Borel theorem for compactness of the closed interval $[0,1]$ using Konig's lemma . This is what I have so far: I assume $[0,1]$ can be covered by $\{(a_i,b_i):i=0,1,2\cdots\}$. I construct a graph $G$ as follows: First let a vertex be labelled $[0,1]$ (the root). Then consider $[0,1]-(a_0,b_0)\cup(a_1,b_1)$. This consists of $n_1$ closed intervals where $n_1$ is finite. Adjoin the $[0,1]$ vertex with $n_1$ vertices labelled by these closed intervals (these vertices will be at level 1). Next consider $[0,1]-(a_0,b_0)\cup(a_1,b_1)\cup(a_2,b_2)$. This consists of $n_2$ closed intervals. Each of these closed intervals is a subset of exactly one the closed intervals considered in the previous step. Make $n_2$ vertices labelled by these closed intervals and adjoin them to that vertex created in the previous step of which it is a subset of (these vertices will be at level 2). Continue doing so for higher levels, each time obtaining the labels by considering the closed interval obtained from $[0,1]-(a_0,b_0)\cup(a_1,b_1)\cdots \cup(a_i,b_i)$. This yields a rooted tree $G$ where each level is finite. Suppose the tree contained an infinite path: $[0,1]\supset[\alpha_1,\beta_1]\supset[\alpha_2,\beta_2]\cdots$. Since a sequence of nested closed intervals is nonempty so there is an element $x$ in it. As $x\in [0,1]$ so $x\in(a_i,b_i)$ for some $i$. But then $x$ cannot exist in any interval which is at a level beyond $i$, yielding a contradiction to 4. So by the contrapositive form of Konig's lemma, $G$ cannot be infinite. It follows that for some $i$, $[0,1]-(a_0,b_0)\cup(a_1,b_1)\cdots \cup(a_i,b_i)$ is empty. Hence $[0,1]$ is covered by $(a_0,b_0)\cup(a_1,b_1)\cdots \cup(a_i,b_i)$.

189411,Localization at a point - an exercise,"I'm trying to practice with localization of rings. In particular, I want to determine the generator t of the principal maximal ideal of the localization of the coordinate ring of a curve at a point. Let's say I have a curve C given by $y^2=(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$. The coordinate ring of C is $k[C]=k[x,y]/( y^2-(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) )$ I want to localize $k[C]$ at say $p=(1,0)$. I'd like to determine $t$, so I'm thinking I should know how $k[C]_p$ looks like explicitly. This is where I'm stuck. I'd appreciate someone showing me how this is done. The curve $C$ has a point at infinity $p=[1:0:0]$. Why is $p$ the point at infinity? I think I don't understand this concept with respect to curves. For $p=[1:0:0]$, I want to determine the generator of the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_p$ in the localization $k[C]_p$. So, I'll have to do this in the affine chart that contains $p$. So, the chart will be $U=\{\,[1,y,z]\, |\, y,z\in k\,\}\cong\{\,(y,z)\,|\,y,z\in k\,\}=\mathbb{A}^2$. In this chart, the curve is given by the equation: $y^2=z(1-z)(1-2z)(1-3z)$ Then what? I'm thinking to localize $k[C]$ at the point $(0,0)$ because it corresponds to $p$. So $(0,0)$ corresponds to the maximal ideal $(y,z)$ in $k[C]$, also the maximal ideal in $k[C]_p$ is $\mathfrak{m}_p=(y,z)$. Now, $(1-z)(1-2z)(1-3z)\notin (y,z)$ which means that $(1-z)(1-2z)(1-3z)$ is a unit $u$ in  $k[C]_p$. We write $y^2=uz$ which means that $z=u^{-1}y^2$. This shows that $z\in(y)$, and we conclude that $(y,z)=(y)$. I think this is correct, but I doubt it.

189430,What is the relationship between Mackey's theorem in character theory and Mackey's theorem in transfer theory?,"Here are the statements of the two theorems.  The first statement I took from a paper I have been reading, but I believe can also be found in Isaacs' Character Theory of Finite Groups as an exercise.  The second comes directly from Isaacs' Finite Group Theory . For both statements, let $X$ be a set of representatives for the $(H,K)$ -double cosets in a group $G$ , where $H$ and $K$ are subgroups and $G$ is finite. Mackey's Theorem :  Let $\theta$ and $\varphi$ be characters of $H$ and $K$ , respectively.  Then $$\langle \theta^G, \varphi^G\rangle = \sum_{x \in X}\langle (\theta^x)_{H^x\cap K},\varphi_{H^x\cap K}\rangle.$$ Mackey Transfer: Let $\Lambda:G\rightarrow H$ be a pretransfer map, and for each element $x\in X$ , let $W_x:K\rightarrow H^x\cap K$ be a pretransfer map.  Then for $k \in K$ , we have $$\Lambda(k)\equiv \prod_{x \in X} x W_x(k) x^{-1} \mod{H'}.$$ Here, a ""pretransfer map"" $\lambda:A\rightarrow B$ refers to a map whose image in the abelianization of $B$ is the transfer homomorphism from $A$ to $B/B'$ .  The map is given by $\lambda(a)=\prod_{t \in T}ta(t\cdot a)^{-1}$ , where $T$ is a right transversal of $B$ in $A$ and $t\cdot a$ is the representative in $T$ for the coset $H(ta)$ .  This is how Isaacs defines the transfer homomorphism in his book (after which he proves the transfer independent of the choice and order of transversal in the pretransfer). My question is, how are these two theorems related? This post on MO gives a representation theoretic interpretation of the transfer, so it seems like the first theorem ought to be a stronger version of the second (but I cannot prove it).  If this is true, can Mackey transfer be used to talk about irreducibility of induced characters?

Let $X$ be a normed vector space. If $K$ is convex, is it necessarily true that ""$K$ absorbing $\implies$ $0 \in \mathrm{Int }K$""? If $X$ is only assumed to be a normed space (not Banach), then I think $X = L^1[0,1]\cap L^\infty[0,1]$ equipped with the $L^1$-norm, and $K = \{f\in X\mid \Vert f\Vert_\infty \le 1\}$ gives a counterexample. $K$ is clearly absorbing and convex, but we can find a sequence $f_n \in X$ with $\Vert f_n\Vert_1 = 1/n \to 0$ and $\Vert f_n\Vert_{\infty} = 2$ for all $n$. So no ball around $0$ can be contained in $K$. I also tried to find a counter-example, where $X$ is Banach. This seemed much more difficult. I could so far only find a counter-example under the assumption of the existence of a non-continuous linear functional: If $f$ is such a functional on $X$, set $K = \{x\in X\mid  |f(x)|\le 1\}$. Then $K$ is convex and absorbing, but $\mathrm{Int }K = \emptyset$. This leads to the question, whether the axiom of choice is necessary to construct a counter-example on Banach spaces or not.

But this ""trick"" reminded me of the well known pseudoparadox we could obtain manipulating divergent series as for example the Bolzano's $$1-1+1-1+1-1+...$$ that setting $S=1-1+1-1+1-1+...$ become $$S=1-1+1-1+1-1+...=1-(1-1+1-1+1-1+...)=1-S$$ and therefore $1-1+1-1+1-1+...=S=1/2$. Obviously the error is in assuming that this series has a precise value, naming it $S$. We obtain other oddities by generalizing the equations above so that $a=\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x+...}}}}$ would imply $x=a(a-1)$, $a=\frac{1}{x+\frac{1}{x+...}}$ would imply $x=\frac{1}{a}-a$ and $a=x^{x^{x^{...}}}$ would imply $x=a^{\frac{1}{a}}$, that would be quite strange identities for lots of values of $a$.

189553,Arc length formula for the lemniscate,"This question can be homework for elementary calculus. The lemniscate of Bernoulli $C$ is a plane curve defined as follows. Let $a > 0$ be a real number.
Let $F_1 = (a, 0)$ and $F_2 = (-a, 0)$ be two points of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $C = \{P \in \mathbb{R}^2; PF_1\cdot PF_2 = a^2\}$. Let's get the equation of $C$ in the polar coordinates. Let $P = (r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta)$: $$PF_1^2 = r^2 + a^2 - 2ar\cos\theta, PF_2^2 = r^2 + a^2 + 2ar\cos\theta$$

If we also observe a fraction $F=a/b$ where $a,b$ are positive real numbers,  the value of $F$ increases with the decrements of $b$. Being $0$ the least non-negative integer, if $b$ tends $0$ then $F$ tends to $\infty$ which is greater than all finite numbers.

If we equate each point with a unit square with its bottom left corner exactly in that point, then the cardinality of $A$ equals $\lfloor \pi n /4\rfloor = \pi n /4 + O(1)$ plus the number of squares intersecting the perimeter. Here I don't know how to justify that the number of ""extra"" squares is $O(\sqrt{n})$. (Any idea?) My point though is that I suspect problems of this kind can be solved by a more general method involving either the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula \[ \sum_{k=a}^{b-1} f(k) = \int_a^b f(x) dx - \dfrac{1}{2} f(x) \bigg|_a^b + \int_a^bB_1(x \bmod 1)f'(x)dx\] or the estimation that holds for a non-negative function $f$ that is weakly increasing (decreasing) over an interval of $\langle a-1, b+1 \rangle$: \[ \int_{a-1}^b f \leq (\geq) \sum_{k=a}^b f(k) \leq (\geq)\int_a^{b+1} f.\] If the given set didn't have such a simple geometric interpretation (yet we could describe it with a functional (in-)equation), the knowledge of how to apply the aforementioned methods would be of much use. I have seen hardly any examples with these methods in action though and I'm having some difficulties applying any of them here. I'd be grateful for a complete , step-by-step derivation of the estimation of the cardinality of $A$ using this general approach. It will be much appreciated if you could also show me the extension of these methods to 3-dimensional space. Recently I have come across a similar problem - the task is to estimate \[ |\lbrace \langle a, b, c \rangle \in \mathbb{N_+^3} : abc \leq n \rbrace| \] with the relative error $o(1)$ (in another thread on SE). The margin of error seems to be the killing part, so a less accurate estimation (although revealing the application of the methods above) is fine as well.","['asymptotics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Also described as: ""closure of $\mathcal{O}$ in $X$ equals $X$"". Question 1 : $X$ is closed in Zariski topology in $A^n$. But since we are looking at the induced topology by $X$, does it mean the whole space is $X$ and hence $X$ is now both closed and open set? Part of my proof for $a\implies b$: Open sets in $A^n$ are given as $\mathcal{O_i}=A^n\backslash V(I_i)$ for some ideal $I_i$. $X$ is an algebraic set $\implies X=V(I_x)$ and $X$ is closed.

I noticed that $A^n\backslash V(I_i)$ is an open set while $V(I_x)$ is closed. Why is $V(I_x)\backslash V(I_i)$ not a closed set? (The question says $\mathcal{O}_i$ is an open set) Question 3 :

This is well defined because for any such two interpolating polynomials $p$ and $q$ we have $p(A) = q(A)$ and such a polynomial always exists. We can also find a polynomial $p$ which has degree less than the minimal polynomial $m$. Also, then there exist linearly independent matrices $Z_{ij}$ such that for any $f$ defined at $f(\lambda_k), f'(\lambda_k), \ldots, f^{(m_k - 1)}(\lambda_k)$ for all $k$, we have $$f(A) = \sum_{k = 1}^{s} ( f(\lambda_k)Z_{k0} + f'(\lambda_k)Z_{k1} + \ldots + f^{(m_k - 1)}(\lambda_k)Z_{k, m_k - 1})$$ Okay, with the definitions and such out of the way here's the actual question..

According to the statement of Grothendieck-Serre duality in Hida's book Geometric Modular Forms and Elliptic Curves, there should be a canonical isomorphism $\underline{\omega}_{E/S}\cong\mathcal{Hom}_{\mathscr{O}_S}(R^1f_*\mathscr{O}_E,\mathscr{O}_S)$, and the first result on elliptic curves in this book is that $R^1f_*\mathscr{O}_E\cong\mathscr{O}_S$.

I can't find another reference with a statement of Grothendieck-Serre duality in this generality which does not use the language of derived categories (which I unfortunately don't understand). The reason I'm kind of skeptical about this is that in Hida's book, as well as in Katz-Mazur, it is said that $\underline{\omega}_{E/S}$ is invertible, so that an $\mathscr{O}_S$-basis $\omega$ for $\underline{\omega}_{E/S}$ can be found locally on $S$. If the invertible sheaf in question were really trivial then one would be able to choose a global $\mathscr{O}_S$-basis for $\underline{\omega}_{E/S}$, and there would be no reason to talk about doing so locally. Hida goes on to say that, choosing an $\mathscr{O}_S$-basis $\omega$ locally on $S$ allows one to regard $(\Omega_{E/S}^1,\omega)$ as a relative effective Cartier divisor in $E/S$, which also doesn't make complete sense to me because if we can only find $\omega$ locally, how are we getting a global section $\omega\in H^0(E,\Omega_{E/S}^1)=H^0(S,\underline{\omega}_{E/S})$ (unless $\underline{\omega}_{E/S}$ really is trivial)?","['algebraic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves']"

Then the equation of $C$ in the polar coordinates is: $r^2 = 2a^2\cos 2\theta$ Let $P$ be a point of $C$ in the first quadrant.
Let $u$ be the arc length between $O = (0, 0)$ and $P$. Then, by this question ,
$u = \int_{0}^{r} \frac{2a^2dr}{\sqrt{4a^4 - r^4}}$ Let $2a^2 = 1$ and $x = r$. Then
$u = \int_{0}^{x} \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 - x^4}}$ $u = u(x)$ is defined in $0 \le x \le 1$.
However, the above integral can be defined on $[-1, 1]$.
So we extend the domain of $u(x)$ to $[-1, 1]$ by the above integral.
Since $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^4}}$ is invariant under the substitution $x \rightarrow -x$,
$u(-x) = -u(x)$ for every $x \in [-1, 1]$. Since $u'(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^4}} > 0$ on $(-1, 1)$, $u(x)$ is strctly increasing on $[-1, 1]$.
Hence there exists the inverse function of $u(x)$. We denote the inverse function of $u(x)$ by $s(u)$. We call $s(u)$ lemniscate sine.
Since arcsin $x = \int_{0}^{x} \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}$, $s(u)$ is analogous to $\sin u$. We denote $u(1) = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 - x^4}}$ by $\omega$.
$s(u)$ is defined on $[-\omega, \omega]$.
$\omega$ corresponds to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in the analogy of $s(u)$ with $\sin u$. Since $u(-x) = -u(x)$, $s(-u) = -s(u)$ We define a function $c(u)$ by $c(u) = s(\omega - u)$ and call it lemniscate cosine.
$c(u)$ is defined on $[0, 2\omega]$. Pursuing the analogy with $\sin u$ and being motivated by this question , we consider the following total differential equation. $$\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 - x^4}} + \frac{dy}{\sqrt{1 - y^4}} = 0$$ Let $u = \int_{0}^{x}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 - x^4}}$
Then $x = s(u)$ Let $v = \int_{0}^{y}\frac{dy}{\sqrt{1 - y^4}}$
Then $y = s(v)$ Let $c$ be a constant.
Then $u + v = c$ is a solution of this equation.
Then we get $$s(u + v) = \frac{x\sqrt{1 - y^4} + y\sqrt{1 - x^4}}{1 + x^2y^2}$$ Substituting $u = \omega$, $v = -u$, we get $x = s(\omega) = 1, y = s(-u) = -s(u)$. Hence $s(\omega - u) = \frac{\sqrt{1 - y^4}}{1+y^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - y^2}{1 + y^2}}$ Hence $c(u) = \sqrt{\frac{1 - s^2(u)}{1 + s^2(u)}}$ Hence $$s(u+v) = \frac{s(u)c(v) + s(v)c(u)}{1 - s(u)s(v)c(u)c(v)}$$ Since $c(u+v) = s(\omega - u - v) = s((\omega - u) + (-v))$, $$c(u+v) = \frac{c(u)c(v) - s(u)s(v)}{1 + s(u)s(v)c(u)c(v)}$$ Remark Since $c(u) = \sqrt{\frac{1 - s^2(u)}{1 + s^2(u)}}$ and $s(-u) = -s(u)$, $c(-u) = c(u)$. My question How do we prove the following equation? $$s(u + v) = \frac{x\sqrt{1 - y^4} + y\sqrt{1 - x^4}}{1 + x^2y^2}$$","['special-functions', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus', 'elliptic-functions']"
189811,path space is contractible,"let $(X,*)$ be a pointed topological space. I want to show that the path space $PX$ of paths $\gamma:[0,1]\to X;\; \gamma(0)=*$ , is contractible. so i will  show that the map $f:PX\to *; \gamma\mapsto \gamma(0)$ is a homotopy equivalence with homotopy inverse the map $g:*\to PX;\; *\mapsto  \gamma_*$ where $\gamma_*$ is the constant path on $*$ . First, $f\circ g=id_*$ . It remains to show that $g\circ f$ is homotopic to $id_{PX}$ . Define the map $H_t: PX\to PX; \gamma\mapsto \lambda$ where $\lambda$ is the path defined by $\lambda(t')=\gamma(t'(1-t))$ and this is clearly a homotopy.

189813,Is this graph based on rationals familiar?,"Has anyone come across a graph like this? The black circles represent rationals in $(0,1)$ and their heights are roughly proportional to the reciprocal of the square of their lowest terms denominator.  The red lines are drawn by eye on the pattern of the black dots. This came from trying to create a probability distribution on the rationals where $$\Pr\left(X = \frac{a}{b}\right) = \frac{\zeta(k)}{\zeta(k-1) - \zeta(k) } \left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^k$$ where $0 \lt a \lt b$ with $a$ and $b$ coprime and where $k \gt 2$. The red lines look somewhat like the left half of the Stern-Brocot Tree except that points with different denominators are at different heights.","['probability', 'graphing-functions', 'rational-numbers']"
189817,Simple Maclaurin Series $e^{\tan(x)}$,"In a multichoice online test that I did the other day, I was required to select the Maclaurin series for $e^{\tan(x)}$. It was necessary for me to find the first four terms in order to establish which answer was correct. In the end of year exam, I will have reference to a Useful Information booklet (this contains a generalized Taylor polynomial approximation and Maclaurin series of $e^x$, $(1+x)^n$, $\sin(x)$, $\cos(x)$ and $\ln(1+x)$), and no calculator - hence throughout all of of my work, including online tests (which do contribute to my grade), I choose only to work with this resource, as preparation for this exam. As my approach for this problem, I used the generalized Taylor polynomial approximation to find the Maclaurin series for $\tan(x)$ and substituted this series in place of $x$ into the given Maclaurin series for $e^x$, and double-checked my answer once I had finished every other question by using the generalized Taylor polynomial approximation to find the Maclaurin series for $e^{\tan(x)}$. Obviously, as you can imagine, both of these methods were very time consuming (especially when you consider that the other nineteen questions in the test collectively took me less than ten minutes to answer). I'm probably missing a simple concept here. Can you please help me to establish a more elegant approach to this problem? The choices I was given were as follows:",['calculus']

189832,"Triple ""Pythagorean identity""","It's not hard to find multiple trigonometric functions of period $2\pi$ that added to self shifted by some constant offset result in a constant. In classic pythagorean identity, you have $$F(x)+F\left(x+\frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1 $$ where $F(x)=\sin^2 x$ Or you can use symmetry of the sine wave and create $F(x)+F(x+\pi ) = 0$ where $F(x) = \sin x$ Now what I'm looking for is a transformation of the sine function that while retaining the $2\pi$ period, gives you identity if repeated three times, with $\frac 2 3 \pi$ shift in each appearance: $$F(x) + F\left(x + \frac 2 3 \pi \right) + F\left(x+\frac 4 3 \pi\right) = \mathrm{const}$$ Can you find such a function?

189834,continuous constant function general topology,"I've read that if $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, and if the constant function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ mapping all of $X$ into the single point $y_{0}$ of $Y$, then $f$ is continuous. (Munkres page 107) Munkres gives the following brief proof: Let $f(x) = y_{0}$ for every $x$ in $X$. Let $V$ be open in $Y$. The set $f^{-1}(V)$ equals $X$ or $\emptyset$, depending on whether $V$ contains $y_{0}$ or not. In either case, it is open. My question is: $f$ is clearly not injective, so what does Munkres mean by the inverse function $f^{-1}$? What am i missing? Thanks for any help/clarification! Sincerely, Vien",['general-topology']
189845,Draw probability tree for drawing black & white cards (how to use $P(A|B)$),"I have a homework question that reads: You have a deck of $16$ cards, with: $4$ cards that are white on both sides; $7$ cards that are white on one side, black on the other; $5$ cards that are black on both sides. The cards are shuffled and randomly flipped. You draw one card from the 
  deck and look only at one side of it. (a) Draw a tree diagram with the probabilities of all possible card types. 
  Hint: Your tree should have two levels, one for the color of the top 
        of the card, and one for the color of the bottom card. (b) What is the probability that the top of your card is black? (c) If the top of your card is black, what is the probability that 
  the bottom is white? (d) If the top of your card is white, what is the probability that 
   the bottom is white? Now, here has been my approach thus far: first, I figured out how many total white sides and black sides there are: White sides $= 4 \times 2 + 7 = 15$ Black sides $= 5 \times 2 + 7 = 17$ Total sides $= 32$ Probability for top side being white $= 15/32 = 0.46875$ Probability for top side being black $= 1 - 15/32 = 0.53125$ Now, my problem is there is this $P(A | B)$ formula thing that I'm supposed to use to get the next level ones, but I don't know how to do that, so I skipped the probabilities for the second level in the tree for a bit. I went on to (c), where I said the probability was $7/12$, or about $0.58333$, because if your top is black, either you have a full black card (of which there are $5$), or you have a mixed card (of which there are $7$). You're looking for the probability of a mixed card, so you have a total of $7$ winning picks out of a total $12$ picks ($7 + 5$). I did a similar thing for (d) Then I went back and filled in the tree by doing the probability of the top side (say the top is black, which is $0.53125$) times the probability of the bottom for that branch (say bottom is white (top has already been black), so that is $0.58333$). So I went $0.53125 \times 0.58333 = 0.309894$, and did $0.53125 - 0.309894$ to get the probability of a full black card. My question is, how can I fill out the probability tree by using this $P(A|B)$ thing? I know that the formula for $P(A|B)$ is $P(A \cap B) / P(B)$. The thing is, I was getting an obviously wrong probability. Let $B$ be the event that the top of the card drawn is black. Let $A$ be the event that the bottom of the card drawn is white. $P(A|B) = P(A \cap B) / P(B) = (7/16) / (17/32) = 14/17 = 0.823529\ldots$? what? I did $7/16$ because that's the percentage of getting a mixed card ($A \cap B$), right? I don't understand UPDATE: Actually, $7/16$ should be $7/12$ right? Because we don't need to have the $4$ full whites in there. Now, $7/12 \times 17/32 = 0.309894$, which is the correct answer I believe. But isn't it $P(A \cap B) / P(B)$?","['statistics', 'probability']"
