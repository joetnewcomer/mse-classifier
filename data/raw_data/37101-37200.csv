358544,Egoroff's Theorem for extended real-valued functions,"Suppose $\{f_n(x)\}$ is a sequence of extended real-valued functions.  I say that this sequence converges uniformly to $f(x)$ provided for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $N$ such that if $n > N$ then (1) if $f(x)$ is finite, $|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon$; (2) if $f(x) = \infty$ then $f_n(x) > 1 / \epsilon$; (3) if $f(x) = -\infty$ then $f_n(x) < -1 / \epsilon$. Under this definition I believe that Egoroff's Theorem remains true if the sequence of functions and their pointwise a.e. limit have their ranges in the extended real numbers.  (The domains are assumed to be a finite measure space, of course.)  Is this correct?","['measure-theory', 'uniform-convergence', 'real-analysis']"
358545,Proof that $U(n)$ is connected,"I'm trying to prove that $U(n)= \{ X\in Mat_n(\mathbb{C})|X^T\bar{X}=I\}$ is connected, but most of the proof comes down to proving that $SU(n)= \{ X\in Mat_n(\mathbb{C})|X^T\bar{X}=I $ and $ detX=1\}$ is connected. This is what I have but I'm not sure whether it's valid: Consider the homomorphism $det:U(n) \rightarrow U(1) \subset \mathbb{C}^*$. 
We have that the kernel of this homomorphism is $SU(n)$. Thus $U(n)/SU(n) = U(1)$. Fibres will be left cosets $ASU(n)$, where $A\in U(n)$. My aim is to use the following theorem: Theorem: Let $G$ be a Lie group and $H\subset G$ its Lie subgroup. Assume that H is connected. Then G is connected $\iff G/H$ is connected. I proceed via induction on $n$. When $n=1$: $SU(1)={1}$ is just one element, thus is connected. Assume $SU(2),...,SU(n-1)$ are connected. The group $SU(n)$ acts on the set $S^{2n-1}$. Let us show that this action is transitive. Take $0\not=\xi_1 \in \mathbb{C}.$ We can add $\xi_2,...,\xi_n$ to get a basis of $S^{2n-1}$. We can take another $0\not= \xi_1' \in \mathbb{C}$ and add $\xi_2',...,\xi_n'$ to get another basis of $S^{2n-1}$. There exists $F\in GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ such that $F(\xi_i)=\xi_i'$. If $detF=\lambda \not= 1,$ then change $\xi_n = \frac{1}{\lambda}$. Then we have $F\in SU(n)$. Therefore the action of $SU(n)$ on $S^{2n-1}$ is transitive. The stabiliser subgroup of $\xi_1$, that is $SU(n)_{\xi_1}=\{F\in SU(n) | F(\xi_1)=\xi_1 \}$, contains $F\in SU(n)$ with matrix of the form: $A= \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 &...& 0\\0 & a_{1,1} & ... & a_{1,n-1} \\ ... &  ... & ... & ... \\ 0 & a_{n,1} & ... & a_{n-1,n-1} \end{bmatrix} $ Let the (n-1)x(n-1) submatrix in the bottom right be called $A_{n-1}$. We have $detA=detA_{n-1}=1 \implies A_{n-1} \in SU(n-1)$. We have by the inductive assumption that $SU(n-1)$ is connected, thus we can connect $A_{n-1}$ to the identity and therefore can connect $A$ to the identity. Thus $SU(n)_{\xi_1}$ is connected. Now I apply the following theorem: Theorem: Assume a Lie group G acts transitively on a manifold M. Then $M=G/G_m$ for a fixed $m\in M$. So we have that $SU(n)/SU(n)_{\xi_1}=S^{2n-1}$. We know that $S^{2n-1}$ is connected since it is just the (2n-1)-sphere, and we have just seen that $SU(n)_{\xi_1}$ is connected. Therefore, by the theorem above, it follows that $SU(n)$ is connected. It then follows from this that, since $U(n)/SU(n)=U(1)$, and we just showed that $SU(n)$ is connected and we know $U(1)=S^1$ is connected, $U(n)$ must be connected. My apologies if that was a bit long winded, I sincerely appreciate any comments you have on the validity of this proof.","['general-topology', 'matrices', 'lie-groups', 'connectedness', 'group-theory']"

358927,"Usage and determination of ""rank"" and ""dimension"" of groups & representations","Physicist here.  I seem to see conflicting statements about the rank of some groups I've come across lately. A paper I'm reading states that $SO(6)$ is rank 3 and therefore its Cartan subalgebra has three commuting generators.  But I also read elsewhere that $SO(N)$ has rank $N(N-1)/2$, ie, equal to its number of generators, here 15.  Similarly I see it stated that $SU(4)$ is rank 3 (as it better be, under some understanding, since $SO(6) \sim SU(4)$) but again I am more familiar with its rank being defined as the number of its generators, ie, $4^2-1=15$ here, $N^2-1$ for general $SU(N)$. I suppose these are just two different uses of the word rank?  Is one usage sloppy? 
( edit: It sounds like one usage is not just sloppy, but actually wrong ) Perhaps the number of generators is more properly called the group's dimension.  But then there is also the dimension of a representation, which is not in general the same as the number of generators for the group.  Correct?  Like $SU(2)$ in its fundamental representation acts on a vector space of dimension 2, but it has 3 generators. I know in some places the rank is specifically defined as the number of generators in the Cartan subalgebra.  If that is the case, how else could one determine the rank?  I wonder because the author states the rank of these groups is 3 and then deduces from that the number of Cartan generators. Sorry for any sloppy terminology or general ignorance, mathematicians!

We may find a string $00\dots 01$ (in base $5$) with $n$ zeroes occuring at the $m^{th}$ digit and it follows that: $$\frac{\lfloor \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot 5^m \rfloor}{5^m} < \frac{\pi}{2} < \frac{\lfloor \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot 5^m \rfloor + \epsilon}{5^m}$$ So $d(\frac{\pi}{2} \cdot 5^m , \lfloor \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot 5^m \rfloor ) < \epsilon$.  Since $5^m \equiv 1 \mod 4$, we have $\sin(\frac{\pi}{2} \cdot 5^m) = 1$, and since $|\sin|$ dominates the triangle wave, $d(1,\sin(\lfloor \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot 5^m \rfloor ) ) < \displaystyle \frac{\epsilon}{\pi}$, from which the result follows.

359332,First jump time of Poisson process (and general right-continuous processes).,"I've read that the first jump time of the Poisson process is totally inaccessible (definition at the bottom for anyone interested). This made me wonder if the first jump time is a stopping time. I think the answer is yes. (If the answer was no, the first jump time would automatically be totally inaccessible and people probably wouldn't bother mentioning totally inaccessibility.) More generally, I think the answer is yes for any right-continuous process. EDIT: Lost1 has pointed out that that the answer is easily yes for a Poisson process. That still leaves general right-continuous processes. Let $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \geq 0}$ be a filtration of a probability space. A random variable $T$ is called an stopping time if $\left\{T \leq t \right\} \in \mathcal{F}_t$ for all $t \geq 0$. For us, $\mathcal{F}_t = \sigma(X_{s} | s \leq t)$. Here's my attempt to show the first jump time for a right-continuous process is a stopping time. The first jump time is defined to be $T = \inf\{t>0 | X_t \neq X_0 \}$. We need $\{ T \leq t \} \in \mathcal{F}_{t}$. I don't know how to prove this, but I do know that
$$
\{ T < t \} = \{ X_s \neq X_0 \text{ for some $s < t$} \} = \bigcup_{r < t, \, r \in \mathbb{Q}} \{ X_r \neq X_0 \} \in \mathcal{F}_{t},
$$
where the last equality is by right-continuity. It's not clear to me how to write $\{ T \leq t \}$ in a way that shows it belongs to $\mathcal{F}_{t}$. By the way, here is the definition of a totally inaccessible stopping time.
If $T_n$ are stopping times and $T_n \uparrow T$, then $T$ is an stopping time and we call it predictable . If $P(S = T < \infty) = 0$ for all predictable stopping times $S$, we say $T$ is totally inaccessible .","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'random-variables']"

359377,The field generated by the empirical distribution function,"The Gist I've got three question related to the field generated by the empirical distribution function (""the empirical field""). Is the empirical field identical to the symmetric field? Are all functions that are invariant under permutation of their argument measurable w.r.t. the empirical field? If $f\left(x,y\right)$ is measurable w.r.t. the product field $\Omega^n\otimes\mathcal{A}$ and for each $y$, $f\left(\cdot,y\right)$ is measurable w.r.t. the empirical field, is $f$ measurable w.r.t. the product of the empirical field and $A$? In Detail Following is a more complete and precise statement of these questions. Let $\left(\Omega_1,\mathcal{A}_1\right)$, $\left(\Omega_2,\mathcal{A}_2\right)$ be measurable spaces (if it helps, they may be assumed to be Borel spaces). Denote by $\mathcal{P}$ the set of probability measures on $\left(\Omega_1,\mathcal{A}_1\right)$ and by $\mathcal{A}_\mathcal{P}$ the $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathcal{P}$ generated by the sets of the form $\left\{P\in\mathcal{P}\space\mid:\space P(B)\leq t\right\}$, for all $B\in\mathcal{A}_1$ and $t\in\mathbb{R}$. Let $n$ be a positive integer. The empirical distribution function of order $n$ on $\left(\Omega_1,\mathcal{A}_1\right)$ is the function $$q:\Omega_1^n\rightarrow\mathcal{P},\space\space q\left(\left(x_1,\dots,x_n\right)\right)(B):=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\mathbb{1}_B\left(x_i\right)$$ It can be readily verified that $q$ is $\mathcal{A}_1^n/\mathcal{A}_\mathcal{P}$-measurable. The $\sigma$-algebra induced on $\mathcal{A}_1^n$ by $q$ will be denoted $\mathcal{A}_q$. Question #1 For every $x\in\Omega_1^n$, $\Pi(x)$ will denote the set consisting of all $n!$ permutations of $x$. The symmetric field of order $n$ on $\left(\Omega_1,\mathcal{A}_1\right)$ is the set $$\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{sym}:=\left\{B\in\mathcal{A}_1^n\space\mid:\space\forall x\in B,\space\Pi(x)\subseteq B\right\}$$ It can be readily verified that $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{sym}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. It is also clear that $\mathcal{A}_q\subseteq\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{sym}$. My first question is: Is it the case that $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{sym}\subseteq\mathcal{A}_q$? Question #2 Denote by $F$ the set of real-valued, measurable functions over $\Omega_1^n$ that are invariant under permutation of their argument. Formally, $$F:=\left\{f:\left(\Omega_1^n,\mathcal{A}_1^n\right)\rightarrow\left(\mathbb{R},\mathfrak{B}\right)\space\mid:\space\forall x\in\Omega_1^n\forall y\in\Pi(x),\space f(x)=f(y)\right\}$$ It is clear that all $f\in F$ are $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{sym}/\mathfrak{B}$-measurable. My second question is: Is it the case that all $f\in F$ are $\mathcal{A}_q/\mathfrak{B}$-measurable? Obviously, if the answer to question #1 is affirmative, so is the answer to this question. Question #3 Finally let $f:\Omega_1^n\times\Omega_2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be $\mathcal{A}_1^n\otimes\mathcal{A}_2/\mathfrak{B}$-measurable and such that $f\left(\cdot,y\right)\in F$ for any fixed $y\in\Omega_2$. My third question is: Is it the case that $f$ is $\mathcal{A}_q\otimes\mathcal{A}_2/\mathcal{B}$-measurable? Is it $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{sym}\otimes\mathcal{A}_2/\mathcal{B}$-measurable? Motivation These questions - and particularly the last one - arose while reading Schervish's first chapter on exchangeable sequences of random variables. Specifically, he states the following proposition without proof (p. 42) with the reassurance that ""it is easy to prove"": Proposition 1.75. Suppose that $X=\left(X_1,\dots,X_N\right)$ are exchangeable, that $k+n\leq N$, and that $j_1,\dots,j_n\in\left\{k+1,\dots,N\right\}$ are distinct. The conditional distribution of $X_{j_1},\dots,X_{j_n}$ given $\left(X_1,\dots,X_k\right)=\left(x_1,\dots,x_k\right)$ and $\mathbf{P}_N=P$ [$\mathbf{P}_N$ is Schervish's notation for the composition of the empirical distribution of order $N$ on $X$. - Evan Aad] is that of a simple random sample of size $n$ without replacement from the distribution $P$ with one ball for each of $x_1,\dots,x_k$ removed first. In trying to prove this proposition, i started by denoting with $f\left(\left(x=\left(x_1,\dots,x_k\right),P\right),B\right)$ the function defined in the last sentence, namely $f\left(\left(x,P\right),B\right)$ is the probability that a simple random sample of size $n$ without replacement from the distribution $P$ with one ball for each of $x_1,\dots,x_k$ removed first will attain values in the Borel set $B$. The first task i undertook was to show that for each $B$, $f\left(\cdot,B\right)$ was measurable. However, finding it difficult to show this when working directly with $P$, i attempted to reduce $f$ to the function $f'\left(\left(x,x'=\left(x_1,\dots,x_N\right)\right),B\right):=f\left(\left(x,q\left(x'\right)\right),B\right)$. I was able to define $f'$ in such a way (see below) that $f'\left(\cdot,B\right)$ was measurable w.r.t. the joint distribution of $\left(\left(X_1,\dots,X_k\right),\left(X_1,\dots,X_N\right)\right)$ and such that, given $x=\left(x_1,\dots,x_k\right)$, $f'\left(\left(x,\cdot\right),B\right)$ was invariant under permutation of $\left(x_1,\dots,x_N\right)$. But does this mean $f'$ is measurable with respect to the distribution of $\left(\left(X_1,\dots,X_k\right),\mathbf{P}_N\right)$? An affirmative answer to question 3 would be an affirmative answer to this question. For completeness, here's how i defined $f'$. First a simple notational convention: if $y=\left(x_1,\dots,x_N\right)$ and $\alpha$ is some sequence of indices $\in\left\{1,\dots,N\right\}$ of length $m$, then define $y_\alpha:=\left(y_{\alpha_1},\dots,y_{\alpha_m}\right)$. Now, given $x=\left(x_1,\dots,x_k\right)$, $x'=\left(x_1,\dots,x_N\right)$, $B$, set $g\left(x,x'\right):=\sum_{y\in\Pi\left(x'\right)}\mathbb{1}_{\left\{x\right\}}(y_{\left(1,\dots,k\right)})$, define for all $0<g\left(x,x'\right)$, $$
f'\left(\left(x,x'\right),B\right):=\frac{1}{g\left(x,x'\right)}\sum_{y\in\Pi\left(x'\right)}\mathbb{1}_{\left\{x\right\}}(y_{\left(1,\dots,k\right)})\frac{1}{n!{N\choose n}}\sum_{\alpha:\left\{1,\dots,n\right\}\overset{1:1}{\rightarrow}\left\{k+1,\dots,N\right\}}\mathbb{1}_B\left(y_\alpha\right)

359396,Generating a random number from a given distribution,"I have a problem (a part of a Monte Carlo simulation) where I'm given the energy of an incoming particle, $\varepsilon$ and want to split this energy in two parts, randomly generating the fraction that goes into each part according to a given function $P(\varepsilon_s) \propto %\frac{1}{\bar E \arctan\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{\bar E}\right)} 
\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{\varepsilon_s}{\bar E}\right)^2}$ $\bar E$ is a known shape parameter. Now, the incoming particle can have energies ranging from 0 to a known maximum, $\varepsilon \in \left[0,\varepsilon_{\text{max}}\right]$, but I do not know the energy until the collision event, when I want to split it up, and therefore I can't figure out how to normalize the distribution function properly. I have a pseudo-random number generator at my disposal which generates uniformly distributed numbers on $[0,1)$. How do I generate random numbers that properly describe how the two collisional products share the available energy? I've tried reading up on methods for this in available books, but they're all a little to theoretical for me to be able to apply them to my scenario. It's been way too long since I took a proper statistics course, and now it seems I need it :) Update : As requested, a more thorough description of $P$ (which will get into detail about the physics of this experiment...) follows here: The physics of this problem is ionization - I have an incoming electron with kinetic energy $\varepsilon$, that collides with a molecule and ionizes it. After the collision event, I have two electrons with energies $\varepsilon_p$ (primary) and $\varepsilon_s$ (secondary), with $\varepsilon_p+\varepsilon_s=\varepsilon-\varepsilon_i$, the latter being the (known) ionization energy. Now, I don't really care which electron is which after the collision, so determining the two energies is simply a problem of dividing $\varepsilon-\varepsilon_i$ into two parts. To do this, I am using the differential cross section of the collision, as suggested by Y. Tzeng and E. E. Kunhardt 1 , which is given by them as $q(\varepsilon, \varepsilon_s) = \frac{C(\varepsilon)}{\bar E \arctan\left((\varepsilon-\varepsilon_i)/\bar E\right)}\cdot \frac{1}{1+\left({\varepsilon_s/\bar E}\right)^2}$ $C(\varepsilon)$ in this epxression is the total collision cross section, which is also known. I'm not 100% sure on this, but if I've understood the physics correctly then normalizing this function over the available energies should give me a probability density. As it turn out, this funciton is normalized so that $\int_0^{\varepsilon-\varepsilon_i} q(\varepsilon, \varepsilon_s)d\varepsilon_s = C(\varepsilon)$ so normalizing w.r.t. the entire interval is just a matter of removing the factor $C(\varepsilon)$. However, if I insert $\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{\text{max}}$, that gives me a probability distribution which allows for energies higher than the available energy, and if I don't then I don't know how to generate random numbers from the distribution correctly. 1 I don't think I'm at liberty to relay the entire paper here, unfortunately...","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'random']"

$$(b,\alpha)+\gamma(c,\beta)=(b+\gamma c,\alpha+\gamma\beta),\quad (b,\alpha)(c,\beta)=(bc+\alpha c+\beta b,\alpha\beta)$$
and $A$ has the norm $\Vert(b,\alpha)\Vert=\Vert b\Vert+|\alpha|$. It is easily checked that $A$ is a commutative Banach algebra with unit $(0,1)$. If we identify $B$ with the subalgebra $B\oplus\left\{ 0\right\}$ of $A$, then it's clear that $B$ is a maximal commutative subalgebra of $A$ which does not contain the unit. If my arguments were correct, then it is not true in general that $B$ contains the unit. But maybe we can still assure that $B$ is closed in $A$ and that, if $B$ contains the unit, then $\sigma_A(b)=\sigma_B(b)$ for every $b\in B$.","['banach-algebras', 'functional-analysis']"
359602,projective cubic curve to complex projectie space,"Suppose we are given the equation
$$
y^2z = x(x - z)(x - 2z)
$$
I would like to define a degree two map $g$ on this curve into complex projective space. I hate to say I am already lost here - how do I start this ? So an element on complex projective space is an equivalence class of the form $[z,\omega]$ where $(z,\omega) \backsim (\lambda z,\lambda \omega)$ for any nonzero complex number $\lambda$. Also, I can see that the above equation gives a homogeneous polynomial of degree $3$,
$$
	f(x,y,z) = y^2z- x^3- 3x^2z +2z^2x
$$
but how can I find the homogeneous coordinates ? My hunch is I should use the identification $\mathbb{C} P \cong S^2$ .. is that a good idea? Any help would be great!","['riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves', 'manifolds']"
359604,form of symmetric matrix of rank one,"The question is: Let $C$ be a symmetric matrix of rank one. Prove that $C$ must have the form $C=aww^T$, where $a$ is a scalar and $w$ is a vector of norm one. I think we can easily prove that if $C$ has the form $C=aww^T$, then $C$ is symmetric and of rank one. Why we need $w$ is of norm one?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
