1293905,Isolated Eigenvalue,"What does it mean that an eigenvalue is ""isolated""? My intuitive understanding says it is when one can find an open ball around it such that there is no other eigenvalue in that open ball. However, I am reading a book (""Perturbation of Spectra in Hilbert Space"" by Friedrichs) that says: ...we assume that the undisturbed operator $H_0$ is Hermitian, possesses a spectral resolution, and has a single eigenvalue $\omega_0$ with an eigenvector $X_0$ [such that $X_0\neq 0$]. We assume this eigenvalue to be isolated, so that the equation $$ (H_0-\omega_0)X=\Psi $$ has a solution $X$ whenever the given right member $\Psi$ is orthogonal to $X_0$. My question is: how does it follow from $\omega_0$ being isolated that the equation has a solution only if $<X_0,\Psi>=0$? No matter if $\omega_0$ is isolated or not, we have that $$ <X_0, (H_0-\omega_0)X> = <(H_0-\omega_0)X_0, X> = <0,X> = 0$$so that if the equation $$ (H_0-\omega_0)X=\Psi $$ is satisfied by $X$ then $<X_0, \Psi>=0$.

1294150,"If $Y$ is a quasi-affine variety, then dim$Y$ = dim$\overline{Y}$","Reading through the proof of proposition 1.10 in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry I found some of it to be unnecessary. Is the following proof correct or can you point out my flawed logic? Let $Z_0 \subset ... \subset Z_n$ be a sequence of distinct closed irreducible subsets of $Y$. Notice that $\overline{Z_0} \subset ... \subset \overline{Z_n}$ is a sequence of closed irreducible subsets of $\overline{Y}$.  This is because we know that if $Z_i$ is an irreducible subset of $Y$, then $\overline{Z_i}$ is irreducible in $Y$ and thus it is also irreducible in $\overline{Y}$. Thus we have that dim$Y$ $\leq$ dim$\overline{Y}$. Now dim$\overline{Y}$ is finite as $Y$ is a non-empty open subset of an irreducible space, so that it is irreducible and dense, yielding $\overline{Y}$ is an affine variety. Thus we can choose a maximal chain of distinct closed irreducible subsets of $Y$, $Z_0 \subset ... \subset Z_n$, with dim$Y=n$. Now $\overline{Z_0} \subset ... \subset \overline{Z_n}$ is a maximal chain of closed irreducible subsets of $\overline{Y}$, this is through a contradiction argument that uses the fact that a non-empty open subset of an irreducible space is irreducible and dense. I omit it here as my proof goes into too much detail. Now from here Hartshorne goes to prove the dimension is $n$ by converting these to prime ideals and finding a maximum chain of those. I understand his proof and it is correct, but is it not correct to say that $\overline{Y}$ is an affine variety whose dimension is given by the supremum of all integers $n$ such that there exists a chain $A_0 \subset ... \subset A_n$ of distinct irreducible closed subsets of $\overline{Y}$? We proved that $\overline{Z_0} \subset ... \subset \overline{Z_n}$ was maximal so that by definition dim$\overline{Y}$ = $n$ = dim$Y$. I am having trouble seeing a flaw in my proof and do not understand why it is necessary to go to a chain of prime ideals in order to argue the dimension of $\overline{Y}$ is in fact $n$.

1294176,Knight movement on chess field,"I had this task in programming competition: There are two knights, which are $(p_1,q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$. $(p,q)$ knight is figure, with p(q)-length first step, and q(p)-length second step in perpendicular direction. Simple chess knight is (2,1) or (1,2) knight. Given $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ - positions of two knights on $(W\times H)$ chess board. Find minimal path which leads both knights in same cell. As I never saw task like this, I've started with simplier: Given $(p,q)$ knight on $(W\times H)$ chess board in $(x_0,y_0)$ initial cell, can knight visit $(x,y)$ cell? I can use some recursive algorithm for finding it, of course, but I've decided to look at this problem analyticaly. I made up this system: $$pk_1+qk_2=x-x_0\\
qk_1+pk_2=y-y_0$$ Solutions of this system are:
$$k_2=\frac{(y-y_0)p}{p^2-q^2}\\
k_1=\frac{x-x_0-qk_2}{p}$$ I thought, that point will be: all available for visit cells will lead to $k_1, k_2$ be integers. But from doing some examples I realised, that actually for available cells $k_1, k_2$ are rational, and for aunavailiable cells they are irrational. So I have questions: Where is my mistake in reasoning? [Answer] Because I don't take into account direction, thanks @Joffan. It is not seem to be practical way to use in program, because I can not distinguish rational from irrational in code. So what will be except recursion and linear programming?

1294224,Number of ways to connect sets of $k$ dots in a perfect $n$-gon,"Let $Q(n,k)$ be the number of ways in which we can connect sets of $k$ vertices in a given perfect $n$ -gon such that no two lines intersect at the interior of the $n$ -gon and no vertex remains isolated. Intersection of the lines outside the $n$ -gon is acceptable. Obviously, $k|n$ , and $n$ can't be prime because otherwise there will be dots left unconnected. The $n$ -gon itself is an acceptable solution to a connection of $n$ vertices, and in the case of $k>2$ , these aren't lines, but a set of connected lines, a sort of a network formed by connected planar graphs with straight edges with $k$ vertices, which are required to be vertices of the $n$ -gon itself. There must always be $S =\frac nk$ sets of lines. For $k=2$ , there are exactly $\frac nk$ lines, and for $k>2$ , there are exactly $\frac nk$ , not lines but sets of such connected planar graphs. Take for example $Q(6,2)$ . We have a perfect hexagon. By brute-forcing with pencil and paper, I found that there are 5 ways to connect sets of 2 vertices (dots) such that no two lines intersect inside the hexagon. Hence, $Q(6,2) = 5$ . The following image depicts the case of $Q(6,2)$ : I know for sure that an elegant solution exists for $k=2$ , but I can't figure it out. For generality I ask about any amount of $k$ dots. It's also extremely important to note we're not dividing the $n$ -gon into $k$ -gons, but connecting paths between $k$ nodes/vertices/dots. Now let's move one step further: Let $U(n,k)$ be the number of unique ways to connect sets of $k$ dots in a perfect $n$ -gon, such that no two lines intersect, and rotational symmetry is neglected, i.e, every possible arrangement is unique and can't be formed by rotating or flipping another arrangement in any way. $U(6,2)=2$ .
Note that $U(6,2)=2$ because the arrangements of the first line in the image are not unique, and can be formed by rotating one another. The same happens for the second line of arrangements. This results in only 1 unique arrangement for each line. Hence $U(6,2)=2$ . I'm pretty clueless about both functions $U$ and $Q$ , and I couldn't derive an algorithm or formula to any of them. Hence I'm posting this here. I'm pretty sure there's a pure combinatorial approach to this problem, perhaps involving Polya's Enumeration Theorem (PET). Is there an elegant solution to these functions? Can they even be solved for $k>2$ ? Any light shed on any of the functions will be very much appreciable, as I haven't been successful in deriving a formula for any of them. EDIT - Temporary Solutions + Relevant questions AND progress $$Q(n,2) = C_{n \over 2}\quad\text{where}\quad C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} {2n\choose n}$$ And $C_n$ denotes the $n$ 'th Catalan number. Now let us denote $W(n) = U(n,2)$ . Can you find a formula for $W(n)$ ? Perhaps a connection between $Q(n,2)$ and $W(n)$ ? Another EDIT: (2) $$Q(k,k) = k\cdot 2^{k-3}$$ EDIT 3 It seems like in general, $Q(n,3)$ is given here: https://oeis.org/search?q=3%2C27%2C324&sort=&language=english&go=Search Perhaps generalization to higher powers will result in the general $Q(n,k)$ function..

$$ EDIT 5 - $Q(n,k)$ SOLVED As beautifully found and explained by @CuddlyCuttlefish in his answer, the formula for $Q(n,k)$ is as follows: $$Q(n,k) = \frac{(n)_{\frac{n}{k}-1}}{\left(\frac{n}{k}\right)!}\cdot (k\cdot 2^{k-3})^{\frac{n}{k}} \quad\text{where}\quad (n)_j = n(n-1)...(n-(j-1))$$ And $(n)_j$ is the falling factorial , defined as above. Now moving to $U(n,k)$ Now it only remains to find a formula or an algorithm for $U(n,k)$ .
Personally I think it has to do with Polya's Enumeration Theorem and Burnside's lemma , combined with the cycle-index of the symmetric group , $Z(S_n)$ . I've touched upon something related to that, and thus I think it's related. I'm not 100% sure but my instincts tell me it's related. EDIT 6 In order to make it clear, I'm hereby adding a picture to describe the case of $U(6,3)$ and by that to clarify better what $U(n,k)$ means. $U(6,3)=4$ , as shown in the picture above (@ Marko Riedel has pointed out an additional arrangement which I had previously missed). There are four unique arrangements to connect sets of 3 vertices such that no vertice remains isolated, no lines intersect at the interior of the hexagon, and each arrangement is unique and can't be formed by rotating or flipping any other arrangement. There are two unique path-types , one that is introduced by connecting 3 adjacent vertices ( $p_1$ ), and another that connects 2 vertices with a little ""jump"", and the third vertice is then adjacent ( $p_2$ ). Hope it makes things a bit clearer.. EDIT 7 As provided by @ Marko Riedel's algorithm, $U(n,3)$ sequence starts as follows: $$1, 4, 22, 201, 2244, 29096, 404064, 5915838,\ldots$$ Computation was very rough, and calculation times were long. That's about as efficient as it gets, as of now. Producing more values just consumes either too much memory, time or both. Refer to Marko Riedel's answers for more sequences and further explanations. Also if anybody can verify the above it would be great.","['combinations', 'group-theory', 'polygons', 'combinatorics']"

1294361,Multivalued Functions for Dummies,"I have been studying complex analysis for a while, but I still cannot ""get"" how multivalued functions work. Despite having it explained to me many times, my brain cannot process it. For example, I do not know / understand what $f(z) = \sqrt{z^2}$, $g(z) = (\sqrt{z})^2$ are. I don't know how to decide which branch to use when I see expressions like $f(z) = \sqrt{z(z-1)(z-\lambda)}$ I don't understand how integrals involving roots work, especially when it seems like the integral is being taken along the branch cuts. I feel like many books I have seen treats these as being obvious. Is there a reference that really drills on this topic? Kind of like 'multivalued functions for dummies'? EDIT: $g(z) = \sqrt{z}^2 = z$ (with a removable singularity at $z=0$.) $f(z) = \sqrt{z^2}$ is a multivalued function. EDIT2: $f(z) = \sqrt{z(z-1)(z-\lambda)} = \exp(\frac12 \log(g(z)))$ where $g(z) = z(z-1)(z-\lambda).$ Let $z_0$ some point that is not $0, 1, \lambda$. Then, it is possible to define $L$ in a small disk around $z_0$, with $$L(z) = \ln|z| + i \theta,$$ If $z_0$ is not a negative real number, $\theta$ can be $[-\pi,\pi]$. If $z_0$ is a negative real number, then $\theta$ can be $[0,2\pi]$. Then for $z\ne 0,1,\lambda$, we can define $$\log z = \int_{z_0}^z \dfrac{g'(z)}{g(z)} dz + L(z_0),$$ which is multivalued. Then, $$\sqrt{g(z)} =\exp(\dfrac{1}{2} \left(\int_{z_0}^z \dfrac{g'(z)}{g(z)} dz + L(z_0)\right))$$ By the argument principle, this is a single valued function on $D$ as long as $D$ does not allow the path from $z_0$ to $z$ to loop around an odd number of zeros of $g$. This can be prevented by pairing up the zeros with a branch cut. For an odd number of zeroes, the left over one can be connected to the point at infinity. So any combination of branch cuts that connects two of the zeros, and the third zero to the point at infinity will make $\sqrt{g(z)}$ single valued. Similarly, $\sqrt[n]{g(z)}$ would require the branch cuts to group $n$-zeroes at a time, to prevent any loops around $k$-zeroes for $k<n$. If there is any shortage, $\infty$  fire one branch cut off to infinity.","['reference-request', 'multivalued-functions', 'complex-analysis']"

  Let $W$ be a subspace of $V$.
  If $f$ is non-degenerate on $W$, then $V=W\oplus W^\perp$. Below I provide a proof of this. My problem is that my proof doesn't seem to make use of the fact that $f$ is symmetric.
Is the above theorem also true if we strike out the word symmetric? If yes, then one may not read my proof and just leave a comment. If not then can one check where have I used the symmetry of $f$ in the argument? Definitions and Notations: Given a bilinear form $f$ on a (finite dimensional) vector space $V$, we define $R_f:V\to V^*$ as $(R_fv)(u)=f(u, v)$ for all $u, v\in V$.
Clearly $R_f$ is a linear map. For a subspace $W$ of $V$, we write $f|W$ to denotes the restriciton of $f$ to $W\times W$. It can be seen that $f|W$ is a bilinear form on $W$.
We define $W^\perp$ as $\set{v\in V: f(w, v)=0 \ for \ all \ w\in W}$.
Also, we write $\ann W$ to denote the annihilator of $W$. We say that $f$ is non-degenerate on a subspace $W$ of $V$ is $R_{f|W}:W\to W^*$ has rank $\dim W$. The Purported Proof: It is clear that $f$ is non-degenerate on $W$ if and only if $W\cap W^\perp=\set{0}$.
So it suffices to show that $\dim W+\dim W^{\perp}=\dim V$.
To this end, first we note the simple fact that given $v\in V$ we have
\begin{equation*}
v\in W^\perp\ \iff\ R_fv\in \ann W
\tag{1}
\end{equation*} Let $\pi:V^*\to V^*/\ann W$ be the canonical projection map and conider the liner map $\pi\circ R_f:V\to V^*/\ann W$. By the Rank-Nullity Theorem we have $$
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dim V &=& \dim \ker (\pi\circ R_f) + \dim \range(\pi\circ R_f)\\
\\
&\leq& \dim \ker (\pi\circ R_f) + \dim (V^*/\ann W)\\
\\
&=& \dim \ker (\pi\circ R_f) + \dim W
\end{array}
$$ Note that from (1) we know that $\ker (\pi\circ R_f)=W^\perp$.
Therefore $\dim V\leq \dim W^\perp+\dim W$.
But since $W\cap W^\perp=\set{0}$, we also have $\dim V\geq \dim W+\dim W^\perp$.
So we must have $\dim V=\dim W+\dim W^\perp$ and we are done.","['multilinear-algebra', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'bilinear-form']"

1295332,Lie groups and Lie algebras for matrices,"Recently, I stumbled over a few things in very basic Lie group/Lie algebra theory concerning matrix groups. Basically, my question is: Is there a way to canonically understand all the Lie groups at once? So there is the group $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{R})$ . This is the only group where I immediately see the manifold structure, as $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{R}) = \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \setminus \det^{-1}(\{0\})$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ just by continuity of the determinant and hence it is a manifold of dimension $n^2$ . The Lie algebra in the context of real matrix theory is apparently given by all matrices $\{X; e^{tX} \in G\}$ where $G$ is the respective Lie group. From this it is clear that any endomorphism $X$ is in the Lie algebra of the general linear group, since $e^{tX}$ is always invertible. All other guys like $\mathrm{SL}, \mathrm{SO}, \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{Sp}, \dotsc$ are now somewhat harder to me. But maybe we can answer this question more canonically? Cause a friend of mine showed me a trick how to figure out what the Lie algebras might be without investigating this exponential. Let $Y = \mathrm{Id} + tX + o(t^2)$ be a Taylor expansion and then you plug this into the defining property of the group: For instance, if we consider $\mathrm{O}(n)$ : $$
  Y^T Y
  = (\mathrm{Id} + t X^t + o(t^2))(\mathrm{Id} + t X^t + o(t^2))
  = \mathrm{Id} + t X + t X^t + o(t^2) \,,
$$ now the Lie algebra is the set of all matrices that have no order $t$ term in this expansion. So in the case of the orthogonal group this means that $X + X^t = 0$ . In the case of $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ the defining property is that $\det(\mathrm{Id} + tX) = 1$ which is for small $t$ equivalent to $\det(\mathrm{Id} + tX) \approx 1 + t \cdot \mathrm{tr}(X) = 1$ and hence we must have trace-free matrices in the respective Lie algebra. Somehow, we can apparently conclude what the Lie algebra has to be from first order Taylor expansion. This is nice because it seems to work generally. My first question is: Why does this work and where does the condition that the first order term has to vanish come from? Now, I would like to understand the Lie groups itself also better and maybe also in a more general way. I don't see how the manifold structure is actually defined on these groups. Sure, in the case of $\mathrm{O}$ or $\mathrm{SO}$ the regular value theorem may be applied somehow, but this does not provide me with a parametrization or chart explicitly. In especially, is there a canonical way to find charts/parametrizations for such matrix groups or is this different in each case? Is there a way to see directly what the dimension of any such matrix group has to be? I mean, think of you sitting in an exam. Is there a way to figure out what the dimension of the respective manifold has to be? Or is this something that has to be investigated in each case differently?","['lie-groups', 'real-analysis', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'lie-algebras']"
1295335,"Quick question: could someone clarify me the notion of ""$k$-points"" of a scheme?","Let $X$ be a scheme, and $k$ be a field. What does it mean by $X(k)$? The reason I am asking this is that there seems to be several definition(or convention) on it, and I can't see why they lead to the same set. First definition is: $$X(k)=\{p\in X | \kappa(p)\simeq k\}.$$ Here, of course $\kappa(p)$ denotes the residue field $\mathcal{O}_{p}/\mathfrak{m}_p$. The other definition concerns general rings $R$, or if $X$ is defined over a field $k$, algebras $R$ over $k$. $$X(R)=\mathrm{Hom}(\mathrm{Spec} R,X).$$ Are they equivalent? If $G$ is a group scheme, it easily follows from the second definition that $G(k)$ has a group structure. 
Multiple elements in $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathrm{Spec}K,X)$ can correspond to a single element in $X$, because of the existence of automorphisms of $K$, so I am hesitant to use an element of this set like an actual point of $X$.","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"
1295344,Confusion between an element and its preimage,"Let $X$ be a set and $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $X$, so that the quotient set 
$X/_\sim=\bigcup_{x\in X}{[x]}$ with $[x]=[y]$ if and only if $x\sim y$. Consider the quotient map $f:X\to X/_\sim\; ; \; x\mapsto [x]$. Now take an element $[x]\in X/_\sim$ , its preimage is the set
$f^{-1}(\{[x]\})=\{z\in X\;|\; [z]= [x]\}=\{z\in X\;|\; z\sim x\}$ I'm confused because the equivalence class $[x]$ of an element $x\in X$ is defined as the set of elements $z\in X$ such that $z\sim x$ and this is the same as the preimage of $[x]$ so that it is like we have $f(x)=f^{-1}(\{f(x)\})$ !! I'm confused between $[x]$ and its preimage, which one is the equivalence class of $x$ and why they seem to be equal?","['elementary-set-theory', 'equivalence-relations']"
1295345,"Proving a real valued function is periodic, and sketching it using obtained information","Consider an arbitrary function, something like $f\left ( x \right )=\arccos \left ( \sin \left ( 4x \right ) \right )$. Its graph looks like this: I was greatly confused by the image below, because before using a tool to graph the function I came to following results: $$y=\arccos \left ( \sin \left ( 4x \right ) \right )$$
$$\cos \left ( y \right )=\sin \left ( 4x \right )=\cos (\frac{\pi }{2}-4x)$$
$$y=\frac{\pi }{2}-x+2k\pi,  k\in\mathbb{Z}  $$
This answers the first part of my question about $f$ being a periodic function. However, since the range of the inverse cosine function is $\left [ 0,\pi   \right]$ it seemed to me that I had made a crucial mistake somewhere.  How should one variate the parameter $k$ in order do get a graph as shown below, and what would be the derivative of the function at points where it ""breaks""? Is it zero because those points represent local extrema, or is it infinity (maybe the same case as with the function $y= \left | x \right |$ at zero)?","['periodic-functions', 'functions']"

1295400,Why is the the double dual functor on finite-dimensional vector spaces naturally isomorphic to the identity?,"$\require{AMScd}$ Note: I have already seen this question, which asks about a specific aspect of the construction - here I am trying to construct this functor and failing at a very different stage. We are trying to show that the two functors $\sf Id:FDVec_k\to FDVec_k$ and $(\cdot)^{\vee\vee}:\sf FDVec_k\to FDVec_k$ are naturally isomorphic. I've never seen such an argument before, and working through the linear algebra is giving me some problems. An element of $V^{\vee\vee}$ is defined to be a linear map from $V^{\vee}$ to $k$, so it takes linear maps $V\to k$ to elements of $k$. For a natural isomorphism we need isomorphisms $$m_V:V\to V^{\vee\vee}.$$ We input a vector and output a map $\operatorname{Hom}(V,k)\to k$: $$m_V(v)(f:V\to k)=f(v)\in k.$$ We then need to show that diagrams $$
\begin{CD}
V @>\phi>> W\\
@V{m_V}VV @VV{m_W}V\\
V^{\vee\vee} @>>\phi^{\vee\vee}> W^{\vee\vee}
\end{CD}
$$ commute if $\phi$ is a linear map of finite-dimensional vector spaces, so $$m_W\circ\phi=\phi^{\vee\vee}\circ m_V.$$ However, my problem ultimately ends up being that I can't interpret $\phi^{\vee\vee}$ sufficiently well. It should take linear maps $\operatorname{Hom}(V,k)\to k$ to linear maps $\operatorname{Hom}(W,k)\to k$ in a way that is somehow induced by $\phi$, but I'm not sure what this way is. My attempt: $$[\phi^{\vee\vee}(f:V^{\vee}\to k)](g:W\to k)\in k$$ but I get no further than this. I ask purely for clarification as to what a double dual map really is (the several layers of abstraction present in the problem are quite hard for my beginner's mind to handle).","['linear-algebra', 'category-theory']"

My approach, from Fermat's Theorem we know that $x^n + y^n = z^n$ does not hold for $n>2$ . And since there doesn't exist any triplet $x,y,z \in \{1,2\}$ , $x,y,z$ will always be greater than $n$ .
