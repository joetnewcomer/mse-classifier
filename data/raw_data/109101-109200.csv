The line $PQ$ is of form $x+y=c$ , and let $P(t²,2t)$. Since $P$ lies on the line we get $c$ in terms of $t$.

Context of the question: I am trying to make a program that converts a model railway layout created in XtrkCAD into a SCARM layout (scarm.info). Both design applications have a different approach, and a different way of saving the layout to a file. Luckily both use a human readable text file format. XtrkCAD knows the concept of the easement or transition curve, but SCARM doesn't. When converting a layout I now get gaps in the track where XtrkCAD had an easement. When I close that gap using SCARM, it creates a piece of track consisting of a straight part and a circular curve. The following image shows an example. A straight track (length 50) has to be connected to a curved track (radius 276, angular length 56.5 degrees). The red track created by SCARM is a straight track of length 56, followed by a curved track with radius 360 and an angular length of 16.8 degrees.

By theorem 7.11 then, if $\varphi_n(x)$ converges uniformly to $\varphi(x)=\frac{f(x)-f(x/2)}{x/2}$ over a set $E$ and $0$ is a limit point of $E$, then $L=f'(0)$. Let $E=[0,1]$. Then for $x\in E$,
$$\big|\varphi_n(x)-\varphi(x)\big|=a_n\bigg|\frac{xf'(0)-2\big(f(x)-f(x/2)\big)}{x+a_n}\bigg|=a_n\big|f'(0)-\varphi_n(x)\big|\leq a_n\big(|f'(0)|+|\varphi_n(x)|\big)\leq a_n\bigg(|f'(0)|+\bigg|\frac{a_nf'(0)}{x+a_n}\bigg|+\bigg|\frac{2\big(f(x)-f(x/2)\big)}{x+a_n}\bigg|\bigg)< a_n\big(|2f'(0)|+|L|\big)\rightarrow0.$$
So by theorem 7.9, $\varphi_n(x)$ converges uniformly to $\varphi(x)$ over $E$ and therefore $f'(0)=L$. What I don't understand is that couldn't I have put basically anything, say $\pi$, in place of $f'(0)$ in $\varphi_n(x)$ and shown that in fact $L=\pi$? Not sure where I went wrong.

1572567,"If a bilinear functional is continuous at $(0,0)$, then it is continuous everywhere","I need help with this exercise: Let X be a complex Banach space. A bilinear functional on $X\times X$
  is a map $B: X \times X\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ such that for all $x,y
 \in X$, the maps $B(x,\cdot),B(\cdot,y): X \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ are
  both linear. Consider the product space $X\times X$ with the norm
  $\|(x,y)=\|(x,y)\|_{X\times X}=\|x\|+\|y\|$. By $(x_n,y_n)\rightarrow
(x,y)$ we mean convergence in $X\times X$ in this norm. We say that B
  is jointly continuous at $(x,y)\in X\times X$ if
  $(x_n,y_n)\rightarrow(x,y)$ implies $B(x_n,y_n)\rightarrow B(x,y).$ a) Show that if $B: X\times X \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is jointly continous at $(0,0)$ then B is jointly continuous everywhere. (Hint:
  note that bilinearity in particular means that
  $B(x,y)=B(x/\sqrt{s},\sqrt{s}y)$, for $s >0$.) b) Show that if B is jointly continuous everywhere, then there exists a constant $C>0$ such that $|B(x,y)|\le C\|x\|\|y\|$ for all
  $x,y \in X$.(Hint: Banach-Steinhaus). I am struggling with a) but I think I managed b). Do you have any tips for a), and could you check if I solved b correct please? For a), I tried this: Let $(x_n,y_n) \rightarrow (x,y)$. $|B(x_n,y_n)-B(x,y)|=|B(x_n,y_n)-B(x,y_n)+B(x,y_n)-B(x,y)|=|B(x-x_n,y_n)+B(x,y_n-y)|$. But this doesn't seem to lead anywhere. I am also not quite sure how we are supposed to use the hint given. For b) I tried: $|B(x,y)|=|f_x(y)|$, where $f_x(\cdot)=B(x,\cdot)$. Now joint continuity gives continuity in one variable, so we get that: $|f_x(y)|\le\|f_x\|\|y\|$. I will be able to solve the problem if I then can show that $\|f_x\|\le C\|x\|$. If x is the zero vector it is ok. If x is not the zero-vector, we look at the family of operators indexed by x, given by $f_x/\|x\|$. Then if we keep y, then for every operator given by x we have: $|f_x(y)/\|x\||=|B(x,y)|/\|x\|\le \|f_y\|\|x\|/\|x\|=\|f_y\|$. So by the uniform boundedness principle, we have that $\|f_x\|/\|x\|\le C$. (Here we use that X is a Banach-space.) Is b correct? And could you please give some hints for a)?","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces', 'bilinear-form']"

If $E[n]$ admits a point of order $n$, then it has a subgroup which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/n$, and since the dual of $\mathbb{Z}/n$ is $\mu_n$, it should also have a subgroup isomorphic to $\mu_n$, so it must be the direct product?

1572826,"$W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ Is Not Closed Under Multiplication when $s\leq n/p$","For $s\in\mathbb{R}$, $1<p<\infty$, and $n\geq 1$, define the Sobolev space $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ by
    $$W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n}):=\left\{f\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) : \|(\langle{\xi}\rangle^{s}\widehat{f})^{\vee}\|_{L^{p}}<\infty\right\}$$,
equipped with norm
    $$\|f\|_{W^{s,p}}=\|(\langle{\xi}\rangle^{s}\widehat{f})^{\vee}\|_{L^{p}}$$
If $\phi+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\psi(2^{-k}\cdot)=1$ is a Littlewood-Paley partition of unity, then we have the equivalence of norms
    $$\|f\|_{W^{s,p}}\approx \|P_{\leq 0}f\|_{L^{p}}+\left\|\left(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}2^{2ks}|P_{k}f|^{2}\right)^{1/2}\right\|_{L^{p}},$$
where $\widehat{P_{\leq 0}f}=\psi\widehat{f}$ and $\widehat{P_{k}f}=\psi(2^{-k})\widehat{f}$. When $sp> n$, one can show that $W^{s,p}$ is closed under pointwise multiplication. More precisely, Theorem. For $n\geq 1$, $1<p<\infty$, and $s>n/p$, $$\|fg\|_{W^{s,p}}\lesssim_{n,p,s}\|f\|_{W^{s,p}}\|g\|_{W^{s,p}},\quad\forall f,g\in W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$$ I want to show that this result is sharp for any $1<p<\infty$, $n\geq 1$, and $0<s\leq n/p$. Specifically, Problem. For all $n\geq 1$, $0<s\leq n/p$, find a function $f\in W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ such that $f^{2}\notin W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$. The proof of the above theorem with which I am familiar (see Week 4 notes here ) uses the fact that by Sobolev embedding, we can control $\|f\|_{L^{\infty}}$ by $\|f\|_{W^{s,p}}$ and therefore we can control the $L^{\infty}$-norm of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function of $f$, denoted $Mf$, by $\|f\|_{W^{s,p}}$. I believe for $s<n/p$, I can construct a function $f\in W^{s,p}$ which is not bounded. T. Tao writes that one cannot control the $L^{\infty}$ norm by the $W^{s,p}$ norm also when $s=n/p$, but I couldn't show the endpoint case (Edit 1: See below for proof of endpoint case). Consider functions of the function
    $$f_{N}:=N^{-1}\sum_{k=1}^{N}2^{-sk}2^{nk/p}\widehat{\psi}(2^{k}x)$$
where $\psi$ is a nonnegative bump function adapted to the annulus $1\leq|\xi|\leq 2$ and $N\geq 1$ is an integer. Instead of $N^{-1}$, Tao uses $N^{-1/p}$ but I was unable to make that work. I claim that $\|f_{N}\|_{W^{s,p}}\lesssim 1$ (i.e. uniformly in $N$). It's clear from the triangle inequality and dilation invariance that $\|f_{N}\|_{L^{p}}\lesssim 1$. Whence by Young's inequality, $\|P_{\leq 0}f_{N}\|_{L^{p}}\lesssim 1$. By analyzing frequency supports, we see that
    $${P_{k}2^{jn/p}\widehat{\psi}(2^{j}\cdot)}=0,\quad |k-j|> 3$$
Whence,
$$2^{sk}P_{k}f_{N}=N^{-1}\sum_{j=k-3}^{k+3}P_{k}2^{s(k-j)}2^{jn/p}\widehat{\psi}(2^{j})=N^{-1}\sum_{j=-3}^{3}2^{-sj}P_{k}2^{(k+j)n/p}\widehat{\psi}(2^{j+k})$$
where terms with negative indices are defined to be zero. Thus by nesting of $\ell^{p}$ spaces and the above observations, we have that
\begin{align*}
\left(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|2^{sk}P_{k}f_{N}|^{2}\right)^{1/2}\lesssim_{n,s,p} N^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{k=j-3}^{j+3}|P_{k}2^{nj/p}\widehat{\psi}(2^{j})|
\end{align*}
By triangle inequality, Young's inequality, dilation invariance, we obtain that
$$\left\|N^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{k=j-3}^{j+3}|P_{k}2^{nj/p}\widehat{\psi}(2^{j})|\right\|_{L^{p}}\lesssim_{n,s}N^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\|2^{nj/p}\widehat{\psi}(2^{j})\|_{L^{p}}=\|\widehat{\psi}\|_{L^{p}}$$ But since $\widehat{\psi}(0)=\int\psi dx=c>0$, it follows that
    $$\|f_{N}\|_{L^{\infty}}\gtrsim N^{-1}\sum_{k=1}^{N}2^{k(n/p-s)}\rightarrow\infty,$$
as $N\rightarrow\infty$, since $s<n/p$. By taking an increasing sequence $N_{k}\rightarrow\infty$ such that $\|f_{N_{k}}\|_{L^{\infty}}$ is suitably large, one can probaby construct a $W^{s,p}$ function of the form $f=\sum_{k}2^{-k}f_{N_{k}}$ such that $\|f\|_{L^{\infty}}=\infty$, but I don't see how to apply this to show what I want. Edit 1: I believe I have figured out how to show the endpoint case $s=n/p$ in the claim that $\|\cdot\|_{W^{s,p}}$ does not control $\|\cdot\|_{L^{\infty}}$. Consider functions of the function
    $$f_{N}:=\sum_{k=1}^{N}2^{-sk}2^{nk/p}\widehat{\psi}(2^{k}x)$$
where $\psi$ is a nonnegative bump function adapted to the annulus $1\leq|\xi|\leq 2$ and $N\geq 1$ is an integer. I claim that $\|f_{N}\|_{W^{s,p}}\lesssim_{n,s,p}N^{1/p}$ (i.e. uniformly in $N$). It's clear from the triangle inequality and dilation invariance that $\|f_{N}\|_{L^{p}}\lesssim N^{1/p}$. Whence by Young's inequality, $\|P_{\leq 0}f_{N}\|_{L^{p}}\lesssim N^{1/p}$. By analyzing frequency supports, we see that
    $${P_{k}2^{jn/p}\widehat{\psi}(2^{j}\cdot)}=0,\quad |k-j|> 3$$
Whence,
$$2^{sk}P_{k}f_{N}=\sum_{j=k-3}^{k+3}P_{k}2^{s(k-j)}2^{jn/p}\widehat{\psi}(2^{j})=\sum_{j=-3}^{3}2^{-sj}P_{k}2^{(k+j)n/p}\widehat{\psi}(2^{j+k})$$
where terms with negative indices are defined to be zero. By the upper Littlewood-Paley inequality,
\begin{align*}
\left\|\left(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}2^{2sk}|P_{k}f_{N}|^{2}\right)^{1/2}\right\|_{L^{p}}&\lesssim_{n,s,p}\left\|\left(\sum_{j=1}^{N}2^{2jn/p}|\widehat{\psi}(2^{j}\cdot)|^{2}\right)^{1/2}\right\|_{L^{p}}\\
&\leq\left\|\sum_{j=1}^{N}2^{jn/p}|\widehat{\psi}(2^{j}\cdot)|\right\|_{L^{p}}
\end{align*}
by the nesting property. Since $\widehat{\psi}$ is a Schwartz function adapted to a ball of radius $O(1)$, we have that
$$\sum_{j=1}^{N}2^{jn/p}|\widehat{\psi}(2^{j}x)|\lesssim_{M}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\dfrac{1}{(1+|2^{j}x|)^{M}}$$
for any $M\geq 0$. So for integer $N-1\geq k\geq 0$,
\begin{align*}
\int_{2^{-k-1}\leq|x|\leq 2^{-k}}\left|\sum_{j=1}^{N}2^{jn/p}|\widehat{\psi}(2^{j}x)|\right|^{p}dx&\lesssim_{M}\int_{2^{-k-1}\leq|x|\leq 2^{-k}}\left|\sum_{j=1}^{k}2^{jn/p}+\sum_{j=k+1}^{N}\dfrac{2^{jn/p}}{(1+|2^{j}x|)^{M}}\right|^{p}dx\\
&\lesssim\int_{2^{-k}\leq|x|\leq 2^{-k-1}}\left|2^{kn/p}+\sum_{j=k+1}^{N}\dfrac{2^{jn/p}}{(1+|2^{j}x|)^{M}}\right|^{p}dx\\
\end{align*}
The second term in the integrand is bounded from above by a decreasing, convergent geometric series, provided $M$ is sufficiently large, and is therefore comparable to its first term $\sim 2^{kn/p}$. Whence the above is majorized by
\begin{align*}
\lesssim\int_{2^{-k-1}\leq|x|\leq 2^{-k}}2^{kn}dx\sim_{n} 1
\end{align*}
For $k\leq N$, we the estimate
$$\int_{|x|\leq 2^{-N}}\left|\sum_{j=1}^{N}2^{jn/p}|\widehat{\psi}(2^{j}x)|\right|^{p}dx\lesssim\int_{|x|\leq 2^{-N}}2^{Nn}dx\sim_{n}1$$
For $|x|\geq 1$, rapid decay gives the estimate
\begin{align*}
\int_{|x|\geq 1}\left|\sum_{j=1}^{N}2^{jn/p}|\widehat{\psi}(2^{j}x)|\right|^{p}dx\lesssim_{M}\int_{|x|\geq 1}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{N}2^{jn/p}|2^{j}x|^{-M}\right)^{p}dx\lesssim_{n,M,p}1,
\end{align*}
provided $M$ is sufficiently large. Combining the estimates and adding up the pieces of the integral, we conclude that
\begin{align*}
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\left|\sum_{j=1}^{N}2^{jn/p}|\widehat{\psi}(2^{j}x)|\right|^{p}dx&\lesssim_{n,p} N
\end{align*}

I am looking to learn topics such as Lie derivative, covarient-contravarient derivatives, pushforward pullback operations, Riemannian manifolds, moving frames, etc. As I am not from math major, I am confused over many previous questions asking suggestions for differential geometry, such as this , this , this , and many other answers on the similar questions. From search on good books on the topic, I found out O'neill's Elementary Differential Geometry is meant for first course on the differential geometry. However, as I have very limited knowledge about the differential geometry, I am not sure whether this would be good starting point. Can someone suggest me a good reference (and prerequisites, if necessary,for studying above topics)?

Obviously if x is a member of the set of square numbers, it makes sense that there must be a number in the given universe of discourse that can be squared to get x. However, the equivalence I'm struggling with is a hang-up for me.

1573115,"The universal cover of a path-connected, locally path-connected space $X$ covers any other covering space","I'm currently reading Hatcher's Algebraic topology book. In page 68 he says: A consequence of the lifting criterion is that a simply-connected covering space of a path-connected, locally path-connected space $X$ is a covering space of every other path-connected covering space of $X$ A simply-connected covering space of $X$ is therefore called a universal cover. It is unique up to isomorphism, so one is justified in calling it the universal covering. Let's precise that a little bit. Let $X$ be a path-connected, locally path-connected space and $x_0\in X$. Let $p_1:(\tilde{X}_1,\tilde{x}_1)\to (X,x_0)$ be a simply-connected covering space and $p_2:(\tilde{X}_2,\tilde{x}_2)\to (X,x_0)$ be any other path-connected covering space. Using the fact that $\tilde{X}_1$ is simply connected and the lifting criterion one can find a map $\tilde{p}_1:(\tilde{X}_1,\tilde{x}_1)\to(\tilde{X}_2,\tilde{x}_2)$ such that $p_2\tilde{p}_1=p_1$ and $\tilde{p}_1$ must be the desired covering map. Note that this is where one uses the hypothesis $X$ path connected and locally path-connected and $\tilde X_1$ and $\tilde X_2$ both path-connected However I'm having some trouble proving it. Let $x\in \tilde{X}_2$ then $p_2(x)\in X$ and there is a nbd $U$ of $p_2(x)$ such that $p^{-1}_1(U)=\cup_i V_i$ where the $V_i$ are open and disjoint subsets of $\tilde{X}_1$ and $p|V_i:V_i\to U$ is an homeomorphism. The desired nbd of $x$ that makes $\tilde{p}_1$ into a covering map should be $p^{-1}_2(U)$. We have $\tilde{p}_1^{-1}(p^{-1}_2(U))=p^{-1}_1(U)$ and then one expects that $\tilde{p}_1|V_i:V_i\to p_2^{-1}(U)$ is an homeomorphism to make this work. But I can't prove that last statement, I'm not even sure it's surjective (Hatcher doesn't assume covering spaces to be surjective). Is this the right approach? Or maybe there is a simpler way to do it.","['algebraic-topology', 'general-topology', 'covering-spaces']"
1573147,Question on the distribution of eigenvalues in a square matrix with random entries.,"Let square matrix $A$ of size $n \times n$, have entries that have been independently sampled from a uniform distribution between $[a_1,a_2]$. The symmetric part of $A$, $A_s$ is defined as $\frac{1}{2}(A+A^T)$. The question I have is what distribution will the eigenvalues of the symmetric part $A_s$ fall under? My Approach: My exploration began by looking at the characteristic polynomial of $A_s$ $$P_A(t) = det(tI - A_s)$$ The roots of the characteristic polynomial will be the eigenvalues of the $A_s$. By Leibniz's formula the determinant will be equal to: 
$$det(M) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n}{sgn(\sigma)\prod_{i=1}^{n}{m_{i,\sigma_i}}}$$
Where the sum is computed over all the permutations of $\{1,2,3,...n\}$, and $sgn$ is the parity of the permutation. My intuition from looking at Leibniz's formula tells me that the eigenvalues should also be distributed uniformly bounded by new constants. But I have not found a way to show this. Any help is much appreciated.","['matrices', 'probability', 'linear-algebra']"
1573158,Zariski topology questions from Atiyah and Macdonald's Introduction to Commutative Algebra,"Exercise 17 in Chapter 1 in Atiyah and Macdonald's Introduction to Commutative Algebra introduces the Zariski topology. There are 7 subquestions, of which 4 I've solved on my own, but the last couple are throwing me off. (iv) $X_f=X_g \Leftrightarrow r((f))=r((g))$, where $X_f$ signifies
  the basic open sets of the Zariski topology, otherwise defined as the
  complement $V(f)^c$, and ""r"" is for radical. There's a ton of such mini questions on the Zariski topology and I've probably gotten a little tired of them because for some reason I can't get past this one! Also, I proved that X is quasi-compact (=compact, really... they want to reserve compact for Hausdorff). But then the exercise reads: vi) Specifically, each $X_f$ is quasi-compact. I can't see why, I can't seem to extend my proof for $X$ quasi-compact to force each $X_f$ to be quasi-compact too. Lastly, vii) An open subset of $X$ is quasi-compact $\Leftrightarrow$ it is a
  finite union of sets $X_f$ Since the finite union of compact spaces is compact, the $<=$ direction is trivial. But the $=>$ direction seems a lot like part vi), I just don't see the connection between $X$ and $X_f$. Any help is much appreciated.

I don't have much certainty if this proof is OK, and one's opinion would be appreciated. Here's my attempt: Suppose that there exists such a group $G$ that satisfies the above condition. Since $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is cyclic, ${\rm Aut}(G)$ is also cyclic and $G$ is abelian, which implies that ${\rm Inn}(G)\cong \{e\}$ . Thus ${\rm Aut}(G)={\rm Out}(G)$ . (I don't think this fact is important here though) . Now, since an automorphism sends a generator to a generator, and since each automorphism is completely determined by such mapping, $|{\rm Aut}(G)|$ must be of factorial order. But an integer factorial is always even. However, $|\mathbb{Z}_n|$ is odd, which is a contradiction. Therefore, no such $G$ exists. I'm afraid that my proof is not very nice, but at least a genuine attempt was made.","['automorphism-group', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-isomorphism', 'cyclic-groups', 'group-theory']"

Proof of the lemma: Consider a partition of $[a,b]$ such that its width is less than $\delta>0$. Then the absolute value of Riemann sum corresponding to this partition is less than $2 \delta $. So for any $\epsilon>0$ we can choose $\delta=\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and we will have $|S|<\epsilon$ whenever $S$ is a Riemann sum corresponding to a partition of width less than $\delta$. Proof of the main result: Choose $\epsilon>0$. From the above lemma and linearity of the Riemann integral, we know that $$\int_{\epsilon/2}^1f(x)dx=0 \mbox{.}$$ Thus there is a step function $g:[\frac{\epsilon}{2},1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $0\le f(x)\le g(x)$ for all $x\in[\frac{\epsilon}{2},1]$ and $$ \int_{\epsilon/2}^1 g(x)dx <\epsilon /2 \mbox{.}$$ Define a new step function $h:[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $h(x)=g(x)$ if $x\in  [\frac{\epsilon}{2},1]$ and $h(x)=1$ if $x\in [0,\frac{\epsilon}{2})$. It is clear that for all $x\in [0,1]$ we have $$0\le f(x) \le h(x) \mbox{.}$$ Also $$ \int_{0}^1 h(x)dx = \int_{0}^{\epsilon/2} dx  + \int_{\epsilon/2}^1 g(x)dx <\epsilon /2+ \epsilon /2 =\epsilon \mbox{.}$$ Thus we proved that $f$ is integrable. It remains to show that the integral $\int_0^1 f(x)dx$ is equal to $0$. We know that $\int_0^1 f(x)dx$ exists and however small $\alpha$ we choose, the integral $\int_{\alpha}^1 f(x)dx$ also exists and is equal to $0$. The result follows from continuity of the integral.

From a previous part of this problem, I computed the limit of $\large \frac{k(r_0)^2}{\pi(x^2+y^2+r_0^2)}$, which is equal to $0$ for all $(x,y)\ne(0,0)$, and equal to $\infty$ at $(x,y) = (0,0)$. Also, I computed the integral of $\large \frac{k(r_0)^2}{\pi(x^2+y^2+r_0^2)}$ inside the disk of radius $R$, centered at $(0,0)$, and got $\large \frac{kR^2}{R^2-r_0^2}$. So, now we see that the integral of $\large \frac{k(r_0)^2}{\pi(x^2+y^2+r_0^2)}$ $\to$ $k$, as $r_0 \to 0$.  I.e., we get a bump of $k$ in a neighborhood of $(0,0)$. Now, back to the above limit that I want to evaluate.  A simple check of the integrand shows that we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem for $(x,y)\ne(0,0)$.  Then we have that $$\lim_{r_0 \to 0} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{f(x,y)k(r_0)^2}{\pi(x^2+y^2+r_0^2)}dxdy =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\lim_{r_0 \to 0}\frac{f(x,y)k(r_0)^2}{\pi(x^2+y^2+r_0^2)}dxdy$$ $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}0dxdy = 0 $$ for all $(x,y) \ne (0,0)$.

1573556,"Exists homeomorphism which carries each fiber isomorphically to itself, composition?","Let $\mu$ and $\mu'$ be two different Euclidean metrics on the same vector bundle $\xi$. How do I see that there exists a homeomorphism $f: E(\xi) \to E(\xi)$ which carries each fiber isomorphically onto itself, so that the composition $\mu \circ f: E(\xi) \to \mathbb{R}$ is equal to $\mu'$? Thoughts so far. Every positive definite matrix $A$ can be expressed uniquely as the square of a positive definite matrix $\sqrt{A}$. The power series expansion$$\sqrt{tI + X} = \sqrt{t}\left( I + {1\over{2t}} - {1\over{8t^2}}X^2 + \dots\right),$$is valid provided that the characteristic roots of $tI + X = A$ lie between $0$ and $2t$. This shows that the function $A \mapsto \sqrt{A}$ is smooth. But I am not sure how to complete. Can anyone help? Notation. Let $B$ denote a fixed topological space, which will be called the base space. A real vector bundle $\xi$ over $B$ consists of the following: a topological space $E = E(\xi)$ called the total space, a (continuous) map $\pi: E \to B$ called the projection map, and for each $b \in B$ the structure of a vector space over the real numbers in the set $\pi^{-1}(b)$. A Euclidean vector bundle is a real vector bundle $\xi$ together with a continuous function$$\mu: E(\xi) \to \mathbb{R}$$such that the restriction of $\mu$ to each fiber of $\xi$ is positive definite and quadratic. The function $\mu$ itself will be called a Euclidean metric on the vector bundle $\xi$.","['differential-topology', 'characteristic-classes', 'general-topology', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

1573583,Transforming the integral $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2}\sin(x) dx$ into a specific sum,"Using the series representation of $\sin x$, I want to prove that: $$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} \sin(x) dx = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{k!}{(2k+1)!}$$ My attempt: I've started by substituting $\sin$ with his power series representation: $$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} \sin(x) dx = \int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k x^{1+2k}}{(1+2k)!} dx \space\space\space\space\space\space\space(1)$$ I don't really know how to continue from there. It seems obvious that I also need to replace $e^{-x^2}$ with it's power series representation $\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{({-x^2})^k}{k!}$, but should I pull $e^{-x^2}$ into the sum that I replaced $\sin$ with, before I insert this second sum? Or should I rather keep these two sums seperate? Either way, I'll end up with two sums. One of the theorems that I can use states that, given a sequence $f_n: \mathbb{R} \to [0, ∞]$ of measurable functions, I have that $$\int_\mathbb{R} (\sum_{k=0}^\infty f_n) d\mu = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \int_\mathbb{R} f_n d\mu$$ So what I would want to do, is rearrange the expression $(1)$ so that I can use this theorem and pull the integral into the sum, in order to then evaluate the integral by integrating each of the $f_n$. But the problem is that $\frac{(-1)^k x^{1+2k}}{(1+2k)!}$ is negative for each odd $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and therefore, $\frac{(-1)^k x^{1+2k}}{(1+2k)!}$ isn't always $≥ 0$, as I needed to be, if I wanted to use the theorem. (And since $e^{-x^2} ≥ 0 \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$, the product of $\frac{(-1)^k x^{1+2k}}{(1+2k)!}$ and $e^{-x^2}$ would give me the same problem, would it?)

1573647,Construct a martingale from a Poisson Process,"Let $X_t = \sum_{i=1}^{N_t} Y_i$ and $N_t$ be a Poisson process with
  intensity $\lambda >0$. Suppose $Y_i$ are i.i.d. (independent of
  $N_t$) with normal distribution $N(m,\sigma^2)$. Determine $\mu>0$
  such that $\exp(X_t-\mu t)$ is a martingale. My attempt: I compute:
$E[e^{u X_t}] = e^{(\lambda t) \exp(u m + 0.5 u \sigma ^2)}$. Then, 
$$\begin{align*} E[\exp{(X_t)} \mid F_s] &= E[\exp{(X_t - X_s + X_s)} \mid F_s] = E[\exp{(X_{t-s})}]e^{X_s} \\ &= e^{(\lambda (t-s)) \exp(u m + 0.5 u \sigma ^2)}e^{X_s}\end{align*}$$ So, 
$E[\exp{(X_t - \mu t)} \mid F_s] = e^{(\lambda (t-s)) \exp(u m + 0.5 u \sigma ^2)}e^{X_s}e^{-\mu t}$ So martingale condition holds if and only if $e^{(\lambda (t-s)) \exp(u m + 0.5 u \sigma ^2)}e^{X_s}e^{-\mu t} = e^{X_s - \mu s}$ But I cannot find $\mu$ from this equation.","['poisson-process', 'probability-theory', 'martingales']"
