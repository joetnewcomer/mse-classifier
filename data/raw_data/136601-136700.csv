2172307,Natural filtration and Kolmogorov existence theorem,"Consider a stochastic process $(X_t)_{t \in T}$ where $T\subseteq[0,\infty)$. The natural filtration $\mathscr F^X=(\mathscr F_t^X)_{t \in T}$ is defined by $$\mathscr F_t^X=\sigma\{X_s^{-1}(B)|0\lt s\le t,B\in\mathscr B(\Bbb R) \}$$ In a book I have read, the author wants to define a mapping $$\psi:\omega\mapsto (X_t)_{t\in T}(\omega):=(\omega(t))_{t\in T}$$
from the underlying probability space $(\Omega,\mathscr A, P)$ to a measure space $(\Bbb R^T, \mathscr S_{cyl})$, the space of sample paths with the sigma-algebra generated by the cylinder-sets. Thus, $$\Bbb R^T=\{f:T\to \Bbb R\}\qquad\mathscr S_{cyl}=\sigma \{f∈\Bbb R^T:\forall i=1,2,...,n,\ f(t_i)\in B_i\}$$ and $$X_t:(\Bbb R^T, \mathscr S_{cyl})\to(\mathbb R,\mathcal B(\mathbb R)),\quad X_t(f)=f(t)$$ is the coordinate mapping
in order to use the Kolmogorov Existence Theorem to construct a probability distribution between the time instance $0\le t_1\le\cdots\le t_n\le T$. Equivalently they use a separable process and define the natural filtration $\mathscr G=(\mathscr G_t)$ as the sigma algebras $\mathscr G_t$ generated by the following cylinder sets
$$A=\{\omega \in \Omega:\forall i=1,2,...,n,\ X_{s_i}(\omega) \in B_i\}$$ for $0\le s_1\le.....\le s_n \le t$. My questions are: 1.Where is the natural filtration $\mathscr G$ defined? On $(\Bbb R^T, \mathscr S_{cyl})$? Where is the equivalence to the usual definition $\mathscr F^X$ given above? 2. If I want to calculate the expectation value $E[X^*_t]$ with $$X^*_t=\sup_{0\le t\le T} X_t$$ am I calculating it on $(\Bbb R^T, \mathscr S_{cyl})$ or $(\Omega,\mathscr A, P)$?

A function $f$ is measurable if $f^{-1}((a , \infty)) = \{x : f(x) > a\} \in \mathscr{M}$ for every $a \in \mathbb{R}$. Ok so this is what I have so far: Consider two cases: $a < 0$ and $a \geq 0$.

2172423,Are there infinitely many primes of the form $3^p-4$?,"My question is the same as you saw: Are there infinitely many primes of the form $3^p-4$, when $p$ prime? I'm a complete novice in this type of questions with few or no theoretical background. Um, so I could only try it by brute-force for all primes $p<15,000$. Then, I found something interesting: it seems not so plausible, because $p$ with $3^p-4$ prime gets rapidly rare, as $p$ increases. The complete list when $p<15,000$ is: $\{2,3,5,31,37,41,53,73,101,557\}$. The largest integer $n<15,000$ with $3^n-4$ prime I found is $4823=7\times 13\times 53$.

2172476,Question about contraction of a differential form,"Let $G$ be a Lie group acting on a manifold $M$. Then for any $g\in G$ we can define the map $\phi_g\colon M\to M$ by $m\mapsto g\cdot m$. This gives rise to a representation of $G$ on the ring of differential forms $\Omega(M)$ via
$$\rho_g\omega=(\phi_g^{-1})^*(\omega).$$
The Lie algebra also has the respresentation
$$L_X\omega= \frac{d}{dt} (\rho_{\exp t X} \omega)|_{t=0}.$$ With these definitions, I can easily show that $\rho_g L_X \rho_g^{-1}=L_{Ad_g X}$. I am reading a text where it is claimed that $$\rho_g \iota_X \rho_g^{-1}=\iota_{Ad_g X}.$$ (1) I'm not quite sure about the meaning of the interior product in this context. The only reasonable one seems to be the contraction by $L_X$ since $L_X$ can be applied to $0$-forms, and we can think of it as a vector field on $M$. (2) Can someone please sketch the proof of the claim please? (The reason that I find it confusing it that if $\omega$ is an $n$-form, then $\iota_X \rho_g^{-1}$ is an $(n-1)$-form and when we apply $\rho_g$ to this $(n-1)$ form, according to my interpretation, $\rho_g$ does not affect the first slot of $\omega$. It is not quite clear to me how contraction with $Ad_g X$ is created on the right because this concerns exactly the first slot of $\omega$.)","['differential-geometry', 'lie-groups']"

2172533,"Confusion on three ""types"" of Markov Chain Monte Carlo for the same inference","This is a long question but I would be very grateful if someone can help or provide some reference! And I believe this is a common confusion among beginners of MCMC. Background Given a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ where $V$ is the vertex set and $E\subseteq V^2$ , define a labeling function $z:V \to \{1,...,k\}$ where $z$ partitions the graph in to multiple "" communities "" or "" groups "" or so-called "" planted partitions "" $C_1,...,C_k$ $C_i=\{v\in V: z(v)=i\}$ and $z(v),v\in V$ can be viewed as the ""membership"" of vertex $v$ . Now also define: A cross-group edge probability matrix, or the so-called stochastic block matrix ${\bf P}$ where a vertex in partition $i$ has probability ${\bf P}(i,j)$ with a vertex in partition $j$ . $e_{i,j}$ is the number of edges between partition $i$ and partition $j$ observed in $E$ , $n_{i,j}$ is the maximum number of edges between partition $i$ and partition $j$ . Note $e_{i,j}$ and $n_{i,j}$ are determined by $z$ , or we can say they are functions of $z$ . We assume the edge set is generated by the following simple process: for every pair of nodes $u,v$ , let $(u,v) \in E$ by probability ${\bf P}(z(u),z(v))$ . This is the so-called standard stochastic block model. The probability of $E$ given $z,\bf P$ is $\mathbb{P}\left( {E|{z},{\mathbf{P}}} \right) = \mathop \prod \limits_{i,j \in \{ 1, \ldots ,k\} } {\mathbf{P}}{(i,j)^{{e_{i,j}}}}{\left( {1 - {\mathbf{P}}(i,j)} \right)^{{n_{i,j}} - {e_{i,j}}}}$ whose log-likelihood (the MLE of ${\bf P}(i,j)$ is simply $\frac{e_{i,j}}{n_{i,j}}$ , plug this back in above $\Bbb P$ , take log and after some calculation) is $\ln \mathcal{L}\left( z \right) = \mathop \sum \limits_{i,j \in \left\{ {1, \ldots ,k} \right\}} {e_{i,j}}\ln {e_{i,j}} - {n_{i,j}}\ln {n_{i,j}} + \left( {{n_{i,j}} - {e_{i,j}}} \right)\ln \left( {{n_{i,j}} - {e_{i,j}}} \right)$ there is a simplified likelihood when $E$ is assumed sparse, $\ln \mathcal{L} = \mathop \sum \limits_{i,j \in \left\{ {1, \ldots ,k} \right\}} {e_{i,j}}\ln \frac{{{e_{i,j}}}}{{{n_{i,j}}}}$ Markov Chain Monte Carlo Now the job is to infer $z$ . I encountered three different methods that claim themselves as ""Markov Chain Monte Carlo"", or ""Gibbs Sampler"" in different literature. Some of them are not rigorous math or statistics, so they may be wrong and are causing confusions to me. The same idea among them is to change or ""re-sample"" the membership of each vertexes one by one, the difference is how to make the change. Suppose now we are changing the membership of vertex $v$ , Type I. Let $z(v)$ be the one that mostly increases $\ln \cal L$ , that is, $z(v) = \arg {\max _{z(v) \in \{ 1,...,k\} }}\ln \mathcal{L}(z)$ . I am not sure but this does not look like Monte Carlo to me . It looks more like coordinate ascent from optimization. The computation of above is actually not very high, since changing $z(v)$ only requires re-computation of some of $e_{i,j}$ and $n_{i,j}$ . However, Type I makes most sense to me because it tries to maximize the likelihood. Type II. Re-sample $z(v)$ based on the distribution conditioned on $E$ and other values of $z$ , i.e. re-sample based on $\mathbb{P}\left( {z(v)|{z^{( - v)}},E} \right)$ where $z^{(-v)}$ denotes ""given all other values of $z$ "". If we assume the prior of $z$ as uniform, then it is easy to see $\mathbb{P}\left( {z(v)|{z^{( - v)}},E} \right) \propto \mathbb{P}\left( {E|{z^{( - v)}},z(v)} \right)$ through Bayesian's formula, then we basically just re-sample proportional to the likelihood ${\cal L}({z^{( - v)}},z(v))$ . This seems the standard Gibbs sampler that I learned from class , and its stationary distribution is $\mathbb{P}\left( {z|E} \right)$ . But this does not make sense to me . Why sampling $z(v)$ while we can just greedily choose the best one as in Type I? Type III. Randomly choose $t$ from $1,...,k$ , and let $z(v)$ be reassigned as $t$ with probability $\mathbb{P}\left( {z(v) = t|{z^{( - v)}},E} \right)$ (or we say the proposal of $z(v)=t$ is accepted), and let $z(v)$ remains where it was with probability $1-\mathbb{P}\left( {z(v) = t|{z^{( - v)}},E} \right)$ (or we say the proposal of $z(v)=t$ is rejected). This is Monte Carlo, but I am not sure if it is equivalent to type II , not sure if it has $\mathbb{P}\left( {z|E} \right)$ as the stationary distribution. Also I am puzzled why we are doing this ?","['markov-chains', 'monte-carlo', 'probability']"

2172729,Average Length of Longest Palindromic Subsequence,"Suppose there is a finite set $A$ containing $n$ elements. One can construct a sequence of  finite length: $$\{a_i\},\ a_i \in A,\  i\in \mathbb N,\ i\le N$$ This sequence contains $2^N$ subsequences of the form: $$\{ a_{i_k}\}, k\in \mathbb N,\ k\le M\le N,\ i_k>i_{k-1}$$ Such a subsequence is palindromic iff $a_{i_{M+1-k}} = a_{i_k}\ \forall k$ . The length of the longest such palindromic subsequence can thus be defined as: $$M_p\{a_i\} = \max\{|\{a_{i_k}\}|:a_{i_{M+1-k}} = a_{i_k}\ \forall k\}$$ The algorithm to find $M_p$ is a well known dynamic programming problem, but after implementing it I found an interesting behavior. The average proportional length of the longest palindromic subsequence can be written as: $$\pi(N) = \left\langle\frac{M_p\{a_i\}}{N}\right\rangle$$ where $\left\langle\right\rangle$ denotes an average over all $\{a_i\}$ of length $N$ . In principle, a random sampling should provide a good approximation. Numerically, it appears that $\lim_{N\to\infty}\pi(N)$ converges to a constant depending only on the $n$ , the number of elements from which the sequence is constructed. For binary sequences, this limit appears to be $\approx 0.8$ , while for $n=10$ , it appears to be $\approx 0.45$ . The fact that the limit converges to a constant other than $1$ or $0$ indicates that the longest palindrome scales linearly with the length of the sequence, and that the calculated values appear to be rational numbers quite curious. Here are some rough approximations of $\lim_{N\to\infty}\pi_n(N)$ , generated using 256 random sequences of length 256. $\sigma$ indicates the standard deviation of the distribution, not the sample mean. \begin{array}{c|lcr}

If we further say that these must be compressibly repeating (as non-compressible repeating substrings don't reduce grammar size), then: # generators = 5:
[A -> cab, B -> bca, C -> ab, D -> bc, E -> abc]
# group elems = 69:

Was wondering what other methods can be used to reduce the size of the action group and thus the computation time of a recursive smallest grammar algorithm. Details We define the left action of a grammar rule such as $A\to abc$, on the string $s = abcabc$ (for example) by taking the leftmost occurrence of $abc \leqslant s$ and collapsing it to the variable $A$.  Applying $A$ twice yields $A^2 \circ s = AA$ in this case.  Applying a 3rd time restarts the process via expanding all $A$ occurences.  Since a smallest grammar expanded fully (up to pure literal rules) always has a leftmost variable occurence, or if it doesn't, you can transfer over to one that does, we believe one could enumerate all possible near-fully expanded grammars by acting on the start string $s$ with the set of all irreducible (and compressibly repeating) rules.  Once you have this enumeration, you then recurse (see the above links).  Of course, without any more study of this, the algorithm does appear to be non-polynomial in complexity class. Is there a way to filter out more ""fruitless"" elements from the group $G(s)$? For example, I'm next going to look into when $\text{RHS}(A) \leqslant \text{RHS}(B)$ as strings.  Since then you can't have both literal rules appear in a smallest grammar. Here is some of the code. import re   # For creating unique variable names

It's pretty interesting that by translating the graph of a function by some vector we get the graph of its derivative. Therefore, here's my attempt: I tried to find the defining property of this function. Here we go:
$$ f'(x)= f(x+\frac{\pi}{2}) $$ That makes
$$ f''(x)= \left( f'(x)\right)'= f(x+\frac{\pi}{2})'=f'(x+\frac{\pi}{2})=f(x+\pi)$$
Generally $$f^n(x)=f(x+n\frac{\pi}{2})$$
With $f^n(x) $ being the $n$-th derivative of $f$.
 And I'm stuck at this step. What makes cosine adapt to this property is that $ \cos (x+\pi)=-\cos x$ which allows it to be the solution of the following differential equation:
$$f''(x)+f(x)=0$$

I have proven a very simple case: If $1 < m \in\mathbb{N}$, then there are infinitely many positive integer $n$ such that $\sqrt[n]m$ is irrational. To show this, I argue by noting the polynomial, $$ p(x) = x^n -m$$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}$[x] for $n > m$, hence it is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ as it is also primitive. So there are no rational solutions to $x^n = m$.  And $\sqrt[n]m$ is irrational. How do I prove the general case?

2173335,Tricky steepest descent applied to an inverse Fourier transform,"I answered a question a while ago on solving a PDE, and ended up with the solution in terms of an inverse Fourier transform but left it at that. I'm curious to try and approximate it now, using the method of steepest descent. The integral is explicitly given by, $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\mathrm dk}{2\pi} \,\underbrace{e^{ixk}}_{f(k)} \, \exp \underbrace{\left[t \left( ik-ak^2-ibk^3\right)\right]}_{t\phi(k)}$$ for $t\geq 0$ and $a,b \neq 0$. I would be interested in the behaviour as $t\to\infty$. As I understand it, the method of steepest descents is considering the integral over contours of constant $\mathrm{Im} \, \phi(k)$, and applying Watson's lemma (or the Laplace method for just the first term in the asymptotic expansion). If we take $k = x+iy$, then $\mathrm{Im}\, \phi(k) = x - bx^3-2axy + 3bxy^2 $ which we desire to be constant. I have a plot of these contours for $a = b = 1$ and $\phi = 1$ (blue) as well as $\phi = -1$ (red): Changing the sign of $b$ gives completely different contours, so I'll settle for thinking of $b > 0$ for now. Now, the integrand has no poles, so the integral over any Jordan curve must vanish. However, if I am to apply this to compute the integrals over all the contours, I still have the problem that I cannot use these to form a closed curve; they only seem to 'meet' at infinity and asymptote some line. How would one go about applying steepest descents in this case? In addition, one of the contours must be along $(-\infty, \infty)$ on the real axis, but it seems I can only 'join' with the contours at two finite points. However, in the limit $c \to \infty$ for $\mathrm{Im} \, \phi = -c$, there is a contour, since the left and right contours spread out. Any other approaches to the integral other than steepest descents is of course also appreciated.","['complex-analysis', 'asymptotics', 'fourier-transform']"

2173712,Pigeonhole height problem?,"Ten people of diﬀerent heights line up in a row. Show that it is always possible to select four of them to step sideways to form a shorter row in which their heights from left to right are either increasing or decreasing. I have the solution, but I need help understanding why it makes sense. SOLUTION. Let ak denote the height of the k-th person from the left, for $k = 1,...,10$. We will show that we can select subindices
k1 < k2 < k3 < k4 from among {1,2,...,10} such that either ak1 < ak2 < ak3 < ak4 (Case 1: increasing heights) or else ak1 > ak2 > ak3 > ak4 (Case 2: decreasing heights).
To see this, assume that there do not exist 4 subindices giving increasing heights (Case 1). We will show we can then ﬁnd 4 subindices giving Case 2.
Deﬁne mk to be the length of the longest subsequence of increasing heights to the right, starting at position k. Then 1 ≤ mk ≤ 3, since Case 1 never holds. So we have 10 integers {m1,m2,...,m10}, each of which is 1,2 or 3. Consequently the Generalized Pigeonhole Principle implies that at least 4 of them are equal, say
mk1 = mk2 = mk3 = mk4.
But this implies that Case 2 is valid for these indices. To see this, note for instance that mk1 = mk2 implies ak1 > ak2, since otherwise mk1 would be strictly greater than mk2. Okay, so assuming that there will never be a case where you can pick 4 people and get increasing heights, that means that the longest subsequence is 3. I understand up to these part. But why would you assign the values 1, 2 or 3 to ten different integers? How do we even get these 10 integers to assign 1, 2, or 3 subsequences from? I also understand from basic pigeonhole principle that at least 4 of them must be equal. So if at least 4 of them have the same subsequences, how would that imply that if you pick 4 people, they would be from increasing to decreasing.","['combinatorics', 'pigeonhole-principle']"

2173864,Applying L'Hospital's rule to The Fundamental theorem of Calculus,"The definite integral of a function $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ as the limit of a sum is:
$$\int_a^bf(x)dx=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}h(f(a)+f(a+h)+.. ..+f(a+(n-2)h)+f(a+(n-1)h))$$
where $h=\frac{b-a}{n}$. So, replacing $h$ with $\frac{b-a}{n}$ gives: $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}(b-a)\frac{f(a)+f\left(a+\frac{b-a}{n}\right)+.. ..+f\left(a+(n-2)\frac{b-a}{n}\right)+f\left(a+(n-1)\frac{b-a}{n}\right)}{n}$$ This seems to be of the form $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ because the numerator is an infinite sum and the denominator also tends to infinity, so I think L'Hospital's rule can be applied. So, applying L'Hospital's rule gives:
$$\int_a^bf(x)dx=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{(b-a)^2}{n^2}\left(-f'\left(a+\frac{b-a}{n}\right)-2f'\left(a+2\frac{(b-a)}{n}\right)-3f'\left(a+3\frac{(b-a)}{n}\right)-.....+3f'\left(a+(n-3)\frac{(b-a)}{n}\right)+2f'\left(a+(n-2)\frac{(b-a)}{n}\right)+f'\left(a+(n-1)\frac{(b-a)}{n}\right)\right)$$
Replacing $\frac{(b-a)}{n}$ with $h$ gives:
$$\int_a^bf(x)dx=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}h^2(-f'(a+h)-2f'(a+2h)-3f'(a+3h)-.....+3f'(a+(n-3)h)+2f'(a+(n-2)h)+f'(a+(n-1)h))$$
Replacing $f'(x)$ with $f(x)$ and hence $f(x)$ with $\int f(x)dx$ gives:
$$\int_a^b\left(\int f(x)dx\right)dx=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}h^2(-f(a+h)-2f(a+2h)-3f(a+3h)-.....+3f(a+(n-3)h)+2f(a+(n-2)h)+f(a+(n-1)h))$$
Does the above series make any sense to you? I'm asking this because the starting terms of the series are negative and the first term is multiplied by 1, the second term by 2, the third term by 3, etc,i.e the multipliers are increasing by 1, but the last terms of the series are positive and the multipliers are decreasing by 1 instead as we move forward in the series. Is it something like some transition from negative terms to positive terms takes place in the middle or something?
Or Is applying L'Hospital's rule not allowed in this case?","['limits', 'calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'infinitesimals']"

Context for this question:  For pedagogical purposes I was trying to create an example of a cubic polynomial with both its critical values and its zeros all at integers.  After fumbling around with it unsuccessfully for a while, I realized that the problem of creating such an example was equivalent to finding a rational number $a$ ($a \ne 0,1$) with the property that $a^2 - a + 1$ is a perfect square.  (Equivalently, find two integers $m,n$ such that $m^2 - mn + n^2$ is a perfect square.)  I haven't been able to find an example and strongly suspect that it's not possible, but can't see a simple proof of why that should be so. Any proof or counterexample to the conjecture that no such $a$ exists? EDIT:  I may have found the beginning of an argument, within a few minutes of posting the question.  I'd appreciate feedback. Suppose $b$ is a positive integer such that $a^2-a+1=b^2$.  Then $a-1 = a^2-b^2$, so $a-1= (a-b)(a+b)$.  Now if $a-b > 1$ then we have
$$a-1 = (a-b)(a+b) > a+b$$ whence $b < -1$, contradicting the assumption that $b$ is a positive integer. So if such a $b$ exists, it must be that $a-b \le 1$.  Then.... (?)","['number-theory', 'diophantine-equations']"

His most influential result is proving that a $\sigma$-finite measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to another $\sigma$-finite measure on the same measurable space can be represented by integration of a(n almost unique) measurable function with respect to that other measure. This generalizes an earlier theorem proved by Austrian mathematician Johann Karl August Radon . The spelling with the diacritic ( Nikodým ) sometimes appears in texts written in the English language, although the usage seems to be pretty inconsistent. I did a little research and found that the version without the diacritic ( Nikodym ) actually seems to be more prevalent in Polish sources. I do not speak Polish, but I know that the letter ý does not even feature in the Polish alphabet. (Although it does in the closely related Slavic languages Czech and Slovak—maybe O.M.N. had Czech/Slovak ancestors?)

$$ R(X,Y)Z = \nabla_X \nabla_Y Z - \nabla_Y \nabla_X Z - \nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$$
If I use the Levi-Civita connection, this seems to agree with the definition by coordinates:
$$ [\nabla_\mu,\nabla_\nu]V^\rho= R^\rho_{\ \ \sigma\mu\nu} V^\sigma$$
If by the $(,)$ in the first formula we mean contraction by the last two indices. I was wondering what happens if we have a generic connection, instead of the Levi-Civita connection. The last equation then becomes:
$$ [\nabla_\mu,\nabla_\nu]V^\rho= R^\rho_{\ \ \sigma\mu\nu} V^\sigma - T_{\mu\nu}^{\ \ \ \lambda}\nabla_\lambda V^\rho$$
And I get:
$$ R(X,Y)Z = \nabla_X \nabla_Y Z - \nabla_Y \nabla_X Z - \nabla_{[X,Y]}Z -\nabla_{T(X,Y)}Z$$

Also, we have the identity functions $I(a)=a \in A \subseteq B$, and $I(b)=b \in B \subseteq C$ and since the identity function is bijetive, there is an injection between the sets $A$ and $B$, and the sets $B$, and $C$.

So if $a$ and $b$ are coprime, $(\mathcal D)$ has a solution, so using a result on coprime integers , we have $$p\geqslant \mathbb P(d=1)=\frac 1{\zeta(2)}=\frac 6{\pi^2}.$$ Since $d$ must divides $c$ , for each $d$ there is $\frac 1d$ integers which will work for $c$ , so $$p=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb P(d=k)\frac 1k.$$ Then we can majorate $\mathbb P(d=k)$ by $\mathbb P(d\geqslant k)=\frac 1k\times \frac 1k$ for $k\geqslant 2$ . So $$p=\mathbb P(d=1)\times 1+\sum_{k=2}^\infty\mathbb P(d=k)\frac 1k\leqslant \frac 1{\zeta(2)}+\sum_{k=2}^\infty\frac 1{k^2}\frac 1k=\frac 1{\zeta(2)}+\zeta(3)-1.$$ What we get so far with our rough analysis is: $$\frac 1{\zeta(2)}\leqslant p\leqslant \frac 1{\zeta(2)}+\zeta(3)-1$$ $$0.6079<p<0.8100.$$ I have read somewhere (if I understand the article correctly) that $$\mathbb P(d=k)=\frac 1{\zeta(2)k^2}.$$ This would mean that $$p=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb P(d=k)\frac 1k=\frac 1{\zeta(2)}\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac 1{k^3}=\fbox{$\frac {\zeta(3)}{\zeta(2)}\approx0.7308$}.$$ My questions. Thanks to comments, I have the new following question: can I formalize this approach to make it rigorous, with a well chosen probabilistic distribution? I am really unused to do probabilities, so is the following approach correct? Can we generalize the result / the approach to find $p_n$ the probability that a linear Diophantine equation with $n$ variables has a solution? If we can't get an exact value for $n$ variables, can we get a numerical approximation of $p_n$ ? What is the limit of $p_n$ ?","['diophantine-equations', 'riemann-zeta', 'probability', 'arithmetic']"

2174513,Show $y = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^{k-1}}{k!} x^k$ satisfies $ye^{-y} = x$.,"My question is literally the title: Show $y = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^{k-1}}{k!} x^k$ satisfies $ye^{-y} = x$. Here's a little motivation for the question. If you don't care about motivation, then ignore what follows! Considering Erdos-Renyi random graphs, in the supercritical case $p = c/n$ with $c > 1$, and consider the size of the giant component. We can show (eg Grimmett, Probability on Graphs, Theorem 11.1) that the size is $\theta(p) n$, where $\theta(p) \equiv \theta(c)$ is the survival probability for a Poisson$(c)$ branching process ($p = c/n$), and this satisfies
$$ 1 - \theta(c) = \frac{1}{c} \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^{k-1}}{k!} (ce^{-c})^k.$$
Moreover, one can also show (eg, Frieze-Karonski, Introduction to Random Graphs, Theorem 2.14) that $\theta(c) = 1 - c'/c$, where $c'$ is the conjugate of $c$, ie for $c>1$ it is the solution $c' < 1$ of $c'e^{-c'} = c e^{-c}$. Combining these two formulae, we obtain (cancelling the $1/c$ factor)
$$ c' = \frac{1}{c} \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^{k-1}}{k!} (ce^{-c})^k.$$
In my general statement at the top, I've just let $y = c'$ and $x = ce^{-c}$ for notational convenience. Try as I might, I haven't been able to come up with any way of justifying the equality, however -- other than, of course, proving the two results on the size of the giant separately, then equating. One would hope that there's a way of showing it directly -- after all, it's not exactly an ugly expression: after not very long it becomes basically geometric; I tried on Matlab and with $c = 3$ I get machine precision after only $40$ terms in the sum. (My PhD supervisor has had a look at it too, but she wasn't able to work it out either!)","['random-graphs', 'summation', 'sequences-and-series']"

If not, would anyone possibly be able to give me an example where $Cov(A,B)=0$, but $Cov(|A|,|B|)$ can be tuned arbitrarily?","['statistics', 'probability', 'covariance']"
