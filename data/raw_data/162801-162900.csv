2828578,Interesting sequence involving prime numbers jumping on the number line.,"Udpate 4: Trying to characterize finite and infinite cycles. Update 3: All primes $a_0\ge29$ seem to either have infinite cycles or finite non-terminating cycles that converge to infinite cycles of other primes. More examples added at the end of the post (visualized as graphs). Also, renamed the post. Update 2: I've found it can be shown that $29$ and $31$ will never terminate. I believe the same can be done for all other primes. Explanation is added at the end of the post. Update 1: Turns out my initial question is a degenerate case of a broader observation. The broader observation (""Conjecture"") is added at the bottom of the post. Defining the sequence Pick any starting number $a_0\in\mathbb N$ on the number line. At $n$ th step (starting at step $n=1$ on your starting number): jump $a_0+n$ numbers to the right (add $a_0+n$) if current number is not composite jump $a_0+n$ numbers to the left (subtract $a_0+n$) if current number is composite If $a_0\lt0$, then reverse the condition (subtract for not composite and add for composite). If $a_0=0$, you stop jumping. By ""not composite"", it is meant ""prime or one"" (zero is stopping condition). For example, If we start with $a_0=6$, we have $(6)-7\rightarrow(-1)-8\rightarrow(-9)+9\rightarrow0$. This process can be defined as: Pick a starting number $a_0\in\mathbb N$ and define a sequence: $a_{n+1}=$ $$
\begin{cases} a_{n}+(a_0+n+1),  & \text{if $a_n>0$ and $a_n$
 is not composite or $a_n<0$ and $|a_n|$ is composite} \\ a_{n}-(a_0+n+1), &
 \text{if $a_n<0$ and $|a_n|$ is not composite or $a_n>0$ and $a_n$ is composite} \\ 0, & \text{if $a_n=0$} \end{cases} $$ ""Not composite"" in the above definition means that it ""is prime or is $1$"". ""Composite"" is then ""not prime and not one"", while zero ends the sequence. If there exists $k\in\mathbb N$ such that $a_k=0$, then we say the
  sequence terminates (converges to $0$). Examining the sequence It is easy to show that if $a_0$ is composite, the sequence always terminates: (One can write down the sequence for even $a_0$ and for odd $a_0$ to conclude:) $a_3=0$ if $a_0$ is odd and composite, or $a_0$ is even and $a_0+3$ is composite $a_{11}=0$ if $a_0$ is even and $a_0+3$ is not composite and $a_0+11$ is composite $a_{19}=0$ if $a_0$ is even and $a_0+3$ is not composite and $a_0+11$ is not composite But when $a_0$ is prime or equal to $1$ (not composite), I have (computed): $a_0=1 \rightarrow a_{14}=0, \space(1, 3, 6, 2, 7, 13, 20, 12, 3, 13, 24, 12, -1, -15, 0)$ $a_0=2 \rightarrow a_{8}=0, \space(2, 5, 9, 4, -2, -9, -1, -10, 0) $ $a_0=3 \rightarrow a_{6}=0, \space(3, 7, 12, 6, -1, -9, 0) $ $a_0=5 \rightarrow a_{22}=0, \space(5, 11, 18, 10, 1, 11, 22, 10, -3, -17, -32, -16, 1, 19, 38,\dots, 0) $ $a_0=7 \rightarrow a_{14}=0, \space(7, 15, 6, -4, 7, 19, 32, 18, 3, 19, 36, 18, -1, -21, 0) $ $a_0=11 \rightarrow a_{14}=0, \space(11, 23, 36, 22, 7, 23, 40, 22, 3, 23, 44, 22, -1, -25, 0) $ $a_0=13 \rightarrow a_{42}=0, \space(13, 27, 12, -4, 13, 31, 50, 30, 9, -13, -36, -12, 13, 39, 12,\dots, 0) $ $a_0=17 \rightarrow a_{38}=0, \space(17, 35, 16, -4, 17, 39, 16, -8, 17, 43, 70, 42, 13, 43, 74, 42, 9, \dots, 0) $ $a_0=19 \rightarrow a_{110}=0, \space(19, 39, 18, -4, 19, 43, 68, 42, 15, -13, -42, -12, 19, 51, 18,\dots, 0) $ $a_0=23 \rightarrow a_{106}=0, \space(23, 47, 72, 46, 19, 47, 76, 46, 15, -17, -50, -16, 19, 55, 18, \dots,0) $ Prime numbers $\ge29$ seem to never reach $0$. Are these truly the only primes that reach zero? Can we show that no other prime will reach zero? Update 1: After letting the sequence continue after numbers hit $0$, and observing sequences: (If $0$ in the above definition is treated as composite and does not terminate the sequence:) Conjecture: If we observe $a_0=a\ne23$, then: If $(a\gt19)$ is not prime , and $(a+4k)$ is prime number for some $k\in\mathbb N$, then the sequence starting with $a_0=a$  will hit $0$ exactly $k$ times for terms $a_3,a_7,a_{11},\dots,a_{4k-1}$, and no other terms. The case $k=0$ is a degenerate case of the previous claim and is: If $(a\gt19)$ is prime , we never hit $0$. It is easily shown that the above holds for $k\ne0$ (all cases of $k$ but the degenerate one) as odd composite numbers will reach zero at $a_3$ after which we have a new odd number, and the same thing will repeat unless we have a prime number; which causes the sequence to enter a cycle which seems to contains no further zeroes (entering the $k=0$ case). Trivial observation for cases not included above: If $(1\le a\le19)$ or $(a\gt2$ and is even $)$, $a_0=a$ will hit zero infinitely many times. This is true (can be easily shown) for even numbers since we know that even numbers $\gt2$ will reach zeroes at one of $a_3,a_{11},a_{19}$ terms for the first time, after which we are left with a new even number, which repeats the cycle indefinitely. It is true as well for first $19$ numbers and number $23$ since they are computed to continue at an even number after reaching their first zero, which enters the infinite cycle of the even numbers. It still remains to show that prime numbers $\ge29$ themselves will not reach zero, as those primes seem to enter cycles that do not contain zeroes. I suspect one should be able to show cycles that do not contain  zero for odd prime numbers, similar to the cycle for even numbers which revisits the zero infinitely many times. Update 2: I've observed that consecutive prime numbers reach same values infinitely many times. For example, primes $29,31$ will reach numbers ${25,26,27,28,29,30,31}$ infinitely many times as some $a_k$ members of their sequences. Turns out it can be shown that $29$ and $31$ will never reach $0$. This can be done by observing $a_k=29$ and assuming $k$ is even. By looking at all cases while writing out the sequence, eventually a full cycle will be shown and we can use induction. (Also for example; If you assume $59+k$ is prime and follow the blue arrow as shown below, that implies $k$ is even in the following nodes.) A simplified proof can be shown as a graph that generates the sequences for $29$ and $31$: Red arrows imply the previous node is composite, and blue arrows imply it is prime. Note that constants summed with $k$ in nodes are based on the starting position $a_k=29$ and assuming shorter paths back to $29$; taking longer paths results in larger summing constants in some nodes (meaning nodes being visited repeatedly or in different order following the longer paths before reaching $29$ and substituting $a_{k+l}=29$ with $a_k=29$ again); but the graph remains the same nonetheless. The nonconstant nodes clearly grow in absolute value for $k\ge0$ and $\ne0$. I believe we can construct a generating graph for all sequences starting with primes and show that the ones where $a_0\ge29$ will never reach $0$. Is it possible to prove this for all primes, rather than confirming it one by one for individual (finitely many) cases? Update 3: It seems that every starting prime number $a_0\ge29$ will either revisit itself infinitely many times (infinite cycle) for some $a_k$ terms, or revisit itself finitely  many times (finite cycle), and after that its sequence will converge to a sequence of some other prime; which again either has an finite or infinite cycle. We can revisit the $(29,31)$ example from above, where we have that the sequences of these two primes are the same infinite cycle. We can draw the same graph from above in a circular form: Nodes represent some terms $a_k$ of their sequences, and following the arrows you get the next term $a_{k+1}$. Nonconstant nodes have decimal names which were generated while drawing the graph. Constant nodes have their exact values; these are ${25,26,27,28,29,30,31}$ for this particular example, as already mentioned above. Nonconstant nodes $a_k$ are either always composite, or take both composite and prime values for different $k$; which is shown by having either one or two different paths leaving them. We can also look at an example involving finite cycles. Prime number $157$ has a finite cycle and its sequence converges to the prime number $163$. (Last time it is revisited is for $a_{116}=157$, and in total it is visited $23$ times) Prime numbers $(163,167)$ share the same finite cycle, and it converges to the prime number $173$. (Last time $a_0=163$ is revisited is for $a_{152}=163$, and in total it is visited $27$ times; Last time $a_0=167$ is revisited is for $a_{12}=167$, and in total it is visited $4$ times) Prime number $173$ has a finite cycle and its sequence converges to the prime number $179$. (Only time it is visited is for $a_{0}=173$, in total that's only once) Prime numbers $(179,181)$ share the same infinite cycle which can be displayed: We can also visualize the previous finite cycles of primes which eventually converge to the above cycle (redrawn again as the rightmost cycle): $157\rightarrow (163,167)\rightarrow173\rightarrow (179,181).$ Click the image to see it in full size. Another example; primes $(37,41,43)$ all share the same infinite cycle, and prime $47$ has a minimal finite cycle which converges to theirs: There is also an example such as: $359\rightarrow367\rightarrow373\rightarrow(379,383)\rightarrow389\rightarrow(397,401)\rightarrow(419,421)\leftarrow409$ Where we have two different sequences of finite cycles converging to the same infinite cycle. The longer sequence of cycles from this example can be seen below: It seems that primes sharing cycles and primes that are a part of connected cycles, are consecutive primes. All primes $359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421$ from the last example are consecutive. Seems like we could represent all sequences for all primes as one
  single graph, where consecutive primes build connected components of
  the graph. All primes $a_0\ge29$ seem to only revisit constant nodes $a_k$ that are $a_0\approx a_k$ their size. All other nonconstant nodes diverge to either $\pm\infty$, for $k\to\infty$. No $0$ nodes have been found so far, which would defy the $a_0\approx a_k$ observation, for constant $a_k$ ( by ""constant term of the sequence"" I mean ""recurring term of the sequence""; $a_k=a$ for different $k$ ). One can generate graphs for individual primes and prove this and the initial question (for finitely many terms); that primes $\ge29$ do not terminate (reach $0$). But I still do not know how can one prove this for all primes, rather than checking individual cases. If we look at sequences of primes, every prime eventually converges to some other prime. If we observe only the first next prime they visit, we can represent the convergence relations with a graph and build the forest of primes. For primes up to $10009$ we have: (Open the image in a new tab and zoom in) Update 4: Characterization of cycles I've noticed that the following seems to hold for prime $a_0$: If $a_0\ge29$ is a Sophie Germain Prime ($2a_0+1$ is prime), then: $a_0$ will have infinite cycle $\iff$ $a_0+2$ is prime $a_0$ will have a finite cycle that does not revisit $a_0$ $\iff$
  $a_0+2$ is not prime If $a_0\ge29$ is not a Sophie Germain Prime, then then $a_0$ will be revisited at least $2$ times. If $a_0\ge29$ is 1st term in Twin Prime pair ($a_0+2$ is prime), then: $a_0$ will have an infinite cycle $\iff$ $a_0$ is not a 3rd term of a
  prime quadruple . $a_0$ will have an finite cycle $\iff$ $a_0$ is a 3rd term of a
  prime quadruple . If we have a Prime Triplet starting with $a_0\ge29$, then: $a_0$ will have infinite cycle $\iff$ $a_0$ is not Median term of
  prime quintuplets . $a_0$ will have finite cycle $\iff$ $a_0$ is Median term of prime
  quintuplets . If we have tuples of $\ge4$ consecutive primes; that is: If $a_0\ge29$ is 1st term of a Prime Quadruplet or a longer Prime Constellation , then that seems to imply that $a_0$ will have an infinite cycle. Can we characterize the finite/infinite cycles more precisely; or find counterexamples to these claims?","['graph-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'sequences-and-series']"
2828582,"Continuous function on $[0,1]$, $f(0)=f(1)$","I came across this very interesting question, which seems to be partially answered in a couple posts around here: Let $f:[0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ continuous such that $f(0)=f(1)$.

2828587,Ranking participants based on tiers and totals,"I am trying to rank participants based on sets of data that I have. The data used is for a competition. In this competition, you can participate in X amount of events , at the end of the event you participate in you get ranked in a Tier (eg from Tier 1 to Tier 6). Example: Particpants  Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 Total
John           2       3     2      7

2828619,A question about the spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators,"The spectral theorem for unbounded operators says that if $A:D(A)\subset H\to H$ is a densely defined self-adjoint operator ($H$ Hilbert), and $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is a Borel function bounded on $\sigma(A)$ then 
$$f(A) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(\lambda) dP(\lambda)$$
where $dP(\lambda)$ is the spectral measure of $A$. I naively thought that the spectrum of $f(A)$ is given by $f(\sigma(A))$ but then I came across the following.
Let $A = -\Delta: D(\Delta) \to L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$, where $\Delta$ is the Laplacian. It  is well known that  $\sigma(A)= [0,+\infty)$. Let $\rho < 0$, then we can consider the self-adjoint operator
$$ (A-\rho)^{-1} = \int_{0}^{+\infty} (\lambda-\rho)^{-1}dP(\lambda) $$
This operator is the inverse of $A-\rho$, and by our naive assumption its spectrum should be $\frac{1}{\sigma(A)-\rho}$.
But from other theories we also know that the inverse $(A-\rho)^{-1}$ is a compact self-adjoint operator and thus its spectrum must be  a discrete set (contradiction). So, where have I made a mistake?","['functional-analysis', 'spectral-theory', 'operator-theory']"
2828629,Is there a surjective morphism $\widehat{\Bbb Z} \to \Bbb Z$?,"Consider the profinite completion $\widehat{\Bbb Z}$ of the additive group of $\Bbb Z$. Is there a surjective group morphism $s : \widehat{\Bbb Z} \to \Bbb Z$ ?
  If so, can we moreover assume that $s \circ i = \rm{id}_{\Bbb Z}$, where $i : \Bbb Z \to \widehat{\Bbb Z}$ is the canonical embedding? Clearly, there is no continuous map $\widehat{\Bbb Z} \to \Bbb Z$, otherwise $\Bbb Z$ would be compact and discrete... ; so $s$ can't be continuous. I also noticed that there is no surjective group morphism $\Bbb Z_p \to \Bbb Z$ (i.e. $\Bbb Z$ is not a quotient of the $p$-adic integers), for any prime $p$, since the former is $q$-divisible for any prime $q \neq p$, while the latter is not.

2828687,Forecasting seasonal data,"I am fairly new to time series modelling. Suppose that I have time series of electricity consumed per day of one company. The series is on workdays only and sometimes there is NA value because of a public holiday. I would like to forecast future electricity consumption. I am familiar with the ARIMA modelling in R, however to properly find seasonal component in R I need to (using auto.arima) specificy frequency of the data, which I believe is double seasonal - that is, depends on both workday and month of the year. Because I was unable to fit the ARIMA, I found a post about predicting a time series using linear regression. Thus my question is, whether the following is statistically correct approach. To deseason my data, I would start with a linear regression $$y_i = day_i + month_i + \epsilon_i,$$
which gives me estimates $y^{seasonal}_i$ of the seasonality of the data. Then I would model the rest of the series, that is $y_i - y^{seasonal}_i$ via ARIMA using Box-Jenkins for series without seasonal component, so basically to model the trend in the data. The forecasting would be simply to forecast from both of the models and sum it. Is my reasoning mathematically correct? Can it be used for correlated data?","['time-series', 'statistics']"
2828697,Universal Classes of Regular Graphs,"There is a small but well-known open problem in graph coloring called the Total Coloring Conjecture.  I worked on this problem several years ago and am interested in returning to it, potentially. For a finite graph $G$ with no multi-edges, I assume it is known what a proper coloring of its vertices is.  In the total coloring conjecture we also want to color the edges, i.e. assign a color to each edge such that no two edges sharing a common vertex are the same color.  A total coloring is a simultaneous proper coloring of the edges and the vertices so that, as well, no edge has the same color as one of its vertices. Let $\Delta(G)$ be the maximum valence of vertices of $G$.  The total coloring conjecture, by Vizing, states that for a graph $G$ the total coloring number, i.e. the minimal number of colors needed to totally color the graph, is at most $\Delta(G) + 2$. The method I was using was to supply total colorings of regular graphs and then embed $G$ into one.  There is a bit of difference between the even and odd cases concerning this, though it didn't cause problems in practice.  Given a homogeneous regular graph I was able to totally color a large number of these manually, even for high degrees, since the adjacency matrices are sort of 'modular' looking and thus susceptible to elementary arguments (putting colors of vertices on diagonals and colors of edges elsewhere). So I am wondering, is there a nice, well-behaved family of (preferably homogeneous) regular graphs for valence $n$ that contain all regular graphs of valence $n$?  What I am picturing are sort of 'longer and longer wreaths' of a single graph, chosen from some finite collection based on $n$, and some rules for braiding it together.  I suppose it is alright if the regular graphs are infinite. Does the question make sense?  Perhaps negative results would also be helpful, to evaluate the feasibility of this method.","['graph-theory', 'algebraic-graph-theory', 'combinatorics', 'coloring', 'infinitary-combinatorics']"
2828715,Operator norm (induced $2$-norm) of a Kronecker tensor,"Let $A \in \mathcal M(n \times n; \mathbb R)$ with $\rho(A) < 1$ . Then we know $I \otimes I - A^T \otimes A^T$ is invertible where $\otimes$ denotes kronecker product.

2828740,"If an extension is locally Galois, is it Galois?","Consider an extension of number fields $L/K$ . Basically, my question is know whether this extension has a given property, if we assume that the completions at all finite places of the extension have the same property.
More precisely, Assume that for almost all finite prime $p$ of $K$ , there is a finite prime $P$ of $L$ above $p$ , such that $L_P / K_p$ is Galois. Does it follow that $L/K$ is Galois? One could make two variations: Make the stronger hypothesis that for all prime $p$ of $K$ and any prime $P$ above $p$ , the extension of local fields $L_P / K_p$ is Galois. Replace ""Galois"" by ""abelian"", both in the hypothesis and conclusion. Some thoughts: Recall that the converse holds : if $L/K$ is Galois, then so is any completion. We may write $L = K(a)$ for some $a \in L$ . Then I think that for any prime $p$ of $K$ , there is $P \mid p$ such that $L_P = K_p(a)$ (consider the minimal polynomial $f$ of $a$ over $K$ , then $a$ is a root of some irreducible factor of $f$ in $K_p[T]$ , and we have $L \otimes_K K_p \cong K_p[T]/(f) \cong \prod\limits_{P \mid p} L_P$ ). But in general, $K_p(a) \cap \overline{K}$ strictly contains $K(a)$ , so if we pick any $\sigma : L = K(a) \to \overline{K}$ and try to extend it to $K_p(a)$ in order to use the assumption, we are stuck. We cannot consider the variation ""replace Galois by solvable "". Indeed, any finite extension of local fields is solvable, while there are $S_5$ -extensions of number fields. For the variation 2., if we further assume that $L/K$ is Galois (not necessarily abelian), the question is just to deduce or not that $\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$ is abelian, knowing that all the decomposition subgroups $D(P \mid p)$ are abelian.","['abstract-algebra', 'galois-theory', 'extension-field', 'field-theory']"

However, I'm having a little bit of trouble with the following: as a generalization of the Beatty sequence $\lfloor \phi n\rfloor$, I am considering the similar sequence $\lfloor \phi n-1/3\rfloor$ and trying to find its complement in the natural numbers. I believe that its complement is $\lfloor (\phi+1)n+2/3\rfloor$, but the method of proof used for Beatty's theorem doesn't work in this case. I used the second proof provided here . EDIT: My conjecture is false (see comments), but I would still like to find the complement of the originally mentioned sequence. Does anyone know how to find the complement of the following sequence?

I am confident in this diagnosis because if I rotate the axis of rotation itself, I do get the same axis back, which seems to indeed indicate that it is simply an issue with $\theta$ that I'm not understanding, and that there isn't any issue in my declaration of $\textbf{R}$... print(""Rk - k = {}"".format(np.matmul(R,k) - k)) gives Rk - k = [ 0.  0.  0.] FYI, I've been using the this wikipedia resource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigues%27_rotation_formula There, it says that $\vec{v}$ in the vector formula is rotated ""by an angle θ according to the right hand rule,"", and in the matrix formula, it is rotated ""through an angle θ anticlockwise about the axis $\vec{k}$"".

I am focusing on the same statement, but it seems that my approach is different from his/hers. Could someone comment on my own proof? Here we go: Let $X$ be a metric space and $p\in X$. Fix $r>0$. Define a neighborhood around $p$ as $N_r (p)=\{q\in X| d(p, q)<r\}$. Now, take $w = \frac{r}{2}$. Then, $N_w (p)\subset N_r(p)$. In other words, every point of $N_r(p)$ is interior. Therefore, $N_r (p)$ is open. Since $r$ is arbitrary, this proves every neighborhood is open. Update: Under my definition of ""neighborhood,"" can I prove in this way instead: For all $m\in N_r(p)$, take $w=\frac{r−d(m,p)}{2}$. Then, $N_w(m)\subset N_r(p)$. Update2 From the hints given in comments, I solve it: Assume $m\in N_r(p)$ and $q\in N_w(m)$. Take $w=r-d(m, p)$. Then, $d(p, q)\leq d(p, m) + d(m, q)< d(p, m) + r-d(m,p) =r$.

I know that $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ and $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ are isomorphic as $\mathbb{F}_p$ vector spaces, so $Gal(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}/\mathbb{F}_p)$ is isomorphic to a cyclic subgroup of GL$_n(\mathbb{F}_p)$ of order $n$, though this doesn't seem too useful (but maybe I'm wrong!).

comes from Let $M$ be a smooth orientable $n$-dimensional manifold with exterior derivative $\operatorname{d}:\Omega^{k}(M)\to\Omega^{k+1}(M)$, metric $g\in\Gamma(T^{0,2}M)$ and volume form $\mu\in\Omega^{n}(M)$. One extends the metric $g$ to a metric $g_{(k)}$ on each $\Omega^{k}(M)$ requiring that for every $\alpha,\beta\in\Omega^{k}(M)$ we have
  $$g_{(k)}(\alpha,\beta) := \frac{1}{k!} g^{a_1b_1}\cdots g^{a_kb_k}\alpha_{a_1\dots a_k}\beta_{b_1\dots b_k}$$
  and define the sign of the metric by
  $$\operatorname{sgn}(g) := g_{(n)}(\mu,\mu) = \pm 1$$
  Then define the Hodge dual to be the operator $\Omega^{k}(M)\to\Omega^{n-k}(M)$ such that for every $\alpha,\beta\in\Omega^{k}(M)$ we have
  $$\alpha\wedge\star\beta = g_{(k)}(\alpha,\beta)\mu$$
  which leads to
  $$\star\star = (-1)^{k(n-k)}\operatorname{sgn}(g)$$
  and this implies
  $$\star^{-1} = (-1)^{k(n-k)}\operatorname{sgn}(g)\star$$ Now if we take the definition
$$\delta\omega = (-1)^{k}\star^{-1}\operatorname{d}\star\omega$$
And we calculate the action of $\star^{-1}$ over $\operatorname{d}\star\omega$: If $\omega$ is of grade $k$, $\star\omega$ is of grade $n-k$ and $\operatorname{d}\star\omega$ is of grade $n-k+1$. Hence we have
\begin{align}
\star^{-1}\operatorname{d}\star\omega
&= (-1)^{(n-k+1)(n-(n-k+1))}\star\operatorname{d}\star\omega\\
&= (-1)^{nk+n+k+1}\star\operatorname{d}\star\omega

Now, multiplying by $(-1)^{k}$ we get
$$\delta\omega = (-1)^{kn+n+1}\operatorname{sgn}(g)\star\operatorname{d}\star\omega$$
Which is formula $(1)$. However, I've also encountered the formula
\begin{align}
\delta &= (-1)^{kn}\operatorname{sgn}(g)\star\operatorname{d}\star\tag{2}

Given the following transition matrix: $$\begin{pmatrix}\frac 1{10}&\frac 3{10}&\frac 35&0&0&0\\\frac 12&\frac 12 &0&0&0&0\\\frac 3{10}&0&\frac 1{10}&\frac 35&0&0\\0&0&\frac 3{10}&\frac 1{10}&\frac 3{10}&\frac 3{10}\\0&0&0&\frac 12&\frac 12&0\\0&0&0&0&0&1\\ \end{pmatrix}$$ (a) What is the probability it leaves the maze, given it started in State $i \quad \forall \ i \in[0,5]$ ?? (b) How long before it leaves the maze, given it started in State $i \quad \forall \ i \in[0,5]$ ? My Attempt: Well first I made a diagram to get the understanding of the problem visually. I replace the number States to letters, i.e. State $1$ as State $A$ etc. and wrote down the transition probabilities from the matrix. (a) I think because there exists an absorbing state at the exit, then the probability of exiting must be $1$ a.s. . (b) I used First-Step-Analysis to find the expected time for each $i$. Let $v_i$ be the expected time to exit from starting position $i$, i.e. $v_i =\Bbb E_i[T_{\{5\}}]$. Then solving the system of equations: $$
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
v_A &=1+\frac 1{10} v_A+\frac 3{10} v_B+\frac 35 v_C \\
v_B &=1+\frac 12 v_A +\frac 12 v_B\\ 
v_C &=1+\frac 3{10} v_A+\frac 1{10} v_C+\frac 35 v_D \\
v_D &=1+\frac 3{10} v_C+\frac 1{10} v_D+\frac 3{10} v_E+\frac 3{10} v_F \\
v_E &=1+\frac 12 v_D+\frac 12 v_E\\
v_F &=0

My Question(s): I was wondering, is there another way to look at this problem without using Markov Chains or First-Step-Analysis? I feel like there are geometric random variables involved here.

It is well known that the largest rectangle in a semi-circle (where the central angle $\alpha = \pi$) has the dimensions $x= \sqrt{2}r$ and $y=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}r$. For sector angles larger than $\pi$, i.e for $\pi \lt \alpha \lt 2\pi$, this remains the largest rectangle, as no rectangle can bend around or encompass the circle's center (see figure below). For sectors smaller than a semi-circle, i.e. for $0 \lt \alpha \lt \pi$ we have the following situation: After setting up equations for x and y (dependent on $\theta$ and $\alpha$), setting area $A = xy$ and differentiating, I find that the maximum area rectangle occurs when $$\theta = \frac{\alpha}{4}$$

consider all possible strings of length $n$ ,place $1$ in the place of $k$-th number if $k$-th number is present in a $S_1$ and $0$ otherwise. Like, for $S_1= \{\{1,2\},\{1,3\}\}$ we have 110 and 101 . Now, consider a function which will give output $0$ or $1$ , when the string is accepted then output will be $1$ and if not then $0$. Observe that, if a string is accepted then also any string bigger than the accepted one is also a accepted string. So actually counting the number of functions $f:\{0,1\}^n\to \{0,1\}$ which are monotone are the number of possible such sets(haven't considered the condition that union of all subsets equals to $\{1,2,\cdots ,n\}$ ). Which is Dedekind number .

$$

I figured that it converges, by using the ratio test: 
$$
\left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right| = \frac{x^{n+1}}{1+x^{n+1}} \cdot \frac{1+x^{n}}{x^n} = \frac{x+x^{n+1}}{1+x^{n+1}} < \frac{1+x^{n+1}}{1+x^{n+1}} = 1.
$$
with $a_n = \frac{x^n}{1+x^n}$. However, I would like to determine if this convergence is uniform on this interval. I know that for $a<1$ it is uniform on the interval $[0,a]$, since $g_n(x) = \frac{x^n}{1+x^n}$ is increasing on the interval, so we have for every $n$:
$$
|g_n(x)| \leq \frac{a^n}{1+a^n}

and $\sum \frac{a^n}{1+a^n}$ converges, as just shown, so the convergence of $\sum g_k(x)$ is uniform by the Weierstrass M-test. However, is it uniform on $[0,1)$?","['real-analysis', 'uniform-convergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'convergence-divergence']"
2829741,"Using different characterizations of compactness, continuity, etc.","I've been looking for simple problems online to improve my grasp on the basics of elementary analysis. I'm not sure how much context I should include to make this question understood, so I'll just include it all; my question will be at the very bottom of the post if the details aren't needed and you want to skip to it. I found the following problem, and thought of two ways to solve it: $\textbf{Problem}$: A real-valued function $f$ on a closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$ is said to be upper semicontinuous provided that for every $\epsilon>0$ and every $p\in[a,b]$, there is a $\delta=\delta(\epsilon,p)>0$ such if $x\in[a,b]$ and $|x-p|<\delta$ then $f(x)<f(p)+\epsilon$. Prove that an upper semicontinuous function is bounded above on $[a,b]$. $\underline{\text{First Proof}}$: The argument is by contradiction. Suppose that $f$ is not bounded above. Then, for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $x_n$ such that $f(x_n)>n$. Since the sequence $(x_n)$ is bounded, it contains a convergent subsequence, $(x_{n_k})$, converging to some $x^*\in[a,b]$. Given $\epsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that for all $x$ satisfying $|x-x^*|<\delta$, we have $f(x)<f(x^*)+\epsilon$. There exists $K$ such that for all $k\geq K$ we have $|x_{n_k}-x^*|<\delta$, so that $f(x_{n_k})<f(x^*)+\epsilon$ for all $k\geq K$. This is a contradiction, since we must have $f(x_{n_k})>n_k\geq k$ for all $k$. $\underline{\text{Second Proof}}$: Given an $\epsilon >0$, the set of open intervals $$\mathcal{O}=\big\{(p-\delta_{\epsilon,p}, p+\delta_{\epsilon,p}): p\in [a,b]\big\}$$ forms an open cover of $[a,b]$. Heine-Borel guarantees the existence of a finite subcover: $$[a,b] \subset \bigcup^{n}_{i=1}(p_i-\delta_{\epsilon,p_i}, p_i+\delta_{\epsilon, p_i}).$$ Let $f(p^*)=\max \{f(p_1),f(p_2),...,f(p_n)\}$. Then $f(x)<f(p^*)+\epsilon$ for all $x\in [a,b]$, so that $f(p^*)+\epsilon$ serves as an upper bound for $f$ on $[a,b]$. After doing the second proof and rereading the first proof, I realized (assuming the proofs are correct): Both rely on the compactness of the interval $[a,b]$. The first proof uses the sequential characterization of compactness; the second uses the finite subcover definition of compactness. I wondered: Can I use the sequential characterization to get a direct proof? I don't see how to do this, and doubt it can be done. So, here's my question: If a direct proof really $\textit{isn't}$ possible with the sequential characterization, is there some deeper reason for this? Does this suggest some underlying difference between the sequential characterization and the finite open subcover definition? More generally, it's impossible not to notice that there are often several equivalent characterizations of a single concept in analysis (e.g., the $\epsilon$-$\delta$ vs. the sequential vs. the open set definitions of continuity), and sometimes one is more appropriate than another. If it happens that for a given problem or a given theorem, one characterization of a concept only allows for indirect proof whereas another characterization allows for a direct proof, is there always some reason for this? Does this tell us anything significant about the differences between the characterizations, or about what assumptions underlie the different characterizations? I hope this question make sense.

Is it true that there exists a smooth positive function $\lambda:S^2\to \mathbb{R}$ such that $g_0=\lambda^2g$?

So my question is equivalent to the following question: can the diffeomorphism $f$ be taken to be the identity? The reason I think this might be true is that a 2-dimensional manifold has constant curvature iff it has constant scalar curvature. For $n\geq 3$, any metric on a closed $n$-manifold is pointwise conformal to a metric with constant scalar curvature (by the solution of the Yamabe problem).

2830224,Maximum the amount of coins the king can get,"Here is how it works: The king has $65$ citizens. Counting himself, each of them gets a coin every month. The king can give a suggestion of how the coins should be distributed, and evryone else cast a vote. It will pass if it has more than $50$% voted ""yes"". Every citizen is extremely selfish and does the following: if he/she gets more coin, then he/she will vote ""yes"". If he/she gets less coin, then he/she will vote ""no"". Otherwise, he/she won't vote at all. Question: What's the maximum amount of coin (out of 66) the king can get, and how is it achieved in minimal amount of suggestions? Apprently the answer seem to be 63, and it's pretty obvious, but how can one formally prove it? Also, how can I find the answer to the second question? Edit: here is an example that might help you to understand the question: Suggestion $1$: $33$ citizens gets 2 coins each ($33$ ""yes"" $32$ ""no"") Suggestion $2$: $17$ citizens gets 3/4 coins each ($17$ ""yes"" $16$ ""no"") Suggestion $3$: $9$ citizens gets 6/7 coins each ($9$ ""yes"" $8$ ""no"") Suggestion $4$: $5$ citizens gets 12/13 coins each ($5$ ""yes"" $4$ ""no"") Suggestion $5$: $3$ citizens gets 22 coins each ($3$ ""yes"" $2$ ""no"") Suggestion $6$: $2$ citizens gets 33 coins each ($2$ ""yes"" $1$ ""no"") Suggestion $7$: $3$ citizens didn't get any coin the first round gets one coin each.

[Verification],"I have the following task: ""State the maximal domain $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ of the following functions $f: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ $\color{grey}{\textrm{and draw D in each case.}}$"" (I'll do this bit). $f(x,y) = \dfrac{xy}{x-y}$ $f(x,y) = x + \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ $f(x,y) = \dfrac{\tan{(xy)}}{x^2 - y^2}$ Whilst I think that I understand what is being asked, I don't think I could articulate my solution with the appropriate rigour such that I could present it. Is my approach for determining the maximal domains valid? As such, have i accurately represented my maximal domains with the correct notation? Progress so far: Generally, I have tried to identify subdomains in my functions, and then wish to state the domain of each whole function as the intersection of those subdomains. Here I would argue that the maximal domain is the intersection of the numerator and denominator. Thus, 
\begin{align*}
D_1 &= \{x,y: x,y \in \mathbb{R}^2\} \ \cap \{ x,y: x,y \in  \mathbb{R}^2 \cap (x \neq y)\} \\
D_1 &=  \{ x,y: x,y \in  \mathbb{R}^2 \cap (x \neq y)\} & \text{(Rule missing.)} \\
\end{align*} Here I would argue that the maximal domain is the intersection of the lone $x$ term and the term contained within the root function. Thus, \begin{align*}
D_2 &= \{x: x \in \mathbb{R} \} \cap \{x,y: x^2 + y^2 \in \mathbb{R_{\geq 0}} \} 
 \hspace{6.1cm} \\
D_2 &= \{x,y: (x \in \mathbb{R}) \cap (x^2 + y^2 \in \mathbb{R_{\geq 0}}) \} \\
\end{align*} Analogue to 1, except that another term needs to be introduced for the repeating asymptotes of the tangent function. Thus, \begin{align*}
D_3 &= \{ x,y: x,y \neq n\cdot \frac{\pi}{2} \in \mathbb{R^2} \ (n \in \mathbb{N}) \} \ \cap \{ x,y: x^2 - y^2 \neq 0 \} \hspace{2.6cm} \\

2830279,On epimorphisms of groups.,"I want to prove by absurdity that every epimorphism of groups is a surjective morphism. So let $f\colon A\to B$ be an epimorphism of groups. Let by absurd assume that $f$ is non surjective, so that the image $f(A)$ of $f$ is properly contained in $B$ and let us also assume that $f(A)$ is not a normal subgroup of $B$, because in that case we can form the quotient group of classes of elements of $B$ modulo $f(A)$ and use the same argument that is used for abelian groups. So, the index of $f(A)$ in $B$ must be at least $3$, otherwise $f(A)$ would be normal in $B$. Let $f(A)$, $f(A)u$ and $f(A)v$ be three distinct cosets of $f(A)$ in $B$. Then, we consider the permutation $\sigma$ on $B$, defined by: $\sigma(xu)=xv$ for all $x\in f(A)$; $\sigma(xv)=xu$ for all $x\in f(A)$ and $\sigma(b)=b$ on the remaining part of $B$. Then, for all $x,b\in B$, let us define $\psi_b(x)=bx$ and $\overline{\psi}_b=\sigma^{-1}\circ\psi_b\circ\sigma$. Let us finally define $\psi,\overline{\psi}\colon B\to\operatorname{Sym}_B$ by $\psi(b)=\psi_b$ and $\overline{\psi}(b)=\overline{\psi}_b$. Since $\psi\circ f=\overline{\psi}\circ f$, then $\psi=\overline{\psi}$, because $f$ is assumed to be an epimorphism. So I need to prove that $\psi\neq\overline{\psi}$ to get a contradiction, but I can't. Can you please help me to show that actually $\psi\neq\overline{\psi}$.","['category-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

2830373,Notion of derivative used in Petersen & Pedersen's Matrix Cookbook,"I am looking at the Matrix Cookbook . From my real analysis background, my understanding of calculating derivatives involving matrices is to use the Fréchet derivative on the normed space $(\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}, \|\cdot\|_{op})$ and whatever the target space is, but I am having a hard time linking this to what is used in this book. For example, consider the matrix trace $\text{Tr}: \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. This is a linear map so the Frechet derivative in direction ${\bf{V}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is just the linear map itself independent of the point ${\bf{X}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ so $$\text{d}\text{Tr}({\bf{X}}){\bf{V}} = \text{Tr}({\bf{V}})$$ whereas in the Matrix Cookbook, the following identity is stated $$\displaystyle\frac{\partial}{\partial {\bf{X}}}\text{Tr}({\bf{X}}) = {\bf{I}}$$ Which I suppose has the same property of being independent of ${\bf{X}}$ but it's not the same. Another example is the function $f({\bf{X}}) = {\bf{X}}^{-1}$, which has Frechet derivative $\text{d}f({\bf{X}}){\bf{V}} = -{\bf{X}}^{-1}{\bf{V}}{\bf{X}}^{-1}$, MC states an extremely similar looking identity:
$$\frac{\partial{\bf{X}}^{-1}}{\partial x} = -{\bf{X}}^{-1}\frac{\partial{\bf{X}}}{\partial x}{\bf{X}}^{-1}$$ My question is, what is the definition of $\displaystyle\frac{\partial}{\partial {\bf{X}}}$, $\partial{\bf{X}}$ and exotic expressions such as $\partial{\lambda_i}$ $\partial{\bf{v}}_i$ (where $\lambda_i, {\bf{v}}_i$ are the eigenvalues and vectors of a real symmetric matrix). I am also curious if there a nice geometric interpretation or analogue to derivatives in Banach spaces and why might these specialised derivatives be preferred over a Frechet derivative in applications.

2830377,How is convolving Haar measure with itself over subsets enough to define subgroups?,"In this post , Terry Tao says that Gaussians are ""a subgroup of $\Bbb R$"". When you convolve Haar probability measure on a (compact) subgroup with itself, you get back the same measure, and this can in fact be used as a definition of such subgroups. If you convolve a Gaussian probability measure with itself, you almost get back the same Gaussian measure, but it has spread out by a factor of $\sqrt 2$. So Gaussians are in some sense a ""$\sqrt 2$-approximate group"". I don't understand this comment, or how it means that Gaussians can be viewed as a subgroup of $\Bbb R$. How can you define subgroups through this? Perhaps this? A subset, $H$ of a group $G$ with Haar measure $\mu$ is called a subgroup if $\mu |_H=\mu\ast\mu|_H$.
