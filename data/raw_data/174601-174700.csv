3118977,Visualized group tables for $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$,"Let me share a kind of visualization of group tables which is especially well suited for cyclic groups like $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ . In these groups you can easily give colors to each group member $k$ with hue = red if $k > 0$ (for $\mathbb{Z}$ ) or $k \leq n/2$ (for $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ ) hue = blue otherwise lightness = goes from 0 to 1 for $|k|\rightarrow \infty$ (for $\mathbb{Z}$ ) or for $k \rightarrow n/2$ (for $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ ) So $k=0$ always looks black while $k = \infty$ resp. $k=n/2$ looks white. My question is: Which specific number- or group- or ring-theoretic facts can be learned from looking at
  these group tables? It comes as no surprise that all addition group tables for $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ look essentially the same, independent of the nature of $n$ (be it prime or whatsoever): But also the multiplication group tables exhibit quite regular patterns. But this time there are at least two of them: those with a distinguished black/white pattern at the center and those with a distinguished red/blue pattern: A closer look at consecutive $n$ reveals another detail: the black/white and the red/blue patterns at the center flip every second step: So far, so good. What remains interesting is the ""limit pattern"" which is approached for $n \rightarrow \infty$ . It looks something like this (for $n=64,128,256, 251$ ): As you may guess there is not a unique limit pattern, but only a kind of pattern whose details depend on $n$ (mainly its size), especially the distinctness and size of ""subcenters"" (next to the ""main center"" at $(\frac{n}{2},\frac{n}{2})$ ), e.g. of the four subcenters in the cases above which you may immediately see (near the centers of the four quadrants). Note again that the existence and visibility of such subcenters are independent of the nature of $n$ – just compare $n=256$ (a power of 2) and $n = 251$ (a prime number). Here is the multiplication group table for $n=512$ : For the sake of comparison here are the addition and multiplication group tables for $\mathbb{Z}$ itself (for $|k| < K$ , $K = 10,100$ : To repeat my question: Which specific number- or group- or ring-theoretic facts can be learned from looking at
  these group tables? To ask one specific question: How can the hyperbolas be explained which can be observed at the
  center of each plot, be it for $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ ? For another sake of comparion: See here some group tables with red = blue:","['number-theory', 'group-theory', 'cyclic-groups', 'visualization']"
3119013,Can we perturb a low rank map to a full rank map in a smooth way?,"Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be smooth. Can we find, for every $\epsilon>0$ , a $C^1$ map $\tilde f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ of full rank such that $\|df-d\tilde f\|_{C^0}<\epsilon$ ? Note that what I require is weaker than $\|f-\tilde f\|_{C^1}<\epsilon$ , I only want the differentials to be uniformly close. The point is that pointwise, for every real $n \times n$ matrix $A$ , and every $\epsilon>0$ , there exist an invertible matrix $\tilde A$ such that $\|A-\tilde A\|<\epsilon$ . The question is whether we can always create a smooth and exact perturbation. (i.e. I want $d\tilde f$ to be everywhere invertible). I am fine if this perturbation cannot be done on the whole space, but only on a fixed ""part of it""- e.g. I am OK with restricting the domain to be the unit disk. (but I don't want to be forced to shrink the domain to a disk with a radius which depends on $\epsilon$ ).","['matrix-rank', 'real-analysis', 'multivariable-calculus', 'stability-theory', 'perturbation-theory']"

If $L$ lies on the median through $A$ and $LM = LN$ , prove that: $2BC^{2}=CA^2+AB^2$ . However, this problem has a hidden gem in it. This is, actually, my own conjecture: If $LM=LN$ then $LM=BC$ I'm calling this ""a conjecture"" but I guarantee that it's correct. I played with Geogebra a lot and found the statement to be true without doubt (If you see that small dot in the top left corner, that's my dragging point. When moved, it changes the shape of the triangle). Despite the fact that I was able to solve the original problem, the extended problem refuses to budge. It seems to be much harder than the original one. Or I'm just blind after spending so many hours over the same problem.","['euclidean-geometry', 'triangles', 'geometry', 'plane-geometry']"
3119030,Counting the number of ways to form teams,"Here's the Question, 12 employees are eligible for working on a company's project. The team must consist of 4 people. However, two employees had a fight and refuse to work together. How many ways can the team be formed? So I am having a hard time checking/confirming if my thinking behind this is correct, even when looking at exclusion-inclusions principles. So I will explain what I think is right and hopefully someone can confirm the logic. 1) $^{12}C_4$ is the total number of ways of selecting a team of 4. $^{10}C_2$ is the total number of ways to exclude the 2 people being together. $^{12}C_4 - ^{10}C_2 =450$ possible ways. 2) Excluding 1 of the two leaves $^{11}C_4$ possible choices.
   Excluding the other 1 instead is also $^{11}C_4$ possible choices. However, this over counts the 10 other people in both cases which is $^{10}C_4$ choices. Therefore $2 \times ^{11}C_4 - ^{10}C_4 = 450$ possible ways. I know the answer of 450 is right, but I am unsure if my reasoning behind these calculations is correct. Maybe there is another way to look at this problem that is easier to grasp? Many Thanks Ken","['combinations', 'combinatorics']"

There are two trivial cases for the 'infinitieth' derivative - namely $ke^{x+c}$ , for which $\frac{d^\infty f(x)}{dx^\infty}=ke^{x+c}$ , and $\frac{d^\infty f(x)}{dx^\infty}=0$ , which is the case for any function with some constant $n^\text{th}$ derivative (e.g. power/polynomial functions).

3119744,Exact Differential Equation Integrating Factor,"Finding an integrating factor can be a genuine mathematical art. 
  However, certain differential forms can remind us of differentiation
  techniques that may aid in the solution of the equation at hand.  For
  example, seeing $x\ dy + y\ dx$ reminds us of the product rule, as in $d(xy) = x\ dx + y\ dy$ [sic], and $x\ dy - y\ dx$ might remind us of the
  quotient rule, $d(x/y) = \frac{y\ dx - x\ dy}{y^2}$ .  In the equation $x\ dy + y\ dx + 3xy^2\ dy = 0$ , we are again reminded of the product
  rule.  In fact, if you multiply the equation by $\frac{1}{xy}$ , then $\frac{x\ dy\ +\ y\ dx}{xy} + 3y\ dy = 0 \implies d(ln(xy)) + 3y\ dy = 0 \implies ln(xy) + \frac{3}{2}y^2 = C$ .  Use these ideas to find a
  general solution for the differential equation $$(x^2 - y^2)(x\ dy + y\ dx) = 2xy(x\ dy - y\ dx)$$ I'm not really sure where to start with this.  I can rewrite the equation as $(x^2 - y^2)\ d(xy) = 2x^3y\ d(y/x)$ and solve for one of the differentials, but not in a way where I can integrate the RHS.  I noticed that $x\ dy + y\ dx$ is cleanly expressible as a dot product, and since $d\vec r$ = $\begin{bmatrix}dx \\ dy\end{bmatrix}$ , integrating $d(xy)$ could be viewed as calculating work, where $\vec f(x,\ y) = \begin{bmatrix}y \\ x\end{bmatrix}$ .  However, there doesn't appear to be a curve, so I can't set integration bounds or use Green's Theorem.  Multiplying everything out didn't spark any ideas either.","['integration', 'differential-forms', 'integrating-factor', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

This did not seem obvious due to me due to the nonlinearity of the sine function. Other resources like Attention is all you need Explained mention this property but do not go deeper into it. I attempted to use linear regression techniques in Python to derive this, but  was unable to find a fitting linear transform.

Also, it doesn't require $f(0)=0.$ Could anyone verify if its correct? thank you. $\textbf{Proof:}$ By Stone-Weierstrass chose polynomials $p_n$ such that $p_n\to f$ uniformly. Then we consider $p_n+(f(0)-p_n(0)).$ Let $\epsilon\geq0$ and choose $N$ large so that for all $n\geq N$ we have $\|p_n-f\|_{[a,b]}<\epsilon/2.$ It follows that $$\|f-(p_n+(f(0)-p_n(0)))\|_{[a,b]}\leq\|f-p_n\|_{[a,b]}+\|f(0)-p_n(0)\|_{[a,b]}$$ $$<\epsilon/2+\epsilon/2=\epsilon.$$ Thus $p_n+(f(0)-p_n(0))\to f$ uniformly, and $$[p_n+(f(0)-p_n(0))](0)=f(0).$$ This completes the proof. $\blacksquare$ To add, we could generalized if we replaced $(f(0)-p_n(0))$ by $$\sum_{i=1}^n(f(x_i)-p_n(x_i))\ell_i,$$ where $x_1,...,x_n$ are a set of nodes, and $\ell_i$ are Lagrange Basis Polynomials.","['lagrange-interpolation', 'polynomials', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

I've been told it's used in almost everything but that was too vague of an explanation for me.

However, I am not quite sure if my proof is right: $$P(|U_nX_n|>\varepsilon) = P(|U_nX_n|>\varepsilon, |U_n| \leq M) + P(|U_nX_n|>\varepsilon, |U_n|>M).$$ For the first term on the right-hand side it holds: $$P(|U_nX_n|>\varepsilon, |U_n| \leq M) \leq  P(|U_n| \leq M) < \epsilon.$$ From the definition of $O_P(1)$ we know that for each $\epsilon$ such an $M$ exists.

3120702,"Smallest 3d grid cell shape that is ""faithful"" under isometries of the grid","This is a question I came up with while playing tetris, not any homework assignment. I tried thinking about it myself but it seems very complicated, and so I thought it would be a good idea to post the question here. I do not have the precise language to formulate my question, so I'll begin attempting to explain the question by first looking at the 2d case. Consider the 2d grid, whose vertices are Z^2, considering of squares of unit length. There are connected shapes in this grid, like the shapes you get in tetris. Some of those shapes, however, are special, in that under any 2 different isometries of the grid, you get 2 different shapes (can't translate one to coincide with the other). My question concerns the smallest such shape. In 2d it's quite easy, since there aren't a lot of possibilities - it's the L shape with one longer side: The following shape, however, is not special: since you can reflect it along the vertical axis and get the same shape. And so my question is if we move on to 3 dimensions or higher, what is the minimal special shape (consisting of least number of blocks)? Is there anything known about the sequence of the size of the smallest special shape in n dimensions?",['geometry']

I started to wonder if the pattern holds, and several plots for the first few powers of $2$ seem to suggest so. I thought perhaps it would be easier to prove the more general statement: For $n\in\{0,1,2,3,\ldots\}$ , prove that $$2^{n+1}\cot(2^{n+1}x)+\sum_{k=0}^n2^k\tan(2^kx)=\cot x$$ Presented this way, a proof by induction seems to be the smart way to do it. Base case: Trivial, we have $$\tan x+2\cot2x=\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}+\frac{2\cos2x}{\sin2x}=\frac{\cos^2x}{\sin x\cos x}=\cot x$$ Induction hypothesis: Assume that $$2^{N+1}\cot(2^{N+1}x)+\sum_{k=0}^N2^k\tan(2^kx)=\cot x$$ Inductive step: For $n=N+1$ , we have $$\begin{align*}
2^{N+2}\cot(2^{N+2}x)+\sum_{k=0}^{N+1}2^k\tan(2^kx)&=2^{N+2}\cot(2^{N+2}x)+2^{N+1}\tan(2^{N+1}x)+\sum_{k=0}^N2^k\tan(2^kx)\\[1ex]
&=2^{N+2}\cot(2^{N+2}x)+2^{N+1}\tan(2^{N+1}x)-2^{N+1}\cot(2^{N+1}x)+\cot x

3120750,Is there an algebraic way to determine the number of turning points of a polynomial from its factorization?,"This question came from a precalculus course: Let $f(x) = x^5 + x^3 - 6x$ . Find all the real zeros of $f$ with corresponding multiplicities and determine the number of turning points of the graph of the function. I believe students are expected to factor $f(x)$ into $x(x^2 - 2)(x^2 + 3)$ and determine the zeros are $x = 0, \sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}$ with multiplicity one each. I guess students are supposed to use graphing software to look at the graph and see that there's only two turning points. Is there any other way to do it? We know there are at most 4, since $f$ has degree 5, and at least 2 between the $x$ -intercepts, so there are either 2 or 4. In particular, is there anything about the irreducible quadratic $(x^2 + 3)$ in the factorization which suggests whether there are additional turning points? By messing around, I found that e.g. $x(x^2-2)(x^2-7x+12.5)$ has 4 turning points, but no additional zeros. I am aware that you can find the number of solutions to $f'(x) = 0$ , but as this is a precalculus course, I'm interested in algebraic methods.","['maxima-minima', 'algebra-precalculus', 'graphing-functions', 'polynomials']"

3121354,"Simple proof that $(1 + 1/n)^n$, $n \in \mathbb N$, is bounded above?","Here is the context of the problem. I'd like to prove that the sequence $$a_n = \left( 1 + \frac 1n \right)^n$$ converges using the monotone convergence theorem.  It is straightforward using Bernoulli's inequality to show that $\{a_n\}$ is increasing. To conclude the sequence converges it suffices to show it is bounded above. The toolbox available is somewhat limited. Just the basic ordered field properties, Bernoulli's inequality, etc. No exponential functions or logarithms are available. An argument that is essentially identical to the proof that $\{a_n\}$ is increasing shows that the sequence $$ b_n = \left( 1 + \frac 1n \right)^{n+1}$$ is decreasing.  Since $\{b_n\}$ is trivially bounded below it converges, and an application of the limit law shows $\{a_n\}$ converges to the same limit. This means I have a simple proof that $\{ a_n\}$ converges.  I'm curious if I am missing an easy way to work only with $\{a_n\}$ .  My question is that of the title: Is there a simple proof that $\{a_n\}$ is bounded above? Edited to add: thanks for the suggestions so far. The precise context of the problem is as an example in a real analysis class. The students are aware of the fact that the line is a complete ordered field, have seen the definition of a convergent sequence, have proved some limit laws, and have just seen the proof of the monotone convergence theorem. The binomial theorem and anything involving series aren't yet known. I could work through the proof of the binomial theorem, but I'm looking to see if there happens to be a really simple proof of boundedness of $\{a_n\}$ , not much more difficult than the proof that $\{b_n\}$ is bounded below.

3121489,Can there be two adjacent solid angles?,"Thanks for reading. My real question is the second part - in the first part I'm just explaining myself. Please read through! Thanks. In 2D geometry, it is easy to picture what it means to add up 2 angles. For example, in this random picture I got off the internet, I can say that $\angle A_5A_1A_4 + \angle A_4A_1A_3 = \angle A_5A_1A_3$ However, with 3D geometry, I'm having trouble picturing what it would mean to add up two solid angles. If I'm adding up solid angles $A$ and $B$ , I can't just draw the second angle $B$ so that it starts from the endpoint of $A$ , as I could if it was in 2 Dimensions, because solid angles don't have a single endpoint. So, how would I be able to picture 2 adjacent solid angles? Or 3 adjacent solid angles? Or does the idea of adjacency just not exist when we're considering solid angles? The reason I'm asking is because I'm working on a proof that involves n arbitrary shape with a point somewhere within it. In order for my proof to work, I need to split up the shape's surface into pieces in such a way that the angle subtended by any section of a piece of the shape's surface relative to the point within the shape is equal for all pieces of that shape's surface. As you can see, the angle subtended by each piece of the shape's surface (with each piece denoted by a different letter) is the same for all the pieces of that shape's surface. They each subtend the angle $\theta$ So, so far my proof is working (kinda) for 2D. But I need it to apply to 3D. But...how would I be able to do this in 3D? How would I be able to break up the 3D's shape surface into areas such that the angle (now a solid angle?) subtended by each section of that 3D shape's surface is equal for all the sections? Thanks!! Something else - when I break up the 3D shape into patches covering equal solid angles of its surface, I need all of the solid angles to be really small. Thanks!

3121593,An Engineer sets out to Prove Fermat's Last Theorem ...,"This started off as a joke post of mine on a Facebook Group called "" Bad Maths that Gives the Right Answer "", in which I pulled a Fermat and claimed that the last bit of the proof was too long to post. But the ""proof"" that I posted raised some questions that intrigued me, so I will repost it here and then raise my questions. Here we go ... I will start with the supposition that Fermat’s celebrated conjecture is false i.e., that there do in fact exist non-zero integer values of $x$ , $y$ , $z$ , and $n>2$ such that $$x^n+y^n=z^n$$ The degenerate case of $y=x$ will be ignored, since $2^{1/n}$ is irrational for $n>1$ , proving the conjecture for this trivial instance. Accordingly, since the ordering of $x$ and $y$ above is arbitrary, the fraction $r=y/x$ which is by definition rational, can be constrained to $0<r<1$ . Substitution into the supposition above, leads to $$\frac{x}{z}=(1+r^n)^{-\frac{1}{n}}$$ The LHS is (again, by definition) rational. Proof of Fermat’s conjecture therefore, requires proving that the RHS cannot be rational for $n>2$ , for any $r\in \mathbb{Q}$ . With the Generalised Binomial Theorem, we have $$
(1+r^n)^{-\frac{1}{n}}
=
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} {{-n^{-1}}\choose{k}}r^{kn}
=
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-n^{-1})_k}{k!}\prod_{j=1}^{kn}r
$$ which converges absolutely, since $|r|<1$ ( $y\neq x$ ), and the Pochhammer Symbol for the Binomial Coefficient is $$(-n^{-1})_k=-n^{-1}(-n^{-1}-1)(-n^{-1}-2)\cdots(-n^{-1}-k+1)$$ Note that for finite $k$ , each term of the series is a finite product of rationals and hence rational. However, if it can be proved that in the limit $k\rightarrow \infty$ , the product of the infinite products always yields an irrational number for $n>2$ and $r\in \mathbb{Q}$ , then Fermat’s conjecture is at once proved. Moreover, even if this were not the case, the falsity of the conjecture would still require showing that the infinite sum of rationals provably converges to a rational. For $n=2$ , there are at least some rational values of $r$ corresponding to the Pythagorean triples, for which the infinite sum does apparently converge to a rational number. Formal proof of Fermat’s conjecture for  therefore, requires demonstrating that there are no rational values of $r$ for which this is the case. I will resist the juvenile urge to “Pull a Fermat” again, and claim that I have a proof that is too large to fit here, and instead readily concede that such a proof is well above my capabilities as a lowly engineer. I do have the following questions, however: 1) Is this a viable approach? 2) Has something along these lines been attempted by Number Theorists before? 3) Can a form of the Thue-Siegel-Roth Theorem be used to determine the convergence to a rational/irrational?

( $S_1 \geq S_2 \geq S_3 \geq ... \geq S_n$ ) we want to prove that $S_{i-1} - S_{i} \leq n ;~~~ 2\leq i\leq n$ . For the proof, I wanted to use induction. If we think $n-1$ is satisfied, then if we add the $n$ -th team, in the worst situation if it wins all the games and all the teams in previous games have $n-2$ points (all equal), then we get $S_{new} - S_{first~Place~Before~Adding~New} = 2(n-1) - (n-2) = n$ . But the problem is I cannot prove that it is actually the worst situation. for example I cannot say if $S_{i} - S_{i-1} = n-1$ before adding the $n$ -th team, what will happen if I add $n$ -th team? P.S : Another approach is proof by contradiction. Let $S_i - S_{i-1} \geq n+1$ . Suppose this happens for the first and second place. first place has $a$ points and all others have at most $a-n-1$ then if we solve $(n-1)(a-n-1) + a \geq n(n-1)/2 \times2$ (Sum of the scores at the and is number of games *2). then we get $a\geq 2n -1/n -1$ . It is completely impossible for all other teams to have more than $2n-1/n-1 - n -1$ points. The problem is that I supposed that the $n+1$ point difference occurs between first and second place. I cannot generalize this method to other situations. So I think this question should have another proof without using induction. So I think I need new ideas to solve this. Maybe the problem is easier than this and I am thinking in a wrong way and I want to find a good approach to solve this problem. P.S : Added another approach which didn't lead to answer.
