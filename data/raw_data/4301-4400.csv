31605,Proof that $t-1-\log t \geq 0$ for $t > 0$,"Using basic calculus, I can prove that $f(t)=t-1-\log t \geq 0$ for $t > 0$ by setting the first derivative to zero
\begin{align}
\frac{df}{dt} = 1 - 1/t = 0
\end{align}
And so I have a critical point at $t=1$ and $f(1)=0$. Then I calculate the second derivative $\frac{d^2f}{dt^2} = 1/t^2 \geq 0$ meaning that $f$ is a convex function with a minimum value of 0 so $f \geq 0$ for $t > 0$. However, something in my gut tells me there's a way to prove this without even using the first or any derivative of $f$. I've been thinking about this for a while and I haven't been able to do this. Question is: can you prove $f\geq 0$ without relying on any derivatives of $f$?","['inequality', 'calculus']"
31614,How do you compute the steady state probabilities of a continuous time markov chain?,"Given a markov model with transition rate matrix $Q$, where the probability of each state at time $t$ is given by $P(t) = P(0)e^{Qt}$, where e is the matrix exponential, the steady state probabilities should be given by taking the $\lim_{t\to\infty}P(t)$. Is this the best way, or are there alternatives, and if so, how do you solve them with those methods? If not, how does one take the limit of the matrix exponential as t goes to infinity so that you can arrive at an analytical solution.",['probability']

31633,(Extended) Hall's Marriage Theorem from Dilworth's Theorem,"This question comes from Exercises III.4.5 and III.4.6 of Bourbaki's Set Theory . They are about using Dilworth's Theorem to prove Hall's Marriage Theorem (did it) and a mild extension of it (can't do it). Dilworth's Theorem: Let $E$ be a finite ordered set and $k$ be the maximal number of elements of an antichain in $E$. Then there exists a partition of $E$ into $k$ totally ordered sets. Hall's Marriage Theorem: Let $E$ and $F$ be two finite sets and let $x\rightarrow A(x)$ be a mapping of $E$ into $\mathfrak{P}(F)$ such that $\text{Card}(\bigcup_{x\in H}A(x))\geq\text{Card}(H)$ for any subset $H$ of $E$. Then there exists an injection $f$ of $E$ into $F$ such that $f(x)\in A(x)$ for each $x\in E$. To prove it, one defines an ordering on the disjoint union of $E$ and $F$ such that $x>y$ if and only if $x\in E$ and $y\in F$ and $y\in A(x)$. It is easy to see that $F$ is an antichain and that there is no antichain with more elements than $F$. So there exists a partition of $E\sqcup F$ into $\text{Card}(F)$ totally ordered sets, which are necessarily either one-point subsets of $F$ or pairs $\{x,y\}$ such that $y\in A(x)$. Those pairs define the asserted injection. Hall's Marriage Theorem (Extended Version): In the setting of above, suppose additionally that $G$ is a subset of $F$ and for each $L\subset G$, $\text{Card}(\{x\in E|A(x)\cap L\neq\emptyset\})\geq\text{Card}(L)$. Then we can choose $f$ as above with the additional property $G\subset f(E)$. The proof is sketched by Bourbaki as follows: Consider the disjoint union of $G$, $F$, and $E$, which I denote here as $(\{1\}\times G)\cup(\{2\}\times F)\cup(\{3\}\times E)$, and define an ordering on it by setting as only relations $(1,z)<(2,y)$ if and only if $z=y$ $(1,z)<(3,x)$ if and only if $z\in A(x)$ $(2,y)<(3,x)$ if and only if $y\in A(x)$ Then apply Dilworth's Theorem. The problem is that I don't quite know how. The greatest number of elements in an antichain is again $\text{Card}(F)$. So we get a partition of $G\sqcup F\sqcup E$ into $\text{Card}(F)$ totally ordered sets. Again, each of those sets contains exactly one element of $F$, at most one of $E$, and at most one of $G$. This way we can define an injection $f$ as before by defining $f(x)$ to be the element of $F$ which lies in the same set of the partition as $x$, but for $G\subset f(E)$ to hold, every set of the partition which contains an element of $G$ would have to contain an element of $E$ as well. But that's obviously not true for all partitions of $G\sqcup F\sqcup E$ into $\text{Card}(F)$ totally ordered sets. So I think that either one has to find a more sophisticated way of defining $f$ from a given partition or one has to modify the order relation before applying Dilworth's Theorem, somehow using the condition on the subsets of $G$. Does someone see a way to finish the proof?","['order-theory', 'combinatorics']"
31639,Rank of an interesting matrix,"Lets define: $U=\left \{  u_j\right \} , 1 \leq j\leq N= 2^{L},$ the set of all different binary sequences of length $L$. $V=\left \{  v_i\right \} , 1 \leq i\leq M=\binom{L}{k}2^{k},$ the set of all different gaped binary sequences with $k$ known bits and $L-k$ gaps. $A_{M*N}=[a_{i,j}]$ is a binary matrix defined as following: $$a_{i,j} = \left\{\begin{matrix}
1 & \text{if } v_i \text{ matches } u_j\\ 
0 & \text{otherwise }

2 & 0 & 1 &1 \\ 
0 & 2 & 1 &1 \\ 
1 & 1 & 2 &0 \\ 
1 & 1 & 0 &2 
\end{bmatrix}$$ For the special case $k=1$, this has been previously solved by joriki and the solution can be found here . any comments or suggestion is appreciated. $^{*}$ here dots denote gaps. a gap can take any value, and each gaped sequence with $k$ known bits and $(L−K)$ gaps in $V$, exactly matches to $2^{L−k}$ sequences in U, hence the sum of elements in each row of $A$ is $2^{L−k}$.","['matrices', 'computer-science', 'linear-algebra', 'graph-theory']"

31649,"Can I build a program that will tell me if a real world data set looks linear, logarithmic, exponential etc?","I have a bunch of real world data sets and from manually plotting some of the data in graphs, I've discovered some data sets look pretty much logarithmic and some look linear, or exponential (and some look like a mess :). I've been reading up on curve fitting / data fitting on wikipedia and if I understand it correctly (which I seriously doubt) I can calculate a curve of best fit using least squares calculations, but I have to determine if I want to have the curve fit a logarithm, linear or exponential (etc) pattern first. What I would really like to do is to pass a data set into a function (I'm a programmer with poor math skills) and have that return something like ""this data set looks more linear than logarithmic"" or ""this looks exponential"". My question is: is that even possible, without a human looking at a graph and recognizing the pattern ? My guess is: yes. But before I invest a ton of time in figuring out how to program this, I just want to make sure I'm not barking up the wrong tree and confirm this with you guys if possible.

31651,roots of $f(z)=z^4+8z^3+3z^2+8z+3=0$ in the right half plane,"This is a question in Ahlfors in the section on the argument principle: How many roots of the equation $f(z)=z^4+8z^3+3z^2+8z+3=0$ lie in the right half plane? He gives a hint that we should ""sketch the image of the imaginary axis and apply the argument principle to a large half disk."" Since $f$ is an entire function, I think I understand that the argument principle tells us that for any closed curve $\gamma$ in $\mathbb{C}$, the winding number of $f(\gamma)$ around 0 is equal to the number of zeros of $f$ contained inside $\gamma$.

31686,Can any of the exotic differentiable structures on $\mathbb R^4$ make $GL(\mathbb R^2)$ into an 'exotic' Lie group structure?,"I am just beginning to learn about Lie groups and am made somewhat uncomfortable by the textbook's handwavy decision to talk about Lie groups $GL(V)$ where $V$ is some $n$-dimensional real vector space.

I believe that maybe the requirement that matrix multiplication be differentiable might settle the issue, but I have no idea to go about showing this. Otherwise, if I choose to believe that all $n$-dimensional vector spaces for $n\neq 4$ have a unique differentiable structure (they have unique topologies for sure), it becomes obvious that talking about $GL(V)$ for arbitrary real vector spaces is perfectly sensical.

31688,Every Function in a Finite Field is a Polynomial Function,"From a bank of past master's exams I am going through: Let $F$ be a finite field. Show that any function from $F$ to $F$ is a polynomial function. I know that finite fields are fields of $p$ elements for $p$ prime [EDIT: It's actually $p^n$ for $p$ prime; see comment below]. Since I have $p$ choices for the $p$ elements to map to, then I have $p^p$ distinct functions. I think every function can be written in the form $f(x) = a_{p-1}x^{p-1} + \dots + a_0x^0$. For then given the values $f(0), f(1), \ldots f(p-1)$, I can solve for the coefficents by the linear system of equations $$ a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} n^i a_i = f(n).$$ This then gives me a $p-1 \times p-1$ square matrix over the field $\mathbb{F}_p$: $$\left( \begin{array}{ccccc}
1& 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
1& 1 & 1 & \dots & 1 \\

But I am a bit stumped on how to show this (partially because I don't think I've ever done linear algebra in a vector space over a finite field). It does not seem easy to show linear independence, or nonzero determinant, or full row rank. Alternatively (I just thought of this), can I show this is true by arguing that the map between the two sets (the set of polynomials of degree $p-1$; and the set of functions $F \to F$) is injective, and that it must be a bijection because the sets have the same cardinality $p^p$?","['matrices', 'finite-fields', 'linear-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"

31859,What concept does an open set axiomatise?,"In the context of metric (and in general first-countable) topologies, it's reasonably clear what a closed set is: a set $F$ is closed if and only if every convergent sequence of points in $F$ converges to a point also in $F$. This naturally generalises to the definition of a closed set in an arbitrary topological space using the concept of limit points... but limit points are defined in terms of open sets, which are, to me, somewhat more mysterious than closed sets. I was once told that ultrafilters axiomatise the concept of (sets of) big sets. I'm hoping here to find a similar conceptual picture of topologies defined by systems of open sets, preferably without reference to closed sets. One such explanation I've seen is that open set axiomatise the concept of nearness, which, I suppose, is fair enough at least for metric topologies. Indeed, if something is ""happening"" at points near $x \in X$, then it's usually the case that every open neighbourhood $U \subseteq X$ of $x$ contains an open subset $V \subseteq U$, $x \in V$, such that the something ""happens"" at all points in $V$. But what about non-metrisable topologies, particularly the coarse ones where there are no ""small"" open sets? Consider, for example, the Zariski topology on affine $n$-space $\mathbb{A}^n$. $\mathbb{A}^n$ is irreducible, so every non-empty open set is dense. It seems reasonable to interpret this to mean that every non-empty open set is ""large"". Indeed, if we work over the complex numbers, then in the usual metric geometry, Zariski-open sets are unbounded and have full measure, so are very large indeed, so I don't think it's fair to say that open sets are capturing the notion of nearness here. I'm also curious about the history of point set topology. When were the axioms first written down? What were the first ""non-geometric"" examples of topological spaces — ""non-geometric"" here referring to either non-metrisable topologies or topologies on sets other than sets of points of some intuitively geometric object — and were they part of the motivations for creating point set topology?","['general-topology', 'math-history']"

My question here is like this: Let $\alpha (s) = \sum a_n n^{-s}$. If $\sum a_n = a \ (R, k)$, then does the limit $\lim_{s \to 0^+} \alpha (s)$ exist? If so, then does the limit coincide with $a$?

31990,"With Choice, is any linearly ordered set well-ordered if no subset has order type $\omega^*$?","I've been fumbling around with order types and ordinals these past few days. I read about partial, total, and well-ordered structures, and I'm curious to see if a linearly ordered set has no subset with order type $\omega^*$, then it is in fact well ordered. Here $\omega^*$ is the order type of the negative integers. My idea was this. Let $X$ be some totally ordered set such with subset with order type $\omega^*$. Take any nonempty subset $Y$ of $X$. If $Y$ is finite, it must have a least element, so assume $Y$ is infinite. By way of contradiction, I assume $Y$ has no least element. My strategy was to then somehow construct a subset of $Y$ which has order type $\omega^*$. I do this by first picking an element $a_0$ from $Y$. Since $Y$ has no least element, and since $Y$ is also totally ordered, there must be some other element $a_1\in Y$ such that $a_1\prec a_0$. Again, $a_1$ is not the least element of $Y$, so we can find an element $a_2\in Y$ such that $a_2\prec a_1\prec a_0$. Continuing along, I would eventually have a set $Z=\{\dots,a_3,a_2,a_1,a_0\}$, where I have written it in increasing order. But then $Z$ has order type $\omega^*$, a contradiction. Does this argument hold up? If so, I feel it is a little handwavey, and the ""continuing along"" part needs to be formalized. Is there a way to do so with Choice or maybe (transfinite) recursion? I fear I may have written nonsense, as I've done many times in the past. Thanks for any criticism and insights.","['axiom-of-choice', 'elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory']"
31991,How many steps does it take the computer to solve a Sudoku puzzle?,"We all know what Sudoku is. Given a Sudoku puzzle, one can use a simple recursive procedure to solve it using a computer. Before describing the algorithm, we make some definitions. A partial solution is a Sudoku puzzle with only some of the numbers entered. Given an empty square in a partial solution, an assignment of a digit to the square is consistent if it doesn't appear in the same row, column or $3\times 3$ square. The algorithm is as follows: If there is any square for which there is no consistent assignment, give up. Otherwise, pick an empty square $S$ (*). Calculate the set of all consistent assignments $A$ to this square. Go over all assignments $a \in A$ in some order (**): Put $a$ in $S$, and recurse. We have two degrees of freedom: choosing an empty square, and choosing and order for the assignments to the square. In practice, it seems that whatever the choice is, the algorithm reaches a solution very fast. Suppose we give the algorithm a partial Sudoku with a unique solution. Can we bound the number of steps the algorithm takes to find the solution? To make life easier, you can choose any rule you wish for ( * ) and (**), even a random rule (in that case, the relevant quantity is probably the expectation); any analyzable choice would be interesting. Also, if it helps, you can assume something about the input - say at least $X$ squares are filled in. I'm also willing to relax the restriction that there be a unique solution - indeed, even given an empty board, the algorithm above finds a complete Sudoku very fast.

32107,Probability distribution for the remainder of a fixed integer,"In the ""Notes"" section of Modern Computer Algebra by Joachim Von Zur Gathen, there is a quick throwaway remark that says: Dirichlet also proves the fact, surprising at first sight, that for fixed $a$ in a division the remainder $r = a \operatorname{rem} b$, with $0 \leq r < b$, is more likely to be smaller than $b/2$ than larger: If $p_a$ denotes the probability for the former, where $1 \leq b \leq a$ is chosen uniformly at random, then $p_a$ is asymptotically $2 - \ln{4} \approx 61.37\%$. The note ends there and nothing is said about it again. This fact does surprise me, and I've tried to look it up, but all my searches for ""Dirichlet"" and ""probability"" together end up being dominated by talks of Dirichlet stochastic processes (which, I assume, is unrelated).

32108,How is Riemann–Stieltjes integral a special case of  Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral?,"Thanks for reading! My questions are based on the following quotes from Wikipedia: About the existence of 
Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral : The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral $  \int_a^b f(x)\,dg(x)$ is defined
  when
  ƒ : [a,b] → R is Borel-measurable and
  bounded and g : [a,b] → R is of
  bounded variation in [a,b] and
  right-continuous, or when ƒ is
  non-negative and g is monotone and
  right-continuous. I was wondering if this is the right
condition for its existence? About the existence of
Riemann–Stieltjes integral : The best simple existence theorem
  states that if f is continuous and g
  is of bounded variation on [a, b],
  then the integral exists. A function g
  is of bounded variation if and only if
  it is the difference between two
  monotone functions. If g is not of
  bounded variation, then there will be
  continuous functions which cannot be
  integrated with respect to g. In
  general, the integral is not
  well-defined if f and g share any
  points of discontinuity, but this
  sufficient condition is not necessary. On the other hand, a classical result
  of Young (1936) states that the
  integral is well-defined if f is
  α-Hölder continuous and g is β-Hölder
  continuous with α + β > 1. For the question in the part 3, I
was wondering for Riemann–Stieltjes
integral $\int_a^b f(x) \, dg(x) $
to exist, must g be nondecreasing?
It looks like not the case quoted
above. Specialization from Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral to Riemann–Stieltjes integral : Where f is a continuous real-valued
  function of a real variable and g is a
  non-decreasing real function, the
  Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is
  equivalent to the Riemann–Stieltjes
  integral, I was wondering  why it only mentions the case when g is nondecreasing? Is this the necessary condition for existence of Riemann-Stieltjes integral? Do Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral and
Riemann–Stieltjes integral generally
use the same notation $  \int_a^b f(x)\,dg(x)$? How does one
know which one the notation refers
to? Thanks for helping!","['functional-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'integration', 'real-analysis']"

My professor suggested that, since $B^2$ fits the characteristic polynomial of $A$, $\mu_A(x) = (x-1)(x+1)(x-a)$, then the minimal polynomial of $B$ must divide $\mu_A(x^2) = (x^2-1)(x^2+1)(x^2-a) = (x-1)(x+1)(x^2+1)(x^2-a)$.
