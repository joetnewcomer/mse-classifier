240139,quadratic and bilinear forms,"Does a quadratic form always come from symmetric bilinear form ?
We know when $q(x)=b(x,x)$ where $q$ is a quadratic form and $b$ is a symmetric bilinear form.
But when we just take a bilinear form and $b(x,y)$ and write $x$ instead of $y$,does it give us a quadratic form ?","['linear-algebra', 'bilinear-form']"
240144,Probability of seeing to a certain distance in a forest and related problems,"I was walking in a forest one day and saw trees all around me. I begun wondering about how far do I see in the forest on average. I was also reminded to the ""proof"" that the age of the universe is finite, ie. that if universe was infinitely old, the light from every star everywhere would have reached us and no matter where we look in the sky, we would see a point of light, this is not true, thus universe is of finite age. I know that the distribution of the number of tree ""cores"" or centers on a given area $N(A)$ is the Poisson distribution, ie. $P(N(A)=n) = (\lambda A)^n e^{-(\lambda A)}/n!$. So, I asked myself, if I had one of those laser distance measuring things, pointed it to a random direction parallel to the ground and waited till the distance ($X$) was shown, what would be the distribution of $X$? Assume the trees are all of the same diameter $d$, the ground is flat and all trees are perfectly smooth. How would this be generalized to higher dimensions? I then asked the follow up question: if there was a red rectangle placed perpendicular to my line of sight, how far would it have to be placed so that I would no longer be able to see it, ie. the fraction visible behind the trees would be small, ie. smaller than some small $\varepsilon$? edit: The answer to the first question, attempt: Lets take that I stand in an empty spot and fire the laser to a random direction. Assume that $x$ is the distance travelled, $\frac{d}{2} $ is the radius of the trees. (I would like to add a pic, but don't really know how). Then we need to calculate the area where there can be no tree centers. Thus around me there is a circle with radius $d/2$ where there are no trees, the laser is surrounded by area the width of which is $d$ and finally at the end there is a semicircle of radius $\frac{d}{2} $. Thus we sum all these together (negative cause I stood in a clearing of radius $\frac{d}{2} $) $$A = -\frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2 + x d + \frac{\pi}{2}\left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2 = x d$$ Then, using the Poisson distribution I gave above, we get the cumulative distribution function of $X$: $$1-P(X\ge x) = 1-e^{- \lambda d x}.$$ This is Weibull distribution with parameters $1$ and $1/(\lambda d)$. The expected value is thus $E(X)=\frac{1}{\lambda d}.$ This answers my first question. I think it would be pretty easy to extend to other dimensions. The last question is a bit too intimidating.","['geometry', 'probability-distributions']"

So then, I set $f(n) = \frac{1}{n (\ln n)^2}$ and $g(n) = \frac{1}{n}$ and did the following: $$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f'(n)}{g'(n)} = 
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{-\frac{\ln(n) + 2}{n^2 (\ln n)^3}}{-\frac{1}{n^2}} =

\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{(\ln n)^2} + \frac{2}{(\ln n)^3} = 0
$$ I know that $\sum \frac{1}{n}$ diverges due to properties of harmonic series, and so concluded that my first expression $\frac{1}{n (\ln n)^2}$ also must diverge.

240191,Assignment on PDE with Neumann boundary conditions,"So, I got the following assignment. Let $D\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ bounded open set woth smooth boundary. Consider the Neumann boundary problem $$-\Delta u =f \text{, and } \left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}\right|_{\partial D}=0.$$ (a) Define the notion of weak solution. (b) Formulate and prove an existance theorem for weak solutions. So, what I have done so far. We have $-\int_D\Delta u\; v=\int_D Du\; Dv-\int_{\partial D}\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}v$ when ever this makes sense and by enforcing the boundary conditions we get $-\int_D\Delta u\; v=\int_D Du\; Dv$. A solution to the problem satisfies $-\int_D\Delta u\; v=\int_D f\; v$, $\forall v\in L^2(D)$, so we get $$-\int_D\Delta u\; v=\int_D f\; v, \forall v\in H^1 (D).$$ Let $u\sim v \Leftrightarrow u-v=c\in\mathbb{R}$ and let $V$ be the space created of choosing from every equivalent class in $H^1(D)$ the function with the smallest norm. It's eaasy to show that $V$ is Hilbert. Anyway, I would like to use LAx-Milgram on $V$. So let $B(u,v)=\int_D Du\; Dv$. $B(\cdot,\cdot)$ is clearly bilinear. $|B(u,v)|\le ||Du||_{L^2(D)}||Dv||_{L^2(D)}\le ||u||_{H^1(D)}||v||_{H^1(D)}$. Then assume that $B(u,u)=0\;\Rightarrow\;\int(Du)^2=0\; \Rightarrow u=c$, but by definition of $V$, $u=0$. So Lax-Milgram theorem can be applied here, which means that for every functional $F(v)=\int_Df\;v$ on $V$ there is a unique element $u$ of $V$ for which we have $B(u,v)=F(v)$. The problem I have here is that $V$ is too big, in fact I forgot about the boundary condition. Now I would like to define $V_0=\{u\in V:\left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}\right|_{\partial D}=0\}$ but I am afraid that $\left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}\right|_{\partial D}$ is not in $L^2(\partial D)$ for all elements of $V$ but rather for only for $V\cap H^2(D)$. Also there is a hint in the assignment that says to use the fact that if $v\in H^1(D)$ and $\int_D f=0$ then $||f||_L^2(D)\le C ||Df||_{L^2(D)}$ and I cannot see how this is useful to me.","['functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

Theorem 1 Every subset of a collinear set is collinear. Theorem 2 Every collinear set can be extended to a line. 1 holds by definition whereas it does not hold by the previous definition. 2 also holds by the previous definition but requires Zorn's lemma by the current definition.

240477,Question of Hartshorne book's Proposion II.(2.6),"In Proposition II. (2.6) of Hartshorne book ""algebraic geometry"".
I can't understand proof of part.
In proof, let $V$ be an affine variety over field $k$ with the sheaf of regular function $\mathcal{O}_V$ and affine coordinate ring $A$. Let $X={\rm Spec}A$. Now, define a morphism of locally ringed spaces $$ \beta : (V, \mathcal{O}_V) \rightarrow X$$ as follows: For each point $p \in V$, $\beta(p)=\mathcal{m}_p$, the maximal ideal corresponding at $p$. And for any open set $U \subseteq X$, define a ring homomorphism $\mathcal{O}_X(U) \rightarrow \beta_*(\mathcal{O}_V(U)=\mathcal{O}_V(\beta^{-1}(U))$.
Givena section $s\in \mathcal{O}_X(U)$, and given a point $p\in \beta^{-1}(U)$, we define $s(p)$ by taking the image of $s$ in the stalk $\mathcal{O}_{X,\beta(p)}$, which is isomorphic to the local ring $A_{\mathcal{m}_p}$, and then passing to the quotient ring $A_{\mathcal{m}_p}/\mathcal{m}_p$ which is isomorphic to the field $k$. Thus, we regard $s$ as a function from $\beta^{-1}(U)$ to $k$. In book, this homomorphism gives an isomorphism $\mathcal{O}_X(U) \cong \mathcal{O}_V(\beta^{-1}(U))$.

So given a vector $v \in V$ and a covector $\phi \in V^*$, you can act on $v$ with $\phi$ to get a real number $\phi(v)$. Is that ""it"" or is there more to it?

I know that the problem of deciding whether a Diophantine equation $P(\vec{x}) = 0$ has any solutions is undecidable (Hilbert's 10th problem).  Since the integers form a ring, $\mathbb{Z}[\vec{x}]$ (the polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$ with coefficients $\vec{x}$) is also a ring.  So the question can be restated as asking whether the variety of $\langle P \rangle$ is empty or not.  But $$\mathbf{V}(\langle P \rangle) = \mathbf{V}(G(\langle P \rangle))$$ where $\mathbf{V}(I)$ is the variety of the ideal $I$, and $G(I)$ is a Groebner basis for $I$.  So we can check whether $\mathbf{V}(\langle P \rangle)$ is empty by checking whether $G(\langle P \rangle) = G(\langle 1 \rangle)$.  But that would give us a decision procedure for solving Diophantine equations. I'm assuming that I've gone wrong either: Assuming that I can compute a Groebner basis for $\langle P \rangle$ (since the integers don't form a field, I don't know whether this is legit) Assuming that Groebner bases have the same properties (like being canonical) if they're done over an arbitrary, non-field base ring Something else?

As a side note, it turns out, that this particular product is a particular Browein integral (Wikipedia) using as a sequence $a_k = 2^{-k}$ which exactly sums to 1. The extra term in the front makes this true for the finite sequence as well. In the limit $k \to \infty$ , that term just becomes $1$ , not changing the product at all.

240913,Category theory without codomains?,"A surjection is a function whose range equals its codomain. Thus, the distinction between functions and surjections requires the notion of a codomain. Similarly, a bijection is an injection whose range equals its codomain. So this distinction, too, requires the notion of a codomain. However, codomains seem like a very artificial idea, to myself and many others; and so we avoid using them. Thus, we speak of functions $f:X \rightarrow Y$ and functions $f: X \twoheadrightarrow Y$, the latter being a substitute for the notion of a surjection. And we speak of injections $f:X \rightarrow Y$ and injections $f:X \twoheadrightarrow Y$, the latter being a substitute for the notion of a bijection. That's all well and good, but there's a tension here lurking beneath the surface. The source of the tension is category theory, which stipulates that morphisms have not only domains but also codomains. So unless we can reformulate category theory without codomains, we're sort of trapped. Has anyone managed to do this? If not, here's my very preliminary attempt at doing so. A category* will consist of the following data: a class of objects, a class of isomorphisms ( not homomorphisms), each of which has a unique domain and range; an operation that composes isomorphisms; and two partial order relations defined on the class of objects, namely the relation ""is a subobject of"" and ""is a quotient object of"". So for example, the statement ""$f$ is monomorphism $X \rightarrow Y$"" would be interpreted as ""There exists a subobject of $Y$, call it $B$, such that $f$ is an isomorphism with domain $X$ and range $B$."" And the statement ""$f$ is a morphism $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$"" would be interpreted as ""There exists a quotient object of $X$, call it $A$, such that $f$ is an isomorphism with domain $A$ and range $Y$."" Anyway, I'd be interested in hearing people's opinion on the matter. EDIT. Just to clarify, this approach would appeal to people whom prefer to define functions (etc.) as their graph, rather than as a triple.","['abstract-algebra', 'category-theory', 'functions']"

240916,Showing a composition is isomorphic to additive group,"Consider the law of composition $(x,y) \rightarrow  \sqrt[3]{x^3+y^3}$ on the set of real numbers. Show that this law of composition defines a group isomorphic to the additive group ($G$) of $\mathbb{R}$. My attempt: 
So I know the additive group on $\mathbb{R}$ is just the set of all real numbers that
1)  have an identity such that : $x+e = e+x$ for all $x \in G$ i.e. ($e=0$)
2)  have an additive inverse
3)  are associative My confusion arises because Im not sure what composition of two elements for instance $(x_1,y_1) \circ (x_2,y_2)$ looks like. Do I add $\sqrt[3]{x_1^3+y_1^3} + \sqrt[3]{x_2^3+y_2^3}$ which then has two values both in $\mathbb{R}$ and then I can see that we are just adding real numbers, which makes sense for the isomorphism, or is the law of composition $\sqrt[3]{(x_1+x_2)^3+(y_1+y_2)^3}$, in which case im a bit lost. How do I know which is the proper way to compose in the original group?
Im heavily leaning towards the first option, because then we can have that $(0,0)$ be our identity element, and $-(x,y)$ be our inverse and we have a subgroup, but I dont understand why this is the law of composition to choose. In terms of showing that it is an isomorphism, unfortunatley, I am completely lost. Any help is appreciated, thanks!","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

If the isomorphism between tangent spaces in different point isn't natural, why can't we differentiate a vector field in the usual way? The problem is comparing vectors belonging in different (isomorphic) vector spaces; but we can send the two vectors, with an isomorphism, in a common vector space and then subtract them.

Let $\alpha:=\sqrt{(2+\sqrt{2})(3+\sqrt{3})}$. After some computations I was able to show that $[K:\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt2,\sqrt3)]=2$, thus proving that $[K:\mathbb{Q}]=8$. After some more computations I was able to find that the polynomial $f=144-288 x^2+144 x^4-24 x^6+x^8$ has $\alpha$ as a root, but I don't know if this is useful. My idea was: 1) To show that $K=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$, and thus $f$ would be the irreducible polynomial of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, 2) To show that $\pm \sqrt{(2\pm \sqrt{2})(3\pm \sqrt{3})}\in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$, 3) To show that these are all the roots of $f$. This would prove that $K$ is a splitting field for $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, thus proving that $K/\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois. I couldn't do part 1). Assuming part 1, part 2) is easy as can be seen multiplying those elements (they live on $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt2,\sqrt3)$.) Part 3) is a straightforward, albeit tedious, computation.

I am not sure why I need that the sets are bounded. My proof is as follows:  Begin by constructing a sequence $(p_n)$ such that the $n^{th}$ term is an element of $E_n.$ $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\text{diam}(E_n)=0,$ for each $\epsilon>0$ there is an $N$ such that if $n\geq N$, $|\text{diam}(E_n)-0| <\epsilon.$ Fix N. This implies if $p$ and $q$ are in $E_N$, $d(p,q)<\epsilon$. By the way we constructed our sequence, we know that there is some $p_N\in E_N$ and for all $p_{N'}$ and $p_{M'}$  where $N'\geq N',M'\geq N$, $d(p_{N'},p_{M'})<\epsilon$ because $p_{N'}\in E_{N'} \subset E_{N}$ and $p_{M'}\in E_{M'} \subset E_{N}$. Thus this sequence is Cauchy. We are given that $X$ is complete, thus every Cauchy sequence converges. Let $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}p_n=p$. We know every open ball around $p$ must contain all but finitely many elements of the sequence--thus it must contain some element of each $E_n$.  Therefore $p$ is a limit point of each $E_n$ since the sets are nested. Since each $E_n$ is closed, $p$ must be an element of each $E_n$.  Thus $\bigcap_1^\infty E_n$ is nonempty. At this point we just need to show that $p$ is the only element in the grand intersection. Assume via contradiction that there exists more than one point $p$ in the  grand intersection. Call it $q$.  Let $L=d(p,q)$.  Choose $\epsilon<L$.  Then for each $n$, $p\in E_n$ and $q\in E_n$ and $\text{diam}(E_n)\geq L>\epsilon$.  Thus,$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\text{diam}(E_n)\neq 0$--a contradiction. Therefore $\bigcap_1^\infty E_n$ contains only one point, namely $p$.
