2953703,Separation of Variables in Integration. Why is it necessary?,"I'm quite a novice with differential equations and such and english isn't my first language so I ask to please explain everything in simple english terms. I am currently studying differentiation equations in school and one of the tricks is ""separation of variables"". The trick is very simple and I get how its used. You replace $y'$ with $dy/dx$ and juggle the equation around until all the $y$ 's are on one side and all the $x$ 's are on the other. Then you can integrate However what I do NOT understand is how this is necessary in a mathematical sense. $y'$ is not $y$ . It is the function of change for $y$ . So why can't I just integrate right away? I know it won't work but I don't get why it wouldn't. Let's say we got the following function: $$y' = -\frac{x}{y}$$ I understand that if I don't separate the variables that $y$ will remain in the solution so essentially the solution of $y$ will have $y$ in it, but in a mathematical sense I still don't get the connection. Is it really just a cheap trick or is there actual logic behind whats happening here other than just ""doing it to get rid of $y$ "".","['integration', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
2953765,"Trouble proving $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty (-\frac1n,1+\frac1n) = [0,1]$","I learned in class that the finite intersection of open sets is open. With that ""big picture"" in mind I want to prove the following: Define $ A:=\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} I_n $ , where $I_n:=\left(-\frac{1}{n}, 1+\frac{1}{n}\right). \text{Then } A = [0,1]$ It seems very obvious that A equals $ [0,1] $ , but I am having trouble proving that the two sets are equal to each other. I think I have to show that $ A \subset [0.1]$ and $ [0,1] \subset A $ . It is very irritating because I don't know where to begin. Which direction should I take to prove the two sets are equal? Any help or hint in any form would be very much appreciated. I believe this question would be helpful for novices like me, because the answers I found from the ""similar questions"" tab do not discuss how to prove that the sets are identical.","['elementary-set-theory', 'real-numbers', 'real-analysis']"
2953796,Golden Ratio plus 1,"There was an interesting puzzle by Presh Talwalker in 'MindYourDecisions' about finding the radius of a circle that was cotangent to two larger circles. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0dZukEw1JY I extended the problem by considering adding a second small circle adjacent to the circle of radius 2, (now 16 in my diagram) and wondered what the radius of the two large circles would have to be to make the two small circles have equal radii. The attached diagram will make this more clear. I was surprised to find that the ratio of the two circles must be equal to 2.61803398875 which is, of course, the Golden Ratio + 1 The straight lines tangent to the larger circles subtend an angle of 53.130102 degrees. The series of circles can be extended to the right indefinitely and will give pairs of circles of equal radii. See second image. Has this been found before? I have looked on the Internet without finding anything.",['geometry']
2953805,Sum of values of an irreducible character is non-negative integer,"I am trying to prove the following fact: If $G$ is a finite group, $\chi$ is a complex irreducible character of $G$ and $\{g_1,\cdots,g_r\}$ is a complete set of representatives of conjugacy classes in $G$ then $\chi(g_1)+\cdots + \chi(g_r)$ is a non-negative integer. It is easy to prove that the above quantity is integer. Sketch of proof: if $|G|=m$ then the components in the  above expression lie in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_m)$ and automorphisms of this field correspond to bijections from $G$ to $G$ which permute conjugacy classes (maps $G\rightarrow G$ , $g\mapsto g^l$ where $(l,|G|)=1$ and correspondingly there are Galois automorphisms); hence above quantity is invariant under all automorphisms of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_m)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and is an algebraic integer.

2953867,"Proof Check: Let $f_{0}(x)=\frac{1}{1-x},$ and $f_{n}(x)=f_{0}(f_{n-1}(x))$ for any positive integer $n$. Find $f_{2018}(2018)$","Let us denote by $F$ the set of real-valued functions of a real variable such that $$F=\left\{\frac{1}{1-x},\frac{x-1}{x},x\right\}.$$ We shall prove that this set forms an abelian group under the compositon of functions. We first notice that the set has closure and is commutative. Indeed, \begin{alignat*}{2}
					\left(x\right)\circ\left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right) &= \left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right)\in F &&= \left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right)\circ \left(x\right)\\
					\left(x\right)\circ\left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right) &= \left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right)\in F &&= \left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right)\circ \left(x\right)\tag{1}\\
					\left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right)\circ\left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right) &= \ \quad\left(x\right)\in F &&= \left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right)\circ \left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right).
				\end{alignat*} Now, we clain that $x$ is the identity element of the set. Indeed, \begin{alignat*}{2}
					\left(x\right)\circ\left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right) &= \left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right)\circ \left(x\right) &&= \frac{1}{1-x}\\
					\left(x\right)\circ\left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right) &= \left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right)\circ \left(x\right) &&= \frac{x-1}{x}\tag{2}
				\end{alignat*} $$					\left(x\right)\circ\left(x\right) = x.$$ Moreover, we see from (1) and (2) that every element is invertible, hence the set forms an abelian group under the composition operator. We would now like to show that $F$ is a cyclic group: Let us define the $n^{\text{th}}$ power $f^{n}$ of an element of $f\text{ of } F$ as the following $$f^n =\begin{cases}
			e & : n = 0 \\
			f^{n-1} \circ f & : n > 0 \\
		\left({f^{-n}}\right)^{-1} & : n < 0
		\end{cases}$$ where $e$ is the identity element of $F.$ We have to prove that every element in $F$ can be expressed as the power of a single element from $F$ . We claim this generator is $\frac{1}{1-x}$ . Indeed, $$\frac{1}{1-x}^{0}=x,\qquad \frac{1}{1-x}^{1}=\frac{1}{1-x},\qquad \frac{1}{1-x}^{2}=\frac{x-1}{x},\\$$ hence $F$ is the cyclic group of order 2 generated by $\frac{1}{1-x}$ . Namely, $$ F=\left\{\frac{1}{1-x}^{0},\frac{1}{1-x}^{1},\frac{1}{1-x}^{2}  \right\}=\left<\frac{1}{1-x}\right>.\\$$ All cyclic groups of equal order being isomorphic to each other, consider the bijection $\phi\colon\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}\to{F}\colon\phi(2^{n})=\frac{1}{1-x}^{n}$ . We would like to show this is a homomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ to $F$ . Note that $\phi(2^{n})=\frac{1}{1-x}^{n}$ holds for all $n$ , for let $n$ be an integer such that $n = q k + r$ for $0 \le r < k$ . Now $$
	2^n = 2^r,\qquad \text{and}\qquad \frac{1}{1-x}^r = \frac{1}{1-x}^n,\\
$$ thus $$
	\phi (2^{n}) = \phi (2^{r}) = \frac{1}{1-x}^r = \frac{1}{1-x}^n.
$$ Now let $x,y$ be in $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ . Since $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}=<2>,$ it follows that there exist integers $s,t$ such that $$x=2^{s} ,\qquad \text{and}\qquad  y=2^{r}, $$ thus, \begin{align*}
			\phi(xy)&=\phi(2^{s}2^{t})\\
			\qquad	&=\phi(2^{s+t})\\
			\qquad	&=\frac{1}{1-x}^{s+t}\\
			\qquad	&=\frac{1}{1-x}^{s}\frac{1}{1-x}^{t}\\
			\qquad	&=\phi(2^{s})\phi(2^{t})\\
			\qquad	&=\phi(x)\phi(y)
		\end{align*} so $\phi$ is a homomorphism. As $\phi$ is a bijection, then it is also an isomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ to $F$ , hence $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong F$ , as desired. Lastly, let $h\colon \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ be a function mapping a positive integer into its equivalence class modulo 3. Then \begin{alignat*}{4}
			&\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad f_{2018}(x)&&=(\phi\circ h)(x)\\
			&              &&=\phi(h(2018))(x)\\
			&              &&=\phi(2)(x)\\
			&              &&=\phi(2)(x)=\frac{1}{1-x}^2\\
			&              &&=x\\
			&\qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \implies f_{2018}(2018)        &&=2018

2953950,A random $r$-regular graph can be generated by taking union of a a random $(r-1)$-regular graph and a perfect matching.,"$\newcommand{\lrp}[1]{\left(#1\right)}$ $\newcommand{\set}[1]{\{#1\}}$ $\newcommand{\mc}{\mathcal}$ $\newcommand{\E}{\mathbb E}$ $\newcommand{\N}{\mathbb N}$ Definition. Let $(\Omega_n, \mc F_n)$ be a sequence of measurable spaces and suppose we are given two probability distributions $P_n$ and $Q_n$ on $(\Omega_n, \mc F_n)$ for each $n$ .
We say that the sequences $(P_n)$ and $(Q_n)$ are contiguous if for each sequence of events $(A_n)$ , where $A_n\in \mc F_n$ , we have that $P_n(A_n)\to 1$ as $n\to \infty$ if and only if $Q_n(A_n)\to 1$ as $n\to \infty$ . We $\mc G^*(n, r)$ to denote the set of all the $r$ -regular multigraphs on the set $V=[n]=\set{1 , \ldots, n}$ (a multigraphs allows for loops and multiple edges).
We define a probability distribution on $\mc G^*(n, r)$ as follows. Assume $rn$ is even.
Define a configuration as a perfect matching of the set $V\times [r]$ , where $[r]=\set{1 , \ldots, r}$ .
Given a configuration, we naturally obtain an $r$ -regular multigraph on $V$ by ``projecting"" the configuration.
The uniform probability distribution on the set of configurations pushes forward to give a probability distribution $G^*(n, r)$ on $\mc G^*(n, r)$ . Note that if $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are two probability distributions on $\mc G^*(n, r)$ and $\mc G^*(n, s)$ respectively, then we get a probability distribution $\sigma+\tau$ on $\mc G^*(n, r + s)$ as follows.
Put the product measure $\sigma\otimes \tau$ on $\mc G^*(n, r)\times \mc G^*(n, r)$ and define $\sigma+\tau$ as the push-forward of $\sigma\otimes \tau$ under the ``union map"" $\mc G^*(n, r)\times \mc G^*(n, s) \to \mc G^*(n, r+s)$ . The following is true and I want to understand the proof of this. Theorem of Interest $G^*(n, r-1) + G^*(n, 1)$ is contiguous with $G^*(n, r)$ . In Janson's paper Random Regular Graphs: Asymptotic Distributions and Contiguity [J] the author hints (on pg. 16) that the above theorem is a consequence of the following two. Theorem. [J, Theorem 4]
  Let $M_n^*:\mc G^*(n, r)\to \N_0$ be the random variable which counts the number of perfect matchings of a given $r$ -regular multigraph.
  Then if $r\geq 3$ , and $n$ is even, we have $$
\frac{M_n^*}{\E[M_n^*]} \xrightarrow{d} \prod_{i=0}^\infty \lrp{1+ \frac{(-1)^i}{(r-1)^i}}^{Z_i} e^{(-1)^{i-1}/2i}
$$ where $Z_i\sim \text{Po}\lrp{ \frac{(r-1)^i}{2i}}$ are independent Poisson random variables.
  Also $$
\E[M_n^*] \sim \sqrt{2} \lrp{ \frac{(r-1)^{(r-1)/2}}{r^{(r-2)/2}}}^n
$$ and $$
\E[(M_n^*)^2]/(\E[M_n^*])^2 \to \sqrt{ \frac{r-1}{r-2}}
$$ Let $P_n$ and $Q_n$ be probability distribution on $(\Omega_n, \mc F_n)$ .
Then $Q_n=Q_n^a+ Q_n^s$ , where $Q_n^a$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $P_n$ and $Q_n^s$ is singular with respect to to $P_n$ .
We write $dQ_n/dP_n$ to denote the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $Q_n^a$ with respect to $P_n$ . Theorem. [J, Proposition 3]
  Suppose $L_n=dQ_n/dP_n$ , regarded as a random variable on $(\Omega_n, \mc F_n, P_n)$ , converges in distribution to some random variable $L$ as $n\to \infty$ .
  Then $(P_n)$ and $(Q_n)$ are contiguous if and only if $L>0$ a.s. and $\E[L]=1$ . I am not able to see how the above two theorems prove the theorem of interest.","['graph-theory', 'random-graphs', 'probability-theory']"

It is obvious $$\frac {f(m)-f(n)}{f(m-n)}\in\mathbb{Z} \Rightarrow \frac {f(m)-f(m-n)}{f(n)}\in\mathbb{Z}$$ If $f(m)≠f(m-n)$ , we can write $\mid  f(m)-f(m-n) \mid ≥f(n)$ .

Assume for the purpose of contradiction that $h(x) = 1$ and $x\neq\frac{a+b}{2}$ . Now $x>a$ and $b>a$ , implying $\frac{x-a}{b-a}>0$ , so $h(x) = \frac{x-a}{b-a}+1>1$ . In summary $h(x)=1$ if and only if $x=\frac{a+b}{2}$ .

Let $y\in[1,2)$ . In the event $y = 1$ , then $h(\frac{a+b}{2}) = 1$ and if $y\neq 1$ , then given the injectivity of $h$ , we may have $h(x) \neq 1$ only if $x\neq\frac{a+b}{2}$ . Let $x = y(b-a)+a$ , here $x\neq \frac{a+b}{2}$ as arguing to the contrary would imply that $y = \frac{1}{(b-a)}(\frac{a+b}{2}-a) = \frac{1}{2}$ , which is impossible considering $y\in[1,2)$ .

Elements of $ S$ are written as $(x,z,p,r)$ where $p=(p_1,...,p_d)$ and $r=(r_{ij})_{1\le i,j \le d}$ The differential equation $F[u]$ is said to be elliptic at $u$ if $\left( \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial r_{i,j}}(x,u(x),Du(x),D^2u(x))\right)_{1 \le i,j \le d} $ is positive definite. So using this definition how do we compute $ \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial r_{i,j}}(x,u(x),Du(x),D^2u(x)) $ for each pair of $(i,j)$ ? We can see that $r_{i,j}=u_{x_ixj}$ so for example does $$ \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial r_{1,1}}(x,u(x),Du(x),D^2u(x)) = \dfrac{\partial}{u_{x_1x_1}}\left(u_{x_1x_1}(x)u_{x_2x_2}(x)-u^2_{x_1x_2}(x)-f(x)\right)=u_{x_2x_2}(x) $$ Then by this logic $\left( \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial r_{i,j}}(x,u(x),Du(x),D^2u(x))\right)_{1 \le i,j \le d}= \begin{bmatrix}
    u_{x_2x_2}       & -2u_{x_1x_2}  \\
    -2u_{x_1x_2}      & u_{x_1x_1}  \\
\end{bmatrix}$ but if this is correct why is this matrix positive definite? Also where does the condition of $f>0$ come into play. Any help is appreciated!","['derivatives', 'partial-differential-equations']"
2954228,Prove the Cantor set has no interior.,"This is not intended to ask for the proof, but just for you to please check my proof. Thank you. Definition of the Cantor set $C$ : $C = C_0 \cap C_1 \cap \cdots \cap C_i \cap \cdots$ where \begin{align}
C_0 &= [0,1] \\
C_1 &= [0,1/3] \cup [2/3, 1] \\
C_2 &= \left[0, \frac{1}{3^2}\right] \cup \left[\frac{2}{3^2}, \frac{3}{3^2}\right] \cup \left[\frac{6}{3^2}, \frac{7}{3^2}\right] \cup \left[\frac{8}{3^2}, \frac{9}{3^2}\right] \\
 &\vdots
\end{align} Prove that $C$ has no interior points. We aim to show that there doesn't exist a ball $B$ , with radius $r >0$ , that is entirely contained in $C$ . proof Let $x \in C_n$ be an endpoint of one of the intervals of $C_n$ , then $x \in C$ . Note that by the construction of $C$ , that $C_n$ has equal length intervals all of length $\frac{1}{3^n}$ . So, for any given $r > 0$ , choose the integer $n$ so that $$n = \left\lceil\log_3\frac{1}{r}\right\rceil + 1 \implies \frac{1}{3^n}< r$$ Now, the ball $B_r(x)$ has a radius larger than the length of any interval in $C_n$ and it contains $x$ . Since $x$ is an endpoint of an interval in $C_n$ , that interval's other endpoint $y$ must satisfy $$\left|y - x\right| = \frac{1}{3^n} < r$$ Therefore, by the arbitrariness of $r$ , the Cantor set has no isolated points. But furthermore, $[x,y] \subset B_r(x)$ , and we construct $C_{n+1}$ by deleting the middle third of $[x,y] \in C_n$ which means that there exists points in $B_r(x)$ that are not in $C$ . Again, by the arbitrariness of $r$ we conclude $C$ has no interior. Alternate proof inspired by copper.hat and Berci proof The measure of each $C_n$ is $$mC_n = \text{num_intervals}\cdot \text{len_intervals} = 2^n\left(\frac{1}{3^n}\right) = \left(2/3\right)^n \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty$$ Since each set $C_n$ is a subset of $C_{n-1} \cap C_{n-2} \cap \cdots \cap C_1$ , then $$m(C_1 \cap C_2 \cap \cdots \cap C_n) = mC_n$$ and therefore $mC = 0$ . Now if $C$ contains any open set of the form $(a,b)$ then $mC \geq m(a,b) = b-a$ . Since $mC = 0$ , $C$ must not contain an open set, which implies it can't contain an open ball, which implies $C$ contains no interior points.","['measure-theory', 'cantor-set', 'real-analysis']"

2954384,Is this definition equivalent to the definition of permutation of sequence given in the text. Justify your answer?,"Q)In the text we defined permutations of a set and permutations of a sequence. Consider the following alternative definition of a sequence $\sigma : I \to A$ . Let S be the set of elements that appear in $\sigma$ ; more precisely, $S = \{x: \text{ for some } i \in I, x = \sigma(i) \}$ . Then a permutation of $\sigma$ is a permutation of the set S. Is this definition equivalent to the definition of permutation of sequence given in the text. Justify your answer?  \ Vocabulary: A sequence is defined as a function (First n elements of N) $\to$ alphabet A function f: $A \to B$ is defined as a relation on A and B Definition the permutation given by the text: Let A be a finite set. A permutation of A is a sequence in which every element of A appears once and only once. For example if $A = \{a, b, c, d \}$ then $(b, a, c , d), (a, c, d, b)$ , and $(a, b, c, d)$ are permutations of A (24 total). \ Sometimes we speak permutations of a sequence (rather than a set). In this case, the definition is as follows $\sigma: I \to A$ and $\tau: I \to A$ be finite sequences over A (note that the two sequences have the same length, $|I|$ ). The sequence $\tau$ is a permutation of $\sigma$ if there is a bijective function $f: I \to I$ so that for every $i \in I, \tau(i) = \sigma(f(i))$ Solution: This definition is not equivalent because $set \neq sequence$ , if you take a permutation of a set $\{1,2,3\}$ is equivalent to $\{2,1,3\}$ , while a sequence order matters, not really sure to be honest.","['elementary-set-theory', 'permutations']"

It is well-known that the image of a Borel set in $\mathbb R^n$ under a continuous map (even a projection) need not be Borel in general. However, for low levels of the Borel hierarchy the situation might be different: if $A\subset \mathbb R^n$ is $F_\sigma$ , then (by writing $A$ as a countable union of compact sets) one finds that $f(A)$ is also $F_\sigma$ , hence Borel. The image of a $G_\delta$ set need not be $G_\delta$ (e.g., take a piecewise linear function  such that $f(\mathbb{N})=\mathbb{Q}$ ) but I did not find any discussion of whether it must be Borel.

2954581,Differentials in Multivariable Calculus,"Does the idea of composing/decomposing the fraction notation of the derivative from/into differentials apply in multivariable calculus?  I realize that this practice is considered non-standard and many don't like it even in single variable calculus, but we can multiply both sides of $dy/dx = f'(x)$ by $dx$ yielding $dy = f'(x)dx$ , and invert the process by dividing both sides by $dx$ to return to the original equation. In the multivariable world, differentials are more diverse.  Instead of having only one dimension in which to nudge the input value of a function, we can take an indefinitely small step in an infinite number of directions, a prime candidate being ∂x, a tiny nudge in the direction of the x-axis, as shown. Similarly, $∂y$ , $∂z$ , etc., represent nudges parallel to the relevant input axes.  However, the formula one comes across for the differential of $f$ in multivariable calculus is interesting. Firstly, ""full differentials"" ( $df$ , $dy$ , etc.) are present, whereas one might expect to find ""partial differentials"" ( $∂f$ , $∂y$ , etc.).  What is the meaning of full differentials in multivariable calculus?  Secondly, dividing through by one of the differentials would yield an equation whose truth isn't obvious.  For example, dividing by $dy$ results in $df/dy = f_x dx/dy + f_y + f_z dz/dy$ .  Again, it's not clear what $df/dy$ means when $f$ has a three variable input.  Does this invite thinking about the inputs as living on three non-continuous number lines rather than in a single three-dimensional space, whereas $∂f/∂y$ would indicate the latter?  What about $dx/dy$ and $dz/dy$ , which are input-to-input nudge ratios; are these concerning since they don't involve the output of the function at all (i.e., it might not be possible for $z$ to be a function of $x$ )?

2955318,Exercise 4.6 in Richard Bass' ''Real Analysis for Graduate Students'',"I am really unsure about my solution to question 2 in 4.6 and have nobody to talk about it. So may be someone in here can help me out. I'll just recall the setting of the exercise. We work on the measure space ([0,1], $\mathcal{B}([0,1]),m)$ , where $\mathcal{B}$ is the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra and $m$ the Lebesgue measure.
Assume that for each $n \geq 1$ , $A_n \subset [0,1]$ is measurable.
Let $B$ be $\lim \sup$ of the $A_n$ . Questions 1 asks us to show that $B$ is measurable. That is the case because the collection of measurable subsets form a $\sigma$ -algebra and $B$ is a countable intersection of a countable union of measurable sets. Now question 2 wants us to prove the following: 
If $m(A_n) > \delta > 0$ , for each $n$ , then $m(B) \geq \delta$ . I did the following. Let $B_n := \cup_{j \geq n} A_j$ . Note that $\{B_n\}_{n \geq 1}$ is a decreasing sequence of sets.  Thus: $$m(B)=m(\cap_{n \geq 1} B_n) = \lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty} m(B_n)=\lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty}m(\cup_{j\geq n}A_j)$$ Now since $A_n \subset \cup_{j\geq n} A_j$ , we have that $m(A_n) \leq m(\cup_{j\geq n} A_j)$ and thus: $$m(B) = \lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty}m(\cup_{j\geq n}A_j) \geq \lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty}m(A_n) \geq \delta$$ Now, I don't see why we need to have the strict inequalities $m(A_n) > \delta > 0$ . I feel like my argument also works if $m(A_n) \geq \delta \geq 0$ ...

2955561,Proper map induced from a continuous map,"Consider the following claim. Claim: Let $X$ and $Y$ be locally compact topological spaces, and $f : X \longrightarrow Y$ a continuous map. Suppose that $W \subset X$ is a relatively compact set. Then the induced map (obtained by restricting $f$ ) $$f : W \backslash f^{-1}(f(\partial W)) \longrightarrow Y \backslash f(\partial W)$$ is a proper map, i.e., the preimage of compact set in $Y \backslash f(\partial W)$ is a compact set in $W \backslash f^{-1}(f(\partial W))$ . Proof : Let $K \subset Y \backslash f(\partial W)$ be a compact set, we need to show that $f^{-1}(K)$ is a compact set in $W \backslash f^{-1}(f(\partial W))$ . By the continuity of $f$ , the preimage $f^{-1}(K)$ is closed, so we need only show that $f^{-1}(K)$ does not intersect the boundary of $W \backslash f^{-1}(f(\partial W))$ . There are two boundaries  to check: (i) $f^{-1}(K) \cap \partial W = \emptyset$ , and (ii) $f^{-1}(K) \cap f^{-1}(f(\partial W)) = \emptyset$ . Indeed, since $K \cap f(\partial W) = \emptyset$ , (ii) is immediate from the fact that $$f^{-1}(A \cap B) = f^{-1}(A) \cap f^{-1}(B),$$ where $A,B$ are some arbitrary sets. Let us therefore turn to (i). Proceeding by contradiction, suppose that $f^{-1}(K) \cap \partial W \neq \emptyset$ . Then there exist some $z \in f^{-1}(K) \cap \partial W$ , and so $$z \in f^{-1}(K) \cap \partial W \implies f(z) \in f(f^{-1}(K) \cap \partial W) \subset f(f^{-1}(K)) \cap f(\partial W) \subset K \cap f(\partial W) = \emptyset.$$ Concern: I have only (to the best of my knowledge) used the fact that $K$ is a closed subset. The proof is either not correct, or at least not illustrating the main idea, since compactness of $K$ should be necessary.

The first thing I've done was understand the meaning of the integral. I think this integral represents the mass (as an example) of a unitary cube which contains materials of different density. The values of the materials density are, point for point, the inverse of the square of spheres centered in the origin plus one. The max value of the density is $1$ in the origin of the cube and the min value is $\frac{1}{16}$ on the opposite vertex. I suppose that the value of the integral is $\frac{\pi^2}{32}$ I've tried to use simple substitutions without any results, so I tried to change the coordinates with spherical and cylindrical systems. The spherical coordinates give me an incredibly long sum of integrals and I doubt that they're all integrable as elementary functions. The cylindrical gives me the following result $$\frac{\pi^2}{16}-\int_0^\frac{\sqrt2}{2}{\frac{\arctan{\sqrt{\frac{u^2-1}{u^2-2}}}}{\sqrt{2-u^2}}du},$$ which I'm not able to solve. My instinct tells me that there is a trick in some steps where I can observe that a difficult integral actually is exactly half of another one simpler but I can't figure out where. I'll appreciate any kind of suggestions.","['integration', 'multivariable-calculus', 'multiple-integral', 'definite-integrals']"

2955788,Have I just proven $0=1$?,"A long time ago I noticed that $2+2 = 2 \times 2 = 2^2$ , which is pretty cool because it’s the 3 basic arithmetical operations. It then recently occurred to me to try to prove that $2$ is the only real number for which this is true. Here is what I came up with: I start with this double equality: $r+r = r \times r = r^r$ or rewritten as $r+r = r^2 = r^r$ . Just examining the first part of the double equality: $$r+r=r^2,$$ I divide by $r$ and get: $$1+1 = r \implies r=2.$$ Looking at the second part of the double equality: $$r^2=r^r$$ I divide by $r^2$ and get: $$1=r^{r-2}$$ Next, I take the logarithm of both sides: $$\ln(1) = \ln\left(r^{r-2}\right) \implies 0 = (r-2)\ln(r).$$ The only numbers that make this true are $r=2$ and $r=1$ , since substituting in any other real number would mean that two non-zero numbers multiplied together would make $0$ , which is clearly false.  Furthermore $r=1$ does not satisfy the first part of the double equality so it has to be $2$ . QED . I was pretty proud of myself for solving this (and yes I'm sure to most of you this is no big deal but I'm not a math person).  However a few hours later a serious problem occurred to me.  Going back to this step: $$0=(r-2)\ln(r).$$ What if I divide both sides by $(r-2)\ln(r)$ , then I get: $$\dfrac{0}{(r-2)\ln(r)} = \dfrac{(r-2)\ln(r)}{(r-2)\ln(r)} \implies 0 = 1.$$ I can't explain this away as division by zero since it's in the numerator.

2955892,Extending Lacunary Series beyond their disks,"I've been for the past year and half fascinated by the lacunary series $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} z^{2^n}$ . This function obeys the following equation inside the unit disk. $$f(z^2) = f(z)-z$$ And there is no known ""natural"" way to extend the function outside the disk, so I attempted to create a way. Consider now the following formula. $$ G(x)= - \frac{1}{\ln(2)} \ln\ln x + \left(1 - \sqrt{x}\right) + \left( 1 - \sqrt{\sqrt{x}} \right)+ \left(1- \sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{x}}} \right)  ... $$ It's clear that $G(x^2) = G(x) - x$ , and moreover it's well defined over $\mathbb{R}^+ - \lbrace 0,1\rbrace$ . If we consider $0 < x < 1$ $$G(x) = - \frac{i \pi}{\ln(2)}  - \frac{1}{\ln(2)} \ln\ln \frac{1}{x} + \left(1 - \sqrt{x}\right) + \left( 1 - \sqrt{\sqrt{x}} \right)+ \left(1- \sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{x}}} \right)  ... $$ So you can graph $G(x) +  \frac{i \pi}{\ln(2)} $ , and observe it as  a function, compared to the lacunary series above Clearly the graphs are extremely similar. And it's not hard to see that $w(x) = g(x)-f(x)$ obeys the functional equation $w(x^2) = w(x)$ . After taking the difference of the two graphs, it looks nearly constant but some careful inspection reveals that $w$ has non trivial structure and its first terms are $$ \frac{i \pi}{\ln(2)} + w(x) \approx 0.333 + \frac{0.255}{1000} + c_0 \sin \frac{2\pi}{\ln 2} \ln \ln \frac{1}{x}...  $$ Where $c_0 \approx 10^{-4}$ see below for visual evidence So naturally one can use a variant of fourier analysis to come up with sequences of complex numbers $a_k, b_l$ such that: $$w(x) +  \frac{i \pi}{\ln(2)} = c + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \sin \frac{2\pi}{\ln 2} \ln \ln \frac{1}{x} + \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} b_l \sin \frac{2\pi}{\ln 2} \ln \ln \frac{1}{x} $$ And therefore: $$ -\frac{\ln \ln x }{\ln(2)} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( 1 - x^{\frac{1}{2^n}} \right)  - \frac{i \pi}{\ln(2)} -  c - \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left( a_k \sin \frac{2\pi}{\ln 2} \ln \ln \frac{1}{x} \right) - \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \left(  b_l \sin \frac{2\pi}{\ln 2} \ln \ln \frac{1}{x} \right)  = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^{2^n} $$ Over $0 < x < 1$ (call the entire completed left hand side $L$ noting that $L = G(x) - w(x)$ ). Now it's interesting observe that $L$ is a complex  function defined over all real positive numbers, and $L(x^2) = L(x) -x $ over the entire line. We CAN extend $L$ to the entirety of the complex plane using that functional equation and using the values of $L$ on the real line, leading us to create $L(z)$ defined globally on the plane minus the unit disc. Some natural questions arise then: Can we prove that as $x \rightarrow 0$ our definition of $L$ approaches 0? It's clear with the many nested-log-terms that $L$ is not defined at $x=0$ but if a limit can nevertheless be assigned it would be nice since we can then have $L$ agree with $f(z)$ over the entire open unit disk. ""What nice properties"" does $L$ extended to the complex plane have? Is it continuous, is it locally analytic, etc...? We define $L$ through its functional equation for complex arguments, but the series form of $L$ has 3 countably long sequences of functions. Is it possible to select branch cuts for each function in such as way, as to allow $L$ to be directly evaluated from its formula over complex values? (Instead of resorting to the functional equation). There's a nice result from the 1980s that lacunary series such as the one above don't have unique continuous or even unique locally analytic extensions. Nevertheless, if (3) is successful, then if one looks at $L$ it has a ""nice"" decomposition, meaning it is built using rather elementary or simply behaved functions. This motivates the following question, is there a subset of locally-analytic functions that can be defined (Call them R-functions) so that all ""analytic continuations"" are also unique R continuations, and moreover the series I have given above is the unique R continuation of the lacunary series $f(z)$ ? I've been ruminating on this result for a while and I needed a place to put my questions out in the public domain, to collect feedback. My blog has a total viewership of maybe 3 people, so posting this on stackexchange seemed like a more appropriate venue. Updates: The fourier series was explored alongside Bill Gosper and we found a few terms: https://www.wolframcloud.com/objects/637b5c6b-f016-43e1-8d1e-935506bb4d24 , there are more written up if anyone wants I can provide. Discussions with Noam Elkies and Warren Smith revealed that these series are known in the past, but its no longer clear if the coefficents decay fast enough to enable convergence outside the disc. This exercise might just reduce to pretty new identity.","['complex-analysis', 'lacunary-series', 'analytic-continuation', 'sequences-and-series']"
2955945,Points of Confusion About Second-Order Taylor Formula of Taylor's Theorem For Many Variables,"My textbook has written the following for the second-order Taylor formula of Taylor's theorem for many variables: $$f(\mathbf{x}_0 + \mathbf{h}) = f(\mathbf{x_0}) + \sum_{i = 1}^n h_i \dfrac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_i}}(\mathbf{x}_0) + \dfrac{1}{2} \sum_{i, j = 1}^n h_i h_j \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial{x_i} \partial{x_j}} (\mathbf{x}_0) + R_2(\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{h}),$$ where $$R_2(\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{h}) = \sum_{i, j, k = 1}^n \int_0^1 \dfrac{(t - 1)^2}{2} \dfrac{\partial^3{f}}{\partial{x_i} \partial{x_j} \partial{x_k}} (\mathbf{x_0 + t \mathbf{h}})h_i h_j h_k \ dt.$$ The integrand is a continuous function of $t$ and is therefore bounded by a positive constant $C$ on a small neighbourhood of $\mathbf{x}_0$ (because it has to be close to its value at $\mathbf{x}_0$ ). Also note that $|h_i| \le ||\mathbf{h}||$ , for $||\mathbf{h}||$ small, and so $$|R_2(\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{h})| \le ||\mathbf{h}||^3C$$ I have a number of points of confusion: The integrand is a continuous function of $t$ and is therefore bounded by a positive constant $C$ on a small neighbourhood of $\mathbf{x}_0$ (because it has to be close to its value at $\mathbf{x}_0$ ). Can someone please explain this? Also note that $|h_i| \le ||\mathbf{h}||$ , for $||\mathbf{h}||$ small, ... Why is this the case? And why only for $||\mathbf{h}||$ small? $$|R_2(\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{h})| \le ||\mathbf{h}||^3C$$ I'm trying to figure out where this came from. On a previous page, the textbook states the following: $$| R_k(x_0, h) | = \left| \int_{x_0}^{x_0 + h} \dfrac{(x_0 + h - \tau)^k}{k!} f^{k + 1}(\tau) \ d \tau \right| \le \dfrac{|h|^{k + 1}}{k!} M$$ But, if we have $||\mathbf{h}||^3C$ , then, according to the above statement, we would need $k = 2$ ; but the $2!$ factor is missing, so it seems that this assumption might be incorrect? So where did this come from?

Let $\tau_a:E^{\Bbb R^n}\to E^{\Bbb R^n}$ such that $\tau_a f(x)=f(x-a)$ for all $x\in\Bbb R^n$ and any chosen $f\in E^{\Bbb R^n}$ . Then the exercise says Prove that if $\lim_{a\to 0}\|\tau_a f-f\|_\infty=0$ then there is some $g=f$ almost everywhere such that $g$ is bounded and uniformly continuous. Here $\|{\cdot}\|_\infty$ is the seminorm of the space $\mathcal L_\infty(\Bbb R^n,\lambda_n,E)$ , where $\lambda_n$ is the Lebesgue measure and $E$ is a Banach space. My proof: The statement to be proved is not true in it generality. Let $f(x):=x$ (we choose here $E=\Bbb R^n$ ), then clearly $\|\tau_a f-f\|_\infty=|a|$ so $\lim_{a\to 0}\|\tau_af-f\|_\infty=0$ , however $f$ is not essentially bounded, so I assume that we need the assumption that $f\in\mathcal L_\infty(\Bbb R^n,\lambda_n,E)$ . If $f\in\mathcal L_\infty(\Bbb R^n,\lambda_n,E)$ then clearly $f$ is essentially bounded, so there is some $g\in\mathcal L_\infty(\Bbb R^n,\lambda_n,E)$ such that $f=g$ a.e. such that $g$ is bounded.

\exists \epsilon_0>0,\;\forall \delta>0,\;\exists x,y\in N^\complement:|x-y|<\delta\,\land\,|f(x)-f(y)|\ge\epsilon_0\tag1

\exists \epsilon_0>0,\;\forall \delta>0,\;\exists a\in\Bbb R^n,\;\exists x_a\in N^\complement:|a|<\delta\;\land\;|\tau_a f(x_a)-f(x_a)|\ge\epsilon_0\tag2
$$ But then we find that $\|\tau_a f-f\|_\infty\ge\epsilon_0$ for arbitrarily small $|a|>0$ in any chosen subset of $\Bbb R^n$ with null complement, what contradicts the assumption that $\lim_{a\to 0}\|\tau_a f-f\|_\infty=0$ , so we conclude that $f$ is also uniformly continuous a.e. Now we need to show that if $f$ is uniformly continuous a.e. then there is some $g=f$ a.e. such that $g$ is uniformly continuous. Let $N$ the null set such that $f$ is uniformly continuous in $N^\complement$ and suppose that $\overline{N^\complement}\neq\Bbb R^n$ , then $(\overline{N^\complement})^\complement$ is open and not empty, and because the Lebesgue measure is massive then $\mu((\overline{N^\complement})^\complement)>0$ what contradicts the completeness of the Lebesgue measure because $(\overline{N^\complement})^\complement\subset N$ , hence $N^\complement$ is dense in $\Bbb R^n$ . Then by a previous result I know that $f|_{N^\complement}$ can be extended continuously on $N$ , so we can conclude that such $g\in BUC(\Bbb R^n,E)$ exists. $\Box$","['lp-spaces', 'proof-verification', 'lebesgue-measure', 'analysis']"

B: (8, 130)$$ Then $a=20$ . But why is the flipped version of $f(x)=ax+b$ equal to the direct formula $a=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ ? Are they even the same? What I mean is that can the two formulas be flipped/multiplied and stuff like that to be the same?",['linear-algebra']
2956330,"Is this seemingly new proof that $[0, 1]$ is compact correct?","Hi all I think I found a new proof that $[0, 1]$ is compact but I am not 100% if it is correct, could you help me check? In the usual proof we just take the sup{x in [0, 1] : [0,  x] is covered by finitely many intervals} etc. My proof goes like this: First we show that compactness for $[0, 1]$ is equivalent to countable compactness : if we have an uncountable open cover of $[0, 1]$ then let us first notice that if a point is covered by more than 2 intervals one of the intervals is contained in the union of the other two so we may as well assume that any point in $[0, 1]$ is covered by at most two intervals. Next, select a rational from inside every interval in the cover and note that since every rational is contained in at most two intervals by the above and since there are countably many rationals we get a countable cover. Finally, to show that $[0, 1]$ is countably compact, we can do the following : suppose $I_1, I_2, ..., I_n, ...$ is a countable cover such that $[0,1]$ is not covered by $I_1, ..., I_k$ for any natural k. Now $[0,1] - I_1$ is a union of at most two closed intervals. It must be the case that at least one of these two intervals is never covered by $I_1,...,I_k$ for any natural k. Select this interval, wlog let's call it $J_1$ . Next, $J_1-I_2$ is also a union of at most two closed intervals, one of which cannot be covered by $I_1,...,I_k$ for any natural k.Let's call this interval $J_2$ . Inductively we get $J_1 \supset J_2 \supset J_3$ ... a descending sequence of closed intervals whose intersection is non-empty and not covered by any $I_n$ , contradiction. Is this correct?
I find this proof much more intuitive than the usual one, don't you agree? N.B. actually a student of mine found this proof","['alternative-proof', 'real-analysis']"
2956355,Are there infinitely-many numbers that are both square and triangular?,"I just started to read ""Friendly Introduction to Number Theory"" but I am getting stuck in the first exercises. 1.1.

  you figure out an efficient way to find triangular–square numbers? Do
  you think that there are infinitely many? https://www.math.brown.edu/~jhs/frintch1ch6.pdf I found how to find out the number which is both square and triangle.

2956369,"What's wrong in my solution? Ways of choosing 5 items from 3 catagory with 3, 6, 14 items, while having 1 item from each catagory.","The exact question is: b) Sandra wishes to buy some applications (apps) for her smartphone but she only has enough
money for 5 apps in total. There are 3 train apps, 6 social network apps and 14 games apps
available. Sandra wants to have at least 1 of each type of app. Find the number of different
possible selections of 5 apps that Sandra can choose? How I approached this question : As we need to choose 1 from each catagory, the first three apps can be choosen in : 3 x 6 x 14 = 252 ways. Now, for the remaining 2 apps, we can choose from the 20 apps (3 + 6 + 14 - the installed 3 apps) So, number of combinations should be 20C2 = 190, so finally the answer I got to was 3 x 6 x 14 x 190 = 47880 which is wrong, the answer is 13839 ways. After trying another method I got 13839 but, I need to know why this method is wrong. Can anyone explain this?","['combinations', 'combinatorics']"
2956389,Solve $f'(t)=0$ and $f'(t)=1$ using Fourier transform,"I'm trying to solve $f'(t)=0$ and $f'(t)=1$ using Fourier transform, but no luck: a) $f'(t)=0$ $$ f'(t)=0 \Rightarrow jwF(w)=0 
\Rightarrow \begin{cases}F(w)=0 ~ \text{if} ~ w \ne 0\\
F(0) = \text{undefined ?}

In case we choice $F(0) \ne \infty$ then $f(t)=0$ that is one of the valid solutions; if we choice $F(0) = \infty$ then $f(t)=1$ , another valid solution; no idea how to obtain all other possible solutions. b) $f'(t)=1$ $$ f'(t)=1 \Rightarrow jwF(w)=\delta(w)

F(0) = \text{impossible! because left part is} =0 \text{ but right is }=\infty

F(w)=c\delta(w) \Rightarrow\\

2956414,"If S is a normal subgroup, identify the quotient group G/S. What are the $\varphi(G)$'s?","The following is an exercise from Artin's Algebra: (Kiefer Sutherland's voice) Let G be the group of upper triangular real matrices $\begin{bmatrix}
a & b\\ 
0 & d

If S is a normal subgroup, identify the quotient group $G/S$ . (i) S is the subset defined by b = O. (ii) S is the subset defined by d = 1. (iii) S is the subset defined by a = d. The following questions are related: How the quotient group of following matrix group looks like? Proving that $G/N$ is an abelian group I found a solution by Blake Griffith linked here . The following is a screenshot of the solution: The following are my questions: How is $S$ is the $\ker$ for iii? I computed the kernel to be $$\begin{bmatrix}
x_{11} & x_{12}\\ 
0 & x_{22}
\end{bmatrix}$$ where $x_{21} = 0, x_{12} \in \mathbb R, x_{11} \ne 0 \ne x_{22}$ . But how do we conclude $x_{11} = x_{22}$ ? I think I'm missing something slightly because the solution was (ii) was incredibly inventing: Is this correction to ii correct? For ii, we set $$\varphi(X)=X\pmatrix{\frac{1}{x_{11}}&\frac{x_{12}}{x_{11}}\\0&1}=\pmatrix{1&2x_{12}\\
 \frac{x_{21}}{x_{11}}&\frac{x_{21}x_{12}}{x_{11}}+x_{22}}=\pmatrix{1&0\\0&1}$$ to get $S$ . It was pointed out this is wrong, but I think I can correct this. For ii, we set $$\varphi(X)=X\pmatrix{\frac{1}{x_{11}}&\frac{-x_{12}}{x_{11}}\\0&1}=\pmatrix{1&0\\
 \frac{x_{21}}{x_{11}}&\frac{-x_{21}x_{12}}{x_{11}}+x_{22}}=\pmatrix{1&0\\0&1}$$ to get $S$ . Does the $G'$ matter? I think it doesn't, but I want to confirm. What are the $\varphi(G)$ 's? For ii, I think $\varphi(G)$ is all of $d \ne 0, b \in \mathbb R$ in $$\begin{bmatrix}
a & b\\
