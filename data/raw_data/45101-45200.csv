450723,an injection into $\mathbb{N}$,"Is that true that the map $f\colon \{(m,n)\in\mathbb N^2:m\le n\}\to\mathbb N$ defined by $(m,n)\mapsto (m+n)^{\max\{m,n\}}$ is an injection?

450740,Example of a variety that is not toric,"My question is simple, but I haven't seen it to be addressed anywhere: What would be a simple example of an affine variety that is not a
  toric variety? Toric varieties (the ones I have studied) are constructed by a fan using ""gluing"". (For some examples, see Example 2.2 in Page 20). 
So to prove that some affine variety is not toric amounts to showing that there is no possible fan that gives rise to this variety. And I am not sure how could one exactly do that. An example of projective variety that is not a toric variety is also welcome. By the way, some authors require toric varieties to be normal varieties, but some do not. I am not looking for an example of such variety as an answer to this particular question. (So I really want something that's not ""toric"" in all senses of the word). I am especially interested in knowing how it is possible to prove that a variety cannot be obtained from a fan using gluing.","['toric-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra']"
450749,Bill calculation (very simple math question),"I hope this question isn't too simple! If it is, let me know if I should post it elsewhere, thank you. (Also, I didn't know what to tag it with, sorry!) My wife and I live with my brother-in-law Bob, and, for 30% of the time, also live with Bob's three children. Our last gas bill was for $161.21 for 45 days. This is how we work Bob's share of the bill. It seems right but I'm sure there are much simpler ways. Is this correct? Is there a more efficient way? (I'm sure there is!) Total cost (a) divided by number of days (b) = cost per day (c) e.g. $161.21/ 45days = $3.58 per day

            c = a/b Then calculate how many days the children were here (30%) (y) e.g. 30% of 45days = 13.5days

            y = b/100 X 30 Then calculate how many days the children are not here (z) e.g. 45 – 13.5 = 31.5

            z = b - y Then find out how much it costs for the amount of days the children are here (d) e.g. 13.5 x $3.58 = $48.33

            d = y X c Then find out how much per person and times by 4 (Bob + 3 children) (e) e.g. ($48.33/ 6 = $8.055) x 4 = $32.22

            e = (d/6) X 4 Then find out how much Bob owes for the remaining time (f) e.g. (31.5 x $3.58 = $112.77) / 3 = $37.59

            f = (z X c) / 3 Finally, add (e) plus (f): $32.22 + $37.59 = $69.81 x = e + f or: x = ((d/6) X 4) + ((z X c) / 3) or: x = (((y X c)/6) X 4) + (((b - y) X c) / 3) or: x = ((((b/100 X 30) X c)/6) X 4) + (((b - (b/100 X 30)) X c) / 3) or: x = ((((b/100 X 30) X (a/b))/6) X 4) + (((b – (b/100 X 30)) X (a/b)) / 3) Where:

450762,Finding limit points of subsets of the cofinite topology on $\mathbb{Z}$,"Is my reasoning correct? Problem: Let $(Z,\tau)$ be the cofinite topology on $Z$. Find the limit points of the sets: $A = \{1,2,\dots,10\}$ $E$, the even integers My solution: $A$ is closed (finite), so it contains its limit points. Let $x$ in $A$, then $\{x\} \cup (Z-A)$ is a neighborhood of $x$ containing no points of $A$ other than $x$, so $A$ has no limit points. Every open neighborhood of a point $x$ in $Z$ must contain infinitely many points of $E$ for the complement to be finite.

I can prove this for any convex $E$ . (see below). Is it true for non-convex domains as well? My proof: $\nabla f$ uniformly continuous implies that for any $\epsilon >0$ , there is a $\delta>0$ such that for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , $$|x-y|<\delta \Rightarrow |\nabla f(x) - \nabla f(y)|<\epsilon.$$ Let $\epsilon > 0 $ be fixed. Choose $x,a \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $|x-a| < \delta$ . By the mean value theorem (for convex domains), there is a $z$ on the line segment connecting $a$ and $x$ such that $$f(x) - f(a) = \nabla f (z) \cdot (x-a).$$ Then $$\begin{align}
\frac{|f(x) - f(a) - \nabla f (a)\cdot (x-a)|}{|x-a|} &=

450959,Prove that $\succeq = \bigcap L \left(\succeq \right)$ - understanding elementary order theory,"Dear reader of this post, I am working on a elementary question on order relations. I would be very glad to receive some guidance since I think understanding this question is important for making further progress with order relations. The question is as follows: Let $\left(X,\succeq \right) $ be a preordered set ($\succeq $ being a transitive and reflexive relation) , and define $L \left( \succeq \right)$ as the set of all complete preoders that extend $\succeq$. Prove that $\succeq = \bigcap L \left(\succeq \right)$. With the two replies by Brian and Hagen (thank you!), I'd like to proceed proving the claim. I am not yet familiar about the usual procedure for answering own questions so I hope I do not violate the etiquette.   I would be glad to receive some remarks about my prove. I relegated previous thoughts to the end. To make use of Szpilrajn's theorem, I will at first create a partially ordered set (poset) out of the preordered set and then extent this poset to a linearly ordered set. ( @ Brian: I expect that the technical details you mention in your post refer to the different elements which can are equivalent in the preordered set but not in the poset. Is this correct?) Let $ \sim $ denote the symmetric part of $\succeq$. Then $ \left( X/~,\succeq^{\star} \right)$  is a poset where $\succeq^{\star} $ is defined on $X/ \sim $ by $[x]_{\sim} \succeq^{\star}  [y]_{\sim} \ \text{iff} \ x \succeq y$. I will no show that $\succeq^{\star} = \bigcap L(\succeq^{\star} ) $. I know that every extension must satisfy $\succeq^{\star} \subseteq \unrhd$. So for each new poset $[x]_{\sim}  \unrhd [y]_{\sim} \  \text{iff} \ [x]_{\sim} \succeq^{\star}  [y]_{\sim} $ holds. For all other equivalence classes $[h]_{\sim},[g]_{\sim}$ for which $ [h]_{\sim} \not \succeq^{\star} [g]_{\sim}, \ \text{and} \ [g]~ \not \succeq^{\star} [h]~ $ the extended poset differ between whether $[h]_{\sim}  \unrhd [g]_{\sim} $ or the other way round. Thus, the intersection of the different extension cannot include any relation which is not stated in the original poset already and $\succeq^{\star} = \bigcap L(\succeq^{\star} ) $. Can someone give me some hints about the mistakes my prove contains? Previous thoughts I know that $\succeq \subseteq \unrhd$  ($\unrhd$ being the extension) so the complete preorder is a larger set than the original preoder. I imagine that extensions generate relations among the previously unrelated elements. For $\succeq = \bigcap L \left(\succeq \right)$ to hold, I know that the extension generates at least one complete preorder. To prove the claims, I expect to show that every relationship contained in the original preoder is an element of each extended preorder. Hence, I basically need to show that both sets (the original preorder and the intersection of the new complete preorders) contain exactly the same relationships. I would like to ask the following questions in particular: I do not understand how one can generate different complete preoders. Could I name them $L_i \left(\succeq \right)$? (Or would  $L \left(\succeq_i \right)$ be more precise ?) In what respect do the complete preorders differ? I have no idea how to show that both sets contain the same relations. Suppose that $x,y \in X$, could one then have $(x,y) \in \succeq $? I am looking forward for your replies.","['proof-writing', 'elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory']"
450967,Interpretation of $\epsilon$-$\delta$ limit definition,"The epsilon-delta definition for limits states that (from Wikipedia ) for all real $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a real $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x$ with $ 0 < |x − c  | < \delta$, we have $|f(x) − L| < \epsilon$ - however, the definition of the limit requires only the existence of some $\delta>0$ for any $\epsilon>0$. The part I am having trouble understanding is why there are no details as to the ""intuitive"" decrease of the δ as ε grows smaller. I realize that saying that as ε approaches zero δ also approaches zero would use the non-rigorous intuition of a limit in a definition meant to make the limit a rigorous part of mathematics, but why is it unnecessary to show the relationship between epsilon and delta besides the proof of existence? Is there some other implication of a function that I am missing that is the reason only the proof of existence is in this definition?

451010,Calculus over $\mathbb{Q}$,"The mismatch between the sensitivity of 'mathematical calculus' and the flexibility of 'real world calculus' has been bothering me a bit recently. What I mean is this: in the real world, I can trust that calculus will work whether $\mathbb{R}$ is ""actually real"" or not. ""Continuity"" can be considered as relative to a certain scale, and this is good enough for many purposes. Mathematically of course, this is not the case. Weakening even to $\mathbb{Q}$ will cause, say, the intermediate value theorem to fail. But I guess what I'm really wondering is whether or not this is just a problem with the chosen definitions involved, and if a clean formalism exists that more accurately captures how/why calculus is so widely applicable in real-world problems. And so I come to my main questions: If we replace the idea of exactly hitting a number (as used in the IVT, EVT, and MVT) with ""getting arbitrarily close to it"", can we still cleanly and/or consistently develop calculus? It seems like $\mathbb{Q}$ could support some form of calculus with this, since as far as I can see the whole '$\forall\epsilon\exists\delta$' paradigm is left intact. The normal counterexample to the IVT in $\mathbb{Q}$ is given by asking for roots of $y=x^2-2$, but this would be avoided because $y$ gets arbitrarily close to $0$. Moreover, restricting to smaller and smaller intervals where $y$ gets arbitrarily close to $0$ can also show that it doesn't get arbitrarily close to any other number ""at the same time"".

451053,Question from 'How to Prove It',"Below is the question from the book mentioned above: Suppose $f : A \rightarrow B$ and $R$ is an equivalence relation on $A$. We will say that $f$ is compatible with $R$ if $∀x \in A\forall y ∈ A(xRy \rightarrow f(x) = f(y))$.
   Suppose $f$ is compatible with $R$. Prove that there is a unique function
  $h : A/R \rightarrow B$ such that for all $x ∈ A, h\left([x]_R\right)=f(x)$. Below is my attempt in solving this problem: Proving the existence of the function:
Let $h=\{(X,y)\in A/R\times B|\exists x\in X(f(x)=y)\}$. Let $X=([x]_R)$ be an arbitrary element of $A/R$ and $x'$ some element of $X$, so $x'Rx$. Since $f$ is compatible with $R$ $(f(x)=f(y))$,so $f(x')=f(x)\in B$. Thus $([x]_R,f(x))\in h$. Proving the uniqueness of the function:
Let j be a function such that $j([x]_R)=f(x)$. That means we can find some $[x]_R \in A/R$ such that $f(x)=y$. Since $[x]_R\in A/R$ and $y\in B$, $([x]_R,f(x))\in h$, so $j\subseteq h$. By similar reasoning, $h\subseteq j$. So $h$ is unique. I want to ask that:
1)Is my proof about the existence of the function correct?
2)is my proof about the uniqueness correct? I basically have no idea what I am proving for the uniqueness of the function... Please explain and give some hints if there are some mistakes in the proof above. Thanks in advance.","['relations', 'elementary-set-theory']"

I'm interesting in deducing the number of positive real roots of $f$ as a function of $a$ and $n$. Checking numerically, it seems that if $a$ is sufficiently small in comparison to $n$ there is a single positive root, otherwise there are three. Initially, I thought of simply using Descartes' rule of signs . Applying the binomial theorem and re-arranging we have that $$f(x)=\begin{pmatrix}n\\0\end{pmatrix}x^{n^2+1}-a\begin{pmatrix}n\\0\end{pmatrix}x^{n^2}+\begin{pmatrix}n\\1\end{pmatrix}x^{n^2-n+1}-a\begin{pmatrix}n\\1\end{pmatrix}x^{n^2-n}+\dots+\left[\begin{pmatrix}n\\n\end{pmatrix}+a^n\right]x-a\begin{pmatrix}n\\n\end{pmatrix}$$ from which it is straightforward to see that $f$ has $2n+1$ sign changes, that is, the number of positive real roots of $f$ is $2n+1$ or less than $2n+1$ by an even number.

Actually, you do not need to proof that you have found a solution. It would be totally sufficient to find a solution.

451142,Why the axioms for a topological space are those axioms?,"This question might have even been asked here before, I don't really know, so sorry if it's duplicate. I've started to study topological spaces and I've found the axioms for such spaces kind of hard to motivate. Well, the ideia of a metric space is much easier to motivate: ""the concept of distance is context dependent, so we want a general idea of what distance is and a general idea of a set on which we can measure distances"". The axioms then for a metric are very intuitive, easy to motivate and everything else. Then we start studying properties of subsets of metric spaces. We define open balls as a way to make precise the notion of ""the set of all points that are sufficiently close to a central point"" and we define open sets to make precise  ""sets such that for every point, other points sufficiently close are also in the set"", which can also be thought as sets such that each point can be oscilated a little bit from it's position and the point will stay on the set. After that we can define lots of things: limit points, closed sets, dense sets, perfect sets, compactness and so on. We also see that all of those notions can be made precise mentioning the open sets alone: the metric is not really necessary to talk about those things, as soon as we can define what open sets are. So this is enough motivation to define a structure on which we have open sets. The answer to this problem is to define a topology on a set $X$ as a set $\mathcal{T} \subset \mathcal{P}(X)$ such that $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under arbitrary unions, finite intersections and such that $X,\emptyset \in \mathcal{T}$. If, $X$ is a metric space, and we let $\mathcal{T}$ be the set of open sets as they are defined using balls, then the three properties are satisfied. My only question is: why those properties capture completely the idea of an open set? I mean, amongst all properties of open sets, why do we select those three? I've always heard that topology is meant to study qualitatively global properties of forms, that's the way we start in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the way we generalize to metric spaces: we introduce tools that allows us to define carefully some of these properties and we work out definitions. It doesn't seem clear the connection of this motivation for topology and the actual definition. I've seem a similar question on MathOverflow, and there was one answer trying to motivate this in terms of rulers, but I really didn't get the idea. Can someone give a little help with this?

451410,What solutions are there to $R(1/x) = x^kR(x)$?,"What solutions are there to the functional equation
$R(1/x) = x^kR(x)$,
where $k$ is a non-negative integer? This is a generalization of the earlier question Functional equation: $R(1/x)/x^2 = R(x) $ which had $k=2$. A more general question is this: What solutions are there to the functional equation
$p(x)R(1/x) = q(x)R(x)$,
where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are pre-specified polynomials? I have only looked at the first equation,
though my technique below might be a starting point
for the second question. Here is what I have done so far. I will look for solutions 
to $R(1/x) = x^kR(x)$
of the form $R(x) = A(x)/B(x)$,
where $A$ and $B$ are  relatively prime polynomials
of respective degrees $n$ and $m$, Some definitions: If $C(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ (so $C(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n c_i x^i$), $[x^i]C(x)$ is the coefficient of $x^i$ in $C(x)$ (i.e., $[x^i]C(x) = c_i$), $deg(C(x)$ is the largest $i$ such that $[x^i]C(x)$ is non-zero, $codeg(C(x))$ is the smallest $i$ such that $[x^i]C(x)$ is non-zero, $\rho(C(x))$ is the reciprocal polynomial of $C(x)$ so that $\rho(C(x)) = x^n C(1/x) = \sum_{i=0}^n [x^i]C(x) x^{n-i} = \sum_{i=0}^n c_i x^{n-i}$. A polynomial $C(x)$ is $symmetric$ if $C(x) = \rho(C(x))$. Suppose $R(x) = A(x)/B(x)$ where $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ are  relatively prime polynomials of degrees $n$ and $m$, respectively. Let $\rho(A(x)) = a(x)$ and $\rho(B(x)) = b(x)$, so that $a(x) = x^nA(1/x)$ and $b(x) = x^mB(1/x)$. Let $u = deg(a(x))$ and $v = deg(b(x))$. We have $R(1/x)= A(1/x)/B(1/x)= (a(x)x^{-n})/(b(x)x^{-m})= x^{m-n}a(x)/b(x)$, so that $x^{m-n}a(x)/b(x) = x^k A(x)/B(x)$ or $x^ma(x)B(x) = x^{n+k}A(x)b(x)$. The degree of the left side is $m+u+m = 2m+u$ and the degree of the right side is $n+k+n+v = 2n+k+v$, so $2m+u=2n+k+v$. I now look at various possibilities for $A(x)$ and $B(x)$. If the degrees of $a(x)$
and $b(x)$ are the same
as $A$ and $B$, respectively,
(i.e., the constant terms of $A$ and $B$ are non-zero),
then $u=n$ and $v=m$,
so that $2m+n=2n+k+m$
or $m = n+k$.
This means that $a(x)B(x) = A(x)b(x)$.
Since $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ are relatively prime,
so are $a(x)$ and $b(x)$,
so that $a(x) = A(x)$ and $b(x) = B(x)$
which means that $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ are symmetric. Conversely, if $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ are symmetric
and $deg(B(x)) = k+deg(A(x))$,
it is easy to verify that
$R(x)=A(x)/B(x)$ satisfies 
$R(1/x) = x^kR(x)$. As a special case,
if $B(x)$ is symmetric with degree $k$,
then $1/B(x)$ satisfies the equation
(i.e., $A(x) = 1$). Suppose $A(x) = x^n$, so that $a(x) = 1$ and $u = 0$.
The condition $2m+u=2n+k+v$
becomes $2m=2n+k+v$
(or $v = 2m-2n-k$)
and $x^ma(x)B(x) = x^{n+k}A(x)b(x)$
becomes $x^mB(x) = x^{2n+k}b(x)$.
Since $v \le m$, 
$2m=2n+k+v \le 2n+k+m$ or $m \le 2n+k$.
so $B(x) = x^{2n+k-m}b(x)$.
Therefore the part of $B(x)$ 
with the low-order zero coefficients removed
is symmetric. The converse also holds. If $B(x) = x^m$, so $b(x) = 1$ and $v=0$,
$2m+u=2n+k$ 
and $x^ma(x)B(x) = x^{n+k}A(x)b(x)$ 
becomes $x^{2m}a(x) = x^{2n+k}A(x)$
or $x^{2m-2n-k}a(x) = A(x)$. 
Therefore, as with $B(x)$, above, 
the part of $A(x)$ 
with the low-order zero coefficients removed 
is symmetric. 
The converse also holds.","['functions', 'polynomials']"

Let $a\in G$ be arbitrary element. I am interested in understanding the map 
$f_a: H\to H$ defined by
$$
f_a(xyz)=(xa)(ya)(za)
$$
It is not hard to see that image of $f_a$ lies in $H$ (because, for example, if $xa=ya$, then $x=y$), so indeed $f$ is well defined. Also, we can show that $f_a$ is surjective: Given any $xyz\in H$, we have 
$$ f_a(xa^{-1}ya^{-1}za^{-1})=xyz$$
So my question is: Is it true that $f_a$ is always a bijection? Here are some partial results: a) If $G$ is finite (in which case $H$ is also finite), then $f_a$ is clearly bijection, as every surjection between finite sets is bijection. b) If $G$ is abelian, then $f_a$ is bijection. This is because $f_a$ can be shown to be injection: If $f_a(xyz)=f_a(x'y'z')$, then $(xa)(ya)(za)=(x'a)(y'a)(z'a)$, and since $G$ is abelian $xyza^{3}=x'y'za^{3}$ which gives $xyz=x'y'z'$, as desired. So it remains to investigate the case when $G$ is infinite non-abelian group.

Note I have used $f^{+}=\frac{|f|+f}{2}$ for converting the positive parts to absolute values.

P =\{p_1,p_2,\cdots,p_K\}\subset \{1,2,\dots,N\},\quad |P| = K, \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}_+^K , \qquad w = e^{-j\frac{2\pi}N}
$$
and,
$$
f(l) = \sum_{i=1}^K \sum_{j=1}^K x_i x_j w^{(p_i-p_j)l}
$$
I am going to find $x$ and $P$ such that these equalities are satisfied:
$$
f(1) = f(2) = \cdots = f(N-1)
$$
We can change this problem to an easier problem by defining : 
$$
S_d = \{(i,j) \quad | \quad p_i - p_j \mod N = d\}, \qquad d=0,1,\cdots,N-1
$$ So : $$
f(l) = \sum_{d=0}^{N-1} \underbrace{\sum_{(i,j) \in S_d} x_i x_j}_{g[d]} \space w^{ld}
$$ Now suppose :
$$
S =S_1 \cup S_2 \cup \cdots \cup S_{N-1} =  \{(i,j), \quad 1\leq i,j \leq K, \quad i \ne j \}
$$ Using properties of Discrete Fourier Transform it can be shown that this problem turns to the problem : $$
g[d] = \sum_{(i,j) \in S_d} x_i x_j = \frac1{N-1} \sum_{(i,j) \in S} x_i x_j\quad, \qquad d=1,2,\cdots,N-1
$$ i.e. the problem becomes finding partition(s) of $S$ and $\{x_i\}_{k=1}^K$ (up to a scale!) satisfying the above equalities. If for simplicity we set the values $x_1=x_2=\cdots=x_K = 1$, the problem will reduce to this: $$
|S_d|=\frac{K(K-1)}{N-1}, \quad d=1,2,\cdots,N-1
$$
so, for the case of $\frac{K(K-1)}{N-1}$ being integer, the solution for $x$ and cardinality of partitions is found. Any idea for the case it is not integer? Even finding cardinality of partitions would be great! Any contribution would be appreciated. Edit: Through simulations I reached the result that the solution of this problem for $|S_d|$ is $\{|S_d|\}_{d=1}^{N-1}$ with minimum variance under constraint of $\sum_{d=1}^{N-1}|S_d| = K(K-1)$ which leads to some of them being $\lfloor \frac{K(K-1)}{N-1}\rfloor$ and the others $\lfloor \frac{K(K-1)}{N-1}\rfloor+1$. Since the question has not received enough attention I asked it in MO too","['elementary-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'combinatorics']"

451793,Shortest way to convert two formulas using associative and commutative steps,"You have two formulas in which you add $n$ variables.
The variables in the two formulas are the same, but they
may be in a different order and the parenthesis may be different.
As an example I will use the formulas $a + (((c + e) + d) + b)$ and $(d + e) + ((a + b) + c)$. Because additions is commutative ($a + b = b + a$) and associative ($(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$),
you can prove that these two formulas are the same. In the formulas of the example, this could
be done in this way: a + (((c + e) + d) + b)
commutative
a + (b + ((c + e) + d))
associative
(a + b) + ((c + e) + d)
associative
((a + b) + (c + e)) + d
associative
(((a + b) + c) + e) + d
commutative
d + (((a + b) + c) + e)
associative
(d + ((a + b) + c)) + e
commutative
(((a + b) + c) + d) + e
associative
((a + b) + c) + (d + e)
commutative
(d + e) + ((a + b) + c) This proof contains of 9 steps. But it probably can be done in less steps.
For each combination of two formulas of $n$ variables I want such a proof
that has a minimal number of steps. Only the commutative and associative
steps may be applied, not induction or anything. What algorithm can I use? The number of formulas of $n$ variables is $\frac{(2n-2)!}{(n-1)!}$,
which gives the list $1, 2, 12, 120, 1680, 30240, 665280, \dots$. I know that a proof with a minimal number of steps is not always unique. It may be helpful to display the formulas as a graph, for example, for $n = 3$: Then for each two vertices in the graph you have to find a shortest path.

The problem is I don't quite like the solution, as it depends on such a heavy weaponry. A limit this simple, should easily be evaluable using some clever idea. Here is a list of what I tried: Substitute $y = x - 1$. This leads nowhere, I think. Find the Taylor polynomial. Makes no sense, it is a polynomial. Divide by major term. Dividing by $x$ got me nowhere. Find the value $f(x)$ at $x = 1$ directly. I cannot as the function is not defined at $x = 1$. Simplify the expression. I do not see how I could. Using l'Hôspital's (Bernoulli's) rule. Works, but I do not quite like it. If somebody sees a simple way, please do let me know. Added later: The approach proposed by Sami Ben Romdhane is universal as asmeurer pointed out. Examples of another limits that can be easily solved this way: $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sqrt[m]{1 + ax} - \sqrt[n]{1 + bx}}{x}$ where $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ are given, or $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\arctan(1 + x) - \arctan(1 - x)}{x}$. It sems that all limits in the form $\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{x - a}$ where $a \in \mathbb{R}$, $f(a) = 0$ and for which $\exists f'(a)$, can be evaluated this way, which is as fast as finding $f'$ and calculating $f'(a)$. This adds a very useful tool into my calculus toolbox: Some limits can be evaluated easily using derivatives if one looks for $f(a) = 0$, without the l'Hôspital's rule. I have not seen this in widespread use; I propose we call this Sami's rule :).","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

It made me wonder whether $A^{3^n}$ could be made arbitrarily close to composite numbers, or in other words: ""how near can $A^{3^n}$ get to the 'next integer'?"" I had a feeling, perhaps erroneous, that this might have to do with the rationality of $A$, but since this is an open question, I decided to consider the more general question in the title. Having very little knowledge in this area, the only two thoughts that occurred to me were: to write $q=k+\epsilon$, where $\epsilon<1$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$ and consider how $k$ and $\epsilon$ effect each other in $(k+\epsilon)^n$. The appears to be difficult because of the symmetry in the binomial expansion. This is also where the rationality of $\epsilon$ might come into play. to see whether $q^{-n}$ might get arbitrarly close to the terms of the harmonic sequence since they both converge to the same thing, $0$.

This is usually done by bounding the magnitude of the integral from above with something that tends to $0$. My question is, is there an intuitive reason for why we should expect this? My thought was that, if we project the complex plane onto a Riemann sphere, the path which appears to enlarge is actually shrunk to the point at $\infty$. I drew a (not very pretty) picture to illustrate what I mean: In blue is a semi-circular contour in the upper-half plane, centered at the origin, and in red is the stereographic projection of this contour onto a Riemann sphere. It is clear that as the radius of the blue semi-circle $\to\infty$, the red semi-circle that corresponds to the complex portion of the contour is shrunk to the north pole of the sphere.
