Question. Are weakly étale ring homomorphisms of finite presentation étale? According to Proposition 2.3.3 here , the answer is yes. Unfortunately, the proof cites some results in a monograph on generalised commutative algebra, which seems to be overkill. I am looking for a more self-contained proof, or at least one that could reasonably be said to be purely commutative algebra (possibly including homological algebra). Looking around in [Stacks], I found the following: By 092M , weakly étale ring homomorphisms are formally unramified. By 00UU , a formally unramified ring homomorphism of finite presentation is unramified. By 08WD , a flat unramified ring homomorphism of finite presentation is étale. This seems to be a complete proof that weakly étale ring homomorphisms of finite presentation are indeed étale. Did I miss anything?

1642290,Find elevator height given rope length?,"This question is deceptively difficult. I feel like it's probably some classic example somewhere, but I'm not sure how to describe it in enough detail to get valid results in searching online. Problem Statement There is an elevator, which is pulled up by a rope. The rope wraps around the pulley (shown in the picture) before accumulating on the elevator wire drum. The pulley diameter $r$ is known and the distance from the pulley to vertical $x$ is known. The elevator rope makes some wrap around the pulley ($\theta$) before travelling to the center of the top of the elevator. Assume there is an identical setup on the other side with identical setup and parameters. Given the length of payed out rope $L$, equal to the blue + green lengths shown in the image, what is the height $y$ of the elevator? My Approach The section in blue is equal to the rope wrapped around the pulley and the section in green is equal to the total rope length minus that amount. Defining the green section to be $a$ and the blue section to be $b$: $$
L = a + b \\
b = r \theta \\
L = a + r\theta \\
a = L - r\theta \\
$$ Also, by similar triangles, the angle between green and vertical is also equal to $\theta$. Now, updating the drawing with this information: Treating the green section as a hypotenuse, there are effective legs $y'$ and $x'$, where: $$
y' = y - r\sin{\theta} \\
x' = x + r\cos{\theta} \\
$$ Then, using Pythagorean Theorem and the definition of $a$ above: $$
a = \sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2} \\
L - r\theta = \sqrt{(x + r\cos{\theta})^2 + (y - r\sin{\theta})^2}
$$ But this alone doesn't buy me much because I don't know $y$ or $\theta$. Two unknowns, one equation. I tried to find an expression for $\theta$ by exploiting the fact that the angle between $a$ and vertical is equal to the angle of wrap. I define a $b'$, which is equal to the path $a$ would have taken past the pulley had there been no wrap: $$
b' = r \tan{\theta} \\
$$ Now there's an $L'$, which is equal to $a + b'$, which again is a length laid from the pivot tangent to the pulley instead of wrapping around the pulley. There's also an $r'$, which is the distance from the middle of the pulley to this new $L'$-horizontal vertex: $$
r' = r \sec{\theta} \\
r' = \frac{r}{\cos{\theta}} \\
$$ And now, where previously the horizontal distance was $x + r$, now it's $x + r'$, and I can state: $$
L'\sin{\theta} = (x + r') \\
(a + b')\sin{\theta} = (x + \frac{r}{\cos{\theta}}) \\
(a + r\tan{\theta})\sin{\theta} = (x + \frac{r}{\cos{\theta}}) \\
(L - r\theta +  r\tan{\theta})\sin{\theta} = (x + \frac{r}{\cos{\theta}}) \\
$$
$$
(L + r(\tan{\theta} - \theta))\sin{\theta} = (x + \frac{r}{\cos{\theta}}) \\
$$ This is the best I can get at an expression for $\theta$, but Matlab is unable to find an explicit solution for $\theta$. With no expression for $\theta$, I can't solve for $y$ in the earlier equation. Is there any closed form solution to this problem, or do the functions of $\theta$ mean I'm stuck using a numeric solver?","['trigonometry', 'nonlinear-system', 'systems-of-equations']"

I'm asked to count the number of sets of 4 elements that satisfy the two following conditions: 1) Each element of the set is a two-digit number (from 10 to 99). 2) There are no repeated digits in the set. What I've done is separate the sets in two disjoint cases. The ones that have an element with the digit 0 and the ones that don't. The sets from the first case have three elements that don't have a $0$ and one that does. For the first element of the three mentioned, there are $C(7,2)$ ways of choosing the digits it will have and then two possible numbers they can form, so $2C(7,2)$ posible elements. Applying the same reasoning to the rest there are $2C(5,2)$ and $2C(3,2)$ possible elements. Order doesn't matter in a set, so I divide by $4!$. This means that the number of sets from the first case is: $C(9,7)C(7,2)C(5,2)C(3,2)\cdot2^3\cdot1/4!$ Then I counted the number of sets from the second case using a similar argument and add them together: $C(9,7)C(7,2)C(5,2)C(3,2)2^3\cdot1/4! + C(9,8)C(8,2)C(6,2)C(4,2)\cdot2^4\cdot1/4!=2^3\cdot3^4\cdot5\cdot7$ The answer is supposed to be twice that.

Show that there is an affine change of coordinates such that $T(P)= P'$ and $T(L_i)= L_i'$ for $i=1,2$. Notation : $A^{n}(K)$ is simply the $n$ times Cartesian Product of $K$. $T$ is an affine change of coordinate of $A^{n}(K)$ if $T$ is a bijective map such that for all $(a_1,...,a_n)\in A^{n}(K)$, there exists $F_1,...,F_n\in K[X_1,...,X_n]$ where $F_i$ have degree 1 such that $T(a_1,...,a_n) = T(F_1(a_1,...,a_n),...,F_n(a_1,...,a_n))$. Well I can't come up with a map that could rotate 2 lines at once. If I could, I would just compose it with the translation map. I thought of reducing the problem to moving any 3 points to any 3 other points and since ACC takes lines to lines, it would yield the result. But that would force me to use polynomials of degree 2. I also have similiar problems for the projective case in $P^{2}(K)$. I need to find a projective change of coordinates that moves any 3 points not lying on a line to any 3 other points. If I have the affine case for dim 2, I might be able to do the one for the projective case just by generalizing the method. I hope someone can help me with this, or give me a hint.

It looks like to even start with this topic you need quite a lot of knowledge in stochastic processes (I am using the two volumes on diffusion by Rodgers as reference), functional analysis (using Folland and Conway), and maybe some differential geometry (using Lee's 3 books). Edit: This conference paper linked by this question gives a strong argument that studying these things from a geometric perspective is misguided, which rules out information geometry references. But there is still plenty of motivation to study relative entropy and Fisher information.","['reference-request', 'probability-theory', 'information-theory', 'statistics', 'entropy']"

1642411,Is there a nice open set proof that multiplication is continuous?,"For students in a first course in analysis or topology, proving that certain function are continuous can be very tricky.  However, some proofs which are difficult for students to prove using the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition of continuity are much easier to prove using the topological definition that the pre-image of every open set be open.  For example, it is much easier for students to prove that $f(x)=x^2$ is continuous using open sets rather than $\epsilon-\delta$. One particularly challenging proof is showing that multiplication $\cdot \colon \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous.  Is anyone aware of a slick way to prove multiplication is continuous using open sets?  Any attempt I make seems to  more or less be just as complex as the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis', 'continuity']"

1642433,"Find a Mobius Transformation that carries the points $ -1, i, 1+i$ to the following:","My goal is to find a Mobius transformation that transforms $-1, i, 1+i$ onto the points a) $0, 2i, 1-i$ b) $i, \infty, 1$ For part a, I know that the Mobius transformation $M$ will be such that $M(-1) = 0$. So, this means that it should have the form $$M(z) = \frac {z+1} {az+b}$$ Therefore, what should happen is that $M(i) = 2i$. That is, $$M(i) = \frac {i+1} {ai+b}$$ Multiplying by the conjugate of the denominator, we obtain 
$$M(i) = \frac {-(a+b)+(a-b)i} {-(a^2+b^2)} = 2i $$ Now, this means that $a = -b$, because the real part of this has to be $0$. Therefore, with this substitution, we can say that $$M(i) = \frac {2ai} {-2a^2}= \frac {-i} {a} = 2i$$ Therefore, $ a = -\frac {1}{2}, b = \frac {1}{2}$. However, when I use these values for the third point I do not find that $M(1+i) = 1-i$ is true. Is there something I'm missing here? Also, for part b, I know the Mobius transformation has to be of the form $$M(z) = \frac {az+b}{z-i} $$ because $0$ is the denominator whenever $z=i$, yielding a value of $\infty$ for $M$. However, I eventually run into similar problems like I'm having for part a). Can somebody tell why this isn't working, whether it's an algebraic mistake, or if I'm missing something more important?

It is a standard fact in probability that almost sure convergence is stronger than convergence in probability. I can only see the differences in the proof. However, is there a way to view it intuitively? Is it true that almost sure convergence has a tighter hold on the tails of a sequence of random variables than convergence in probability does? The definition of convergence in probability I am using is that given $\epsilon >0$: $$
\lim_{n \to \infty} P(|X_n-X|> \epsilon) = 0

P(\lim_{n \to \infty}X_n = X) = P\left(\omega \in \Omega: \lim_{n \to \infty}X_n(\omega) = X(\omega)\right) = 1

I know that defining: $$\langle x,y\rangle_g=\langle(\mathrm{d}_gL_g)^{-1}(x),(\mathrm{d}_gL_g)^{-1}(y)\rangle,$$ where $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ is any inner product on the Lie algebra $T_eG$ and $L_g$ is the map $L_g(h)=gh$, one obtains a left-invariant metric for $G$. I know that if $G$ is compact we can define the metric: $$(u,v)_g=\int\limits_G\langle\diff_gR_h(u),\diff_gR_h(v)\rangle_{gh}\diff\mu(h),$$ where $\mu$ is the unique left-invariant Haar measure on $G$; I believe the following proves right-invariance for that metric: \begin{align*}
(\diff_gR_ku,\diff_gR_kv)_{gk}={}&\int\limits_G\langle\diff_{gk}R_h\diff_gR_ku,\diff_{gk}R_h\diff_gR_kv\rangle_{gkh}\diff\mu(h)={} \\

{}={}&\int\limits_G\langle\diff_gR_\ell u,\diff_gR_\ell v\rangle_{g\ell}\diff\mu(\ell)=(u,v)_g.

Set $\ell=kg$ and change variables. $h=k^{-1}\ell$. This is where I use the invariance. I used it in the form $\diff\mu(k^{-1}\ell)=\diff\mu(L_{k^{-1}}\ell)=\diff\mu(\ell)$. Is that right?

A subset $I \subseteq R$ is called an ideal if it is a group with respect to addition and $rx, xs \in I$ for each $r,s \in $ and $x \in I$. With these definitions an ideal $I$ is a subring iff $1 \in I$ iff $I = R$, hence there are no proper ideals that are also subrings of $R$. If we change the definition and look at rings without requiring an identity, then every ideal is also a subring, but not every subring needs to be an ideal. This could be read on wikipedia . There it is also stated that not every ideal has itself an identity, examples as given there are $\mathbb Z$ and $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$, other are in quotient polynomial rings, where ideals have identites, see for example this post . But lets look at rings with unity from now on. If an ideal has unity, then it is itself a ring with unity, but the identity might be different, and I ask myself it what sense is the ring structure on the ideal then different from the ring structure on the given ring. What are the conditions that ensure that ideals have identites, and hence form rings by themself? And what is the relation to the original ring? Could we give a ring homomorphism from the ring to the ideal then? I give a special case, which came up on a recent question of mine (see the linked one above), and is in some way related to representation theory, where similar constructions are used. Let $R$ be a ring with unity, then $R$ could be regarded as $R$-module by its regular action on itself, and the $R$-submodules are precisely the ideals then. Now suppose (considered as a module) we have $R = I \oplus J$ for two $R$-submodules. In the module we have $R / I \cong J$ as modules, i.e. we have a module isomorphism. Now if we look at $R$ as a ring again, then $I$ and $J$ are ideals, and so we can built the quotient ring $R / I$. Now I want to look at the relation of this quotient ring to $J$ (or $R / I$ as a module), and want to know if they are isomorphis as rings. In this special case if we write $1 = 1_I + 1_J$, then $1_J$ is an identity in $J$, as for $x \in J$ we have $x = x1 = x(1_I + 1_J) = x1_I + x1_J$ and $x1_I \in I$ and $x1_I \in J$ by the ideal properties, hence $x = x1_J$. So $J$ has a unity and is a ring. The map $\pi : R \to J$ gives a surjective homomorphism (it is like a projection) and its kernel is precisely $I$, hence $R / I \cong J$. But this situation is very special. But in general, when are ideals also rings with unity, and what is their relation to the original ring?","['modules', 'abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'commutative-algebra', 'ideals']"

My question is: Does the series 
  $$ \sum\limits_{n \in E} \frac{1}{n} \tag 1$$ converge? My attempt is : Let $1/n = 0,a_1 a_2 \dots a_k \overline{b_1 b_2 \dots b_m}$ with $n \in E$. Since $1/n$ has no digit ""9"", we have at most $9^{k+m}$ possibilities for the $a_i$'s and $b_j$'s. Moreover, $1/n ≥ 0,00...0\overline{00...01}≥1/10^{k+m}$. But then I can only bound my series $(1)$ from below, by some real number. So, this is not a clue for the divergence of the series. Apparently, the numbers of the form $n=10k+1$ don't belong to $E$.

No Repetition Version : There are many such triples including: $$(0, 1, 224), (0, 2, 223), ... , (74, 75, 76)$$ Note: $(0, 0, 225)$ is not a valid triple as $0$ is repeated. What is the minimum number of values which must be present in the set $A$ such that we can guarantee that a triple must exist? Or put another way, how many elements can I allow an opponent to strategically remove such that I can still guarantee that a triple must exist (without seeing which values were removed)? Background & Version with Repetition : This question arose from an assignment to write an $O(n)$ algorithm which, given a list of perhaps $100,000$ non-negative integers, will determine whether there are $3$ integers which sum to $225$ (note: I have long since finished the assignment, but am still wondering about a better solution). Here, repetition is allowed so $(0, 0, 225)$ or $(75, 75, 75)$ are valid triples. My approach was to create a 'counter' array $C$ of size $226$ and initialize it with $0's$. While iterating through the list, if the value $i$ is encountered where $0\le i \le 225$, then increment $C[i]$. The counter array therefore keeps track of the number of times each relevant value occurs. We can stop counting after $1$ occurrence for any given value $j \gt 225/2$, and after $2$ occurrences for any other value, except $75$ which must be counted for up to $3$ occurrences since the triple $(75, 75, 75)$ must be checked for. After iterating through the list the counter array can be checked for the presence of valid triples using nested loops and so on. But an optimization can be made. If for example, every value from $0...225$ has been found at least once, then we can say that a triple exists without even checking. The question is then similar to the simplified case above. After how many 'hits', where some $A[i]$ is incremented, can we simply return true and know that a triple must exist? I've been trying to find a solution to the simpler version of this problem for quite a while. I asked my algorithms professor and a TA.

I started with simple functions, which are basically sequences with finite range set. $$\int f\,d\mu \;=\; \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \mu (A_i) \;=\; \sum_{k\in N} f(k).$$ Then I defined integration for $[0,\infty]$ -valued sequences: $$\int f\,d\mu \;=\; \sup\left\{\int g\,d\mu: \text{$g \leq f$ and $g$ is simple and $[0,\infty]$-valued }\right\}.$$ The above expression is simply summation of all terms since $f$ can be approached by a sequence of simple non-decreasing functions $f_n=fX_{(-n,n)}$ . Then for $[-\infty,\infty]$ -valued sequences we define $$\int f\,d\mu \;=\; \int f^+-\int f^- \;=\;  \sum_{k\in N}f(k).$$ So I deduced that the integral of any function on $N$ is just summation of the terms of the sequence of its image. $f$ is said to be integrable if $\int f^+$ and $\int f^-$ are finite. Hence $\sum_{k\in N} f(k)$ must converge. Now here I got confused. We know that every measurable function $f$ is integrable if and only if $|f|$ is integrable.

1643828,A closed form for the following Series,"I was computing some calculations, when I got stuck about a possible closed form for this series: $$S = \sum_{k = 2}^{N}\ \frac{k!}{k^k - k!}$$ I proved by hands that it's absolutely convergent by using the ratio test, but now I have to find something with which to approximate that series, or a closed form if it does exist. Computing the first $50$ term of the series, the result is around $$S \approx 1.454864034404(...)$$ If I try to take the limit for large $k$ (namely for large $N$), I can use Stirling approximation $$k! \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \frac{k^k}{e^k}$$ I will obtain: $$S(\text{large}\ k) = \frac{\sqrt{2\pi k}}{e^k - \sqrt{2\pi k}}$$ Numerical evaluation ""My"" alternative form seems good because even for $k = 5$ I got these: $$
\begin{cases}
\frac{5!}{5^5 - 5!} & \approx 0.03993 \\\\
\frac{\sqrt{2\pi 5}}{e^5 - \sqrt{2\pi 5}} & \approx 0.03924
\end{cases}
$$ Anyway: is there a way to obtain a closed form for a general $N$? I also tried with mathematica but it doesn't work.","['power-series', 'summation', 'sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence']"

1643898,Convergence of stochastic processes via convergence of infinitesimal generators,"Given a sequence of sequence processes $(X_N(\cdot))_{N \geq 0}$, I want to show this sequence converges to another process $X(\cdot)$ by considering that the sequence of generators $(A_N)_{N \geq 0}$ converge to some generator $A$ which corresponds to the process $X$. Could someone please point towards a proposition for a textbook (or if not a research paper) for me to refer to when doing this? Also, I think there are some further details here linked to the cores of the generators which I am unclear on, so it would be helpful to see a proposition/ theorem which clearly outlines the required conditions.

1643910,Probability of getting $5$ heads on $10$ (fair) coin flips?,"Even before attempting the problem, I immediately defaulted to an answer: $\frac{1}{2}$. I thought that this was a possible answer since the probability of flipping a head on one flip is definitely $\frac{1}{2}$. I then worked through the problem: Let E be the event in the problem statement. The total number of possible outcomes of $10$ coin flips: $N = 2^{10}$ The total number of ways in which E can result:for $n=10,r=5, nCr= 252$ $P(E) =\frac{n}{N} = .246$ How do I correct my intuition?","['combinatorics', 'statistics', 'probability']"
