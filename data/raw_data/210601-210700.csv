4233689,Logic behind two consecutive heads/tails,"We play a game with a fair coin where we toss $N$ amount of times before we get a consecutive head or consecutive tails. What is the expected number of rolls ( $N$ )? My solution differed from that of the textbooks - which argued the expectation is $$ \sum_{2}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{k-1},$$ however my logic was $$ \frac{1}{2}(2) + \frac{1}{2}(x+1) = x $$ where $\frac{1}{2}(2)$ is the the choice where you roll two consecutive numbers, and the $\frac{1}{2}(x+1)$ is the choice where you roll a non-consecutive, meaning you would have to roll again.
Both answers gave $3$ ; however I am concerned if my logic is incorrect for my solution or if I found an alternate solution.","['probability-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"
4233703,Find the missing angles in the picture containing squares and circles,"In the following figure, $ABCD$ is a square. $\stackrel{\frown} {AB}$ and $\stackrel{\frown}{AC}$ are semicircles and quarter circles respectively. The blue circle touches $\stackrel{\frown} {AB}$ at $P$ , $\stackrel{\frown} {AC}$ at $Q$ and line $BC$ . $MN$ is a line such that $MN\parallel PQ$ and touches the blue circle at $R$ . If $\angle MPR=\alpha$ and $\angle NQR=\beta$ , find $\alpha+\beta$ . Here is my progress in solving the problem: I could just find the radius of the blue circle. Let $OG=r$ and $AB=2$ . So, $BE=1$ , $BO=2-r$ , $OE=1+r$ , $EH=1-r$ . Then, $BG^2=HO^2=4-4r$ and $4-4r+(1-r)^2=(1+r)^2$ . This gives $r=\frac 12$ . I can't proceed from here. Also while creating the figures, I found the answer: $\alpha=45^\circ$ and $\beta=30^\circ$ So, I need a solution to the problem. All solutions are welcome, but as I'm always interested in synthetic solutions I'll most likely accept an answer with synthetic solution.","['contest-math', 'euclidean-geometry', 'circles', 'geometry']"
4233707,Rigorously Proving Countable Additivity of Discrete Measure,"I'm trying to show, in full rigor, that a measure on a discrete probability space is necessarily countably additive. That is, with countable $\Omega$ and $p: \sum_{x\in \Omega} p(x) = 1$ and $p(x) \ge 0$ for all $x$ , we define: $P(A) = \sum_{x\in A} p(x)$ Now my hand-wavy solution is, with the $A_i$ disjoint: $P(\bigcup A_i) =\sum_{x\in \bigcup A_i} p(x) = \sum_i \sum_{x\in A_i} p(x) = \sum_i P(A_i) $ But it feels like the middle equality is doing some work that I can't necessarily justify.

4233777,Existence of Complex Frames on a Complex Vector Bundle,"$E \rightarrow M $ be a complex vector bundle (of real rank $2r$ ) with almost complex structure $J:E\rightarrow E \space\space\space(J^2 =-1)$ on it. $U\subset M$ be a trivial neighbourhood. Does there exist a complex frame for $E \rightarrow M$ over U? By a complex frame, I mean a set of $r$ (real) linearly independent $E_U$ -sections $\{X_1, ... , X_r\}$ , such that $\{X_1, ... , X_r, JX_1, ... , JX_r\}$ forms a complete $E_U$ -frame. (By ""linearly independent"", I mean they are linearly independent in the fibre above every point $x\in U$ ). It seems like such frames do exist as I recall seeing such frames in definition of complex connection and curvature matrices on complex vector bundles, which then lead to construction of Chern forms and classes. I need such a frame to prove that existence of a $J$ map for $E \rightarrow M $ implies a reduction of structure group of E to $GL(r,C)$ . I am stuck with this, even though I can prove the converse by explicitly constructing a complex frame using the reduction. Edit: I am using the following definition for 'complex vector bundle': A real even ranked vector bundle with a J-map. Sorry for the confusion.","['complex-geometry', 'vector-bundles', 'algebraic-geometry', 'almost-complex', 'differential-geometry']"
4233814,"Why is our definition of ""smooth"" function on a totally disconnected space the ""right"" definition?","My main interest in this comes from starting to learn about representations of totally disconnected, locally compact topological groups $G$ , and their representations. I came across the definition of ""smooth"" functions $\phi:G\to \mathbb{C}$ as being those which are locally constant, and smooth representations $G\to\text{End}(V)$ being those for which $\text{Stab}_G(v)$ is open for all $v\in V$ . These definitions lead me to two questions, which I suspect do not have technically precise answers, but for which I'm hoping there exists some good heuristic motivations. Why is the definition of ""smooth"" for functions $\phi:G\to\mathbb{C}$ the ""right"" definition?  That is, why is this considered to be the notion of functions on totally disconnected spaces that is analogous to the classic notion of smooth functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ ? in the same manner, why is the definition of smooth representations as above, the ""right"" analogue of smooth representations of Lie groups? These don't seem totally alien to me given the nature of the topology of totally disconnected spaces, but I'm hoping someone can spin a narrative more convincing than just saying the definitions involved are very ""pointy"". Also, I suspect that the answer to 2) will follow more or less directly from any reasonable answer to 1). I'm happy to simply be directed to a source that has already laid this out.","['p-adic-number-theory', 'smooth-functions', 'representation-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'langlands-program']"
4233833,"Why do the vertices of $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, when fixing $a$ and $c$ but varying $b$, lie on $g(x) = -ax^2 + c$?","As a bit of background context, I'm teaching a calculus course this semester, and for a learning activity, the students had to examine various functions and how certain modifications affected them. In one case, they were examining the function $f(x) = 3x^2 + bx - 2$ , for various values of $b$ : what did those changes in $b$ do to the shape of the parabola, and why? I got curious, and noticed that as we varied $b$ , the parabola would move in a parabolic way with respect to the vertex. That is, if we increased $b$ when it was positive, it would move right and down; if $b$ was decreased and negative, it would move left and down. (The vertical changes were sharper for larger $b$ of course.) So naturally, I wanted to graph the various vertices of the function. I couldn't figure out a proper way to do this in Desmos, but I managed something feasible: Create a list $L$ of test values from $-100$ to $100$ with small intervals in-between. These $L$ will function as our $b$ values. The axis of symmetry of $f$ then is at $x = -b/6$ for each $b \in L$ . Of course, then, the vertex is at $(-b/6,f(-b/6))$ for each $b \in L$ . (You can play with a demo of it here if you wish.) Graphing a bunch of these points in black and $\color{red}{f(x)}$ in red gives this: Curiously, the set of vertices (for variable $b$ ) lie on a parabola that is precisely $f$ (when $b=0$ ) flipped vertically; that is, the vertices lie on $g(x) = -3x^2 - 2$ . (And in general, if we vary $b$ in $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ , then the vertices lie on $g(x) = -ax^2 + c$ .) I've been wondering about this for a few days and a student even brought it up to me, and I can't think of a reason why this should be. Maybe it's incredibly simple, but can someone perhaps enlighten me? Thanks!","['algebra-precalculus', 'graphing-functions', 'quadratics']"
4233879,Disk glued to a Torus. Classifying the resulting spaces - How/Where to begin?,"My algebraic topology professor gave me an exercise and I feel very lost.
The exercise is the next: Describe the homotopy type of the different spaces that can be obtained from gluing a disk to a torus. Obs: The gluing is only at the disk's border. On a first try, I was thinking of gluing the border of the disc to a single side of the torus (>), then to two sides (maybe continuous sides (>,>>) or inverting the orientation of the first gluing(>,<)), etc. After a week, I gave up and asked my prof for hints. He said that could be useful to think in $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}^2$ and he also said that at some point I would be working on an algebra problem instead of a topology problem.
To do the classification of the spaces, he also mentioned that
Van Kampen would be necessary. Any ideas/suggestions about this?","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"
4233904,Existence of a set $A\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that $|G\setminus A|=\infty$ for every open set $G\supset A$ [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : There exists a set $A\subset\mathbb{R}$ with $|G-A|=\infty$ for each open set containing $A$. (1 answer) Closed 2 years ago . I am trying to prove the following statement and I would like to have an hint about how to complete it, thanks: ""Prove that there exists a set $A\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that $|G\setminus A|=\infty$ for every open set $G$ that contains $A$ ."" What I have tried: We know that if $A\subset\mathbb{R}$ is Lebesgue measurable iff for each $\varepsilon>0$ , there exists an open set $G\supset A$ such that $|G\setminus A|<\varepsilon$ so the set $A$ we are looking for must be non Lebesgue measurable. Now, the only non Lebesgue measurable set I know of is the Vitali set $V$ which is a subset of $[-1,1]$ so although it must have a positive and finite outer measure $|V|$ does not have the property required. I have thought about $\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}(r_k+V)$ (where the $r_k$ s are an enumeration of the rationals) but this has infinite outer measure. I have also thought about the set $\tilde V$ which contain one element from each of the sets $\{V+r:r\in\mathbb{Q}\}$ but one could find an open set $G$ containing it made up of $(-2,2)$ and then of intervals $I_k=(a_k-\frac{\varepsilon}{2^k},a_k+\frac{\varepsilon}{2^k})$ which has a total outer measure of $4$ so it doesn't work. Thus I am guessing this set needs to contain an uncountable number of elements (to prevent $G$ from having finite measure) and containing ever bigger terms. Is my intuition correct? I would appreciate any hint about how to find/build this set. Thanks $|A|$ denotes the outer measure of the set $A$","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'real-analysis']"

4234007,Is there a set-based semantics for the untyped lambda calculus?,"Is there a set-based semantics for the untyped lambda calculus? As an example, here's a simple set-based semantics for the simply typed lambda calculus (henceforth STLC). It is extremely naive and amounts to little more than an observation that a function from $A$ to $B$ can be represented as a set of pairs. This treatment here sweeps some details under the rug regarding management of free variables in the interest of brevity. For every ground type $A, B, C \cdots$ , we have a sets $A, B, C \cdots$ . For each primitive constant and function, we send the symbol to its interpretation. For example if $f$ is a primitive function from $A$ to $B$ , the interpretation of $f$ will be a subset of $A \times B$ that is left-total. Let $\varphi$ be a well-formed formula with free variables $x_1, \cdots, x_n$ of type $A_1, \cdots, A_n$ . Let the interpretation of $\varphi$ be a function that sends $v_1, \cdots, v_n$ to the interpretation of $\varphi(v_1, \cdots, v_n)$ . Let the interpretation of $\lambda x : A \mathop. \varphi$ be a function that sends each $a$ in $A$ to the interpretation of $\varphi(a)$ . Let the intepretation of $a(b)$ be the unique value $u$ such that $(b^*, u) \in a^*$ where $a^*$ is the interpretation of $a$ and $b^*$ is the interpretation of $b$ . Attempting to do the same trick for the untyped lambda calculus doesn't work because ZFC is well-founded. For example, if $X$ is the interpretation of $(\lambda x : x(x))$ , then $X(X)$ would have to equal to $X$ .","['elementary-set-theory', 'lambda-calculus']"

4234033,Every finite group with more than $2$ elements has a non-trivial automorphism.,"$\newcommand{\Aut}{\operatorname{Aut}}$ Theorem: Given a finite group $G$ of order $n\gt 2$ ,  it follows that $\left|\Aut G \right| \gt 1$ . Proof:
I tried it like this: Suppose on the contrary that $\left|\Aut G\right|\le1$ . It follows that $\left|\Aut G\right|=1$ as identity permutation $i:G\to G$ defined as $i(x)=x$ , always belongs to $\Aut G$ . I know the result that: $G/Z(G)\sim I(G)$ , where $I(G)$ is the set of all inner automorphisms of $G$ ; and that $I(G)\le \Aut G$ . It follows that $G=Z(G)\implies G$ is abelian. It can be shown here that $T:G\to G$ defined by $T(x)=x^{-1}$ is an automorphism. But as per the assumption, it should follow that $T(x)=x$ for all $x\in G$ , that is, $x=x^{-1}$ for all $x\in G\implies$ every non-identity element of $G$ is of order $2.\implies G$ is of even order. Above shows that if $G$ (finite and of order greater than $2$ ) is a non-abelian group or a group of odd order, then the theorem is proved by contradiction. So all it remains is to prove the result when $G$ is abelian and every non-identity element is of order $2$ . $G=\{1,a_1,a_2,\dots,a_{2k-1}\}$ , where $k\ge 2$ and $2k=n$ . I tried to create a non-trivial automorphism as follows: Let $T:G\to G$ be defined as $T(x)=\begin{cases} x  \text{ if $x\notin \{a_1,a_2\}$}\\a_2 \text{ if $x=a_1$}\\a_1 \text{ if $x=a_2$}\end{cases}$ $T$ is clearly a bijection. I tried to prove it homomorphism but got stuck and I feel that it's not a homomorphism (as it's not yet clear where $xy$ will be mapped by $T$ when $x$ and $y$ both are neither $a_1$ nor $a_2$ ). How can I create a not trivial automorphism of $G$ ?  Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks. I have seen this question being asked before ( here ) but the answers use arguments on finite field which I don't currently know much about.

Take $x,y\in \mathbb C^2_{0}$ (of course, $x$ and $y$ are tuples, and I am lazy). I need to find a continuous function $f: [0,1]\to \mathbb C^2_{0}$ such that $f(0) = x$ and $f(1) = y$ . Since $X$ is path-connected, there exists $g: [0,1]\to  X$ with $g(0) = x$ and $g(1) = y$ . My sense is that we must modify $g$ in some way (restrict to $\mathbb C^2_{0}$ , or something) to construct $f$ , but I am stuck here. Possible Generalization: I wonder if the following generalization is true, for $n\in \mathbb N$ : If $X$ is an open path-connected subset of $\mathbb C^n$ , is $$\mathbb C^n_{0} = \{(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)\in X: a_i \ne 0, 1\le i\le n\}$$ also an open path-connected subset of $\mathbb C^n$ ? I was able to prove path-connectedness for a very special case, i.e. when $n=1$ and $X\subset \mathbb C$ is convex. I doubt if a similar idea would work for the more general cases ( $X$ may not be convex, $n=2$ or greater, etc.) Take $n=1$ , and let $X$ be a convex subset of $\mathbb C$ . If $0\notin X$ , then $C_0^1 = X$ , so there is nothing to do. Assume $0\in X$ . Then, $C_0^1 = X\setminus \{0\}$ . Consider $x,y\in C_0^1$ , and the straight line path in $X$ given by $f:[0,1]\to X$ such that $f(t) = (1-t)x + ty$ for $t\in [0,1]$ . If $f(t)\ne 0$ for all $t\in [0,1]$ , then $f:[0,1]\to C_0^1$ is the required path in $C_0^1$ . If $f(t) = 0$ for some $t\in [0,1]$ (there is at most one such $t$ ), then consider $z\notin f([0,1])$ . Define $g_1:[0,1]\to C_0^1$ by $g_1(t) = (1-t)x + tz$ and $g_2:[0,1]\to C_0^1$ as $g_2(t) = (1-t)z + ty$ .

4234692,A pathological example of a distribution.,"Everyone who studied distributions at some point have seen how locally all distribution are basically formal derivatives of continuous functions. The question is: does there exists a bounded function $f\in L^\infty(\mathbb R^d,\mathbb R^d)$ such that its distributional derivative is not a measure? The easiest formulation of the question would be to find such a function in $L^\infty (\mathbb R)$ . Since the topology on the distribuitions is the pointwise topology when looking at bounded functions we can just look at characteristic functions. Given a measurable set $A$ we know that $\chi_A$ can be approximated by above with open sets $O_n$ and from below with compact sets $K_n$ , thus creating two converging sequences $$
T_{\chi_{O_n}}\to T_{\chi_{A}}\leftarrow T_{\chi_{K_n}}.
$$ We get $$
\partial T_{\chi_A}(\varphi)=- T_{\chi_A}(\varphi')=\lim -T_{\chi_{O_n}}(\varphi')=\sum_k (\varphi(a^n_k)-\varphi(b^n_k)).
$$ The inequality $|\partial T_{\chi_A}(\varphi)|\leq\|\varphi'\|_\infty\mathcal{L}^1(A)$ is trivial but if the number of intervals in $O_n$ is a finite number $M_n\in\mathbb N$ for any $n\in\mathbb N$ then we get $$
|\partial T_{\chi_A}(\varphi)|\leq 2 M_n \|\varphi\|_\infty+\varepsilon,
$$ thus pointing out that if $M_n\leq M$ uniformly then we would get a measurable set with a measure as a derivative. Is such a condition necessary? Of course not, because Cantor's functions is an example of a bounded function whose derivative is a measure supported on an uncountable set. Does this mean that considering the function $$
f=\sum_n(-1)^{n+1}\frac{n}{2}\chi_{[-\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n}]}
$$ is enough? It is bounded because the alternated harmonic series converges and its derivative is $$
\int_{\mathbb R}\varphi' f\mathcal L=\sum_n(-1)^{n+1}\frac{\varphi(1/n)-\varphi(-1/n)}{2/n}.

Simiralry, I have tried separating $y''(t)$ into $\frac{dy'(t)}{dy(t)}\times y'(t)$ . This however didn't work since isolating $y'(t)dy'$ was out of my range of skills. Finally, I just tried to integrate both sides with respects to $t$ , however, I lack information to compute $\int\frac{(y'(t)^2)}{y(t)}dt$ when using integration by parts.","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

4234825,Inner product of polynomials defined using determinant.,"The following question was on my qualifying exam. I'd like to understand this question, but I've never seen anything like this, so I don't even know what key words to research or where to look for more information. I'm not necessarily looking for an answer to the following question. Rather, in years past, exams have routinely featured a question that explores the connection between determinants and polynomials, such as the following question. So any sources with more information about this topic, or any hints about the following problem, would be much appreciated! Question. Consider a continuous function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow (0, \infty)$ such that $\int_{-\infty}^\infty |x|^j f(x) \ dx < \infty$ for all $j \geq 0$ . Denote by $\mathcal{P}_m$ the vector space of all real-valued polynomials of degree at most $m$ , equipped with the inner product $$\langle g, h \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x)h(x)f(x) \ dx.$$ Let $m_j = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^j f(x) \ dx \ (j = 0, 1, 2, \dots)$ and consider the polynomials $p_0(x) = m_0$ and \begin{align}
p_n(x) = \det \left( \begin{matrix} 
m_0 & m_1 & m_2 & \dots & m_n \\
m_1 & m_2 & m_3 & \dots & m_{n+1} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
m_{n-1} & m_n & m_{n+1} & \dots & m_{2n-1} \\
1 & x & x^2 & \dots & x^n 
\end{matrix} \right) \ \ \ \ n = 1, 2, \dots
\end{align} Prove that $p_0, \dots, p_m$ are orthogonal in $\mathcal{P}_m$ . Observations. I have been able to ascertain the following intuition: Any (nonzero) polynomial cannot be integrated from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ , so for polynomials $g, h \in \mathcal{P}_m$ , their product will certainly fail to have an integral. Therefore, the function $f$ is introduced. The function $f$ must have tails that go to zero fast enough so that not only can $f$ can be integrated across all of $\mathbb{R}$ , but also $f$ modulates the end behavior of the term $x^j$ so that it can be integrated. Then, the product of $f$ and $g$ will be a polynomial, the integral of a polynomial can be split across the terms, the coefficients pulled out of the integrals, and the result will be of the form $\sum_{j=1}^{2m} a_j \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^j f(x) \ dx = \sum_{j=1}^{2m} a_j m_j$ , where $a_j$ is some constant and $m_j$ is defined as per the problem. Lastly, I have checked a couple of lower order polynomials and confirmed that their inner product is zero. The computations have felt a little like the kind of index-tracking exercises that I've done during my limited exposure to multilinear algebra. So I am thinking that maybe with more powerful tools for tracking indices, I can prove the desired result. Or maybe it is an induction on $m$ . Or maybe it has something to do with somehow forcing a determinant to have linearly dependent rows.

We would like to estimate $\tau=(\lambda-\mu)e^{-(\lambda+\mu)}$ . (a) Find a function of $X_1$ and $Y_1$ that is an ubiased estimator of $\tau$ . (b) Find the UMVUE of $\tau$ . (c) Calculate the asymptotic variance of this estimator when $\lambda=\mu$ . Context I am studying some old exams, and I came across this problem. I think I have the correct unbiased estimator, but my UMVUE is definitely wrong since it is a function of unknown parameters. I am not sure if I made a mistake with my complete sufficient statistic, or I did the conditional expectation wrong. Attempted Solution (a) Find some function $g(X_1,Y_1)$ such that $\mathbb{E}(g)=\tau$ . $$
\tau = \lambda e^{-(\lambda+\mu)}-\mu e^{-(\lambda+\mu)}=\mathbb{P}(X_1=1, Y_1=0)-\mathbb{P}(X_1=0, Y_1=1)=\mathbb{E}\big[I_{X_1}(1)I_{Y_1}(0)-I_{X_1}(0)I_{Y_1}(1)\big],
$$ therefore, $U=I_{X_1}(1)I_{Y_1}(0)-I_{X_1}(0)I_{Y_1}(1)$ is unbiased for $\tau$ . (b) The Lehman-Scheffe theorem tells us that, given a complete sufficient statistic $T$ and an unbiased estimate $U$ , the UMVUE is $E(U|T)$ . Let $S_j=\sum_{i=j}^nX_i+Y_i$ . From previous results we know that $S_j\sim Pois((n+1-j)(\lambda+\mu))$ , where Poisson is in the exponential family of distributions and $S_1$ is a complete sufficient statistic. Therefore, \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}

4234963,Which of the following properties must be true.,"Consider a matrix $A = (a_{ij})_{n×n}$ with integer entries such that $a_{ij} = 0$ for $i>j$ and $a_{ii} = 1$ for $i = 1,2...,n$ . Which of the following properties must be true ? $A^{-1}$ exists and it has integer entries. $A^{-1}$ exists and it has some entries that are not integers. $A^{-1}$ is a polynomial function of $A$ with integer coefficients. $A^{-1}$ is not a power of $A$ unless $A$ is the identity matrix. My Attempt: Here we see that $|A|=1$ and $A^{-1} = \frac{adj(A)}{|A|} = adj(A)$ . So option 1 is true and option 2 is false.
Also $ch_A(x) = (x-1)^n$ and we know that every square matrix satisfy its characteristic polynomial. So $(A-I)^n = O \implies n_{C_0}A^n(-I)^0+n_{C_1}A^{n-1}(-I)^1+n_{C_2}A^{n-2}(-I)^2+n_{C_3}A^{n-3}(-I)^3+...+n_{C_{n-1}}A(-I)^{n-1}+n_{C_n}A^0(-I)^n = 0$ There will be two cases.
Case 1: $n = 2m , m \in \Bbb N$ . Therefore $n_{C_0}A^n-n_{C_1}A^{n-1}+n_{C_2}A^{n-2}-n_{C_3}A^{n-3}+...-n_{C_{n-1}}A+n_{C_n}I = 0$ Now multiplying by $A^{-1}$ on both sides, we get $n_{C_0}A^{n-1}-n_{C_1}A^{n-2}+n_{C_2}A^{n-3}-n_{C_3}A^{n-4}+...-n_{C_{n-1}}I+n_{C_n}A^{-1} = 0 \implies n_{C_0}A^{n-1}+n_{C_1}A^{n-2}-n_{C_2}A^{n-3}+n_{C_3}A^{n-4}+...+n_{C_{n-1}}I = A^{-1}$ Case 2: $n = 2m+1 , m \in \Bbb N$ . Therefore $n_{C_0}A^{n-1}+n_{C_1}A^{n-2}-n_{C_2}A^{n-3}+n_{C_3}A^{n-4}+...-n_{C_{n-1}}I = A^{-1}$ We know that $n_{C_r} \in \Bbb Z$ . Hence option 3 is correct.
If I take $A = I$ then above cases can be written as
Case 1: $n = 2m , m \in \Bbb N$ . $n_{C_0}I^{n-1}+n_{C_1}I^{n-2}-n_{C_2}I^{n-3}+n_{C_3}I^{n-4}+...+n_{C_{n-1}}I = A^{-1}$ . So $I(n_{C_0}+n_{C_1}-n_{C_2}+n_{C_3}+...+n_{C_{n-1}}) = A^{-1} \implies kI = A^{-1}$ , where $k =(n_{C_0}+n_{C_1}-n_{C_2}+n_{C_3}+...+n_{C_{n-1}} \in \Bbb Z$ We see clearly that $A^{-1}$ is powers of $A$ and $A$ is not powers of $A$ when $A = I$ . So option 4 is true. Please correct me if I'm wrong anywhere. Thanks.","['matrices', 'solution-verification', 'inverse']"
4234976,Logic of proofs involving variables and “for all” statements,"It is taught that in order to prove ""for all"" statements such as $$P(G): \mathrm{For \ all \ groups} \ G \ \mathrm{it \ holds \ that} \ \{(g,g+g) \in G \times G \ | \ g \in G\} \ \mathrm{is \ a \ set}$$ one assumes that $G$ is a group and then proves the statement $P(G)$ . I wonder about the logic behind this and ""what is logically allowed"", which is never explained in introductory courses. Q $1$ : What does ""Let $G$ be a group"" even mean? A $1$ : As far as I can tell, it means that one assumes that all properties of the object of interest, in this case a group, are true and one calls the object of interest $G$ . Explicitly this would mean that it is true that $G$ is a set equipped with an addition/multiplication (whatever definition you are using) satisfying the group laws. Note that as far as I can tell one does not know which elements are contained in $G$ , only that $G$ is a set satisfying some extra properties. Q $2$ : Why is the above a set? Since I use the naive set definition, meaning that any unordered collection of objects are sets, it is true that the collection of all $(g,g+g)$ is a set, which is exactly $\{(g,2g) \in G \times G \ | \ g \in G\}$ . Q $3$ : Why does this prove the statement? Or more generally, why does this method suffice to prove a for all statement in general? I think there would be two ways to view this: $(1)$ One proved the statement is correct using nothing but the properties of a group which any group obviously satisfies. Thus the proof is ""a path"" one could follow for any explicit group to show that the statement is indeed true. $(2)$ Assume there exists a group which does not satisfy a statement proven this way.

I don't see how one would prove this generally, that every ""next"" generated number is different from all the  ""previous"" ones without really defining order.

4235115,Infinite series identity via integrating doubly connected domain,"I am having some trouble obtaining the correct answer to the following problem.  I would appreciate it if someone could point out where I went wrong in my computations. This problem occurs as exercise 1020 in A Collection of Problems On Complex Analysis by  L. I. Volkovyskiĭ, et. al. Problem: Prove that $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n}{(n^2-3)\sqrt{4n^2-3}} = \int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{x\cot(\pi x)}{(3-x^2)\sqrt{3-4x^2}}\mathrm{d}x+\frac{1}{6}\cot(\pi(2-\sqrt{3}))$$ Hint:  Use the integral \begin{equation}
    \int_C\frac{z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z
\end{equation} over the contour $C$ bounding the doubly connected domain given in figure where the small circular arcs are centered around $z=\pm\sqrt{3}/2$ and the large circular arc is of radius $n/2$ centered at the origin.  (The book doesn't actually specify the orientation of the contours.) Attempt at a Solution: First of all, I don't believe the book's suggested radius of the outer circle is correct if you take $n$ to be an arbitrary integer, as $\cot(\pi z)$ is not bounded on $\vert{z}\vert=k$ for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ .  I'm also not sure why they write $\cot(\pi(2-\sqrt{3}))$ instead of $-\cot(\pi\sqrt{3})$ . The answer I obtain is close but off by a factor of $\pi$ for the last term and $2\pi$ for the integral term.  In particular, I get \begin{equation}
 \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{k}{(k^2-3)\sqrt{4k^2-3}}  = 2\pi \int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{t\cot(\pi t)}{(3-t^2)\sqrt{3-4t^2}}\mathrm{d}t - \frac{\pi}{6}\cot(\pi\sqrt{3})
\end{equation} The factor of pi arises because the residues of $\cot(\pi z)$ at the integers is $1/\pi$ while the factor of two on the integral comes from the fact that integrating over the dog bone contour results in two integrals from $-\sqrt{3}/2$ to $\sqrt{3}/2$ , one each from the bottom and top segments, and these simplify to a single integral over $0$ to $\sqrt{3}/2$ multiplied by 4, due to the integrand being an even function. I would love to know where I went wrong! Proof: Diverging from the hint slightly, we consider the integral \begin{equation}
    \int_C\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z
\end{equation} over the contour bounding the doubly connected domain.  To integrate over the doubly connected domain we will use the following fact. Proposition: If $D$ is a doubly connected domain with boundary curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ oriented in the same direction and if f is analytic in a
domain containing $D$ and its boundary, then \begin{equation}
    \int_{C_1}f(z)\mathrm{d}z = \int_{C_2}f(z)\mathrm{d}z
\end{equation} Before beginning with integration, we need to select a branch of $\sqrt{4z^2-3}$ which is analytic in the complex plane slit from $-\sqrt{3}/2$ to $\sqrt{3}/2$ .  To do this we may factor the polynomial in the square root and choose a branch for each of the square roots of linear factors.  We define the branch of $\sqrt{2z-\sqrt{3}}$ to be such that $-\pi<\arg{(2z-\sqrt{3})}\leq \pi$ and the branch of $\sqrt{2z+\sqrt{3}}$ to be such that $-\pi<\arg{(2z+\sqrt{3})}\leq \pi$ . Recall that the complex logarithm $\log(z)$ is defined as \begin{equation}
    \log(z)=\log(\vert{z}\vert)+i\arg(z)
\end{equation} Thus the complex square root function is given by \begin{equation}
    \sqrt{z}=e^{\frac{1}{2}(\log(\vert{z}\vert)+i\arg(z))}=\sqrt{\vert{z}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}\arg(z)}
\end{equation} This shows that \begin{equation}
    \sqrt{4z^2-3} = \sqrt{\vert{4z^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2z-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2z+\sqrt{3})})}
\end{equation} where $-2\pi < \arg{(2z-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2z+\sqrt{3})} \leq 2\pi$ .  We would like to show that $\sqrt{4z^2-3}$ is continuous across the branch cut below $z=-\sqrt{3}/2$ .  To do this let $z = -t$ where $t>\sqrt{3}/2$ and consider the points $-t+i\varepsilon$ and $-t-i\varepsilon$ above and below the real axis for $\varepsilon$ real and tending to $0$ .  For the point above we see that \begin{align}
    \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\sqrt{4(-t+i\varepsilon)^2-3} &= \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\sqrt{\vert{4(-t+i\varepsilon)^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2(-t+i\varepsilon)-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2(-t+i\varepsilon)+\sqrt{3})})} \\
    &= \sqrt{4t^2-3}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\pi+\pi)} \\
    &= -\sqrt{4t^2-3}
\end{align} For the point below we have \begin{align}
    \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\sqrt{4(-t-i\varepsilon)^2-3} &= \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\sqrt{\vert{4(-t-i\varepsilon)^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2(-t-i\varepsilon)-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2(-t-i\varepsilon)+\sqrt{3})})} \\
    &= \sqrt{4t^2-3}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(-\pi-\pi)} \\
    &= -\sqrt{4t^2-3}
\end{align} Thus $\sqrt{4z^2-3}$ is in fact continuous across the branch cut.  To show that $1/\sqrt{4z^2-3}$ is holomorphic in $D$ we integrate along any circle in $D$ , splitting it in half along the real line.  By continuity the integrals along the segments on the branch cut annihilate each other, and since the integrals along the half circles are 0 the integral along the whole circle vanishes as well.  Thus, by Morera's Theorem $1/\sqrt{4z^2-3}$ is holomorphic in $D$ . Let us denote the circular contour of radius $N+1/2$ as $C_N$ and denote the interior dog bone contour by $D$ .  The the above proposition shows that \begin{equation}
    \int_{C_N}f(z)\mathrm{d}z = \int_{D}f(z)\mathrm{d}z
\end{equation} if we traverse each contour in the counterclockwise direction.  Beginning with the circular contour, by parameterizing we see that \begin{equation}
    \int_{C_N}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z = \pi i(N+1/2)^2\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{e^{2it}\cot(\pi (N+1/2)e^{it})}{((N+1/2)^2e^{2it}-3)\sqrt{4(N+1/2)^2e^{2it}-3}}\mathrm{d}t
\end{equation} Taking the absolute value of both sides we have \begin{align}
    \bigg\vert{\int_{C_N}\frac{\pi z\cot(z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z}\bigg\vert &\leq \pi (n+1/2)^2\bigg\vert{\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{e^{2it}\cot(\pi (N+1/2)e^{it})}{((N+1/2)^2e^{2it}-3)\sqrt{4(N+1/2)^2e^{2it}-3}}\mathrm{d}t}\bigg\vert \\
    &\leq \pi(n+1/2)^2\coth^2(\pi/2)\int_{0}^{2\pi}\bigg\vert{\frac{1}{((N+1/2)^2e^{2it}-3)\sqrt{4(N+1/2)^2e^{2it}-3}}}\bigg\vert\mathrm{d}t \\
    &\leq  \frac{\pi^2\coth^2(\pi/2)}{n+1/2}
\end{align} Thus \begin{equation}
    \lim_{N\to\infty}\int_{C_N}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z = 0
\end{equation} On the other hand the contour encloses the poles at $z=\pm \sqrt{3}$ as well as the poles of cotangent at $z\in \mathbb{Z}$ except for $z = 0$ .  Therefore the residue theorem shows that \begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_N}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z = \sum_{k=-N}^{N}\underset{{z=k}}{\mathrm{res}}\left(\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\right) + \underset{{z=\pm \sqrt{3}}}{\mathrm{res}}\left(\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\right)
\end{equation} With this in mind we first evaluate the residues at $\pm \sqrt{3}$ , finding that \begin{align}
    \underset{{z=\sqrt{3}}}{\mathrm{res}}\left(\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\right) &= \lim_{z\to\sqrt{3}}(z-\sqrt{3})\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}} \\
    &= \lim_{z\to\sqrt{3}}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z+\sqrt{3})\sqrt{\vert{4z^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2z-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2z+\sqrt{3})})}} \\
    &= \frac{\pi}{6}\frac{\cot(\pi\sqrt{3})}{e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(3\sqrt{3})})}} \\
    &= \frac{\pi}{6}\frac{\cot(\pi\sqrt{3})}{e^{i\frac{1}{2}(0+0)}} \\
    &= \frac{\pi}{6}\cot(\pi\sqrt{3})
\end{align} Likewise the residue at $z=-\sqrt{3}$ is given by \begin{align}
    \underset{{z=-\sqrt{3}}}{\mathrm{res}}\left(\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\right) &= \lim_{z\to-\sqrt{3}}(z+\sqrt{3})\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}} \\
    &= \lim_{z\to-\sqrt{3}}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z-\sqrt{3})\sqrt{\vert{4z^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2z-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2z+\sqrt{3})})}} \\
    &= \frac{\pi}{6}\frac{\cot(-\pi\sqrt{3})}{e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(-3\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(-\sqrt{3})})}} \\
    &= -\frac{\pi}{6}\frac{\cot(\pi\sqrt{3})}{e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\pi+\pi)}} \\
    &= \frac{\pi}{6}\cot(\pi\sqrt{3})
\end{align} Similarly evaluating the residues at $z = \pm k$ for $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ we find that \begin{equation}
    \underset{{z=k}}{\mathrm{res}}\left(\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\right) = \frac{k}{(k^2-3)\sqrt{4k^2-3}}
\end{equation} and \begin{equation}
    \underset{{z=-k}}{\mathrm{res}}\left(\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\right) = \frac{k}{(k^2-3)\sqrt{4k^2-3}}
\end{equation} Therefore, we find that \begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_N}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z = 2\sum_{k=1}^{N}\frac{k}{(k^2-3)\sqrt{4k^2-3}} + \frac{\pi}{3}\cot(\pi\sqrt{3})
\end{equation} Taking the limit as $N\to \infty$ and using Cauchy's Theorem for multiply connected domains gives \begin{equation}
 2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{k}{(k^2-3)\sqrt{4k^2-3}} + \frac{\pi}{3}\cot(\pi\sqrt{3}) = \int_{D}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z
\end{equation} Next we break up the dog bone contour into four parts \begin{equation}
    \int_{D}=\int_{C_{\varepsilon}^{-}}+\int_{\Gamma_{\varepsilon}^{-}}+\int_{\Gamma_{\varepsilon}^{+}}+\int_{C_{\varepsilon}^{+}}
\end{equation} Where $C_{\varepsilon}^{-}$ and $C_{\varepsilon}^{+}$ denotes the circular arcs of radius $\varepsilon$ traversed in the counter clockwise direction and centered at $-\sqrt{3}/2$ and $\sqrt{3}/2$ respectively, and $\Gamma_{\varepsilon}^{-}$ and $\Gamma_{\varepsilon}^{+}$ are the lines a distance of $\varepsilon$ below and above the real line respectively. It is not difficult to show that the integrals along the small circular arcs $C_{\varepsilon}^{-}$ and $C_{\varepsilon}^{+}$ vanish as $\varepsilon \to 0$ .  On the other hand the integrals along the lines above and below the real axis can be evaluated as \begin{align}
    \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\int_{\Gamma_{\varepsilon}^{+}}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z &=  \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\int_{\sqrt{3}/2}^{-\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{\pi (t+i\varepsilon)\cot(\pi (t+i\varepsilon))}{((t+i\varepsilon)^2-3)\sqrt{4(t+i\varepsilon)^2-3}}\mathrm{d}t \\
    &= -2i\int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{\pi t\cot(\pi t)}{(t^2-3)\sqrt{4t^2-3}}\mathrm{d}t
\end{align} and \begin{align}
    \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\int_{\Gamma_{\varepsilon}^{-}}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z &=  \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\int_{-\sqrt{3}/2}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{\pi (t-i\varepsilon)\cot(\pi (t-i\varepsilon))}{((t-i\varepsilon)^2-3)\sqrt{4(t-i\varepsilon)^2-3}}\mathrm{d}t \\
    &= -2i\int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{\pi t\cot(\pi t)}{(t^2-3)\sqrt{4t^2-3}}\mathrm{d}t
\end{align} Where we have used the fact that for $-\sqrt{3}/2<x<\sqrt{3}/2$ we have on the line above the real axis \begin{align}
     \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\sqrt{\vert{4(-x+i\varepsilon)^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2(-x+i\varepsilon)-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2(-x+i\varepsilon)+\sqrt{3})})} 
    &= \sqrt{4x^2-3}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\pi+0)} \\
    &= i\sqrt{4x^2-3}
\end{align} Likewise below the real axis we find that \begin{align}
     \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\sqrt{\vert{4(-x-i\varepsilon)^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2(-x-i\varepsilon)-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2(-x-i\varepsilon)+\sqrt{3})})} 
    &= \sqrt{4x^2-3}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(-\pi+0)} \\
    &= -i\sqrt{4x^2-3}
\end{align} Putting this all together the integral over the contour $D$ becomes \begin{align}
    \int_{D}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z = -4i\int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{\pi t\cot(\pi t)}{(t^2-3)\sqrt{4t^2-3}}\mathrm{d}t
\end{align} giving in the end \begin{equation}
 \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{k}{(k^2-3)\sqrt{4k^2-3}}  = 2\int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{\pi t\cot(\pi t)}{(3-t^2)\sqrt{3-4t^2}}\mathrm{d}t - \frac{\pi}{6}\cot(\pi\sqrt{3})

4235124,Getting the most accurate bezier curve that plots a sine wave,"I would like to draw a bezier curve that looks the most like a sine wave that has a single wave length of 1000 pixel and an amplitude of 1, which is 159.15 pixels high (wave length / 2𝜋). Here are the parameters of my bezier curve: p1 = starting point p2 = ending point h1 = outer handle linked to p1 h2 = inner handle linked to p2 Since I have set the wave length at 1000 pixels to begin with, I know my p1 and p2: p1 = (0,0) p2 = (1000,0) Now, I need to find the coordinates of h1 and h2. But I don't know how to get there by calculation. By trial and error I get approximately this: h1 = (477,550) h2 = (523,-550) This is not perfect as no bezier would represent perfectly a sine curve but pretty close (see picture below). My question is: knowing my starting parameters (wave length in pixels, amplitude in pixels, p1 and p2 coordinates), how can I find mathematically h1 and h2? It seems that a bezier function with 4 coordinates (p1,h1,p2,h2) uses a cubic equation that should look like this: $$B(t) = (1-t)^3 . p1 + 3(1-t)^2.t.h1 + 3(1-t).t^2.h2+t^3.p2$$ I don't know what to do with this though since the wave length and the amplitude need to be accounted for so that h1 and h2 can be found. That said, I only need to find h1 since h2 will always have as its x value the wave length minus the x value of h1 ; and its y value will be the negative of the y value of h1 . Anyway, here is the visual result I came up with by trial and errors: The white graph is the Desmos Graph accurate rendering of a sin(x). Once cropped in Photoshop to make it a single wave length and edited to make it 1000 pixels wide, I used bezier (the black graph) in After Effects to replicate it. In pink you can see the values of h1 and h2 I came up with by trials and errors. Thanks for your help.","['bezier-curve', 'calculus', 'functions', 'optimization', 'trigonometry']"
4235127,How to compute $\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt x\log(x)}{x^2+16}\;dx$ using Residue theorem?,"I considered $\gamma$ the following curve: From there, I know that \begin{equation}

\end{equation} \begin{equation}
\operatorname{Res}(f,4i) = \lim_{z\to 4i}(z-4i)f(z) = \lim_{z\to 4i}\frac{\sqrt z\log(z)}{x+4i} = \frac{2e^{\frac{\pi i}{4}}(\log(16)+\frac\pi2 i)}{8i} = \frac18e^{\frac{\pi i}{4}}(-i\log(16)+\pi)
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
\operatorname{Res}(f,-4i) = \lim_{z\to -4i}(z+4i)f(z) = \lim_{z\to -4i}\frac{\sqrt z\log(z)}{x-4i} = \frac{-2e^{\frac{3\pi i}{4}}(\log(16)-\frac\pi2 i)}{-8i} = \frac18e^{\frac{\pi i}{4}}(\log(16)-\pi i)
\end{equation} We also have that \begin{equation}
\int_{\gamma}f(z)\;dz = \int_{\gamma_1}f(z)\;dz + \int_{\gamma_2}f(z)\;dz - \int_{\gamma_3}f(z)\;dz - \int_{\gamma_4}f(z)\;dz 
\end{equation} It is easy to check that $\int_{\gamma_2}f(z)\;dz\to 0$ when $R\to\infty$ and $\int_{\gamma_4}f(z)\;dz\to 0$ when $\varepsilon\to0^+$ . Then, the only thing we need to do is the following: \begin{equation}
\int_{\gamma_1}f(z)\;dz =  \int_0^{\sqrt{R^2-\varepsilon^2}}f(x+i\varepsilon)\;dx\to \int_0^{\infty}f(x)\;dx\text{ when $R\to\infty$ and $\varepsilon\to0^+$}
\end{equation} Now, with $\gamma_3$ we get that \begin{equation}
\int_{\gamma_3}f(z)\;dz =  \int_0^{\sqrt{R^2-\varepsilon^2}}f(x-i\varepsilon)\;dx\to -\int_0^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt x(\log(x) + 2\pi i)}{x^2+16}\;dx\text{ when $R\to\infty$ and $\varepsilon\to0^+$}
\end{equation} Therefore: \begin{equation}
\frac{\sqrt2}4\pi i(\log(16)+\pi) = 2\int_0^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt x\log(x)}{x^2+16}\;dx + \int_0^{\infty}\frac{2\pi i\sqrt x}{x^2+16}\;dx\;\;\;\;(1)
\end{equation} To not complicate this much, I computed $\int_0^{\infty}\frac{2\pi i\sqrt x}{x^2+16}\;dx$ in Mathematica and got $\frac{i\pi^2}{\sqrt2}$ . Substracting it in (1) we get \begin{equation}
\int_0^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt x\log(x)}{x^2+16}\;dx = i\pi\frac{\log(16)-\pi}{4\sqrt2}\ne \pi\frac{\log(16)+\pi}{4\sqrt2}

4235131,On the integral $\int_0^\infty{\frac{\sin(\lambda x)\mathrm{d}x}{e^{2\pi x}-1}}$,"In the book Asymptotics and Special Functions by Frank Olver, an integral formula of Legendre reads $$\int_0^\infty{\frac{\sin(\lambda x)\mathrm{d}x}{e^{2\pi x}-1}}=\frac{1}{2(e^\lambda-1)}-\frac{1}{2\lambda}+\frac{1}{4}\text{ for }\lambda>0$$ Which is then used to prove an already-well-known integral
(by repeatedly differentiating with respect to $\lambda$ and setting $\lambda=0$ in the formula above): $$\int_0^\infty{\frac{x^{2s-1}\mathrm{d}x}{e^{2\pi x}-1}}=(-1)^{s-1}\frac{B_{2s}}{4s}\text{ for }s>1$$ However, the author introduced, that the first formula can be obtained by straightforwardly integrating the function $\frac{e^{-i\lambda{z}}}{e^{2\pi{z}}-1}$ , in which $\lambda>0$ , around a rectangle with vertices at $0,K,K+i,i$ , and indentations at $0$ and $i$ . Then let $K\to\infty$ and the indentations shrink to zero. I literally don't see how this works, if simply applied residue theorem, and how are the integrals combined. Could someone please show me more details about the process producing the first formula through such integration? Very appreciative. Ps. I'm not a native English speaker, so I got confused with what he intrinsically meant by the term ""indentations"", the contour wasn't drawn so there's not an illustration ;) EDIT. HUUUGE gratitude to Mark Viola, I finally figured out the method. The core is to only consider the imaginary part of the integral, which won't diverge. (Added) Here's a modified version of my first approach following Mark's answer: (Equivalent) Choose $0<\delta<\frac{1}{2}$ $$I=\int_\delta^K{\frac{e^{-i\lambda{x}}\mathrm{d}x}{e^{2\pi x}-1}}+\int_K^\delta{\frac{e^{-i\lambda(x+i)}\mathrm{d}x}{e^{2\pi(x+i)}-1}}+\int_K^{K+i}{\frac{e^{-i\lambda{x}}\mathrm{d}x}{e^{2\pi{x}}-1}}+e^\lambda\int_0^{\frac{3}{2}\pi}{\frac{e^{-i\lambda\delta{e^{i\theta}}}i\delta{e^{i\theta}}\mathrm{d}\theta}{e^{2\pi\delta{e^{i\theta}}}-1}}+\int_{\frac{\pi}{2}}^{2\pi}{\frac{e^{-i\lambda\delta{e^{i\theta}}}i\delta{e^{i\theta}}\mathrm{d}\theta}{e^{2\pi\delta{e^{i\theta}}}-1}}+\int_{\delta{i}}^{i-\delta{i}}{\frac{e^{-i\lambda x}\mathrm{d}x}{e^{2\pi x}-1}}=I_1+I_2+I_3+I_4+I_5+I_6$$ $I=i(e^\lambda+1)$ by residue theorem. Taking the limit, $$\Im(I_1+I_2)=\int_0^\infty{\Im(\frac{e^{-i\lambda{x}}}{e^{2\pi x}-1})\mathrm{d}x}(1-e^\lambda)=(e^\lambda-1)\int_0^\infty{\frac{\sin(\lambda x)\mathrm{d}x}{e^{2\pi x}-1}}$$ $$\left|I_3\right|\le\max_{0\le{x}\le1}{\left|\frac{e^{-i\lambda(ix+K)}}{e^{2\pi(ix+K)}-1}\right|}\to 0$$ $$\Im(I_4)=e^{\lambda}\int_0^{\frac{3}{2}\pi}{\Im(\frac{ie^\lambda}{2\pi}+O(\delta))\mathrm{d}\theta}=\frac{3e^\lambda}{4}$$ $$\Im(I_5)=\int_{\frac{\pi}{2}}^{2\pi}{\Im(\frac{ie^\lambda}{2\pi}+O(\delta))\mathrm{d}\theta}=\frac{3}{4}$$ $$\Im(I_6)=-\int_\delta^{1-\delta}{\Im(i\frac{e^{\lambda x}}{e^{2\pi ix}-1})\mathrm{d}x}=-\int_\delta^{1-\delta}{-\frac{e^{\lambda x}}{2}\mathrm{d}x}=_{\delta\to0}\frac{e^\lambda-1}{2\lambda}$$ Combine the results and we get the result.","['complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"
4235137,Addition of Permutations,"Sorry, if the title doesn't provide any clarity, but I didn't really know how to call it. Anyways, I've been studying quantum field theory from Blundell's book and during the derivation of the formula for second quantizing an operator I'm getting a little bit confused about a step he makes. I'll walk you through: We first write down an expression of an $N$ -particle state $$\left|\psi_1\cdots\psi_N\right>=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}\sum_P\xi^P\prod_{i=1}^N\left|\psi_{P(i)}\right>$$ where the sum is taken over all $N!$ permutations of the single particle states $\left|\psi_i\right>$ . We take $\xi=+1$ for bosons while $\xi=-1$ is for fermions. Now, the inner product of two such states (either both boson states or fermion states) is: $$\left<\chi_1\cdots\chi_N|\psi_1\cdots\psi_N\right>=\frac1{N!}\sum_P\sum_Q\xi^{P+Q}\prod_{i=1}\left<\chi_{Q(i)}|\psi_{P(i)}\right>\label{before}\qquad (1)$$ Then comes the confusing part. The author says that we can rewrite the above expression using $P'=P+Q$ which spans all the permutations $N!$ times and hence: $$\left<\chi_1\cdots\chi_N|\psi_1\cdots\psi_N\right>=\sum_{P'}\xi^{P'}\prod_{i=1}^N\left<\chi_i|\psi_{P'(i)}\right>\qquad (2)$$ Writting down examples for $N=2$ and $N=3$ I can see what he means and then the generalisation seems kind of intuitive. So for $N=2$ one would write down the 2-particle state as: $$\left|\psi_1\psi_2\right>=\frac1{\sqrt{2!}}(\xi^{\sigma_0}\left|\psi_1\right>\left|\psi_2\right>+\xi^{\sigma_1}\left|\psi_2\right>\left|\psi_1\right>)$$ Where $\sigma_0=i,\sigma_1\in S_2$ (the elements of the symmetry group). Then the inner product with another state $\left|\chi_1\chi_2\right>$ would be: $$ \frac12(\xi^{\sigma_0+\sigma_0}\left<\chi_1|\psi_2\right>\left<\chi_2|\psi_1\right> +
+\xi^{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}\left<\chi_1|\psi_1\right>\left<\chi_2|\psi_2\right>
+\xi^{\sigma_1+\sigma_0}\left<\chi_1|\psi_1\right>\left<\chi_2|\psi_2\right>
+\xi^{\sigma_1+\sigma_1}\left<\chi_1|\psi_2\right>\left<\chi_2|\psi_1\right>)$$ $$ =\frac122(\xi^0\left<\chi_1|\psi_2\right>\left<\chi_2|\psi_1\right>+\xi^{1}\left<\chi_1|\psi_1\right>\left<\chi_2|\psi_2\right>) $$ So, as it seems to me, for $N=2$ : $$\sigma_0+\sigma_0=\sigma_1+\sigma_1=\sigma_1$$ $$\sigma_0+\sigma_1=\sigma_1+\sigma_0=\sigma_0$$ However, the author from the example of $N=3$ seems to have defined in general for $\sigma_n,\sigma_m\in S_3$ $$\sigma_n+\sigma_m=\sigma_{(n+m)mod(3!)}$$ Well, now to make my confusion a bit more precise, Why is there a disagreement with my definition of addition and the authors one. Is it maybe because he might consider $\sigma_1$ for example a different permutation in the symmetry group? Does the generalisation come from noticing the common theme in specific examples or is there a more formal and elegant way of transitioning from $(1)$ to $(2)$ ?

4235139,"Introductory, college-level math books based on _modern concepts_?","Has there ever been a more-or-less successful attempt to write a truly modern math book, say, on analysis or geometry, one rooted in the more abstract mathematics of the last century, that is introductory in nature, i.e. that does not assume that a person has already been through a four-semester calculus sequence? Maybe something that anchors or connects it to some mainly modern subject, like abstract algebra or topology? Or that ties it more to foundational concepts, as in systems of relationships between concepts and fields, rather than, e.g., set theory. (I describe these, somewhat unconventionally, as foundational, because I think they are closer to the heart of of the practice of working mathematicians. Somewhat in the flavor of catagory theory, maybe?) I have been feeling a need to review my college calculus, and it occurred to me that I might like to learn something new at the same time, maybe something that would give me a deeper appreciation of the subject (though Apostel was pretty deep). But since my original motive was that I have forgotten much of this over the last 35 years or so, I’d rather not focus on a book that assumes that I have all of it readily at hand. Also, I’ve been working my way through Pinter‘s A Book of Abstract Agebra 2nd ed., and it’s loads of fun.

Define: $$f(x)=(x+1)((x+1)^{2m}+(x+1)^{m}+1) \in \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}[x]$$ I would like to prove that if $p \neq 7$ and $p \neq 13$ then $x^m-1 \nmid f(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}[x]$ . Attempt: I observed that $f(x-1)(x^m-1)=x^p-x$ . Then I observed that $x^p-x$ has all its roots in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ and that its roots are all distinct. I would like to prove that for $m \geq 6$ then $x^m-1$ and $((x-1)^m-1)$ share at least a root. This is sufficient because then we would have that $x^p-x$ has at least one multiple roots (I mean that it is not simple).,"['number-theory', 'finite-fields', 'abstract-algebra', 'sylow-theory', 'polynomials']"

4235176,The category of finite abelian groups has no (nonzero) projective objects.,"This is a proof verification post about the following statement: The category of finite abelian groups has no nonzero projective objects. Similar questions: About finitely generated abelian groups and about (all) finite groups . $\newcommand{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}$ First we make the following observations for objects in any abelian category: Observation 1. Let $A = B \oplus C$ . If $A$ is projective, then so is $B$ . (The proof is essentially as the proof that a direct summand of a free module is projective.) Observation 2. Suppose $P$ is projective. Then, any exact sequence of the form $$A \to P \to 0$$ splits. (Use projectivity to lift the map via $P \xrightarrow{\operatorname{id}_{P}} P$ .) Now, by the Structure Theorem for Finite Groups, it suffices to show that $\mathbb{Z}/p^{n}$ is not projective for any prime $p$ and $n \ge 1$ . To this end, consider the exact sequence \begin{equation*} 
	\mathbb{Z}/p^{n + 1} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z}/p^{n} \to 0.
\end{equation*} Since $\mathbb{Z}/p^{n + 1}$ cannot be written as a direct sum of nontrivial cyclic groups, it follows that the above sequence does not split. In turn, it follows that $\mathbb{Z}/p^{n}$ is not projective. Question: Is the above correct?","['finite-groups', 'category-theory', 'group-theory', 'solution-verification', 'abelian-groups']"

I define a group $G$ to be Cayley if its minimal degree is the same as the order of the group, so that the Cayley representation is an example of this minimal degree. So which groups are Cayley? So far I have found that cyclic groups of prime power order are Cayley, and the Klein 4-group is Cayley. The quaternion group $Q_8$ is Cayley because it has too many elements of order $4$ (six) to be injected into $S_7$ , which has only four order- $4$ elements. The direct product of a group $G$ of order $>2$ and a group $H$ of order $>1$ is not Cayley. I wonder if there are any other Cayley groups.

Consider now, for $n\geq 1$ , the sets $F_n$ defined by $F_n:=\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}C_k$ : these form an increasing sequence of sets ( $F_{n+1}=\bigcup_{k=1}^{n+1}C_k=\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}C_k \cup C_{n+1}=F_n\cup C_{n+1}\supset F_n$ ) which are also closed (being the union of finitely many closed sets).

Here's my attempt I have come to the conclusion that it would be an inverse relationship between the percentage of time you should allocate (S) and the time until the test (t). Multiplied this by the grade percentage the test was worth (G). $$S\propto \frac{G}{t}$$ Given that you have multiple tests and 8 hours (S=8) a day to study I sum the above relationship to and equate the hours to yield the following: (k= 8/sum) $$8=k \sum^n_{i=1} S_i$$ $$8=k \sum^n_{i=1} \frac{G_i}{t_i}$$ For instance let's say that I have 6 tests: English( $G_1=0.25$ , $t=58$ days) Maths Methods( $G_2=0.5$ , $t=60$ days), Specialist Maths( $G_3=0.5$ , $t=65$ days), Chemistry( $G_4=0.5$ , $t=72$ days), Modern History( $G_5=0.25$ , $t=74$ days), Physics( $G_6=0.5$ , $t=76$ days).

So let $t_1=1$ $$8=k\Big(\frac{0.25}{1}+\frac{0.5}{3}+\frac{0.5}{8}+\frac{0.5}{15}+\frac{0.25}{17}+\frac{0.5}{19}\Big)$$ $k\approx 14.45 $ Therefore English $S= 3.61$ hours Maths Methods $S= 2.4$ hours Specialist Maths $S=0.90 $ hours Chemistry $S= 0.48$ hours Modern History $S= 0.21$ hours Physics $S= 0.38$ hours This is where my model somewhat fails as I want most of the day to be studying the most urgent subject.

(C is unknown.) $$\overset{\mmlToken{mo}{⏜}}{AB\,} = \theta R,\space \text{thus}\space R = \frac{\overset{\mmlToken{mo}{⏜}}{AB\,}}{\theta} $$ $$2R \sin (\frac{\theta}{2}) = \overline{\rm AB}, \space \text{so}\space R = \frac{\overline{\rm AB}}{2\sin (\frac{\theta}{2})}$$ Using these, we can find: $$\frac{\overset{\mmlToken{mo}{⏜}}{AB\,}}{\theta} = \frac{\overline{\rm AB}}{2\sin (\frac{\theta}{2})}$$ With some rearranging, $$\sin (\frac{\theta}{2}) = \frac{\overline{\rm AB}}{\overset{\mmlToken{mo}{⏜}}{AB\,}}\frac{\theta}{2}$$ From here, we can do some variable reassignment:  I'll say $t = \frac{\theta}{2}$ , and $k = \frac{\overline{\rm AB}}{\overset{\mmlToken{mo}{⏜}}{AB\,}}$ . This gives us $\sin (t) = kt$ I see no way for $k$ to be $>1$ (and $k=1$ only if the radius is infinite and theta is $0$ ), but I suppose theta could be basically any angle - I'm solving for positive, and for my use case I expect it will always fall in the $0-\pi$ range, but I guess it doesn't have to. I feel fairly confident on the geometry side of things; that makes sense to me.  I haven't done much by way of approximation, so I don't know where to go from here.  I understand from my reading of other questions that this is a ""transcendental"" equation, which apparently means something like ""doesn't have a closed-form algebraic solution""?  Thus my question: have I screwed anything up?  If so, what?  If not, where do I go from here? I tried doing something like $\frac{\sin (t)}{t} = k$ , but I still don't know how to computationally approximate this - I'm embedding this in an algorithm I'm using on a website for solving a specific class of geometry problems, so I'd like it to be as accurate as possible - an arbitrary number of decimal places would be great, but I'll settle for like $4$ .

Now I want to argue that $$\lim_{s \to 0^-} I(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\arcsin(\sin x)}{x} \, \mathrm dx  $$ so that I can conclude that $$\begin{align} \int_0^\infty \frac{\arcsin(\sin x)}{x} \, \mathrm dx &= \frac{4}{\pi} \lim_{s \to 0^-} \beta(2+s) \Gamma(s) \sin \left(\frac{\pi s}{2} \right) \\ &= \frac{4}{\pi} \beta(2) \lim_{s \to 0^-} \left( \frac{1}{s} + \mathcal{O}(1) \right) \sin \left(\frac{\pi s}{2} \right) \\ &= 2 G. \end{align} $$ The issue is that $\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\arcsin(\sin x)}{x} \, \mathrm dx$ doesn't converge absolutely, so we can't appeal immediately to the dominated convergence theorem. In the case of the Laplace transform,  it turns out that $$\lim_{s \to 0^+} \int_0^\infty \frac{f(x)}{x} e^{-sx} \, \mathrm dx = \int_0^\infty \frac{f(x)}{x} \, \mathrm dx$$ if $\int_0^\infty \frac{f(x)}{x} \, \mathrm dx$ exists as an improper Riemann integral.  This has to do with the fact that the improper integrals $\int_0^\infty \frac{f(x)}{x} e^{-sx} \, \mathrm dx$ converge uniformly on $[0, \infty)$ . (See here and here .)

\frac1{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\;dz = \frac1{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\left(\frac1{z}+\frac1{z-i}+\frac1{z+i}\right)\;dz = n(\Gamma,0) + n(\Gamma,i) + n(\Gamma,-i) = 2n(\Gamma,i)
\end{equation} With this, the only possibility is that $A\subset2\Bbb N$ . Rewrite $f(z) = \frac{z(z-i)}{(z+i)}(z+i)^2 = g(z)h(z)$ , with $g(z) = \frac{z(z-i)}{(z+i)}$ and $h(z) = (z+i)^2$ . By the same procedure as before, we know that $\frac1{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{g'(z)}{g(z)}\;dz = 0$ , so there exists a branch for $\log(g)$ , which means that there exists a branch for $\sqrt[n]g$ for any $n\ge2$ . The branch for $\sqrt h$ is just $z+i$ , so we know that there exists at least a branch of $\sqrt f$ , so $\{2\}\subset A \subset 2\Bbb N$ . Can we say that $A$ is either $\{2\}$ of $2\Bbb N$ ? If we instead consider $D' = \Bbb C\setminus(\{e^{i\theta} : -\frac\pi2\le\theta\le\frac\pi2\}\cup[-1,2])$ , for that same $f$ we would get $\frac1{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\;dz = 3n(\Gamma,0)$ , and by the same reasoning as before, $\{3\}\subset A'\subset3\Bbb N$ .

4235681,Axiom 3. Comprehension Scheme,"The following is from Kenneth Kunen's Book - Set Theory, An Introduction to Independence Proofs. The Comprehension Axiom is intended to formalize the construction of sets of the form $\{x:P(x)\}$ where $P(x)$ denotes some property of $x.$ Since the notion of property is made rigorous via formulas, it is tempting to set forth as axioms statements of the form $$ \exists y \forall x (x\in y \iff \phi)$$ where $\phi$ is a formula. Unfortunately, such a scheme is inconsistent by the famous Russell paradox : If $\phi$ is $x\in x,$ then this axiom gives us a $y$ such that $$ \forall x(x\in y \iff x\notin x),$$ whence $y\in y \iff y\notin y.$ Fortunately in mathematical applications it is sufficient to be able to use a property $P(x)$ to define a subset of a given set, so we Postulate Comprehension as follows. Axiom 3. Comprehension Scheme. For each formula $\phi$ without $y$ free, the universal closure of the following is an axiom $$\exists y \forall x(x\in y \iff x\in z \,\wedge \phi).$$ My Question : Why is it that Axiom $3$ can prevent Russel Paradox in comparison with the first proposed definition? Can we not argue that if $\phi$ is $x\notin x $ in Axiom $3$ and come up with Russel Paradox again?

4235732,Is this a correct formula for sin(a b)?,"First of all, recall the complex definitions of the two trigonometric functions: $$ \sin(x) = \frac{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}{2i}, \space \cos(x) = \frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2}. $$ Now, the formula for $\sin(2x)$ can be derived from these two. But so can it be extended by multipying each new result by $ 2\cos(2^{b}x) $ : $$ 2\sin x \cos x = \sin(2x), \space 4\sin x \cos x \cos(2x) = \sin(4x), \space ...
 $$ and so on. Therefore $$ 2^{b}\sin x \prod_{n=0}^{b-1}\cos(2^{n}x) = \sin(2^{b}x). $$ However, it might be possible - and this is the step that could be a fallacy - to rewrite the product so as to generalize the outcome to some real numbers. $$ 2^{b}\sin\ x \prod_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(2^{n}x)}{\cos(2^{n}2^{b}x)} = \sin(2^{b}x) =>   \prod_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(2^{n}x)}{\cos(2^{n}bx)} = \frac{\sin(bx)}{b\sin x}.$$ So far, is this true?
Pick x = 1 and notice this is false for b = $\frac{\pi}{4}$ . However, for x = 1 and b = $\pi$ or x = 1 and b = 1 the product goes to appropriate values. Can I now deduce from this the formula for the reciprocal of the product? $$ \prod_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(2^{n}bx)}{\cos(2^{n}x)} = \frac{b\sin x}{\sin(bx)} $$ Instead of starting the derivation with sinx, I could have started it with $\frac{1}{\sin x}$ and then continued multiplying the denominator. Hence the invalidity of the formula for $\frac{\pi}{2^{n}}, \space n > 1 \space and \space n \in \mathbb{N}, \space$ cannot be explained by the first product's singularities, right?
