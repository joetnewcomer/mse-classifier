42295,Power series of $\ln(x+\sqrt{1+x^2})$ without Taylor,"The answer is $$x-\frac{ 1}{2}\frac{ x^3}{3}+\frac{ 1\cdot 3}{2\cdot 4}\frac{ x^5}{5}-\frac{ 1\cdot 3\cdot 5}{2\cdot 4\cdot 6}\frac{ x^7}{7}+\cdots$$ But I can't see how. Unfortunately, ""how"" can't be using Taylor's formula, because that isn't introduced until the next section. (Simmons' Calculus) The hint given with the problem is to integrate another series. This series must be $$1-\frac{ 1}{2} x^2+\frac{ 1\cdot 3}{2\cdot 4} x^4-\frac{ 1\cdot 3\cdot 5}{2\cdot 4\cdot 6} x^6+\cdots$$ But where does it come from? [How would I know to integrate that series, if it weren't for the hint?] The derivative of $\ln(x+\sqrt{1+x^2})$ is $\displaystyle \frac{ 1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}$, but I can't see how to get from $\displaystyle \frac{ 1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}$ to that series. The derivative can be written as $\displaystyle \frac{ 1}{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}\left(1+\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right)$, but that looks even worse.","['power-series', 'calculus']"

42333,Coordinate-free techniques in Lagrangian mechanics,"Consider the following Lagrangian (Exercise 3.6B from Abraham and
Marsden's Foundations of Mechanics ):
$$
L(\upsilon)=\frac12g(\upsilon,\upsilon)+V(\tau_Q\upsilon)+g(\upsilon,Y(\tau_Q\upsilon))
$$
($V \colon Q \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function; $Y \colon Q \rightarrow TQ$ is a
vector field; $\tau_Q\colon TQ\rightarrow Q$ is the tangent bundle).
My aim is to calculate the corresponding Legendre transform $FL
\colon TQ \rightarrow T^*Q$. It was easy to deal with the first
term $L_1(\upsilon)=\frac12g(\upsilon,\upsilon)$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\langle FL_1(\upsilon) |\, w\rangle &=
\left.\frac{d}{ds}\left[\vphantom{\frac{d}{ds}}L_1(\upsilon+sw)\right]\right|_{s=0}=\left.\frac{d}{ds}\left[\vphantom{\frac{d}{ds}}\frac12g(\upsilon+sw,\upsilon+sw)\right]\right|_{s=0}\\
&=\frac12\left.\frac{d}{ds}\left[\vphantom{\frac{d}{ds}}g(\upsilon,\upsilon)+g(\upsilon,sw)+g(sw,\upsilon)+g(sw,sw)\right]\right|_{s=0}\\
&=\frac12\left.\frac{d}{ds}\left[\vphantom{\frac{d}{ds}}s(g(\upsilon,w)+g(w,\upsilon))+s^2g(w,w)\right]\right|_{s=0}\\
&=g(\upsilon,w),

but I'm stuck with the other two terms for the reasons I myself do not fully understand. I must be able to calculate $FL$ using simple chain rule, but the differential $T\tau_Q$ of the bundle somewhy confuses me.

If we say that complex polynomials have to be finite sums of monomials of the form $cx_1^{e_1}\dots x_n^{e_n}$ where $c \in \mathbb{C}$, $e_i \geq 0$, then is this really enough?

For the second assertion, I have the following answer. If $\lbrace \sqrt{n_k}e_{n_k}\rbrace$ be weakly convergent subsequence, then it must be norm-bounded. However, $\| \sqrt{n_k}e_{n_k}\|=\sqrt{n_k}\to \infty$ as $k\to \infty$ which is a contradiction.

42373,On doubly graceful permutations,"A permutation $\sigma\in\mathfrak S_n$ is graceful if
$$\{|\sigma(i+1)-\sigma(i)| \text{ with } 1\leq i\leq n\}=\{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$$
(terminology coming from a more general definition in graph theory). From the definition, it follows that if $\sigma$ is graceful and we set $\tau(i)=|\sigma(i+1)-\sigma(i)|$ for $i=1,\ldots,n-1$, then $\tau$ is a permutation (in $\mathfrak S_{n-1}$).
This made me wonder about those $\sigma$'s such that $\tau$ is again graceful – I would call them doubly graceful. For instance, this is clearly the case for $\sigma=[1,3,2]$. I ran tests showing there are no doubly graceful permutations for $n=4$ to 9. I could not find anything in the literature and I'm no expert of permutations nor graphs, so... Question 1: Are there any doubly graceful permutations for $n>3$?

42381,Intersection of two (related) concave functions,"Question: In general, two concave functions intersect at at most two points.
True or False? If false, can you please provide an example. If true, can you please provide a proof. Proving or disproving may be hard for any two concave functions. But, the functions I have are related. I am explaining my problem below: (please note that though the functions are related and are known to be concave, the explicit form of the functions are unknown ). Consider the concave functions $f:[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}_+$ and $g:[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}_+$, which are related as follows. Let $p \in (0,1)$, and let $h_0$ and $h_1$ are Gaussian probability density functions with mean $\mu_0$ and $\mu_1$ respectively, and having the same variance (say $\sigma^2$). 
$$ 
g(x)= \lambda + \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f\left(\frac{(x+(1-x)p)h_1(y)}{(x+(1-x)p)h_1(y)+(1-x)(1-p)h_0(y)}\right) \ \left[(x+(1-x)p)h_1(y)+(1-x)(1-p)h_0(y)\right] \ dy
$$
where $\lambda > 0$ is some constant. Please note that $g$ is defined by an appropriate Expectation operation on $f(\cdot)$ (i.e., wrt to the pdf $(x+(1-x)p)h_1(y)+(1-x)(1-p)h_0(y)$). Question: Can we prove that $\{x:g(x) \leq f(x)\}$ is a convex set? Assume/Given: $g(0) > f(0)$ and $g(1) > f(1)$. You can assume smoothness, like twice continuously differentiable, strictly concave etc.
But, please do not restrict to monotone functions. But, even if there is a solution/counter-example to monotone functions, it would be great. Please note that an alternate way of looking at $g$ is the following. Let $Y$ be a random variable having a pdf $(x+(1−x)p)h_1(⋅)+(1−x)(1−p)h_0(⋅)$, and define the random variable $Z$ as $$\frac{(x+(1−x)p)h_1(Y)}{(x+(1−x)p)h_1(Y)+(1−x)(1−p)h_0(Y)}$$ Note that $g(x):=λ+E[f(Z)].","['convex-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'functions']"

42447,Expressing the Gradient in terms of an Arbitrary Scalar Product,"As part of determining the expression for the gradient in terms of an arbitrary inner product, I arrived at the following problem:
Given: $y = (y^1, \dots, y^n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a selected point $h = (h^1, \dots, h^n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is an arbitrary point. $f$ is a real-valued function defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$ $[g_{ij}]$ is a positive definite, symmetric  $n \times n$ matrix I'm trying to show that $$
\sum\limits_{j=1}^n \partial_{j}f(x_0)h^j = \sum\limits_{j,k=1}^n g_{jk}y^j h^k	 
$$ implies $$
\partial_{j} f(x_0) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^n g_{jk}y^k
$$ The only way I can reasonably see how to arrive at the conclusion is to reason as follows: Since the antecedent holds for arbitrary points in $\mathbb{R}^n$
it must hold for the particular $n$ points associated with the standard basis vectors $e_1, \dots, e_n$ So, for example, if we take the first point
$h = (1, 0, \dots, 0)$ it follows that $\partial_{1}f(x_0) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^n g_{1k}y^k$ and so on and hence for the $j^{th}$ point we have the conclusion above. So, my questions: Is this line of reasoning correct? Is there a better or more direct way to demonstrate the conclusion? EDIT I'm updating this post to provide additional contextual information. Given that $[g_{ij}]$ is a positive-definite and symmetric $n \times n$ matrix, it can be shown that the function $$
(. | . )^g:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$ given by $$
(x | y)^g = \sum\limits_{j,k=1}^n g_{jk}y^j x^k
$$ is a scalar product on $\mathbb{R}^n$.  Now, let $f$ be a function on $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is differentiable at $x_0$. By the Riesz represenation theorem 
(for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces) since $df(x_0)$ is a continuous
linear form there exists a unique vector $y$ such that $df(x_0)h  = (y | h)^g \; \forall h\in \mathbb{R^n}$ This unique vector $y$ is defined to be the gradient of $f$ at $x_0$ with respect to the scalar product $(x | y)^g$ and is denoted by $y = \nabla^g f(x_0)$ I am working through the details of the proof that $$
\nabla^g f(x_0) = (g^{1k}\partial_{k}f(x_0), \dots, g^{nk}\partial_{k}f(x_0))

42457,Brouwer FPT and solutions to a system of equations,"I am trying to solve the following problem: Let f, g be continuous positive functions $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$: show that the system of equations $$(1-x^2)f^2(x,y) = x^2 g^2(x,y)$$
$$(1-y^2)g^2(x,y) = y^2 f^2(x,y)$$ has 4 distinct solutions on the unit circle. Now my thinking was to use Brouwer's fixed point theorem on the unit disc: rewrite the problem as $x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{f^2}{f^2 + g^2}},\,y = \pm  \sqrt{\frac{g^2}{f^2 + g^2}}$ Now it is clear then that both of these square roots must have modulus at most 1, and furthermore, if x and y satisfy these then $x^2 + y^2 = 1$: thus it comes down to showing that these 4 $\pm$s give us the 4 distinct solutions we require. Defining $F_{\pm \pm} = (\pm \sqrt{\frac{f^2}{f^2 + g^2}}, \pm  \sqrt{\frac{g^2}{f^2 + g^2}})$ in the obvious way, each $F_{\pm \pm}$ is a continuous map to the unit disc, so each has a fixed point: so far so good I think. (Though, do we need to worry about the case where $f^2 = g^2 = 0$?) Now, since each of the 4 functions $F_{* *}$ maps to a distinct quadrant in the unit disc, it is almost obvious that our 4 fixed points for $F_{* *}$ from Brouwer must be distinct: however, what if they both lie on the boundary where 2 quadrants meet? For example the point (1,0) is in both the ""x,y positive, positive"" and ""x,y positive, negative"" quadrant, so if 2 of our 4 fixed points coincide here then we have obviously not solved the problem. Is there a simple way around this? Or am I overlooking something? Many thanks, Peter","['fixed-point-theorems', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

42494,Odds of winning at minesweeper with perfect play,"How would someone go about doing this? Assume that the first ""click"" will never be a bomb, and that the number of mines and the area are both known. Rather hoping there is a clever way to do this, but I will not be so surprised if there isn't. EDIT:
I would assume (though without any real proof) that a program could be written that could solve minesweeper in linear time (as the board gets bigger linearly, if the mines/area ratio stays the same). It would seem to me that in general no more than 9 blocks need to be considered (the high end of what i've see playing minesweeper at expert) to determine if its a mine its a safe square the odds that its a mine That would support my earlier assertion. EDIT 2: This would also seem to contradict the fact that minesweeper is NP complete, and with probably not so much work one (maybe even I, but probably not) could write an algorithm that can play a perfect game of minesweeper that would have a linearly increasing runtime which would contradict (summery of) the paper here . So I guess this raises the next question which is: where is the flaw in my logic? EDIT 3: I really am more interesting in the odds than in the algorithm to solve minesweeper.

Now for an affine subvariety determined by the zeros of some $f_i$, I know the definition of a tangent space in terms of the directional derivatives etc., and I guess I want to find that, but I am confused about what the $f_i$ I would be taking directional derivatives of are: our matrices have rank $\leq$ r iff every r+1 by r+1 minor of the matrix has zero determinant, so these are the ""equations"" for which our matrices form the vanishing set: however, there are many many such equations and clearly it is not feasible to work with all of them at once. If our r is strictly less than the minimum of the row/col size then I think this implies that there actually is such a minor for which the determinant is 0, but then to show that a point is singular I would need to show that the dimension of the tangent space does not equal the dimension of S, wouldn't I? This surely implies I know the dimension of S, which is entirely non-obvious to me. Or maybe it is just that in the case of the zero matrix, it is easy to show the dimension of the tangent space is not equal. Otherwise, is there a better (equivalent) definition of 'singular point' I could work with here?

Spanning forest algorithms are basically linear (in both time and memory) in the number of faces of the complex.

42609,Strong and weak convergence in $\ell^1$,"Let $\ell^1$ be the space of absolutely summable real or complex sequences. Let us say that a sequence $(x_1, x_2, \ldots)$ of vectors in $\ell^1$ converges weakly to $x \in \ell^1$ if for every bounded linear functional $\varphi \in (\ell^1)^*$, $\varphi(x_n) \rightarrow \varphi(x)$ as $n \to \infty$. How may I show that weak convergence, in this sense, is the same as the usual convergence-in-norm? It's clear the weak convergence implies pointwise convergence, but that's not good enough to conclude strong convergence... By linearity, it suffices to prove that if $\varphi(x_n) \longrightarrow 0$ for every $\varphi \in (\ell^1)^*$, then $\| x_n \| \longrightarrow 0$. Let $x_n(k)$ be the $k$-th component of the vector $x_n$. Then, $x_n(k) \longrightarrow 0$ for every $k$, so $\sup_n |x_n(k)| < \infty$ for each $k$, and this implies
$$\lim_{N \to \infty} \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{N} |x_n(k)| = 0$$
This is almost what I want, but the limits are the wrong way around. The obvious next thing to try is to construct some clever functional, or even a family of clever functionals, but I can't think of anything useful here. I can see that pointwise convergence alone is not good enough — if $x_n$ is the standard basis vector, then $x_n \longrightarrow 0$ pointwise, but $\| x_n \| = 1$ for all $n$. The fact that it doesn't converge strongly can be detected by the linear functional $\varphi(x_n) = \sum_k x_n(k)$, but I'm at a loss as to how to generalise this.","['functional-analysis', 'convergence-divergence', 'banach-spaces', 'weak-convergence', 'lp-spaces']"

In other words, we naturally have $J_0(N)^\vee \xrightarrow{T_p^\vee} J_0(N)^\vee$, and therefore $J_0(N) \xrightarrow{T_p^\vee} J_0(N)$.  So, what is this dual map? The reason that I ask this question is the following. Let $Y_0(N)= \Gamma_0(N)\backslash \mathbb{H}$ be the usual modular curve of level $N$. 
Given $p\nmid N$, we have two maps from $Y_0(pN)$ to $Y(N)$. Let's call them $B_1$ and $B_p$. By definition, $B_1$ is induced by the identity map of the upper half plane, and $B_p$ is induced by $z\mapsto pz$.  Now $B_1$ and $B_p$ uniquely determines maps from $X_0(pN)$ to $X_0(N)$.  With an abuse of notation, I am going to denote the map between the Jacobian of the modular curves 
$J_0(pN)\to J_0(N)$ induced by Albanese functoraility still by $B_1$ or $B_p$, and denote the maps induced by the Picard functoriality by $B_1^\vee$ or $B_p^\vee$. I was able to show that $B_1\circ B_p^\vee$ coincide with the Hecke operator $T_p$. This can be explained by the following fact. 
If we let $\alpha =\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & p \end{smallmatrix} \right)$. Then $$\alpha^{-1}\Gamma_0(N)\alpha \cap \Gamma_0(N)=
\alpha^{-1}\Gamma_0(pN) \alpha.$$ However, I am having trouble to figure out what is $B_p\circ B_1^\vee$.","['algebraic-geometry', 'number-theory']"

Any person either has (atleast 3 friends) OR (atleast 3 enemies).

42736,Showing equivalence of two definitions of the Blow-Up of a Variety,"Let $X=\mathop{\mathrm{Spec}}(A)$ be an affine variety over some algebraically closed field $\Bbbk$ and $I\subseteq A$ an ideal of $A$. There are two ways to define the blow-up $\tilde X$ of $X$ along $I$, namely Set $\tilde X := \mathop{\mathrm{Proj}}(A[IT])$ where $A[IT]$ is the graded ring $\bigoplus_{d\ge 0} I^dT^d \subseteq A[T]$ and $I^0:= A$. Let $I=(f_0,\ldots,f_r)$ be a set of generators for $I$ and define a  rational map $\varphi: X \to \mathbb{P}_\Bbbk^r$ by $\varphi(P):=[f_0(P):\ldots:f_r(P)]$. It is defined over $U:=X\setminus Z(I)$. Then, we define $\tilde X := \Gamma_\varphi$ to be the graph of $\varphi$, which is the closure of the graph of $\varphi|_U$. I would like to show that both definitions are equivalent; let me give you my approach (which is basically just a more general variant of Example II.7.12.1 in Hartshorne): Define a map $\pi: A[y_0,\ldots,y_r] \to A[IT]$ by $y_i\mapsto f_iT$. It induces an embedding of $\tilde X$ into $\mathbb{P}_\Bbbk^r \times X$ whose image should be $\Gamma_\varphi$. On any open subset $D(f_iT)$, we should now be able to prove that the kernel of the induced map $A\left[\frac{y_0}{y_i},\ldots,\frac{y_r}{y_i}\right]\to \left(A[IT]_{f_iT}\right)_0$ is equal to $\left(y_kf_j-y_jf_k\,\vert\,0\le k<j\le r\right)$.

If $\displaystyle z = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt2}$, Evaluate $1 + z + z^2 + ... + z^{20}$ The way I solved this was to evaluate the terms upto the 8th term. like below, $$
\begin{align}
z^2 &= i \\
z^3 &= -\frac{1}{\sqrt2} +\frac{1}{\sqrt2}i \\
z^4 &= -1 \\
z^5 &= -\frac{1}{\sqrt2} -\frac{1}{\sqrt2}i \\
z^6 &= -i \\
z^7 &= -\frac{1}{\sqrt2} +\frac{1}{\sqrt2}i \\
z^8 &= 1 \\

$$
S_7 = 1 + z + ... + z^7 = 0

$$
S_20 = 0 + 0 + z^{17} + z^{18} + z^{19} + z^{20} = 1 + z + z^2 + z^3

Some thoughts: By regularity, we may suppose that $D$ is open, and that $A$ and $B$ are closed If $D$ is not dense, then the answer is easily ""yes"".  So we may suppose that $D$ is open and dense. You can then write $D$ as a countable union of open rectangles with rational coordinates.  Treating each one at a time, we can delete null sets from A or B.  Repeating countably many times shows that if $A$ and $B$ exist, then actually, we can choose them with $D \cap (A\times B) = \emptyset$.

42838,Mercator versus cylindrical projections,"If I'm not mistaken, the Mercator projection is characterized by these two properties: (1) It is conformal, and (2) It maps curves of constant bearing on the sphere to straight lines in the plane.  I.e. $\theta$ degrees east of north corresponds to a certain slope on the map regardless of where on earth you are. In ""An Application of Geography to Mathematics: History of the Integral of the Secant"", by V. Frederick Rickey and Philip M. Tuchinsky, Mathematics Magazine, v. 53, No. 3, May 1980, pp. 162–166, we find this (the inside quote is from Edward Wright, who wrote some time around the year 1600): ""Consider a cylinder tangent to the earth's equator and imagine the earth to 'swal [swell] like a bladder.' Then identify points on the earth with the points on the cylinder that they come into contact with. Finally, unroll the cylinder; it will be a Mercator map. This model has often been misinterpreted as the cylindrical projection (where a light source at the earth's center projects the unswollen sphere onto its tangent cylinder), but this projection is not conformal."" The description involving ""swelling"" does seem to me to correspond to the cylindrical projection.  What is the difference?  How does ""swelling like a bladder"" give a result different from that given by the cylindrical projection? (As the title suggests, the authors are saying a major motive for integrating the secant function is the Mercator projection.) Note added later: I suppose the two conditions (1) and (2) could be regarded as more simply expressed by saying this: bearings on the globe equal bearings on the map, i.e. if north on the globe corresponds to upward on the map, then $\theta$ degrees east of north on the globe corresponds to $\theta$ degrees clockwise from straight upward on the flat map.  If I'm not mistaken, the Mercator projection is the only projection of which that is true. Still later note: I now find it being speculated in another forum where I asked about this, that the cylinder is viewed as something like a solid material, so that the swelling balloon clings to the sides of the cylinder rather than passing through it.  I had imagined a spherical balloon expanding while retaining its spherical shape, so that progressively more of the sphere is outside the cylinder.  Each point on the sphere would pass through (""touch"") the cylinder once, and that point on the cylinder would be the image of that point on the sphere.  It seems altogether unclear how that would determine the projection, and if that's what R & T had in mind, or what Wright had in mind, that's not at all clear from R & T's paper.","['geometry', 'conformal-geometry']"

42874,How to deal with alternating series when index $ \to +\infty$ and $ \to - \infty $?,"This question stems from some exercises in summing the alternating series of iterations of (simple) functions. I get some sort of paradox... Assume $f(x) = x^2 - 0.5$  which has the inverse $ g(x) = \sqrt{0.5+x} $. Let's write the iterates using $h$ as ""iteration-height"" as second parameter:
$ f(x,h+1)= f(f(x,h)) \qquad f(x,0)=x $     and $ \qquad g(x,h)$ analoguously. The iterations, if started at $x_0=1$ have two fixpoints: $ x_\omega=\lim_{k\to\infty} f(x_0,h)={1-\sqrt 3 \over 2} \approx -0.366 $ and $ x_{-\omega} = \lim_{k\to\infty} f(x_0,-h) = g(x_0,h) ={1+\sqrt 3 \over 2} \approx 1.366 $. Let's denote the iterates from $x_0$ by the index $x_1 = f(x_0,1), x_2=f(x_0,2),\ldots,x_\omega $ and $x_{-1} = f(x_0,-1), x_{-2}=f(x_0,-2),\ldots, x_{-\omega} $ Now I compute the alternating sums:
\begin{align}
\operatorname{sp}(x_0)&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k x_k \\\
\operatorname{sn}(x_0)&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k x_{-k} \\\
 y(x_0) &= \operatorname{sp}(x_0) + \operatorname{sn}(x_0) - x_0 \\\
   &= x_\omega \cdots +x_2 -x_1 + x_0 - x_{-1}+ x_{-2} - \cdots + \cdots x_\omega
\end{align} Because the iterations converge to the fixpoint and the sum is alternating each series can be Abel- or Euler summed and I can simply use the sumalt -function in Pari/GP to get numerical values, for instance, \begin{align}
 \operatorname{sp}(1)&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k f(1,k) &\approx 0.7098  \\\
 \operatorname{sn}(1)&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k f(1,-k)&\approx 0.41976 \\\
 y(1) &= \operatorname{sp}(1) + \operatorname{sn}(1) - 1 &\approx\ 0.1296 \\\
 \end{align} Intuitively I'd assume, that taking $x_{-4},x_{-2},x_0,x_2,x_4,\ldots$ as central values for the two alternating sums (in steps of two iterations) the results $y(x_{0+2k})$ should be identical for integer k - but apparently this is not true: Pari/GP as well as some checks with Euler-summation give a nonconclusive empirical result. Here is a table of some alternating sums centered at the iterates from $x_0=1$ $ \qquad \qquad \small

$ This confuses me much: I think, that the summation is valid, but I also think, that the two-way-infinite sum should be invariant to the centering in steps of two iterations. Where do I go wrong here? [Update] I've seen one source of the problem: this is the two-valuedness of the inverse $f(x)$-function (the taking of squareroot). From this follows the infinite multifoldness of the trajectory if going with negative height. As simple as it is: on the trajectory is $x_0=1, x_1=0.5, x_2=-0.25, x_3=-0.4375,\ldots$ but if we go back from $x_3$ to $x_2$ by $x_2 = f(x_3,-1)= g(x_3) $ we need a correction of sign after taking the squarerroot in g(x) . This inherits to the full trajectory as far as it is in the negative domain. There is some more interesting stuff following from this - indefinities or better: multivaluedness of iteration height of the values on the curve y=x^2-0.5=f(x) near the negative fixpoint - we have a continuous set mapped to itself (with contraction), which may have more consequences also in general, which I cannot yet fully recognize. Hmm, while this solves at least the ""practical"" or ""obvious"" problem before the eyes here, I'm still scared/insecure about the more general problem of summing series if they are assumed with infinite index at both ends (even if things are generally easier if the series have alternating signs). But this question may then be too broad/unspecified for math.SE so maybe I'll later formally ""accept"" some null-answer or I'll retract the whole question. [end update] For convenience, here is Pari/GP-code to reproduce the behaviour: \\ f can be positively or negatively be iterated:

42904,"finite subgroups of PGL(3,C)","The enumeration of finite subgroups of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ is one of the classic classification problems: mathematicians in many fields know well that the answer is cyclic groups, dihedral groups, $A_4$, $S_4$ and $A_5$.  Moreover each of these groups occurs exactly once, up to conjugacy. I hadn't thought about this classification very much for many years (if at all), but recently I have had some impetus to do so.  In particular I am currently reading this wonderful note of A. Beauville, which treats the classification of finite subgroups of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(K)$ for any field $K$ of characteristic $0$.  Here the new work is not so much figuring out exactly which groups can be realized over a given $K$, but rather working out the classification up to $K$-rational conjugacy, which turns out to be an interesting problem in Galois cohomology. In some recent ruminations I have been thinking about Galois cohomology of finite subgroups of $\operatorname{PGL}_N(K)$, but it occurs to me that I don't know anything concrete past $N = 2$.  Well, I can see that every finite group occurs as a subgroup of $\operatorname{PGL}_N(K)$ for any field $K$ and sufficiently large $N$, so obviously one can only ask for so much. So...what about $\operatorname{PGL}_3(\mathbb{C})$?  In particular: 1) What are the finite subgroups of $\operatorname{PGL}_3(\mathbb{C})$. 2) Is it still the case that if a finite group can be embedded in $\operatorname{PGL}_3(\mathbb{C})$, the embedding is unique up to conjugacy? If so, is there a general principle at work here? Note that Beauville gives proofs of everything in the $\operatorname{PGL}_2$ case.  But much of his classification arguments turn on the ""accidental isomorphism"" $\operatorname{PGL}_2 \cong SO(q)$, where $q = x^2 + yz$.  Perhaps if these arguments generalized to $\operatorname{PGL}_N$ in some well-known way, he would have given proofs which generalize as well...","['finite-groups', 'representation-theory', 'group-theory']"
42909,How do I calculate the size of padded envelope needed for a given size box?,"When you put a box of dimensions (W x H X D) in a padded envelope of dimensions (X x Y), what is the mathematics? The padded envelope also has to have a flap of length (F), it also has welded seams (S). There also needs to be some extra gap so the box can be taken in/out (G). The corners are tricky because of how the paper creases - this takes the maths out of basic trigonometry. For this reason I would like a bit of help with my homework!",['trigonometry']
42930,What is the expected value of the number of die rolls necessary to get a specific number?,"Given a discrete random number generator, such as a six-sided die, what is the expected value of the number of rolls necessary to roll a specific number (e.g. a six)? I think the result should be given by E$\langle$rolls$\rangle$ = $\frac{1}{6}\sum_{n=0}^\infty{(\frac{5}{6})^n(n+1)}$, but I don't know how to calculate the convergence of that sum. Also, how do I calculate the variance?","['sequences-and-series', 'probability']"
42952,Counting outcomes of flipping coins,"I know this is an extremely basic question, but I have a slight misunderstanding (?) regarding this question: How many possible outcomes are there when flipping two coins? At first glance, this is a really easy problem: 2 x 2 = 4 ! But if I list all the possible outcomes: {H, H}
{H, T}
{T, H}
{T, T} I noticed that there are really three ""distinct"" outcomes: {H, H}
{H, T}
{T, T} Is it wrong to consider {H, T} and {T, H} the same? Why or why not?","['discrete-mathematics', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"
