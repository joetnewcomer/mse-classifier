$$|f(0)|\le \sqrt[4]{M_1M_2M_3M_4}$$ 
I have an idea if we assume $f$ is never zero. By Schwarz-Christoffel formula, we can map the unit cicle to the square ,fixing the origin and the vertices. Then define $h=f(g)$ and log $|h|$, we have log$|h(0)|={1\over{2\pi}}\int_0^{2\pi}$log$|h(e^{i\theta})|d\theta$ and then we can get the inequality. However, if $f$ is zero somewhere, we can't define log $h$ then I'm stuck. Any help would be appreciated!",['complex-analysis']
487702,How do I prove that in every commuting family there is a common eigenvector?,"The proof given by my textbook is highly non-satisfying. The author adopted some magic-like ""reductio ad absurdum"" and the proof (although is correct) didn't reveal the nature of this problem. I made my own effort into it and tried a different approach. Yet I can't finish it. Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a commuting family in $M_n(\mathbb{C}^n)$, and $A\in\mathscr{F}$, then $A$ has $n$ eigenvalues. We pick one, say $\lambda$. Let $x$ be one of its eigenvector. We can easily prove that, if $A$ has no other eigenvector with eigenvalue $\lambda$ that linearly independent with $x$, which means that $\{cx|c\in\mathbb{C}\}$ are the only vectors satisfying $Ax=\lambda x$, then $x$ is a common eigenvector. Because $\forall B\in\mathscr{F}$ and $\forall y\in \{cx|c\in\mathbb{C}\}$, $$A(Bx)=ABx=BAx=B(Ax)=B(\lambda x)=\lambda (Bx)$$, so that $Bx$ has to be in $\{cx|c\in\mathbb{C}\}$, that is, $Bx=c_0x$ for some $c_0\in\mathbb{C}$, which means $x$ is a eigenvector of $B$ too. But what if there are vectors satisfying $Ax=\lambda x$ that's not in  $\{cx|c\in\mathbb{C}\}$? Well, then we should have a set of linearly independent eigenvectors $\{x_1,x_2,...,x_k\}$, that $\{c_1x_1+c_2x_2+...+c_kx_k|c_i\in\mathbb{C}\}$ are the only vectors satisfying $Ax=\lambda x$. Now, I have a reasonable hypothesis that there exists some $x=c_1x_1+c_2x_2+...+c_kx_k$, that can be proven to be a common eigenvector of $\mathscr{F}$. I've tried some approaches to prove it but all failed. Do you guys believe it's true? And if it is true then how do I prove it?",['matrices']
487729,"$\pi$, disjunctive numbers, and finite sequences of given length","It is an open problem whether the number $\pi$ is disjunctive in base $10$, i.e., whether every finite sequence appears (at least once) in the base $10$ expansion of $\pi$. Of course, every sequence of length $1$ appears, and it is readily checked that so does every sequence of length $2$. I guess the same can be easily checked for other small lengths, and has surely been done before. So, my question is the following: For which natural numbers $n$ is it known that every sequence of length $n$ appears in the base $10$ expansion of $\pi$? Searching the internet somewhat longer I found that this is known to be true for $n$ at most $7$. Surely there must be much better bounds...","['pi', 'computational-mathematics', 'number-theory']"

Context: In the coursera course Introduction to Mathematical Thinking by Dr. Keith Devlin I came across this sentence in the set supplement reading: If we have to prove that the sets $A$ and $B$ are equal, we usually split the proof into two parts: $(a)$ Show that every member of $A$ is a member of $B$. $(b)$ Show that every member of $B$ is a member of $A$. Taken together, $(a)$ and $(b)$ clearly imply $A = B$. (The proof of both $(a)$ and $(b)$ is usually of the ‘take an arbitrary element’ variety. To prove $(a)$, for instance, we must prove $(\forall x \in A)(x \in B)$; so we take an arbitrary element $x$ of $A$ and show that $x$ must be an element of $B$.) Thanks!",['elementary-set-theory']

However, I thought this might not be simply a matter of convention. Let $\mathbb{P}^n$ be a projective space of dimensional $n$, if we realize a point $[l]$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ as a line $l \subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ passing through origin. Then the tautological bundle $S$ of $\mathbb{P}^n$ is defined as a subbundle of $\mathbb{P}^n\times \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ by $$[l] \times l \subset [l] \times \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$$ In many books, the convention is $S \cong \mathcal{O}(-1)$ on $\mathbb{P}^n$. Here $\mathcal{O}(-1)$ is defined as it is in Hartshorne which is the sheaf of modules associated to $\mathbb{C}[x_0,\dots,x_n](-1)$ (for example $x_i^{-1}$ is degree $0$ element in $\mathbb{C}[x_0,\dots,x_n](-1)$). I know something need to be clarified in $S \cong \mathcal{O}(-1)$: for $S$, I mean the sheaf associated to the tautological line bundle S.

This function is continuous and surjective but not injective (e.g., $(01000...)$ and $(00111..)$ have the same image). This was taken from J. Oxtoby's ""Measure and Category"" [2nd ed. p. 84].

One condition is very easy to check, for instance, if the sets $(E_i)_{i=1}^\infty$ are such that $g(E_i)$ is measurable for every $i$ then $\bigcup_i E_i$ is measurable since $g(\bigcup_i E_i)= \bigcup_i g(E_i)$.

488183,Why does the amoeba shrink to its skeleton when we go to infinity?,"Let $f\in\mathbb{C}[X_1^{\pm1},\ldots,X_n^{\pm1}]$ a Laurent polynomial.
Let $\mathrm{Log}:(\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\})^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by $\mathrm{Log}(z_1,\ldots,z_n)=(\log|z_1|,\ldots,\log|z_n|)$ . We call amoeba of $f$ the set $\mathcal{A}_f=\mathrm{Log}(f^{-1}(0))$ , i.e. the image of the variety defined by $f$ under the logarithm. It can be shown that there exists a convex subdivisions of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that, each $n$ -dimensional cell contains exactly one connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\mathcal{A}_f$ . Then the $(n-1)$ -dimensional cells are contained in the amoeba and form the so called skeleton of the amoeba. From the pictures ( c.f. the links), it seems obvious that when we go to infinity the amoeba shrinks to its skeleton.
Because of some properties of the amoeba, what I want to show can be formulated in the following way: If a convex polyhedron $P$ is contained in $\mathcal{A}_f$ , then
either $P$ is bounded
or $P$ has empty interior. And, if we write $B(\boldsymbol{x},r)=\{\boldsymbol{y}\in\mathbb{R}^n \mid \|\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{x}\|<r\}$ the ball of center $\boldsymbol{x}$ and radius $r$ ; this is equivalent to: For any $\epsilon>0$ there exists $D>>0$ such that $$\|x\|>D\Rightarrow B(\boldsymbol{x},\epsilon)\not\subset\mathcal{A}_f.$$ In the article of Passare and Rullgard it is shown that the skeleton is a deformation retract of the amoeba, but this does not imply that the amoeba shrinks on its skeleton when we go to infinity. An other nice reference on this subject. Some more properties: The connected components of $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus \mathcal{A}_f$ are convex. The convex subdivision of $\mathbb{R}$ is dual to a convex subdivision of the newton polytope of $f$ . Let $E$ be a connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus \mathcal{A}_f$ and $\sigma$ the $n$ -cell that contains it. Then the recession cones of $E$ and $\sigma$ are the same.","['geometry', 'convex-analysis', 'complex-analysis', 'polynomials']"

Prove that $A\subseteq f^{-1}(f(A))$ and that $A=f^{-1}(f(A))$ if $f$ is injective. Proof: (1) Let $x\in A$, then $\{x\}\subseteq A$, then $f(\{x\})\subseteq f(A)$, then $f^{-1}(f(\{x\}))\subseteq f^{-1}(f(A))$.
Since $\{x\}\subseteq f^{-1}(f(\{x\}))$, then $\{x\}\subseteq f^{-1}((f(A))$, i.e. $x\in f^{-1}(f(A))$, thus $A\subseteq f^{-1}(f(A))$. (2) Now let $x\in f^{-1}(f(A))$, since $f$ is injective, there is a distinct $x\in S$ such that $f(x)=y\in T$, then $f^{-1}(f(x))=f^{-1}(y)=x$, then $f^{-1}(f(x))\in f^{-1}(f(A))$, i.e. $x\in A$, thus $f^{-1}(f(A))\subseteq A$.

488843,Origin of Littlewood's idea about sign changes of $Li(x) - \pi(x)$,"Background (skip if you like). Skewes and Littlewood are closely identified with the idea that $Li(x)- \pi(x)$ changes sign infinitely often, but Littlewood closed a gap in the work of Schmidt, who refined an early idea of Phragm$\acute{\text{e}}$n, who credited Chebyshev with the original idea, calling it an idea of ""perhaps little importance, which nonetheless seems somewhat curious."" Phragm$\acute{\text{e}}$n in 1891 expressed the idea by saying ""there is no limit beyond which the difference $f(x)- (Li(x) -\log 2)$ does not change sign."" Of the five theorems in the paper of Chebyshev he cites, the relevant one seems to be:* The function $\pi(x)$...satisfies...an infinite number of times the inequalities $$\pi(x) > \int_2^x\frac{dx}{\log x}-\frac{\alpha x}{\log^n x},~~~ \pi(x) < \int_2^x\frac{dx}{\log x}+\frac{\alpha x}{\log^n x}\hspace{10mm}(1) $$ no matter how small the positive constant $\alpha$ or how big n. Chebyshev proves this theorem and uses it later to show that the best approximation of $\pi(x)$ of the form $\frac{x}{A\log x + B}$  is $\frac{x}{\log x -1},$ already a nice result. If we suppress almost everything but the sense of the inequalities, letting $m$ be the quantity $\frac{\alpha x}{\log^n x}$ and $d$ the difference $\pi(x) - \int_2^x\frac{dx}{\log x},$ we can re-write (1) as $$ d > -m,~~d < m.\hspace{20mm}(2)  $$ Question: The logic of Chebyshev in (1),(2) seems to be almost the opposite of what Phragm$\acute{\text{e}}$n was getting at. At least superficially, for infinitely many x, Phragm$\acute{\text{e}}$n: $\hat{d} < - \hat{m}$ and $~\hat{d} > \hat{m}.$ Chebyshev:  $d > -m$ and $~d < m.$ So does Chebyshev's theorem (1) really prefigure Phragm$\acute{\text{e}}$n's idea? After looking through Chebyshev's paper and staring at his theorem for a while I can't convince myself that the idea of infinitely many sign changes is part of Chebyshev's theorem (or paper). My interest is not in deciding who gets the laurels but in finding the earliest form of the idea, which is sometimes (but not always) instructive. If someone can explain how/why these ideas are the same (or not) that would be great. It may be that this was not the theorem (there are five) Phragm$\acute{\text{e}}$n intended. I have looked at the others and do not see another obvious candidate.  I don't expect this question is one of general interest and provide the archive page for Vol. 1 of Chebyshev's works (page 39 is where the theorem appears) only in case anyone wants a look (no pay wall!). Thanks. http://archive.org/details/117744684_001 *Edit: Phragm$\acute{\text{e}}$n's attribution reads: ""[My result] is, as we see, a little more precise than the one we owe to M. Chebyshev [citing the paper above]."" Phragm$\acute{\text{e}}$n's f(x) is Riemann's f(x) but his paper deals with fairly general differences of this sort. So I use $\hat{d}$ and $\hat{m}$ in the question because they are not identical to Chebyshev's quantities.","['math-history', 'number-theory']"

Attempt: Since this is a show-me-what-you've-got-so-far community, I'll give you what I've come up with so far even though it's incomplete: Suppose that $x$ is an accumulation point of a set $S$. By the definition of accumulation point, for all $\epsilon>0$ we have that $N^*(x;\epsilon)\cap S\neq \varnothing$. Thus, we can conclude that $N^*(x;\frac{1}{n})\cap S\neq \varnothing$ by setting $\epsilon_n=\frac{1}{n}$ for $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and so for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we can select the desired sequence $s_n\in N^*(x;\frac{1}{n})\cap S$. Now, for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we have $s_n\neq x$, and $s_n\in S$ since $s_n\in N^*(x;\frac{1}{n})\cap S$---for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. To show that for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that if $n>N$, then $\lvert s_n-s\rvert <\epsilon$ let $\epsilon>0$; by the Archimedian property there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{N}<\epsilon$, and by design $s_n\in N^*(x;\frac{1}{n})$ for all $n$. Thus $\lvert s_n-x\rvert <\frac{1}{n}$ for all $n$, and so $n>N$ implies $\lvert s_n-x\rvert <\frac{1}{n}<\frac{1}{N}<\epsilon$ . . . still working . . .","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

(Depending on your definition of odd number, this can either be stated as ""every number is even or odd"", or as ""every odd number is one greater than an even number"".  My question is, can this be proven without induction?  In other words, can this be proven in Robinson arithmetic?  If not, what is example of a nonstandard model of Robinson arithmetic that doesn't have this property? The reason I'm asking this is that the proof of the irrationality of the square root of 2 is usually presented with only one use of induction (or an equivalent technique).  But the proof depends on the fact if k^2 is even, then k is even, and that fact in turn depends on the fact that the square of a number not divisible by 2 is a number not divisible by 2.  And that fact is, as far as I can tell, is a result of the proposition above.  (I'm open to correction on that point.)  So if that proposition depended on induction, then the proof that sqrt(2) is irrational would depend on two applications of induction.  (The reason that the ancient Greeks wouldn't have been aware of this is that Euclid implicitly assumes the proposition above, when he defines an odd number as ""that which is not divisible into two equal parts, or that which differs by a unit from an even number"".)

alternate (simpler) proof? Please help me out here. Thanks in advance. Proof: The set of integers is countable, we have this following theorem: Let $A$ be a countable set, and let $B_n$ be the set of all n-tuples $(a_1,...,a_n)$, where $a_k \in A, k=1,...,n,$ and the elements $a_1,...,a_n$ need not be distinct. Then $B_n$ is countable. So by this theorem, the set of all $(k+1)$-tuples $(a_0,a_1,...,a_k)$ with $a_0 \neq 0$ is also countable. Let this set be represented by $\mathbb Z ^k$. For each a $a \in \mathbb Z ^k$ consider the polynomial $a_0z^k+a_1z^{k-1}+...+a_k=0$. From the fundamental theorem of algebra, we know that there are exactly $k$ complex roots for this polynomial. We now have a series of nested sets that encompass every possible root for every possible polynomial with integer coefficients. More specifically, we have a countable number of $\mathbb Z^k s$, each containing a countable number of $(k + 1)$-tuples, each of which corresponds with $k$ roots of a $k$-degree polynomial. So our set of complex roots (call it $R$) is a countable union of countable unions of finite sets. This only tells us that $R$ is at most countable: it is either countable or finite. To show that $R$ is not finite, consider the roots for $2$-tuples in $\mathbb Z^1$. Each $2$-tuple of the form $(-1, n)$ corresponds with the polynomial $-z + n = 0$ whose solution is $z = n$. There is clearly a unique solution for each $n \in \mathbb Z$, so $R$ is an infinite set. Because $R$ is also at most countable, this proves that $R$ is countable.","['algebraic-numbers', 'elementary-set-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

He take  $\tau$  a  topology on natural number such that is generated by $ \{ 1,2 \}, \{3,4\}, \{5,6\}....$. and said that $( ‎‎\mathbb{N}, \tau)$ is  a countably compact space. But, I think, every  countably open cover has not a finite subcover","['general-topology', 'compactness']"
