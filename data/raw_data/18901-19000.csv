157044,A list of basic integrals,"I am in need of a list of basic integrals for my upcoming ODE test,
I have searched on Math.SE for a post that might help but I didn't find such a post. When I write 'basic' I don't necessarily mean immediate integrals (such as $e^x,\sin x$) but also 'useful' ones such as $\ln x$. If there is also some common techniques (useful substitutions like the trigonometric substitutions, how to integrate a rational function, etc.) this would be helpful too (since it has been over a year since I tooked my exam on Calc II and I forgot some of this material, this might also save some time during the exam). I would appreciate any reference for this matter.","['big-list', 'reference-request', 'integration']"

157047,Axiomatic approach to polynomials?,"I only know the ""constructive"" definition of $\mathbb K [x]$, via the space of finite sequences in $\mathbb K$. It essentially tells a polynomial is its coefficients. Is there a way to define polynomials ""axiomatically""? I just don't know a more suitable word, what I mean is like real numbers can be defined as complete ordered field, in opposition for example to repeating decimals. If there is no such definition then why? Why it is needed to tell what is a polynomial as itself, instead of telling what can be done with it? Maybe there are axiomatic definitions for some specific kinds of polynomials?","['axioms', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"
157093,Topological necessary and sufficient condition for tightness,"Recall the definition of tightness for a probability measure $\mathbb P$ on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of a metric space $(S,d)$: For each $\varepsilon>0$, we can find a compact subset $K$ of $X$ such that $\mathbb P(K)\geq 1-\varepsilon$. The question is: is there a ""nice"" topological characterization of metric spaces such that each Borel probability measure is tight? In Billingsley's book Convergence of probability measures , 1968, it's said that it's an open problem. I wish know whether some progress have been done so far. Call EPT a metric space on which each Borel probability measure is tight. 
Some remarks: By Ulam's theorem, each separable metric space topologically complete is EPT. A necessary and sufficient condition that each probability has a separable support is that each subset of $D$ of $S$ which is discrete have a non-measurable cardinal (i.e. we can't find a probability measure $\mu$ on $2^D$ such that $\mu(\{x\})=0$ for each $x\in D$). Hence for each EPT space, each discrete subset have a non-measurable cardinal. If we assume the metric space separable, we have the answer from Dudley's book: each probability measure on $S$ is tight if and only if $S$ is universally measurable (that is, if $\widehat S$ is the metric completion of $S$, then $S$ is $\mathbb P$-measurable for each probability measure $\mathbb P$ on $\widehat S$).","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'probability-theory']"
157099,Proposition 5.21 in Atiyah-MacDonald,"There's just one step in this proof I can't see for the life of me. Set up: We have a field K and an algebraically closed field $\Omega$.  $(B, g)$ is maximal in the set $\Sigma$ of ordered pairs $(A, f)$ where $A$ is a subring of K and $f$ a homomorphism into $\Omega$, where $\Sigma$ has the partial order $(A, f) \leq (A', f')$ if $A$ is a subring of $A'$ and $f'|_{A} = f$.  The overall claim is that $(B, g)$ is a valuation of $K$.  We let $M$ be the unique maximal ideal of $B$ (which exists).  We take $x \in K$ with $x \neq 0$ and may assume that $M[x]$ is not the unit ideal of $B' = B[x]$(by a lemma) and so is contained in some maximal ideal $M'$.  Let $k = B/M$ and $k' = B'/M'$.

If $(R \otimes M, b)$ is the tensor product then I thought I could construct an isomorphism as follows: Let $\pi: R \times M \to M$ be the map $rm$. Then there exists a unique linear map $l: R \otimes M \to M$ such that $l \circ b (r,m)= l(r \otimes m) =r l(1 \otimes m) = \pi(r,m) = rm$. Now I need to show that $l$ is bijective. Surjectivity is clear. But I can't seem to show injectivity. In fact, by now I think it might not be injective. But I can't think of a different suitable map $\pi$. 
Then I thought perhaps I should show that $l$ has a two sided inverse but for an $m$ in $M$ I can't write down its inverse. How do I finish the proof?","['modules', 'tensor-products', 'abstract-algebra']"

157209,Algebraic proof of a binomial sum identity.,"I came across this identity when working with energy partitions of Einstein solids. I have a combinatorial proof, but I'm wondering if there exists an algebraic proof.
$$\sum_{q=0}^N\binom{m + q - 1}{q}\binom{n + N - q - 1}{N - q} = \binom{m + n + N - 1}{N}$$
I've tried induction, but Pascal's Identity cannot simultaneously reduce the top and bottom argument for an inductive proof. For those interested , a combinatorial proof of the identity can be given as follows: Consider the ways of distributing $N$ quanta of energy to a system of $n + m$ oscillators (where each oscillator can have any number of quanta). This is equivalent to the question of asking how many ways of putting $N$ objects into $n + m$ boxes. From the traditional stars and bars method, the total is given by
$$\binom{m + n + N - 1}{N}$$
which is the right-hand side. Alternatively, consider partitioning the units of energy between the first $m$ and the last $n$ oscillators. Give $q$ units of energy to the first $m$ oscillators. Then there remains $N - q$ units of energy for the latter $n$. Together, the number of states for this particular partition is
$$\binom{m + q - 1}{q}\binom{n + N - q - 1}{N - q}$$
Summing over all partitions gives the left-hand side. Thanks for your time.","['binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"
157211,"Extreme boundary of a compact, convex, metrizable set is $G_\delta$","Let $X$ be a topological vector space (no assumptions about local convexity are made in the question, though I am worried they might be required). Suppose $K\subset X$ is a compact, convex, metrizable subset of $X$, and denote by $\partial_e K$ the extreme boundary of $K$. We wish to show that $\partial_e K$ is $G_\delta$ in $K$. It seems that this would boil down to writing a correct, alternate definition of being an extreme point as an intersection of bunch of open or $G_\delta$ sets, and using separability (of $K$ or of $\mathbb{R}$) to reduce that intersection to a countable one. I had two possible approaches: (1): For each rational $\lambda$ with $0<\lambda<1$, let $$U_\lambda = \{x\in K : \forall y,z\in K (x=\lambda y + (1-\lambda z) \implies y=z)\}.$$ I believe $\partial_e K = \bigcap_\lambda U_\lambda$, and would like to claim that each $U_\lambda$ is open. (2): Let $D$ be a countable dense set in $K$ (which is separable). For $y\neq z$ in $D$, let $$G_{y,z}=\{x\in K:x \text{ is not in the interior of the line segment between $y$ and $z$}\}.$$ It is easy to see that each $G_{y,z}$ is $G_\delta$, and $\partial_e K\subset \bigcap_{y\neq z \in D} G_{y,z}$. There is an obvious problem if $D$ is dense in the interior of $K$ while containing no boundary points of $K$, but we could throw in a countable dense subset of the boundary of $K$ as well. Under the assumption of local convexity, we need only show that every boundary point of $K$ which is in $\bigcap_{y\neq z \in D} G_{y,z}$ is in $\partial_e K$, which seems geometrically clear to me, but I do not see the details.

157217,Liouville's theorem for Banach spaces without the Hahn-Banach theorem?,"Let $B$ be a (complex) Banach space. A function $f : \mathbb{C} \to B$ is holomorphic if $\lim_{w \to z} \frac{f(w) - f(z)}{w - z}$ exists for all $z$, just as in the ordinary case where $B = \mathbb{C}$. Liouville's theorem for Banach spaces says that if $f$ is holomorphic and $|f|$ is bounded, then $f$ is constant. The only way I know how to prove this uses the Hahn-Banach theorem: once we know that continuous linear functionals on $B$ separate points, we can apply the usual Liouville's theorem to $\lambda(f)$ for every such functional $\lambda : B \to \mathbb{C}$. Can we avoid using Hahn-Banach? What if $B$ is in addition a Banach algebra? Motivation: Liouville's theorem is useful in the elementary theory of Banach algebras, where it seems to me that we usually don't need the big theorems of Banach space theory (e.g. the closed graph theorem), and I would like to be able to develop this theory within ZF if possible. It would be very interesting if this were actually independent of ZF.","['banach-algebras', 'functional-analysis', 'complex-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

By definition of an open set this means that for every $x$ in the boundary there is an open ball centred at $x$ contained in the boundary. An open ball is a neighbourhood of $x$, which implies it contains points of $A$ and $X - A$, which in turn implies there are points in both $A$ and $X - A$ that are in the boundary of $A$. If $A$ is open, then pick any such point in $A$ that is also in the boundary. This point cannot be in $X - A$ by definition of set subtraction. Further, because $A$ is open there exists an open ball centred around this point contained in $A$. Again, an open ball is a neighbourhood, which means a neighborhood of this point does not contain points of $X - A$, implying it cannot be in the boundary, a contradiction. If A is closed then $X - A$ is open and a symmetric argument holds. Hence the boundary is closed. Is my work correct?","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

Hausdorff spaces compactly generated? 2) If not, is the $k$-ification of a paracompact (resp. regular, normal...) space still paracompact (resp. regular, normal...)? 3) Are there free online resources that give a thorough account of paracompactness and other such separation properties (such as regularity, normality, metrizability) and their interplay?

157744,Should students be taught that $\int dx/x = \log(|x|)$? [closed],"It's difficult to tell what is being asked here. This question is ambiguous, vague, incomplete, overly broad, or rhetorical and cannot be reasonably answered in its current form. For help clarifying this question so that it can be reopened, visit the help center . Closed 12 years ago . I think in precalculus students should be taught the following: Euler's identity for $e^{i \theta}$. The principal value of $log(x)$ for $x<0$. Then in Calculus they should be taught that $\int dx/x = \log(x)+C$ instead of  $\log|x|+C$. Likewise, teach them that $\int dx \tan(x) = -\log(\cos(x))+C$ and so on. I don't think that would be too advanced. The advantage would be, that, what they learn will be consistent with what some will learn at a later date in complex analysis. Perhaps more important, students would get the expected answer from tools such as Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica. Any thoughts?","['education', 'calculus', 'algebra-precalculus']"
