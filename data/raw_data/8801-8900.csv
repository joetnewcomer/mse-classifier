66520,"If $A$ and $B$ are positive-definite matrices, is $AB$ positive-definite?","I've managed to prove that if $A$ and $B$ are positive definite then $AB$ has only positive eigenvalues. To prove $AB$ is positive definite, I also need to prove $(AB)^\ast = AB$ (so $AB$ is Hermitian). Is this statement true? If not, does anyone have a counterexample? Thanks,

66539,Degree of a field extension when compared to the Galois group,"Consider $K=\mathbb Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$ - I think $K$ is Galois since it's the splitting field of $(x-\sqrt 2)(x+\sqrt 2)(x-\sqrt 3)(x+\sqrt 3)$. I feel like $G(K/F)$ is isomorphic to the Klein 4 group since you can swap $\pm\sqrt{2}$, $\pm\sqrt{3}$ or both (since the roots have no F-relation). But since $K$ is Galois, $|G(K/F)|=[K:F]$ which means $[K:F]=4$, which clashes with my intuition that it should have degree three (the basis units being 1, $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt 3$). What am I not understanding?","['galois-theory', 'extension-field', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"
66541,Inequality with absolute value,"I am unsure if have solved the following inequality correctly: $ \dfrac{2x+3}{x+5} \leq \dfrac{x+1}{|x-1|} \tag{1}$ I've proceeded as follows. If $x>1$ then $|x-1|=(x-1)$ If $x<1$ then $|x-1|=-x-1$ I've then solved for those seperate inequalities, $\dfrac{2x+3}{x+5} \leq \dfrac{x+1}{x-1}$ $\dfrac{2x+3}{x+5} \leq \dfrac{x+1}{-x-1}$ The problem is that the union of their solution intervals yields a different result from the inequality (1) when I enter it into Wolfram Alpha.

66543,Conjugacy of projective representations,"Given characters of the Schur covering group of $G$ of the same degree, how does one tell if the projective representations (as homomorphisms from $G$ into $\operatorname{PGL}$) are conjugate in $\operatorname{PGL}$? For some reason I had assumed one simply checks for equality of characters, but this does not appear to be the case for $A_4$ into $\operatorname{PGL}(2,7)$.  The (Frobenius) characters are not equal.  The first rep has trace 6 on an element of order 3, and the second has trace 5 on that element, yet the two projective representations are conjugate in $\operatorname{PGL}(2,7)$. I suppose that the elements themselves are only defined up to a scalar multiple, and so the trace can be changed by any multiple of 2, but surely not all projective representations of the same dimension are conjugate in general? Edit: Karpilovsky seems to suggest one just checks equality of characters, as in theorem 3.3 on page 16 of vol 3 of his Group Representations book. Maybe theorem 3.5 is enough?","['finite-groups', 'representation-theory', 'group-theory']"
66546,Continuous involutions on $\mathbb R$ with at least two fixed points,"Thanks to the posts 65876 and 66141 , I was thinking about the functional square roots of the identity function on $\mathbb R$, namely involutions. An involution on $\mathbb R$ is a function $f:\mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ such that $f(f(x))=x$ for all $x \in \mathbb R$. I will restrict myself to functions that are continuous everywhere. It is an easy exercise that every continuous involution on $\mathbb R$ has at least one fixed point. After a little effort, I have a complete characterization of continuous involutions on $\mathbb R$ with precisely one fixed point. Namely, these are precisely the functions that of the form: $$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
a + \varphi(x-a)  & x \geq a,
\\ 
a - \varphi^{-1}(a-x) &  x \leq a.
\end{cases}
$$
where $a \in \mathbb R$ and $\varphi: [0,\infty) \to [0, \infty)$ is a continuous strictly increasing bijection with $\varphi(0)=0$. Here $a$ is the fixed point of $f$. (A special example is the function $x \mapsto 2a-x$ for a fixed $a \in \mathbb R$.) I want to know if there are any nontrivial examples other than the above family of functions. Are there continuous involutions on $\mathbb R$, other than the identity, that have at least two fixed points? Note. Searching on Math.SE, I found this question on involutions of $\mathbb R$ . Gerry's answer gives a reference to a paper by J F Ritt, On certain real solutions of Babbage's functional equation , Annals of Math 17 (1916) 113-122. The paper touches upon fixed points, but does not address or answer my question.","['functions', 'real-analysis']"

66613,When is a class function $\theta:G\to\mathbb C$ on a finite group $G$ a character?,"Suppose $G$ is a finite group, and $\{ \chi_1,\chi_2,\cdots,\chi_k \}$ be the complete set of irreducible complex characters of $G$. If $\theta$ is a class function on $G$, i.e. function from $G$ to $\mathbb{C}$ which takes same values on conjugacy classes of $G$, Question: When can we say that $\theta$ is a character of $G$? If we take characters $\chi_i$ and $\chi_j$, then their sum $\psi=\chi_i + \chi_j$ is also a character of $G$. Looking in other way, the character $\chi_j$ is difference of two characters, $\psi -\chi_i$. So a difference of two characters may be a character of $G$. So if a class function $\theta$ when expressed as an integral linear combination of $\chi_i$'s, then it will be a character provided $\theta(1)>0$. But in the online notes on "" Group Representation Theory "", by Daniel Bump ( here ), he has proved that the class function (namely $\theta^G$  in Theorem 2.5.1 in the notes) is character by showing that it is non-negative integral linear combination of irreducible representations $\chi_i$'s.

66629,When is a free and transitive $G$-space homeomorphic to $G$? And when is it (not) a torsor?,"In response to comments: let $G$ be a topological group. A $G$-space is a topological space $X$ equipped with a continuous right group action: a continuous function $X \times G \to X$, $(x, s) \mapsto xs$, such that $x(st) = (xs)t$ and $x1 = x$. Consider a right $G$-space $X$ such that the action of $G$ on $X$ is free and transitive. Generally speaking, $X$ is not homeomorphic to $G$, a counterexample is the action of $\mathbb{R}$ on $\hat{\mathbb{R}}$ by addition, where $\hat{\mathbb{R}}$ is $\mathbb{R}$ with left order topology. I have two questions: 1) Are there broad sufficient conditions for when $X$ is homeomorphic to $G$? One example is when $X$ is Hausdorff and $G$ is compact (then $g \mapsto xg$ is the homeomorphism for any $x \in X$), are there any other? 2) For a torsor, by definition, $X \times G \to X \times X$, $(x, g) \mapsto (x, xg)$ is an isomorphism, and this implies that $X$ is homeomorphic to $G$. Why was this particular definition chosen for 'a group that forgot its unit'? Are there examples of free and transitive group actions where $X$ is homeomorphic to $G$, but is not a $G$-torsor?

66877,Max dimension of a subspace of singular $n\times n$ matrices,"I am sure the answer to this is (kind of) well known. I've searched the web and the site for a proof and found nothing, and if this is a duplicate, I'm sorry. The following question was given in a contest I took part.

Consider $V$ a linear subspace of the real vector space $\mathcal{M}_n(\Bbb{R})$ ($n\times n$ real entries matrices) such that $V$ contains only singular matrices (i.e matrices with determinant equal to $0$). What is the maximal dimension of $V$? A quick guess would be $n^2-n$ since if we consider $W$ the set of $n\times n$ real matrices with last line equal to $0$ then this space has dimension $n^2-n$ and it is a linear space of singular matrices. Now the only thing there is to prove is that if $V$ is a subspace of $\mathcal{M}_n(\Bbb{R})$ of dimension $k > n^2-n$ then $V$ contains a non-singular matrix. The official proof was unsatisfactory for me, because it was a combinatorial one, and seemed to have few things in common with linear algebra. I was hoping for a pure linear algebra proof.

Then $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i x_i = d$ is solvable in integers $x_i$. How can I find a solution which minimizes $\sum |x_i|$ ? (A more vague question.)  Let $f(S, d)$ be the minimum possible value of $\sum |x_i|$; what can be said about this function as $S$ and/or $d$ vary?  (An obvious observation is that $f(T,d) \le f(S,d)$ if $S \subset T$.) When $n=2$, it's easy to answer.  For $d=1$, the usual Euclidean algorithm gives a minimal solution.  Equivalently, if the integers are $p$ and $q$, find the simple continued fraction expansion for $p/q$ that does not end in a 1.  Then take the numerator and denominator of the second-to-last partial quotient, with appropriate choice of signs.  You can check that this is minimal. For $n=2$ and larger $d$, first solve for $d=1$ as above, then multiply the solutions by $d$.  Now you have a solution to $p x_1 + q x_2 = d$, and all other solutions are given by $x'_1 = x_1 + kq$ and $x'_2 = x_2 - kp$, and you can easily find the right integer $k$ to minimize $|x_1|+|x_2|$.  There may be a better way to do this. The motivation (this is kind of bizarre, feel free to skip) is the following idealized product design scenario.  You are designing controls for a robot that walks along the integers.  Your controls consist of $n$ levers which can be pulled either to the left or right, and associated with each lever is a positive integer $a_i$.  Pulling a lever moves the robot in that direction by a distance of $a_i$.  You could just supply one lever with $a_1=1$, and the robot could reach any integer, but if some customer's application frequently needs to hop 15 spaces, they'll have to pull the lever 15 times which they won't like.  So if a customer gives a certain set of preferred $d$ values, maybe even with a weighted frequency for each $d$, you want to choose an appropriate $S$ to keep $\sum |x_i|$ smaller for the more common $d$'s (that's the number of times the customer must pull the levers to achieve $d$).  But you also want to keep $n$ small since that's cheaper and the customer wouldn't like having tons of unnecessary controls to remember.  There's still some more to specify to get a precise question, but I hope this gives the gist of the motivation (maybe a precise version can become a separate question).",['number-theory']
66889,Finite/Infinite Coxeter Groups,"In the same contest as this we got the following problem: We are given a language with only three letters letters $A,B,C$. Two words are equivalent if they can be transformed from one another using transformations of consecutive letters in a word like this:  $ABA \leftrightarrow BAB$, $ACA \leftrightarrow CAC$ and $AA=BB=CC=\emptyset$ Decide if there are finite or infinite number of non equivalent words in this language if the following condition is added: 1) $BC=CB$; 2) $BCB=CBC$. If there are a finite number of words, how many inequivalent words are there? The problem can be quickly translated into group theory (which I didn't see...) like this: A group has three generators $a,b,c$ with the following relations between them. Decide in each case if the group is finite/infinite. If finite, find the number of elements of the group. 1) $a^2=b^2=c^2=e, \ (ab)^3=e, \ (ac)^3=3,\ (bc)^2=e$; 2) $a^2=b^2=c^2=e, \ (ab)^3=e, \ (ac)^3=3,\ (bc)^3=e$. These are easily seen to be particular cases of Coxeter groups . The official proofs were based on finding actual geometrical models of the given Coxeter groups (this is always possible, although not very simple...). Of course, no one of the participants thought of it like this, and in case $1)$ it is possible to prove that there are finitely many words by proving that a large enough word, which is equivalent to a word of the form $ABCABC..., BABCABC...,BCABCABC...$ can be made shorter, but even if we prove that there are finitely many words, there is still the part when we need to count the different words, which can be very tricky. For the second problem no solution without Coxeter groups geometrical representation was presented. My questions are: 1) Are there any results from which we can see directly from the relations given for the Coxeter group if the group is finite or not? I am interested especially in the 3 generators case, but maybe there are some results in the general case also. 2) Can we find the number of inequivalent words in the first part without using Coxeter groups? 3) Can you solve second part without using Coxeter groups?","['coxeter-groups', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'combinatorics']"

66999,$C_c(X)$ dense in $L_1(X)$,"I did the following homework, can you tell me if my answer is correct? Prove that for any $\sigma$-compact, locally compact Hausdorff space $\Omega$ equipped with a Radon measure $\mu$ the set of continuous functions with compact support $C_c(\Omega)$ is dense in the set of Lebesgue-integrable functions $L_1(\Omega, \mu)$. Remember that any point of a locally compact space has a neighbourhood basis consisting of compact sets. A topological space is $\sigma$-compact if it allows a countable cover of compact sets. a) We may assume that $f \in L_1(\Omega)$ is non-negative. Why? Prove that for any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a function $s \in L_1$ of finite support such that
$\|f−s \|_1 <\varepsilon$. You may use the fact that for any measurable, non-negative function $f$ there exists a monotonely increasing sequence of simple functions $\{s_n\}$ that approximate $f$ pointwise. Answer a.1 : Because $f = f^+ - f^-$ where $f^+ , f^- \geq 0$ and so one only needs the integral on non-negative functions. Answer a.2 : To prove that one uses that for any non-negative $f$ there exists $s_n$ such that $$\forall \varepsilon > 0 \exists n_0 : n > n_0 \implies |f(x) - s_n(x) | < \frac{\varepsilon}{\mu(\Omega)} \forall x \in \Omega$$ where $s_n \leq s_{n+1}$ and $\displaystyle s_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i \chi_{Y_{i,n}}(x)$ and $Y_n := \cup Y_{i,n}$. Here I think I need to assume $\mu(\Omega) < \infty$ but maybe that follows from what is given in the question. Then $$\| s_n(x) - f(x) \|_1 = \int_\Omega |s_n(x) - f(x)| d \mu < \varepsilon $$ Now one has a measurable function with finite (and therefore compact) support. Next one wants to make that into a continuous function. b) Recall the Theorem of Lusin and Tietze’s Extension Theorem: Theorem (Lusin’s Theorem). Let $\Omega$ and $\mu$ as above and $f\colon\Omega\to\mathbb R$ a $\mu$-measurable function with finite support $E$. Then for any $\delta > 0$ there exists a closed set $K\subset E$ such that $μ(E\setminus K) < \delta$ and $f$ is continuous on $K$. Theorem (Tietze’s Extension Theorem for LCH spaces). If $\Omega$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space and $K \subset \Omega$ compact then any $f \in C(K, \mathbb R)$ can be extended to a function on $C_c(\Omega,\mathbb  R)$ with supremums norm bounded by $\| f \|_\infty$. Combine these theorems to show that $C_c(\Omega)$ is dense in $L_1$. You may need that $\mu$ is Radon. Answer b : From a) one has a measurable function $s_n$ with finite support $Y_n$. To make it into a continuous function one can set it to be $0$ on $Y_n \setminus K$ where $K$ is a closed set such that $μ(Y_n \setminus K) < \delta$ for some $\delta$. Let's call this modified function $\tilde{s_n}$. Then $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \| \tilde{s_n}(x) - f(x)\|_1 =  \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{Y_n \setminus K} |s_n(x) - f(x)| d\mu = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{Y_n} |s_n(x) - f(x)| d\mu = 0$$ Many thanks for your help!","['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

67093,"An argument on page 62 of Griffith's book,  ""Introduction to Algebraic Curves""","I am a bit confused about some of the things that Griffiths says on page 62 of his book, Introduction to Algebraic Curves .  I am not sure how I can reproduce the text here. I can see that GoogleBooks does have those pages on display. Firstly I felt that the points $(x,y_\nu(x))$ are points on the algebraic curve $f$ which can have a non-trivial topology but from the way the line $\Lambda$ or the set $\Omega$ is talked about it seems that one is working on $\mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{C}$. What is the right picture? Are these local analytic elements on the generically non-trivial Riemann surface or are they on just $\mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{C}$? Now these function elements $y_\nu(x)$ were obtained by using the implicit function theorem locally around each of the roots of an algebraic curve $f(x,y)=0$ This could be done only on the complement of the non-singular points. Now one removes a semi-infinite line from the plane which passes through the finite number of singular points. Then what is left is still simply connected. Now to extend these local analytic elements to the complement of the line that has been removed, does one necessarily need to use the Riemannn monodromy theorem or isn't it possible to simply argue that from the property of analytic continuation? (..that if two analytic functions agree on a ""large"" enough open set then they are the same..) The explicit need for a path and continuation along it comes only when one introduces the equivalence relation whereby one calls two of the $y_\nu$s to be equivalent if there exists a path in the full space (without deleting any of the points unlike at first) along which analytic continuation will convert one into the other...this again doesn't seem to need the monodromy theorem...Am I missing something? What exactly is this ""heredity property"" that is being invoked to say that if $f$, a second degree homogeneous polynomial in two complex variables evaluated on the point $(x,y_\nu(x)$ went to zero then it should evaluate to $0$ on any extension of the function $y_\nu(x)$. I guess that given any set of $n$ locally holomorphic functions $y_i(x)$ one can remove a semi-infinite line in the plane and repeat the above argument with some specific choice of path that intersects the line. Hence any line segment and a path intersecting it induces a permutation of the $y_i$s? Lastly I want to know if that entire argument can be made on $\mathbb{C}$ or is this entire thing something typical over $\mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{C}$ ? May be by replacing the holomorphic functions by power-series expandable real functions...they too will satisfy the analytic continuation property like the holomorphics..I am not clear about what happens to the ""heredity"" property. Or more generally is there an extension of this argument/proof/technique for $\mathbb{C}^n$ or $\mathbb{R}^n$ (..looking at the zero-sets of homogeneous polynomials on appropriate number of variables..)...possibly by restricting the class of functions appropriately.

I think I have eliminated the possibility that the hint merely says that $\binom JK$ is one way to count K of them and there's another way involving ""1, or 2, or 3, or 4, ... or K"" plus possibly other different but irrelevant ways. I have also eliminated a theory that ""count K of them"" was a typo for ""choose K of them"". Beyond that I'm drawing blanks.","['terminology', 'soft-question', 'combinatorics']"

67164,which topology is used on $\mathbb{C}^ 2$ to prove that the complex addition continuous?,"The title says it all. The motivation behind this question is that I'm stuck with a theorem in topology, which  states that if $f,g:X \rightarrow \mathbb{K}$  (where $\mathbb{K}$ is either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ - both endowed with the euclidean topology - and $X$ is some topological space) is continuous, then $f\cdot g$ is as well.
Since the sketch of the proof goes like this: ""We know that from that the multiplication $\textrm{mult}: \mathbb{K}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{K}$ is continuous and $C:X \rightarrow \mathbb{K}^2, C(x)=(f(x),g(h))$ is as well, so must be $f \cdot g = C \circ \textrm{mult}$"" I'm left with the problem (not having taken a full  course in complex analysis yet) with which topology $\mathbb{C}^2$ traditionally is  endowed, when one proves, that the multiplication of complex numbers is continuous. (For this theorem I need the fact that this topology I'm looking for on  $\mathbb{C}^2$ - viewed as the domain of $\textrm{mult}$ - is at least contained in the product topology obtained from  $ \mathbb{C}^2 = \mathbb{C} \times  \mathbb{C} $ , both equipped with the euclidean topology - $ \mathbb{C}^2$ viewed this time as the range of $C$ -  because else the proof won't work. My guess is, that the topology I'm looking for on  $\mathbb{C}^2$ - as the domain of $\textrm{mult}$ - is the product topology above described, but I couldn't quickly do a proof that using this topology $\textrm{mult}:  \mathbb{C}^2 \rightarrow  \mathbb{C}$   is continuous and since I've wasted enough time on this problem and also  haven't taken a complex analysis course, I thought it is finally time to ask you guys about this, so that I can get a clear view of things.) Side questions: I'm also wondering why ""euclidean topology"" was mentioned, because as far as I knew, this makes sense only for $\mathbb{R}$ (I'm guessing with $\mathbb{C}$ it is meant, that the euclidean topology of $\mathbb{R}^2$ is used; could it be, that if the topology I'm looking for on $\mathbb{C}^2$  - as the domain of $\textrm{mult}$ - is the product topology, that it is the same as the euclidean one for $\mathbb{R }^4$ ?)

Here, $\mathscr{T}(X)_x$ denotes the tangent space of $X$ at $x$. Let $\mathscr{O}_x$ be the local ring of $x$, and $\mathscr{m}_x$ its maximal ideal, then $\mathscr{T}(X)_x$ is defined to be the dual vector space $(\mathscr{m}_x/\mathscr{m}_x^2)^*$ over$\mathscr{O}_x/\mathscr{m}_x$. Part of the proof is as follows: $K(X)$ is a separably generated extension of $K$, i.e., $K(X)$ is a separable algebraic extension of a subfield $L=K(t_1, \cdots, t_d)$, the latter being purely transcendental over $K$. The theorem of the primitive element allows us to find a single generator $t_0$ of the extension $K(X)/L$. Let $f(T_0) \in L[T_0]$ be its minimal polynomial. This defines a rational function $f(T_0, T_1, \cdots, T_d) \in K(T_0, T_1, \cdots, T_d)$, defined on an affine open subset of $\mathbb{A}^{n+1}$, where its set of zeros $Y$ is a hypersurface with function field $K(Y)$ isomorphic to $K(X)$ . Some nonempty open sets in $X$ and $Y$ are isomorphic . The points $y \in Y$ where $\mathrm{dim} \mathscr{T}(Y)_y = \mathrm{dim}Y$ form a dense open subset of $Y$ , so in particular $\mathrm{dim}\mathscr{T}(X)_x = \mathrm{dim}X$ for $x$ in some dense open subset of $X$. There are three statements which I can't understand. Why is $K(Y)$ equal to $K(X)$? Why are there any nonempty isomoarphic open sets in $X$ and $Y$?

Basically what I'm doing is taking a number and using a universe of numbers and I'm trying to figure out how the combos work (I think this is a form of number theory). For example, for a sum of 10 and using a universe of [4, 2, 1], I get (I'm showing how I perceive the breakdown): 2 * 4 +  1 * 2 +  0 * 1 = 4 + 4 + 2
2 * 4 +  0 * 2 +  2 * 1 = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1
1 * 4 +  3 * 2 +  0 * 1 = 4 + 2 + 2 + 2
1 * 4 +  2 * 2 +  2 * 1 = 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1
1 * 4 +  1 * 2 +  4 * 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 * 4 +  0 * 2 +  6 * 1 = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
0 * 4 +  5 * 2 +  0 * 1 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
0 * 4 +  4 * 2 +  2 * 1 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1
0 * 4 +  3 * 2 +  4 * 1 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

0 * 4 +  0 * 2 + 10 * 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 So as the numbers get larger, I am having problems scaling it (if I have a sum of 1000 with 30 variables, it take forever).  So looking at the problem like I have above, I thought I could break down the result based.  So what I do is take the universe list [4,2,1] and go through the list and see how many of the previous numbers takes to make that number.  Here's an example: 2 [[1, 1]]
4 [[2, 2]]
4 [[2, 2]] What that means is 1+1=2, 2+2=4, so I can use that table to break down the first highest result (4+4+2... I look up the table and see that 2 = 1+1 so I replace that, then go back to the first highest result and then lookup the breakdown of the second number, etc.). I'm not sure but I believe this can scale because I can split the calculation and lookups over separate CPU/systems/clusters/etc.. There's probably  many logical flaws, but the one I noticed right now is what if the number is a prime number or doesn't break down into the last highest number?  Say my universe changes from [4,2,1] to [4,3,2,1]... because the highest match is still 4+4+2, the 3 will get missed totally as a solution. So I'm wondering how I can mathematically deal with prime numbers (I have a function to identify them)? Also what is the correct logic if I have numbers that don't divide cleanly into each other? (universe of [6,4,2,1] breaks down also).  In the past I brute forced this (try all until successful) the problem is, if I can't break down the problem into smaller math problems than I can't scale it. I think this can be done because I can scale it (on a small scale :-), but dealing with specific numbers are the problem (prime and I guess numbers that are the opposite of the sum odd or even).

A fisherman catches 8 fish, what is the probability of exactly two of them being trout if at least three of them are not (so they are carp)? I approached this by reducing the sample to 102 (assuming 3 carps), and counting $$\frac{\binom{40}{2} \binom{62}{3}}{\binom{102}{5}}.$$ I thought since 3 carps are already there, we are looking for P that two of the other 5 are trout, and the other 3 are carps. But this was wrong, and the correct answer was $$\frac{\frac{\binom{40}{2} \binom{65}{6}}{\binom{105}{8}}}{\frac{\sum_{x=3}^{8} \binom{40}{8-x} \binom{65}{x}}{\binom{105}{8}}}.$$ This also makes sense, but I don't understand why my original solution was wrong (it over-counted). Problem #2: A box contains 18 tennis balls, 8 new 10 old. 3 balls are picked randomly and played with (so if any of them were new, they become 'old'), and returned to the box. If we pick 3 balls for the second time (after this condition), what is P that they are all new? I broke this down into 4 pieces: P(3 new second round|3 new first round)P(3 new first round) + P(3 new second round|2 new 1 old first round)P(2 new 1 old first round) + P(3 new second round|1 new 2 old first round)P(1 new 2 old first round) + P(3 new second round|3 old first round)(3 old first round). However, I was supposed to used binomials to count this. Instead I had a feeling that I should just multiply probabilities this way: $$\begin{align*}

Can anyone help me visualize what I'm trying to solve? Or how I should begin tackling this (probably simple) problem? Any kind of help will be greatly appreciated. I'll respond as soon as possible. Thank you EDIT: I'm going to start working on this here. I may have figured something out. Maybe set the lighthouse at the origin (0,0,0), and have two vectors <0,1,1... degree..? crap nevermind","['vector-spaces', 'trigonometry']"

67400,About real entire function,"Assume that $f:(a,b) \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$, $x_0 \in (a,b)$ and $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (x-x_0)^n$ for $x \in (a,b)$ and radius of convergence $R$ of this power  series is infinite. (Then $f$ is smooth, $a_n=\frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}$ for $n=0, 1, 2,  \ldots$ and
$\frac{1}{R}=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt[n] {  \frac{  |f^{(n)} (x_0)|} {n!}    }=0$).
Is it true that $ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt[n] {  \frac{\sup_{x \in K}  |f^{(n)} (x)|} {n!}    }=0$ for every compact $K \subset (a,b)$ ? Thanks.",['analysis']

67411,What is the simplest way to represent this situation mathematically?,"Sitting in my room with two large jars full of green tea and black coffee, I suddenly realized that I would not be able to drink the coffee first. That is because I only regularly drink out of one of the jars. Yet I also realized that, without a third jar, I would not be able to move all of the contents of jar 1 into jar 2. As such, it seemed like there was something universal about the fact that, given two full jars, the contents of one cannot be poured into the other without the existence of a third jar. I suddenly found myself wanting a mathematical abstraction that could represent this situation. But I have no idea how a set could be called 'full.' I suppose there is some set-theoretic mathematical structure that can have this property though, right?",['elementary-set-theory']
67431,Intersection points in a one-parameter family of lines,"Given is a one-parameter family of lines, $$L(t) = \{ a(t) + \lambda w(t) : \quad \lambda \in \mathbb{R} \}$$ in which the base point $a$ and the direction vector $w$ vary smoothly with a parameter $t$ (you may assume that $|w| = 1$ and $w' \neq 0$). There is a unique line segment that joins two nearby lines $L(t)$ and $L(t + \Delta t)$ orthogonally. Let $C$ be the center of this line segment. My question: what is the position of $C$ in the limit, when $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$? EDIT : I realize I should have mentioned that the lines are in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and therefore $L(t)$ and $L(t + \Delta t)$ are supposed to be skew lines. Also, the solution $C$ is known to be located at $$ \bar{\lambda} = -\frac{a'(t) \cdot w'(t)}{w'(t) \cdot w'(t)}$$ for a given $t$. I just don't know how to prove this. EDIT 2 : Based on robjohn's answer below, I've got the following: Let $t_1$ and $t_2 = t_1 + \Delta t$ be two nearby values of the parameter $t$, corresponding to two lines $L_1$ and $L_2$. The perpendicular that joins $L_1$ and $L_2$ has the direction $w_1 \times w_2$, and the plane containing $L_2$ and the perpendicular therefore has the normal $$w_2 \times (w_1 \times w_2)$$ which means that, for any point $x$ in the plane, we get $$(x - a_2) \cdot (w_2 \times (w_1 \times w_2)) = 0$$ We need to find the point $a_1 + \bar{\lambda} w_1$ at which $L_1$ intersects this plane, therefore $$(a_1 + \bar{\lambda} w_1 - a_2) \cdot (w_2 \times (w_1 \times w_2)) = 0$$ or $$\bar{\lambda} = \frac{(a_2 - a_1) \cdot (w_2 \times (w_1 \times w_2))}{\Vert   w_1 \times w_2 \Vert^2}$$ This yields $\bar{\lambda}$ for any finite displacement $\Delta t = t_2 - t_1$. For $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$, the expression gets indeterminate (because $w_2 \rightarrow w_1$ implies $w_1 \times w_2 \rightarrow 0$)... I believe I am close, but I don't see how to obtain the correct limit from this.",['differential-geometry']
