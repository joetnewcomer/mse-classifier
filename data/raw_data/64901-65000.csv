757370,Fraction Problem. 3rd grader question got parents thinking,"So our nine year old son comes home from 3rd grade and tells us an amazing thing happened in school today. He was playing a math game with his friend and they got the same score two times in a row! Here was the game: Deck of 32 cards, each card is blank on front side and has a fraction $\frac{1}{N}$ on the backside, i.e. $\{1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}..., \frac{1}{32}\}$ . No fraction is repeated. Two players, cards are shuffled, deck is divided into half for each player. It's like War .  In every round each player plays his top card (random).  Whichever player has a bigger fraction takes both cards and sets them aside. After 16 rounds players count the cards they won. Whoever has more cards wins the game. Our nine year old thought it was amazing that he and his partner both had 16 cards at the end of the game. The question is, using nothing fancier than algebra, what are the odds that both players end up with the same number of cards after one game (16 hands). The more interesting question is how to explain the answer to a 3rd grader!","['normal-distribution', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"
757384,Which properties do still hold for the limit of a sequence of functions?,"I think it would be very useful to have a list of properties that are preserved for the limit of a sequence of functions, and was wondering if you could help me making the list more complete. Let $f_n$ be a sequence of functions on $\mathbb{R}$ which converges (uniformly or only pointwise) to a limiting function $f$. Which properties of $f_n$ still hold for $f$? The easy bits are probably: If convergence is uniform, then -continuity -boundedness -Riemann integrability -analyticity are preserved as $n\to\infty$ (see, for example, https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/intro_analysis_pdf/ch9.pdf and of course http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_convergence ). Do you know others? Are there any properties that are preserved under pointwise convergence? References or (sketches of) proofs would be great, too, if you know any. Thanks for helping with this list! Edit: Jochen pointed out in his answer below that in general differentiability does not need to be preserved when taking the limit. However, if $f_n\to f$ pointwise, and $f_n'\to g$ uniformly, then $f'=g$ (see https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/intro_analysis_pdf/ch9.pdf ). Does this also hold for left- or right-differentiability? If $f_n$ is not differentiable but right-derivatives exist and tend to $g$, is that then the right-derivative of $f$?","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'uniform-convergence', 'functional-analysis']"

757478,"Equivalence of definitions for ""normal extension"" and how to lift isomorphisms to them","Briefly: I want to prove that these two definitions for ""normal extension"" are equivalent: ""$K$ is a splitting field for a collection of polynomials in $F[x]$"" vs. ""Every irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ with a root in $K$ splits completely in $K$"". But I don't have much machinery for working with splitting fields of multiple (much less infinite) polynomials. My proof involved a use of well-ordering and transfinite induction that I'm not that confident about. Is there an easier way to prove this? Less briefly: In our abstract algebra class, we were asked to prove the following theorem: Problem: Let $K$ be a finite extension of $F$. Prove that $K$ is a splitting field over $F$ if
  and only if every irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ that has a root in $K$ splits
  completely in $K[x]$. I tried to prove this without the restriction on finiteness, because clearly I don't have anything better to do with my time. The backward direction was unchanged, but my proof for the forward direction relied on the ability to ""lift"" isomorphisms to arbitrary splitting fields, i.e., Theorem: Let $\sigma : F \to F'$ be an isomorphism, and let $S \subseteq F[x]$ be a collection of polynomials. If $K$ is the splitting field of $S$ over $F$ and $K'$ is the splitting field of $\sigma(S)$ over $F'$, then there is an isomorphism $\tau : K \to K'$ such that $\tau$ restricted to $F$ is exactly $\sigma$. We have already proven that we can do this for the splitting field of a single polynomial, but induction can only get me so far (finite collections). So I tried to use transfinite induction. Here's a rough sketch of my proof (I wrote it out in full on the problem set, so I can fill in any details if need be): By the Axiom of Choice, we can well-order $S = (p_i)_{i \in I}$ by some index set $I$. Let $F_0 = F$, and for each $i \in I$, let $F_i$ be the splitting field of $p_i$ over $\bigcup_{j < i} F_j$. Let $K = \bigcup_{i \in I} K_i$. [Proof that $K$ is a splitting field of $S$ over $F$] Do the same for $F'$. Let $\sigma_0 = \sigma$. For every successor ordinal $i + 1$, let $\sigma_{i + 1} : F_{i+1} \to F'_{i+1}$ be a lift of $\sigma_i$. For every limit ordinal $i$, we have to take an additional step. For all $j < i$, union together all $F_j$ to get $L_i$, and then we can define $\varphi : L_i \to L'_i$ as a 'union' of all the $\sigma_j$. Now, we let $\sigma_i$ be the lift of $\varphi$ to $F_i$ and $F'_i$. Lastly, we union together all the $\sigma_i$ to get a $\tau : K \to K'$, and show it is an isomorphism, and that when restricted to $F$, it is exactly $\sigma$. Here's a diagram I included, but I'm not sure how much that helps. This feels pretty cumbersome, but it also proves many results together (including the existence of algebraic closures!). Is there a cleaner way to prove the theorem? In particular, I'm much more comfortable with Zorn's Lemma than transfinite induction. (I suspect it requires Choice, in one form or another). And if the theorem is still just has hard, is there an easier way to prove the actual problem? The only proofs I've seen seem to take for granted that we can lift isomorphisms to algebraic closures, which seems to be just as hard as what I'm trying to prove.","['alternative-proof', 'extension-field', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

757532,action of symmetry group of cube on pairs of opposite faces.,"I want to solve the following problem from Dummit & Foote's Abstract Algebra: Explain why the action of the group of rigid motions of a cube on the set of three pairs of opposite faces is not faithful. Find the kernel of this action. My attempt: If the action is faithful, we would have an injective group homomorphism $G \to S_A$ where $A$ is the set of three pairs of opposite faces of the cube. That means $|G| \leq |S_A|$, but $|G|=24,|S_A|=6$. Thus this action cannot be faithful. In order to see what elements of $G$ are in the kernel, we list them all explicitly: There are 3 rotations around a line through centres of two opposite faces, each of order 4. There are 4 rotations around a line through opposite vertices, each of order 3. There are 6 rotations around a line through midpoints of opposite edges, each of order 2 Thus we have $3(4-1)+4(3-1)+6(2-1)=23$ nonidentity rotations. If we add the identity we see that we indeed have listed all elements of $G$. It is now geometrically evident that the kernel of the action consists of the squares of rotations in  part $1$, as well as the identity. Is my solution correct? If not, please help me fix it.

What I'm asking is why is it necessary to use the value of x to derive the inequality? Theorem 5.2.7. Let G be a bipartite graph with vertex partition L, R where $|L| \leq |R|$. If G is degree-constrained, then there is a matching that covers L. Proof. The proof is by contradiction. Suppose that G is degree constrained but that
there is no matching that covers L. By Theorem 5.2.5, this means that there must
be a bottleneck $S \subseteq L$.
Let x be a value such that $deg(l) \geq x \geq deg(r)$ for every $l \epsilon L$ and $r \epsilon R$.
Since every edge incident to a node in S is incident to a node in N(S), we know
that
\begin{aligned}
|N(S)|x \geq |S|x
\end{aligned}
and thus that
\begin{aligned}
|N(S)| \geq  |S|
\end{aligned}
This means that S is not a bottleneck, which is a contradiction. Hence G has a
matching that covers L. EDIT: For clarification (hopefully), this theorem builds on the definition of a bottleneck where: \begin{aligned}
G \ is \ the \ bipartite \ graph \ (V,E)
\end{aligned} So the graph is partitioned in to L and R, where: \begin{aligned}
S \subseteq L

N(S) = \{r \ | \ \{s,r\} \ \epsilon \ E \ for \ some \ s \ \epsilon \ S \}

Prove that $\mathcal{P}$ is symmetric with respect to $0$ and that, if $a \in \mathcal{P}$ and $\mathrm{Res}_{a}(f)$ denotes the residue of $f$ at $a$, then $\mathrm{Res}_{-a}(f) = - \mathrm{Res}_{a}(f)$. My try : let $a \in \mathcal{P}$ a pole of $f$ of order $k \in \mathbb{N}^{\ast}$. Since $f$ is even, $f$ is not defined at $-a$ and to prove that $a$ is also a pole of $f$ of order $k$, I need to prove that $(z+a)^{k}f(z)$ has a finite limit when $z \to -a$. It follows from : $$
\begin{align*}
\lim \limits_{z \to -a}(z+a)^{k}f(z) &= {} \lim \limits_{z \to -a}(-1)^{k}(-z-a)^{k}f(-z) \\[2mm]
 &= (-1)^{k}\lim \limits_{z \to a}(z-a)^{k}f(z) \\

$$ And $\displaystyle \lim \limits_{z \to a} (z-a)^{k}f(z)$ exists because $a$ is a pole of order $k$ of $f$. As a consequence, $-a$ is also a pole of $f$. For the residue relation, we can note that if $a$ is a pole of order $k$ of $f$, then : $$ 
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Res}_{-a}(f) &= {} \frac{1}{(k-1)!}\frac{d^{k-1}}{dz^{k-1}} \Big((z+a)^{k}f(z) \Big) \\[2mm]

758121,Recovering congruence conditions from the Hilbert class polynomial for idoneal numbers,"Before I can ask my question, I need to introduce some terminology and background. Statement 1: Let $n$ be one of Euler's 65 convenient numbers . Then we can find congruence conditions such that $$p=x^2+ny^2 \Leftrightarrow c_1, \ldots, c_r \mod{N}$$ See for example this article why this is possible. On a related note: one can even show that for other numbers it is impossible to provide congruence conditions (cf. here , here , and page 19 here ) . Statement 2: The more general case goes as follows. . Statement 3: Finding the HCF for $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-n})$ is difficult. However, when $n$ is one of Euler's 65 convenient numbers then the Hilbert class field of $K$ equals the genus field of $K$ . The genus field can be easily determined as follows: Now, basically what I want to do is the following: Consider cases when the genus field equals the Hilbert class field (i.e. Euler's convenient numbers) Construct a primitive element for the genus field (cf. here ) Next, from the minimal polynomial of the Hilbert class field, I want to recover congruence conditions through quadratic reciprocity. Two worked out examples: The genus field of $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-5})$ is $M=K(\sqrt{5})=K(i)$ . Now, the Hilbert class field equals the genus field, so the minimal polynomial for the primitive element $i$ is $x^2 + 1$ . From the above theorem we get the condition that $$x^2 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod{p}$$ must be solvable. But this just means that $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ . Together with the other condition of the theorem, which says that $-5$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ , we find that: $$p = x^2 + 5y^2 \Leftrightarrow p \equiv 1,9 \mod{20}$$ The genus field of $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-21})$ is $M=K(\sqrt{-3},\sqrt{-7})$ . To calculate the minimal polynomial for the primitive element $\sqrt{-3} + \sqrt{-7}$ , we use Wolfram : $$f(x)=x^4+20x^2+16=(x^2+10)^2-84$$ This polynomial is solvable modulo $p$ if $$y^2 \equiv 84 \mod{p}$$ is solvable, AND $$x^2 \equiv - 10 \mod{p}$$ has a solution. Each condition can, via quadratic reciprocity, be expressed by a congruence, and putting the different congruences together (via the AND operator) gives us again a congruence condition. Problem: The above method seems to break down when we consider more than $2$ elements. (eg. $\sqrt{-3}+\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{-7}$ ). Wolfram does not give a nice ""recursive quadratic"" polynomial. However, I suspect that congruence conditions can be recovered in a similar way.","['algebraic-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'number-theory']"

$$
note these are higher order correlation functions for a Gaussian generating functional.  Also the matrix $A_{ij}=A^\top_{ij}$ (real symmetric) and is also positive definite, thus the eigenvalues of $A_{ij}$ all satisfy $\lambda_i>0$.  Note the generating functional is given by
$$
\mathcal{F}(h)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\bigg({-\sum_{i,j=1}^N\frac{1}{2}x^\top_i A_{ij}x_j}-\sum_{i=1}^Nh_i x_i\bigg)\prod_{i=1}^Ndx_i=\frac{(2\pi)^{N/2}}{\sqrt{\det A_{ij}}}\exp\big( \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^N h_i A^{-1}_{ij}h_j\big)
$$
where I used $\det(A)=\prod_{i=1}^N \lambda_i$. We calculate this by finding the minimum of the quadratic form
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k}\bigg(\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}	\frac{1}{2} x_i A_{ij} x_j-\sum_{i=1}^N  h_i x_i	\bigg)=\sum_{j=1}^{N}  A_{kj}x_j- h_k=0.
$$
In order to solve this we need to introduce the inverse matrix of $A$ given by $A^{-1}$.  Thus we can write the solution as
$$
x_i=\sum_{j=1}^{N} A^{-1}_{ij} h_j.
$$
We can now make a change of variables $x_i \mapsto y_i$ to obtain
$$
x_i=\sum_{j=1}^{N} K^{-1}_{ij}h_j+y_i.
$$
Re-writing $\mathcal{F}(h)$ we obtain
$$
\mathcal{F}(h)=\exp\bigg(\sum_{i,j=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} h_i A^{-1}_{ij} h_j\bigg)\int_{-\infty}^\infty d^Ny \exp\bigg(-\sum_{i,j=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2} y_i A_{ij}y_j				\bigg).
$$
This integral is now a simple gaussian which we diagonalize by an orthogonal transformation $A=O\lambda_i\delta_{ij}O^\top$ and a linear change of variables $x=Oy$.  The Jacobian of the transformation is unity since a rotation leaves the volume invariant.  We write the general result as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}(h)=\big({2\pi}\big)^{N/2} (\det A_{ij})^{-1/2} \exp\left(\sum_{i,j=1}^{N} \frac{1}{2}  h_i A^{-1}_{ij} h_j\right).

Having calculated this, I now need to calculate the expected value of the higher order moments which is what my question is. Note in 1 dimension, the expected value I am trying to calculate is similar to

758485,"Why is $[\widetilde{v},\widetilde{w}]_p(f)=0$ when $f$ has a critical point at $p$?","Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $f$ a smooth function $M\to\mathbb{R}$.  Let $p$ be a critical point of $f$.  We define the Hessian of $f$ at $p$ to be the symmetric bilinear functional $f_{**}$ on $T_p M$ given by $f_{**}(v,w)=\widetilde{v}_p(\widetilde{w}(f))$ where $\widetilde{v}$ and $\widetilde{w}$ are extensions of $v$ and $w$ to vector fields on $M$.  It must be checked that $f_{**}$ is symmetric and well defined. Milnor states that $f_{**}$ is symmetric because $\widetilde{v}_p(\widetilde{w}(f)) - \widetilde{w}_p(\widetilde{v}(f)) = [\widetilde{v},\widetilde{w}]_p(f)$ where $[\widetilde{v},\widetilde{w}]$ denotes the Poisson bracket, which he says satisfies $[\widetilde{v},\widetilde{w}]_p(f)=0$ because $f$ has a critical point at $p$.  Thus since $\widetilde{v}_p(\widetilde{w}(f))$ is independent of the extension of $v$ and $\widetilde{w}_p(\widetilde{v}(f))$ is independent of the extension of $w$ we have that $f_{**}$ is well defined and symmetric by the preceding. My confusion is why $[\widetilde{v},\widetilde{w}]_p(f)=0$.  I'm not familiar with Poisson bracket but this looks like the Lie bracket to me, not the Poisson bracket.

758511,Calculate depth using triginometry,"I was asked a question like this on an exam today and I'm wondering if I got it right or not. A boat is laying a pipe on the ocean floor using two cables. The angle of depression for one of the cables is $38^\circ$ degrees and the other is $44^\circ$. The length of the pipe is $118$ meters. What is the depth from the bottom of the boat to the pipe? Here's a picture to visual the situation (please  assume the bottom of the boat is flat) This is what I did: Using the alternate interior angles rule I was able to assume that the two angles of elevation were also $44^{\circ}$ and $38^{\circ}$. The top angle would be $98^{\circ}$.: Then using sine, I was able find out the hypotenuse for one of the outside triangles (in this case I used the one on the left). $$\frac{118}{\sin{98^\circ}} = \frac{x}{\sin{38^\circ}}$$
$$x\sin{98^\circ} = 118 \times\sin{38^\circ}$$
$$\frac{x\sin{98^\circ}}{\sin{98^\circ}} = \frac{118 \times\sin{38^\circ}}{\sin{98^\circ}}$$
$$ x \approx 73.36 $$ Then, I was able to come up with another triangle which has a hypotenuse of $73.36$ meters. The other angle is $46^\circ$ because $90^\circ-44^\circ = 46^\circ$ Then using SOHCAHTOA (because its a right angle triangle) I was able to solve $x$ (which represents the depth) using Sine. Like so: $$\sin{44^\circ} = \frac{x}{73.36}$$
$$x = \sin{44^\circ} \times 73.36$$
$$x \approx 50$$ The answer I got on the test was more like $80$ meters, but that's probably because I forgot what the angles and measurements exactly were on the exam. Is this the right approach or am I totally off course?","['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'algebra-precalculus']"

If $c \in C$ is $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, or an endpoint of an interval deleted in the Cantor set, let $X_{c} = \{ (x,y) \in L(c) : y \in \mathbb{Q} \}$.

I've found several references to the fact that Cantor's Teepee is totally disconnected, but I cannot quite prove it. It was brought to my attention in the comments that I had taken the wrong definition for totally disconnected when first working on this problem, as demonstrated in the following example. The property I had been attempting to prove was totally separated , which lead to the quandary I was experiencing below. In particular, I cannot seem to separate two points that belong to the
  same $X_c$. For concreteness: What are two separated open sets $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ and $B$ witness the disconnectedness of Cantor's Teepee, $(0,0) \in A$, and $(\tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{1}{4}) \in B$? Notice $(0,0), (\tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{1}{4}) \in X_0$. Presumably the

758633,A conjecture relating Multiple Zeta Values and the Polya Enumeration Theorem,"Let me state my motivation. I believe that the Polya Enumeration Theorem and Multiple Zeta Values (the classic  being the  Basel problem and  the values of  the Riemann
zeta  function at  the even  integers) are  among the  most intriguing
objects in mathematics. With this message I present  a conjecture that connects these two (PET
and MZVs).  Most likely there  is a proof somewhere in the literature,
which I invite  readers to submit in text form if  it admits a compact
presentation or as a reference if it does not. To understand this  conjecture you need to learn  about multiset cycle
indices , which I presented in a different context at this MSE link . Multisets and their  cycle indices form a combinatorial  species like  any other,
e.g.  cycles, sequences  and sets.  They represent  multisets  and are
identified by the partition  that corresponds to the multiplicities of
the  elements  of  the  multiset,  e.g.  $\mathfrak{M}_{1,2,3}$  is  a
multiset that contains three elements,  one of which in two copies and
another in three.  Substitution of an OGF into  a multiset cycle index
yields the generating function of the multiset. There   is  a   special  multiset   cycle  index   which   is  written
$\mathfrak{M}_{1,1,1,\ldots,1}$  which gives  the  multiset where  all
elements are  unique, i.e. the species  of sets. This  cycle index has
been known for quite some time and is used to compute the set operator
$\mathfrak{P}.$  The   cycle  index  $Z(P_n)$  of   the  set  operator
$\mathfrak{P}_{=n}$ is  the difference between the cycle  index $Z(A_n)$ of
the alternating  group and the  cycle index $Z(S_n)$ of  the symmetric
group on $n$ elements. It admits the following simple recursive definition: $$Z(P_0) = 1 \quad\text{and}\quad
Z(P_n) = \frac{1}{n}
\sum_{l=1}^n (-1)^{l+1} a_l Z(P_{n-l}).$$ Here are the cycle indices $Z(P_3), Z(P_4)$ and $Z(P_5):$
$$\begin{array}{|l|l|}
\hline
Z(P_3) &
\frac{1}{6}\,{a_{{1}}}^{3}-1/2\,a_{{2}}a_{{1}}+1/3\,a_{{3}}\\
\hline
Z(P_4) &
\frac{1}{24}\,{a_{{1}}}^{4}-1/4\,a_{{2}}{a_{{1}}}^{2}
+1/3\,a_{{3}}a_{{1}}+1/8\,{a_{{2}}}^{2}-1/4\,a_{{
4}}\\
\hline
Z(P_5) &
{\frac {1}{120}}\,{a_{{1}}}^{5}-\frac{1}{12}\,a_{{2}}{a_{{1}}}^{3}
+1/6\,a_{{3}}{a_{{1}}}^{2}+1/8\,a_{{
1}}{a_{{2}}}^{2}-1/4\,a_{{4}}a_{{1}}
-1/6\,a_{{2}}a_{{3}}+1/5\,a_{{5}}\\
\hline\end{array}$$ With these definitions we are  now ready to state the conjecture which
is quite simply that
$$\large \color{blue}{\zeta(s, s, s, \ldots, s) = 
Z(P_n)(\zeta(s), \zeta(2s), \ldots, \zeta(ns))}$$
i.e.   the MZV  of a  unique argument  $s$ repeated  $n$ times  is equal to the
substituted  cycle  index  $Z(P_n)$  of the set operator $\mathfrak{P}_{=n}$ according  to  the  rule  $a_l  =
\zeta(ls).$ Note that the case $n=3$ is  found on the Wikipedia page for MZVs that
I linked to in the introduction. Example. The conjecture says e.g. that
$$\zeta(5,5,5,5) =
1/24\,  \zeta \left( 5 \right) ^{4}-1/4\,\zeta \left( 10 \right)
 \zeta \left( 5 \right)  ^{2}+1/3\,\zeta \left( 15 \right) \zeta
 \left( 5 \right) +1/8\,  \zeta \left( 10 \right) ^{2}-1/4\,\zeta
 \left( 20 \right).$$ Important observation. The reader may well  ponder the statement
of the conjecture and say  that there is nothing to  prove here, which I  will accept as
proof, if accompanied by a brief explanation why this should be so. Addendum. An interesting application of the above result is found at this MSE link .","['riemann-zeta', 'reference-request', 'combinatorics']"

First we prove $A$ is a partial ordered set. Reflexitivity: It is easy to see that $a \mid a$ where $a \in A$ therefore the divides relation is reflexive on $A$. Anti-Symmetric: If $a \mid a^{*} \wedge a* \mid a \implies a=a$ where $a,a^{*} \in A$. This is true since $a=a^{*}k_1$ and $a^{*}=ak_2$ then $a=ak_1k_2 \implies k_1=k_2=1 \wedge a=a$ Therefore the divides relation is anti-symmetric on $A$ Transitivity: If $(a\mid b\; \wedge b \mid c) \implies a \mid c$ where $a,b,c \in A$ We have by the definition of divisibility $b=ak_1$ and $c=bk_2$ By substitution we get $c=ak_1k_2 \implies a \mid c$ Therefore the divides relation is Transitive on $A$\ \ Lastly we need to show that for any two elements $a,b \in A$ either $a \mid b$ or $b \mid a$ This is true by the definition of divisibility assuming that $a \neq b$ Therefore we conclude that the ""divides"" relation is a total order on $A$.

$$[\gcd(6,15),\gcd(9,15)]=[3,3]=3$$
so
$$\gcd([6,9],15)=\gcd(18,15)=[\gcd(6,15),\gcd(9,15)]$$
so this such condition. But for general I think is true.But I can't prove it.",['number-theory']
758993,Trig identity question,"Show that $\sin(2nx)=\sin((2n+1)x)\cos(x)-\cos((2n+1)x)\sin(x)$. I have the mark scheme in front of me, but it doesn't make sense to me... $$\sin((2n+1)x)\cos(x)-\cos((2n+1)x)\sin(x)=\sin((2n+1)x)-x=\sin(2nx)$$ Initially, I would think that it would be a double angle identity so $\sin2\theta=2\sin\theta \cos\theta$, where $\theta$ here is $nx$ but that doesn't seem to be it. How does the cosine disappear from the solution in the mark scheme? If someone could explain every step, I'd really appreciate it.","['trigonometry', 'algebra-precalculus']"

759101,Finding a tangent to an ellipse parallel to a given line,"Problem: Find the lines that are tangent to the ellipse $x^2 + 4y^2 = 8$ and parallel to $x +2y = 6$. I tried to find the derivative of $x^2 + 4y^2 = 8$ and I got: $$\frac{dx}{dy} = -\frac{x}{2y}.$$
Not quite sure if it's right, but I tried to equate it with the slope of $x +2y = 6$, which is $-\frac{1}{2}$. So I get, $$-\frac{1}{2} = -\frac{x}{2y}$$ 
Now, I'm stuck and I don't know what to do. How do I get the tangent lines? I have no knowledge of any point of that tangent line, only the slope. I appreciate any help. Thanks.","['calculus', 'derivatives']"
759131,Ordinal addition is associative,"We've been asked to teach ourselves a unit on ordinals for our final exam tomorrow, I grasp how to prove that certain ordinals are distinct but I am having trouble figuring out a proof to show ordinal addition is associative. All the proofs I have found online use methods that we have not covered yet. Would someone be able to guide me through a proof of associativity for ordinal addition? Here's a general overview of what I know: Two ordinals are equal if they are order isomorphic. Ordinal addition for two well ordered sets $a=ord(A, <_A) b=ord(B, <_B)$ then$ a+b=ord(AUB, <_+) $ where $x <_+ y$ if either x, y are in A and $x<_A y$, or x, y are in B and $x<_B y$, or x is in A and y is in B Thank you so much","['ordinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"

(2 answers) Closed 10 years ago . Let G be a group and let p be a prime. Let g and h be elements of G with order p. I am wondering how I can use group theory to find the possible orders of the intersection between $\def\subgroup#1{\langle#1\rangle}\subgroup g$ and $\subgroup h$ and also to prove that the number of elements of order $p$ in $G$ is a multiple of $p-1$. I've been looking for the path for ages and got nothing really. These are presented as typical applications to group theory and I'm not at ease with the subject so I'd like to see how you think on this example (in order to get a better idea). Can you hint me?

759190,"Partial differentiability with respect to $x$ and $y$ of $\int_0^x z(s,y)ds$ where $\partial_y z \in C^0$","I have the following (not accredited and not mandatory) Exercise: Problem : Let $z : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous and in respect to its second variable partially differentiable. Define  $$f: \begin{cases} \mathbb{R}^2 & \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \\ (x,y) & \longmapsto \displaystyle \int_0^x z(s,y)ds \end{cases} $$ and show that $f$ is differentiable in respect to $x$ and $y$ I believe I have done 'most of the work' already and confuse myself now in an unnecessary way which is most likely due that this is only my third week in multivariable Calculus and we did not have any helpful theorems yet that I can apply. Sketch (succeeded, wrt $y$) : I will only provide a rough sketch of what I did considering partially differentiating $f$ in respect to $y$, because it might be helpful to do the same with respect to $x$ which is where I am stuck. 1) Defined rectangle $R= \lbrace (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid a \leq x \leq b, \ c \leq y \leq d \rbrace \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ 2) Defined mapping $F: [c,d] \to \mathbb{R}, \ y \mapsto \int_0^x z(s,y)ds$ and guessed $F'(y)= \int_0^x \partial_y z(s,y)ds$ 3) Computed $ \left|F(y_0+h)-F(y_0)-\left(\int_0^x \partial_yz(s,y)ds\right)h\right|$, which I managed to show is $\leq |h|\epsilon x$ by applying the triangle equality and the mean value theorem, namely $\partial_y z(s, \gamma)h = z(s,y_0+h)-z(s,y_0)$ for $\gamma \in (y_0,y_0+h)$ Since this worked out rather nicely I thought I might as well choose the same approach to show that $f$ can be differentiated in respect to $x$, but here I struggle My approach (wrt $x$) : First I defined $$G: \begin{cases}[a,b] & \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \\ x & \longmapsto \displaystyle \int_0^x z(s,y)ds\end{cases} $$
And my problem now clearly is that although I can guess that $G'(x)=z(x,y)-z(0,y)$ it won't help me applying the definition as above to verify this because I obtain $$ G(x_0+h)-G(x_0)-(z(x,y)-z(0,y))h=\int_0^{x_0+h}z(s,y)ds-\int_0^{x_0}z(s,y)ds-z(x,y)h+z(0,y)h \\ =\int_{x_0}^{x_0+h}z(s,y)ds-h(z(x,y)-z(0,y)) $$
which is a rather useless expression. Update : I don't understand how I could implement the fundamental theorem of Calculus into this problem because even if I hold $y$ is constant, I am dealing with  a function that I could differentiate the way as described above, for constant $y$ it would be $G'(x)=z(x,y)$. But if that is the correct derivative, shouldn't I be able to verify it using the definition of a derivative in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ?","['multivariable-calculus', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"
