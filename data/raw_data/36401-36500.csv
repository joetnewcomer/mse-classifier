350687,What is the area of a pixellated surface?,"Recently after playing hours of Minecraft (and generating block volumes), a question popped up in my head: Is it possible to easily (by hand in a reasonable amount of time) determine the surface area of an arbitrary function? For instance, if you were to take the function $y=x^2$, and move it onto a graph with discrete coordinate values (with non-integer function values being rounded accordingly - something like $\text{Int}(y)=x^2$ for $[\text{Int}(a),\text{Int}(b)]$ ? Extending that further, like here would it be possible to find the volume of some equation or solid of revolution and in addition the surface area? In other words, could you calculate the area of a function using the rectangle method with midpoint approximation and equal width rectangles? If these are not possible, can one find some sort of approximation of this area/volume more accurate than that of the integral it seems to represent?
Thanks.","['algebraic-geometry', 'discrete-mathematics']"

350803,Absolute Continuity of Finite Borel Measure Characterized by Orthonormal Basis,"I've been working through Fundamentals of Stochastic Filtering (Bain, Crisan) and am a little perplexed by the following (initially) seemingly straightforward exercise and its given solution. We are given a certain finite Borel measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and we wish to determine whether or not it is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. The exercise purports the following: Let $\{\varphi_i\} _{i>0}$ be an orthonormal basis of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d$ ) with the property that $\varphi_i$ is continuous and bounded for all $i$ . Let $\mu$ be a finite measure. If $$\sum_{i=1}^\infty \, \mu(\varphi_i)^2 <\infty $$ then $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. Moreover, if $g_\mu$ is the density of $\mu$ with respect to Lebesgue measure, then $g_\mu \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ . The solution in the book goes as follows: we construct a density function, use it to define a new measure (which is necessarily absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure) and then show that this new measure is indeed the one we were given. Defining our density function $\bar{g_\mu} = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \, \mu(\varphi_i) \varphi_i$ , it is easy to see that this is in $L^2$ . Defining $\bar{\mu}$ to be the finite measure given rise to by this density, we see that $\bar{\mu}(\varphi_i) = \mu(\varphi_i)$ for all i. All well so good. The problem is showing that our wavelet basis $\{\varphi_i\}_{i>0}$ is a separating set of functions with respect to Borel measures on $\mathbb{R^d}$ , which would show that $\bar{\mu} = \mu$ . The book simply says: [...] via an approximation argument $\bar{\mu}(A) = \mu(A) $ for any ball A of arbitrary center and radius. Hence $\bar{\mu} = \mu$ . The issue I have here is making this approximation argument or any similar one work. The most obvious idea is to show that $ \bar{\mu}(f) =\mu(f)$ for any continuous bounded function $f$ . If we approximate naively $f$ in $L^2$ by functions in the span of our wavelet basis, this will also approximate the left hand side since we have absolute continuity between Lebesgue measure and $\bar{\mu}$ . However, the same cannot be said a priori about the right hand side. I note that the proposition supposed continuity of the wavelet functions, but this was never explicitly referred to in the proof. In fact, continuity must be necessary here, because it's easy to construct a counter example to this if the wavelets are allowed to be discontinuous (take $\mu$ to be Dirac measure at the origin, with any wavelet basis whose basis functions are modified to be zero at the origin). Being able to approximate in $L^2$ alone is clearly not strong enough - we need some uniform or uniform-like strength. Unfortunately though I can't think of any specific properties (such as their span forming an algebra) of general wavelets that would let us infer this. As I type this, it occurs to me that for the way this result is applied in the book, it is enough for it to hold for one particular choice of basis. Using finiteness of $\mu$ , it would be enough to exhibit existence of a wavelet basis that can uniformly approximate any given continuous $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ (or on any given compact interval/cube). I guess we could use truncated trigonometric base functions (truncation in the sense of domain) - allowing for uniform convergence on $...,[-1,0],[0,1],[1,2],...$ simultaneously (similarly for $\mathbb{R}^d$ . Now the wavelets are only piecewise continuous, but this is probably not a problem). For the time being I'll likely go with this makeshift approach, so I hope I haven't made any mistakes in my reasoning. For general continuous wavelets, is the original proposition true, I wonder. EDIT: It turns out that my above makeshift approach isn't going to work for proving the main result since I need the wavelets to have bounded partial derivatives up to second order.","['wavelets', 'measure-theory', 'hilbert-spaces']"

350898,Compactness of the complex points of a $\mathbb{C}$-variety,"Let $X$ be a $\mathbb{C}$-variety and let $X_{cx}$ denote the topological space formed by its $\mathbb{C}$-points with the complex topology (i.e. the associated analytic space). If $X$ is projective, then $X_{cx}$ is a compact topological space. I was thinking about the converse and found a GAGA-cite that $X_{cx}$ is compact iff $X$ is proper. This was not what I expected: If you draw for example the real points of the variety defined by $X^2+Y^2+Z^2=1$, you get a $2$-sphere which is nice and compact. I can think about $\mathbb{C}$-points honestly only for curves since $\mathbb{R}^{\geq 4}$ is beyond of what I can imagine as a whole (and compactness is not a local property). Therefore, if the GAGA-cited theorem is true, there must be a big difference in relation to compactness between the real and the complex picture. Why are there no non-trivial affine $X$ with $X_{cx}$ compact (a proper affine morphism is finite) and where is (morally) the difference to the real picture?","['algebraic-geometry', 'projective-schemes']"

Let $Z$ be a ruled surface with $h^1(Z, \mathcal{O}_Z) = q(Z) > 0$, and consider its Albanese map:

The curve $C$ is is smooth and of genus $q(Z)$ (Beauville V.15). Now it is stated in the mentioned paper (proof of 3.2) that the generic fibre is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1$. My question is, why? It seems like magic to me. My thoughts so far: It seems very likely that it has to do with $Z$ being birational to the surface $D \times \mathbb{P}^1$, where $D$ is a smooth curve of genus $q(Z)$. I have tried to use generic smoothness in characteristic zero (Hartshorne 10.7) so that at least the fibres of $\alpha$ are smooth curves, but this did not bring me anywhere.

Hope: Is it in general true that if $Z$ is ruled and there is a surjective map $Z \rightarrow C$ to a smooth curve of genus $q(Z)$, the general fibre of this map is $\mathbb{P}^1$?

While reading Vakil's notes I wondered how could we define poles of such a rational function. After some thought I came up with the following definition: I'd  say that a regular codimension one point $p$ is a pole if it's not in the domain of definition of $f$. If $X$ is also an integral scheme (or at least if all the stalks of $\mathcal{O}_X$ are integral domains, in which case we can cover $X$ with integral schemes), then this definition would coincide with the usual one, namely using the discrete valuation at $p$. But there is something unnatural about my definition, since I was not able to relate the rational function with the discrete valuation on $\mathcal{O}_{X,p}$ and consequently was not able to determine the order of the pole.

I was wondering about the converse - when can two linear operators acting on a finite-dimensional vector space (over an algebraically closed field) be simultaneously Jordanized? Unlike the case of simultaneous diagonalization, I don't think commutativity is forced on the transformations in this case, and I'm interested in other natural conditions which guarantee that this is possible. EDIT: as Georges pointed out, the statements that two commuting matrices are simultaneously Jordanizable is in fact wrong. Nevertheless, I am still interested in interesting conditions on a pair of operators which ensures a simultaneous Jordanization (of course, there are some obvious sufficient conditions, i.e. that the two matrices are actually diagonalizable and commute, but this is not very appealing...)","['jordan-normal-form', 'linear-transformations', 'linear-algebra']"

The short description of why I'm asking this question is in there in case anyone is interested/has something to say about it (e.g., that I'm going wrong somewhere). Thank you very much in advanced. Is it possible to modify Theorem 3 such that the premise reads ""Suppose $E$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $f$ maps $E$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$, $f$ is differentiable at $x\in E$, $g$ maps (1) containing $f(E)$ into $\mathbb{R}^k$, and $g$ is (2) at $f(x)$"" and the conclusion reads ""$F(x)=g(f(x))$ is differentiable at $x$ and $F'(x)=(3)f'(x).$"" where (1) = the non-negative orthant of $\mathbb{R}^n$, that is $\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:x_i\geq 0,\quad i=1,2,\dots,n\}$ (or some type of set that encompasses the non-negative orthant, for example, closed, convex, etc.). (2) = some criterion analogous to differentiable but that can be defined functions that are not defined on open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (see Definition 1). (3) = some function evaluated at $f(x)$ analogous to the derivative $g'$ (see Definition 1) of $g$ evaluated at the point $f(x)$. If so, What are (1), (2), and (3)? Does there exists some theorems analogous to Theorem 1 and 2 that provide us with an easy way to test for (2) and compute (3)? Otherwise how does one check for (2) and computes (3)? Alternatively, if there is a reason one cannot do the above, what is it? Motivation I'm looking at initial value problems of the type $$\dot{x}=f(x),\quad\quad x(0)=x_0$$ where $x_0$ is in the non-negative orthant of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:x_i\geq 0,\quad i=1,2,\dots,n\}$ and $f$ maps from the non-negative orthant to $\mathbb{R}^n$. I'm looking at the above because I'm would like to be able to evaluate the time derivative of a Lyapunov function $V$ which is only defined on the non-negative orthant much in the same fashion one usually does, by using the chain rule: $$\dot{V}(x(t))=\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}(x(t))\dot{x}(t).$$ Background If $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$, let $|x|$ denote the euclidean norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$ evaluated at $x$. Definition 1 (Differentiable): Suppose $E$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $f$ is a function that maps $E$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$, and $x\in E$. If there exists a linear transformation $A$ from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ such that $$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{|f(x+h)-f(x)-Ah|}{|h|}=0$$ then we say that $f$ is differentiable at $x$, and we write $$f'(x)=A.$$ If $f$ is differentiable at every $x\in E$ we say that $f$ is differentiable in $E$. In the above, it was implicitly assumed that $h\in\mathbb{R}^n$. Since $E$ is open, if $|h|$ is small enough then $x+h\in E$, thus the above limit makes sense. If we know a priori that $f$ is differentiable at a point $x$, then we can use the following handy theorem to find $f'(x)$. Theorem 1: Suppose $f$ maps an open set $E\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$ and $f$ is differentiable at a point $x\in E$. Then the partial derivatives $$\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}(x) := \lim_{t\rightarrow0}\frac{f_i(x+te_j)-f_i(x)}{t},$$ where $e_j$ denotes the $j^{th}$ vector of the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$, exist. Furthermore, using the standard bases of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$, $$f'(x)=\left[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x)\right],$$ where the RHS denotes the matrix whose $i,j$ entry is given by the partial derivative defined above. However, to be able to use the above we first need to be able to conclude that $f$ is differentiable. If $f$ is continuously differentiable we can also use the partial derivatives to this end. Definition 2 (Continuously differentiable): We say that a differentiable function $f$ that maps from an open subset $E\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$ is continuously differentiable if $f'$ is a continuous mapping of $E$ into the set of linear functions that map from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$, $L(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^m)$ (for example, defining continuity using some induced matrix norm to define a metric on $L(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^m))$. Theorem 2: Suppose that $f$ maps an open set $E\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$. If $f$ is continuously differentiable if and only if all the partial derivatives of $f$ exist and are on continuous on $E$. One final result, the chain rule: Theorem 3: Suppose $E$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $f$ maps $E$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$, $f$ is differentiable at $x\in E$, $g$ maps an open set containing $f(E)$ into $\mathbb{R}^k$, and $g$ is differentiable at $f(x)$. Then the mapping of $E$ into $\mathbb{R}^k$ defined by $$F(x)=g(f(x))$$ is differentiable at $x$ and $$F'(x)=g'(f(x))f'(x).$$","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

First learn General Topology, and you'll understand Differential Geometry even better!"" and I agree with that, but my point is: I'm a student of Physics, however I like to do everything with rigorous math, and of course I have special interested in math made with rigour like Spivak does, however, in the course of Physics we don't have General Topology and in the moment because of some things I'm studying I'm needing Differential Geometry, so I don't have time at the moment for General Topology. Of course I'm interested in General Topology and of course in the future I'll study it, revisit Differential Geometry and make it more general, but for now I'm looking for some place which teaches without this. I'm looking for some treatment of differential geometry that defines manifolds without resorting to topological spaces and that gives good examples of constructing atlases. Today my background is: basic set theory, single and multivariable calculus, ordinary differential equations, linear and multilinear algebra, a little bit of abstract algebra and also the basic topology of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Also I know the construction of vectors as derivations in euclidean spaces, as well as the definitions of tangent and cotangent spaces in the euclidean space. Is there some book that teaches differential geometry (starting from the definition of manifold) in a way that it's suitable for someone who has this background? Thanks for your help, and sorry if this question is silly, or if it's not suitable here.","['soft-question', 'reference-request', 'differential-geometry']"

So far, I've proved that this function (unlike the Thomae's function) is differentiable in $x=0$. And I expect it to be non-differentiable in $\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$ (my guess is largely based the Proposition 4.1 , yet the general proof from the paper is too advanced for me).

351581,Equivalences and isomorphisms of short exact sequences,"In case it's necessary, I'm working in the category $\mathbf{Ab}$ of abelian groups. My question concerns what I find to be a strange way of viewing the elements of the Ext group $\mbox{Ext}(A,B)$ of the abelian groups $A$ and $B$. The statement of my question is at the end of this post but first two definitions and some notation. A morphism $\varphi\colon E\rightarrow E'$ of short exact sequences $$E=0\rightarrow B\rightarrow G\rightarrow A\rightarrow 0$$ and $$E'=0\rightarrow B'\rightarrow G'\rightarrow A'\rightarrow 0$$ of abelian groups is a triple $\varphi=(b,g,a)$ of group homomorphisms $b\colon B\rightarrow B'$, $g\colon G\rightarrow G'$ and $a\colon A\rightarrow A'$ making the obvious diagram commute. So, $\varphi$ is an isomorphism precisely when $b, g$ and $a$ are isomorphisms. We say that the SESs (short exact sequences) $E$ and $E'$ are equivalent if $B=B'$, $A=A'$ and there exists a SES morphism $(b,g,a)=\varphi\colon E\rightarrow E'$ with $b=\mbox{Id}_B$ and $a=\mbox{Id}_A$. By the short five-lemma, if $\varphi$ is an equivalence of SESs, then it is a SES isomorphism. Wikipedia says that the classes of equivalent SESs with fixed $A$ and $B$ are in one to one correspondence with the elements of the Ext group $\mbox{Ext}(A,B)$. However, one would have guessed that it would be more natural to view the elements of $\mbox{Ext}(A,B)$ as classes of isomorphic SESs with $A$ and $B$ fixed. My question is, are these actually equivalent ways of viewing the elements of the Ext group? More precisely, if $E$ and $E'$ are short exact sequences of abelian groups with $A=A'$ and $B=B'$, is it true that if $E$ is isomorphic to $E'$ then $E$ is equivalent to $E'$? (If this is true, does it then hold in any exact category?)","['abelian-groups', 'homological-algebra', 'category-theory', 'exact-sequence', 'group-theory']"

These spaces are the diffeomorphic to the fibers of Brieskorn-Pham Manifolds $\Sigma(a_0, \dots, a_n)$. I'd like to understand related spaces defined by a single monomial in several variables. Consider the locus of points $V_n = \{ (z_0, \dots, z_n) \in \mathbb{C} \, | \, z_0 \cdots z_n = 1 \}$. Since $z_k = (z_1 \cdots \hat{z}_{k} \cdots z_n)^{-1}$ for $0 \leqslant k \leqslant n$, then $V_{n}$ is diffeomorphic to the product space $(\mathbb{C}^{\times})^{n}$, which has the homotopy type of a torus $\mathbb{T}^{n} = (S^{1})^{n}$, that is, $V_{n} \simeq \mathbb{T}^{n}$. Similarly, consider the locus of points $V_{n,m}  = \{ (z_0, \dots, z_n) \in \mathbb{C} \, | \, (z_0 \cdots z_n)^{m} = 1 \}$ Since there are $m$ $m^{\text{th}}$-roots of unity, one can show that $V_{n,m}$ is diffeomorphic to the $m$-fold disjoint union of $V_{n} \cong (\mathbb{C}^{\times})^{n} \simeq \mathbb{T}^{n}$, that is, $V_{n,m} \simeq \bigsqcup_{i = 1}^{m} \mathbb{T}^{n}$. I suspect the homotopy type of the locus $V_{n, (k_0, \dots, k_n)} = \{ (z_0, \dots, z_n) \in \mathbb{C} \, | \, z_0^{k_0} \cdots z_n^{k_n} = 1 \}$ for arbitrary $k_0, \dots, k_n \in \mathbb{N}$ is the $d = \gcd(k_1, \dots, k_n)$-fold disjoint union of that of the reduced locus $V_{n, (k_0/d, \dots, k_n/d)} = \{ (z_0, \dots, z_n) \in \mathbb{C} \, | \, z_0^{k_0/d} \cdots z_n^{k_n/d} = 1 \}$, so it suffices to consider those spaces where $\gcd(k_0, \dots, k_n) = 1$.

My knowledge: $A^{\circ}$ is the interior $A^{\circ}\subseteq A \subseteq \overline{A}\subseteq X$ My proof was as follows: To show $\partial A = \overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ}$ is closed, we have to show that the complement $( \partial A) ^C = X\setminus{}\partial A =X \setminus (\overline{A} \setminus A^{\circ})$ is open in $X$. This is the set $A^{\circ}\cup X \setminus(\overline{A})$ Then I claim that $A^{\circ}$ is open by definion ($a\in A^{\circ} \implies  \exists \epsilon>0: B_\epsilon(a)\subseteq A$. As this is true for all $a$, by definition of open sets, $A^{\circ}$ is open. My next claim is that $X \setminus \overline{A}$ is open. This is true because the complement is $\overline{A}$ is closed in $X$, hence $X \setminus \overline{A}$ is open in $X$. My concluding claims are: We have a union of two open sets in $X$, By a proposition in my textbook, this set is open in $X$. Therefore the complement of that set is closed, which is we had to show.

I will outline my proof below.  I think it has some holes.  My approach to the problem was to say that the following equations must have real solution(s) if the above equation has solution(s): $$
\cos^2(\sin x)=\sin^2(\cos x)\\
1-\cos^2(\sin x)=1-\sin^2(\cos x)\\
\sin^2(\sin x)=\cos^2(\cos x)\\
\sin(\sin x)=\pm\cos(\cos x)\\
$$ I then proceeded to split into cases and use the identity $\cos t = \sin(\frac{\pi}{2} \pm t\pm y2\pi)$ to get $$
\sin x=\frac{\pi}{2} \pm \cos x\pm y2\pi\\
$$ and the identity $-\cos t = \sin(-\frac{\pi}{2}\pm t\pm y2\pi) $ to get $$
\sin x=- \frac{\pi}{2}\pm \cos x \pm y2\pi.\\
$$ where $y$ is any integer.  I argued that $y=0$ was the only value of $y$ that made any sense (since the values of sine and cosine remain between $-1$ and $1$).  Therefore, the above equations become $$
\sin x=\frac{\pi}{2} \pm \cos x\implies \sin x \pm \cos x=\frac{\pi}{2}\\
$$ and $$
\sin x=- \frac{\pi}{2}\pm \cos x\implies \cos x\pm\sin x= \frac{\pi}{2}.\\
$$ Then, by a short optimization argument, I showed that these last two equations have no real solutions. First, does this proof make sense?
