304928,How do you calculate IQR (interquartile range)?,"I have the following data (ordered): $$0,	1,	1,	2,	3,	4,	4,	7,	9,	23.$$ As far as I know, $Q_1 \text{(median of the upper half)} = 1$;
$Q_3 \text{(median of the lower half)} = 7$;
Therefore, $\text{IQR} = Q_3-Q_1 = 6$. But when I boxplot this simple data in 'R', the summary says that, $Q_1 = 1.25$, $Q_3 = 6.25$, and consequently, $\text{IQR} = 6.25-1.25 = 5$!! How is that?

304958,Surface integral of Poynting vector for time-invariant E & B fields,"I've got this question from electrodynamics, but I have a feeling that this is probably purely a maths question. I'm using standard terminology, but for folks not into electrodynamics here is the background: Consider fields $\rho \left( \vec{r} \right)$, $\vec{J} \left( \vec{r} \right)$, $\vec{E} \left( \vec{r} \right)$ and $\vec{B} \left( \vec{r} \right)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Take any finite volume $V_s$ outside of which $\vec{J}\left(\vec{r}\right)$ and $\rho\left(\vec{r}\right)$ are $0$. Then define $\vec{E}\left(\vec{r}\right) $ and $\vec{B}\left(\vec{r}\right) $ for any $\vec{r}$ as follows: $$
\vec{E} \left( \vec{r} \right) = 
   \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}
      \iiint_{V_s} 
          \frac{\rho\left(\vec{r}_s\right)}{\left|\vec{r}-\vec{r}_s\right|^3} 
          \left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}_s\right)

$$
\vec{B} \left( \vec{r} \right) = 
   \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}

304961,Can the distance from the vertices of a square of integer width to an inscribed circle all be integer?,"I'm looking for solutions to the following British Mathematical Olympiad question: Suppose that $ABCD$ is a square and that $P$ is a point which is on the circle inscribed in the square. Determine whether or not it is possible that $PA$, $PB$, $PC$, $PD$ and $AB$ are all integers. I first assumed that $AB=2$, Therefore, the radius of our circle $r=1$, so we have the Cartesian equation of the circle: $$x^{2}+y^{2}=1$$ Which gives us the parametric equations: $$x=\cos{\theta} \\ y=\sin{\theta}$$ Therefore, any arbitrary point $P$ on the circle can be written $P(\cos{\theta},\sin{\theta})$, for some $\theta\in[0,2\pi]$. As we know the position vectors for each of the points $A(1,1)$, $B(1,-1)$, $C(-1,-1)$ and $D(-1,1)$, we can find the vectors: $$\overrightarrow{AP}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos{\theta}-1 \\ \sin{\theta}-1\end{pmatrix} \\ \overrightarrow{BP}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos{\theta}-1 \\ \sin{\theta}+1\end{pmatrix} \\ \overrightarrow{CP}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos{\theta}+1 \\ \sin{\theta}+1\end{pmatrix} \\ \overrightarrow{DP}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos{\theta}+1 \\ \sin{\theta}-1\end{pmatrix}$$ And therefore, we have a general expression for the Euclidean norm of these vectors: $$\|\overrightarrow{AP}\|=\sqrt{3-2\sqrt{2}\sin\left(\theta+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \\ \|\overrightarrow{BP}\|=\sqrt{3-2\sqrt{2}\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\theta\right)} \\ \|\overrightarrow{CP}\|=\sqrt{3+2\sqrt{2}\sin\left(\theta+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \\ \|\overrightarrow{DP}\|=\sqrt{3+2\sqrt{2}\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\theta\right)}$$ From this we can see $\not\exists \theta \in [0,2\pi]$ such that $\|\overrightarrow{AP}\|$,$\|\overrightarrow{BP}\|$,$\|\overrightarrow{CP}\|$ and $\|\overrightarrow{DP}\|$ are all integral. However, I cannot see how to prove that there is no $\theta$ such that they are all rational, and so cannot finish the proof, so is this proof salvageable?","['geometry', 'algebra-precalculus', 'contest-math', 'elementary-number-theory', 'trigonometry']"

305001,How can the real numbers be a field if $0$ has no inverse?,"I'm reading a linear algebra book (Linear Algebra by Georgi E. Shilov, Dover Books) and the very start of the book discusses fields. 9 field axioms discussing addition and multiplication are given then the author goes on to discuss common sets of numbers. The integers are identified as being a set of numbers which is not a field because there does not exist a reciprocal element for every integer (axiom # 8 in this book states the existence of a reciprocal element $B$ for a number $A$ such that $AB=1$). The author goes on to call the real numbers a field, and asserts that an axiomatic treatment can be had by supplementing the field axioms with the order axioms and the least upper bound axiom. My understanding consists of the following statements I believe are facts: zero is a member of the reals there exists no reciprocal element of zero that is a real number Given those two facts it seems to me that the reals fail the same test for being a field that the author states the integers fail. Yet the author is calling the real numbers a field. To my mind this is a contradiction. Is there a resolution to this apparent contradiction?

Now let $ R<R' $. My question:  is there a regular compact domain $ D $ such that $ B_R \subset D $ and $ \partial D \subset B_{R'} $ (where $ B_R $ is the metric ball of $ M$ )? I'm thinking that if we can construct a smooth function $ \varphi $ such that $ \varphi = 1 $ on $ B_R $, $ supp(\varphi)\subset B_{R'} $ and $ |\nabla \varphi |\neq 0 $ on $ interior( supp(\varphi)) \diagdown \overline{B_R} $ then the subset $\Omega=\{p \in M:\varphi(p)\geq \frac{1}{2}\} $ is the regular compact domain looked for.

example about calculating $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(ax)}{x}\, dx$$
that I don't understand. The solution in the notes starts like this: Denote $C$ as the path from$-R$ to $R$ on the $x$-axis (where
$R>0$ is real). Denote $C_{R}$ as the semi-circle (anti-clockwise)
that goes from $R$ to $-R$. $$\int_{-R}^{R}\frac{\sin(az)}{z}\, dz=\int_{C}\frac{\sin(az)}{z}\, dz=\int_{C}\frac{e^{aiz}-e^{-aiz}}{2iz}=\frac{1}{2i}(\int_{C}\frac{e^{iaz}}{z}\, dz-\int_{C}\frac{e^{-aiz}}{z}\, dz)$$
Assume $a>0$: $$e^{iaz}=e^{iaRe^{i\theta}}=e^{iaR\cos(\theta)}-e^{-iaR\sin(\theta)}$$ Thus $$\int_{C}\frac{e^{iaz}}{z}\, dz+\int_{C_{R}}\frac{e^{iaz}}{z}\, dz=2\pi iRes_{z=0}\left(\frac{e^{iaz}}{z}\right)=2\pi i$$ The next part claims that for $R\to\infty$:$\int_{C}\frac{e^{iaz}}{z}\, dz=2\pi i$
(I understand this part) From here don't understand what going on in the notes, the sentences
claim that $$\int_{C}\frac{e^{-iaz}}{z}\, dz+\int_{C_{R}}\frac{-e^{iaz}}{z}\, dz=0$$ but I think that in a similar manner that sum is $2\pi iRes_{z=0}(\frac{e^{-iaz}}{z})$
which I believe to be $2\pi i\neq0$. The next two sentences afterward say that $\lim_{R\to\infty}\int_{C}\frac{\sin(az)}{z}\, dz=\frac{1}{2i}\cdot2\pi i=\pi$
and that $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(ax)}{x}\, dx=\pi$$ Can someone please help me understand the part about the sum $$\int_{C}\frac{e^{-iaz}}{z}\, dz+\int_{C_{R}}\frac{-e^{iaz}}{z}\, dz$$

305187,"Prime numbers, analysis of polylogarithms","Can any interesting results concering prime numbers be obtained using the analytic properties of the polylogarithm, similar to how analytic methods are used on the zeta function to obtain results about primes? $\text{Li}_s(x)$ is the polylogarithm, and $\zeta(s)$ is the zeta function: $$\text{Li}_s(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n^s} ,\text{    }\text{ } \text{ } \zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^s}$$
The zeta function satisfies $$-\frac{d}{ds}\ln(\zeta(s))=\sum_{p\text{ prime}}\frac{\ln(p)}{p^s-1}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}$$
and the polylogarithm satisfies a similar result: 
$$-\frac{d}{ds}\text{Li}_s(x)=\sum_{p\text{ prime}}\ln(p)( \frac{ \text {Li}_s(x^p)}{p^s}+\frac{ \text {Li}_s(x^{p^2})}{p^{2s}}+\frac{ \text {Li}_s(x^{p^3})}{p^{3s}}+....)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\Lambda(n)\text{Li}_s(x^n)}{n^s}$$ Also, I don't know if its worth noting, but by substituting roots of unity for the argument of the polylogarithm, using some orthogonality relations and Möbius inversion one can obtain, $$-\frac{1}{a}\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}\sum_{t=0}^{a-1}\frac{d}{ds}\text{Li}_s(e^{2\pi itn/a})e^{-2\pi i t b/a}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\Lambda(an+b)}{(an+b)^s}=\sum_{p\equiv \text{ b mod a }}\frac{\ln(p)}{p^s}+o(1)$$
And thus,
$$-\frac{1}{a}\int_{s}^\infty\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}\sum_{t=0}^{a-1}\frac{d}{ds}\text{Li}_s(e^{2\pi itn/a})e^{-2\pi i t b/a}\ ds=\sum_{p\equiv \text{ b mod a }}\frac{1}{p^s}+o(1)$$ which I used to obtain results like:
$$\sum_{p\equiv 2 \text{ mod 3}}\frac{\ln(p)p^s}{p^{2s}-1}=\frac{\zeta(s,\frac{2}{3})\zeta'(s,\frac{1}{3})-\zeta(s,\frac{1}{3})\zeta'(s,\frac{2}{3})}{\zeta(s,\frac{1}{3})^2-\zeta(s,\frac{2}{3})^2}$$
where $\zeta(s,q)$ are Hurwitz zeta functions. I know Dirichlet $L$ functions can be used to give similar results. I just thought it was worth mentioning, and in this case it's much easier to recognize divergence of the left hand sum as $\lim_{s\to 1}$.","['prime-numbers', 'mobius-inversion', 'analysis']"

However, the notion of continuity can be generalized to functions between arbitrary topological spaces. My question is, how does non-standard analysis stand in relation to general topology? Are concepts like ""continuous function between topological spaces"" still defined and studied, and if so, are they defined in the same way as in the classical approach? What about compactness and connectedness? Are they defined in the same way, or are they defined differently?

My immediate answer to the question is that we consider the upper diagonal matrices instead, since we have the same independent choices. Then for the first row we can choose $n$, for the second $n-1$, for the third $n-2$, and so on down to just one choice for the $n^\text{th}$ row. Since we can choose up to $m$ elements for any of them, we have $m^{n+(n-1)+(n-2)+\cdots+1}=m^{n(n+1)/2}$. However, it follows easily from the algebra that $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is simply ${n+1\choose 2}$, so nothing is stopping us from writing the number of symmetric matrices as $m^{n+1\choose 2}$.

305499,Differentiability vs Having a Derivative,"In some calculus texts, one comes across the following statement - ""A function is differentiable, if it has a derivative and a function has a derivative, if it is differentiable."". Two such texts are  - A treatise on Advanced Calculus by Philip Franklin(this book can be found on archive.org - check section 69 - Page 109) and Advanced Calculus - An Introduction to Linear Analysis by Leonard F. Richardson - Chapter 4 - Page 101.
Analytical proofs are also given to justify these statements. This raises the question - What is the physical difference between being differentiable and having a derivative? The book by Leonard Richardson gives some analytical explanation about the existence of a linear function, which approximates the function at points very close to x. If such a function exists, then the function is said to be differentiable(and then he goes on to prove analytically that the function has a derivative and vice versa). The problem is that the whole proof is anlaytic, and is not illustrated using a practical example. When we say that a function is differentiable, we generally check for the existence of its derivative (i.e the limit of its differential coefficient). But this text 'implies' that its possible to check the differentiability of a function by checking for the existence of such a linear function(whose slope as you've guessed becomes the derivative in the limit). So what essentially is the difference, between this approach and the standard approach? It seems purely algebraic to me....Or is there more to it? A related question is - what's the difference between Caratheodory's definition of the derivative and the standard definition of the derivative?. The difference seems purely algebraic to me.I would like to know if there's more to it.(I think the answer to this question is closely related to the first, but since Caratheodory's definition is rarely covered in most standard calculus texts, I've decided to gain as much information as possible, on this subject.) I am not a mathematics major, so there are limits to my theoretical thinking! I would greatly appreciate if practical examples are provided to illustrate these concepts.",['calculus']

Since $w \equiv 0$ on$ U \times \{t=0\}$, we conclude $w=u-\tilde {u}\equiv 0$ in $U_{T}$.

Let $K$ be an extension of $k$, so $A \otimes K$ is a $K$-algebra and $M \otimes K$ and $N \otimes K$ are $A \otimes K$ modules. I would like to say that, if $M \otimes K \cong N \otimes K$, then $M \cong N$. When $k$ is infinite, there is a very easy proof. The $K$-vector space $\Hom_{A\otimes K}(M\otimes K, N \otimes K)$ is simply $\Hom_{A}(M,N) \otimes K$. Saying $M \cong N$ means that there is a matrix in $\Hom_{A}(M, N)$ with nonzero determinant. If the polynomial $\det( \ )$ is nonzero somewhere after extending scalars, then it is already nonzero over $k$. But, over a finite field, this argument is broken. If $M$ and $N$ were dimension $3$ over $k = \mathbb{F}_2$, and $\Hom(M,N)$ consisted of those matrices of the form $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} x & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & y & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & x-y \end{smallmatrix} \right)$, then this matrix is singular for any $(x,y) \in k^2$, but in extension fields it can be invertible. Nonetheless, I think I have an argument that the statement is true for finite fields as well. Has anyone seen this statement before? Is there an easy proof I missed?","['modules', 'finite-fields', 'abstract-algebra']"

There are $2^n - n - 1$ subsets S of $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ for which we may or may not have $P(\bigcap_{j \in S}A_j) = \prod\limits_{j\in S}P(A_j)$ $(*)$. (When $S$ is empty or has a single element, this is trivially true.) Suppose we know whether or not $(*)$ holds for each $S$, except one, which I shall call $T$. Is there any case in which we can deduce from what we know whether or not the equality holds for $T$? For instance, suppose $n = 3$, and that we know the equality holds for $\{1, 2\}$, $\{1, 3\}$, $\{2, 3\}$, but we wish to know whether or not $(*)$ holds for $T = \{1, 2, 3\}$. In this specific case, we are just asking whether or not we can tell if three events are mutually independent given that they are pairwise independent. But we know we can find pairwise independent events that are not mutually independent and also pairwise independent events that are mutually independent. Therefore, we cannot tell whether or not $(*)$ holds for $T$ with just the information we were given. Edit: I'm going to make my question more precise as a first step to answering it. First, I'll need a few definitions: Definition 1 : Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ be a collection of events in a probability space. For each $S \subseteq \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$, we put $\delta_{S} = 1$ if S satisfies $(*)$ and $\delta_{S} = 0$ otherwise. Definition 2 : Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ be a collection of events in a probability space. Then the configuration of this collection is the hypergraph $H = (\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}, E)$, where $S \in E$ iff $\delta_{S} = 0$. Now I can reformulate my question thus: is the following conjecture false? Conjecture : Every hypergraph $H = (\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}, E)$ is the configuration of some collection $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ of events in a probability space, as long as $\emptyset \notin E$ and $\{1\}, \{2\}, \ldots, \{n\} \notin E$. Even though I want the conjecture to be false, I expect it to be true. So I guess we must try and prove it. But it is not obvious to me how to. It might be of interest to note that for each natural number $n$, there are $2^{2^n - n - 1}$ different hypergraphs $H$ (as in the Conjecture)! (That's quite a lot: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2%5E%282%5En+-+n+-+1%29 .) But some of them can be ""transformed"" into others by re-indexing, like the hypergraph with just one edge linking the vertices $1$ and $2$, which is basically the same as the hypergraph with just one edge linking the vertices $2$ and $3$.","['probability-theory', 'graph-theory', 'products']"
305905,What's the justification for defining the (definite) integral using a countably infinite sum?,"To compute the area under a continuous function $f$ from $\Bbb{R\to R}$ in the interval $[a,b]$, Riemannian integration is often employed that could defined as $$\lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \frac{(b-a)}{N} f\left(a+i\frac{b-a}{N}\right)$$ The intuition given behind this is to divide the interval into smaller and smaller pieces and 'sample' the function in each interval to compute the areas. However, no matter how large N gets, we will still be making only a finite sum. In the limit as $N\to\infty$ then, we will be sampling a countable infinity of points from the function. But the function's domain is $\Bbb R$, which is uncountably infinite . So, intuitively, how do we expect to sample it faithfully with only a countable infinity of samples?

Now $f(z)$ has poles of order 1 at $(k+\frac{1}{2})a$ for all $k\in\mathbb{Z}$.  Thus using the Residue Theorem and l'Hôpital's Rule: $$\lim_{z\rightarrow (k+\frac{1}{2})a}\frac{(z-(k+\frac{1}{2})a)e^{-z^2}}{1+e^{-2az}}=\lim_{z\rightarrow (k+\frac{1}{2})a}\frac{\frac{d}{dz}(z-(k+\frac{1}{2})a)e^{-z^2}}{\frac{d}{dz}1+e^{-2az}}=\frac{e^{-(k+\frac{1}{2})^2a^2}}{-2ae^{-2(k+\frac{1}{2})a^2}}=\frac{e^{-k^2a^2-ka^2-\frac{a^2}{4}}}{-2ae^{-2ka^2-a^2}}=\frac{e^{-\pi ik^2-\pi ik-\frac{\pi i}{4}}}{-2ae^{-2\pi ik-\pi i}}=\frac{e^{\frac{-\pi i}{4}}}{2\sqrt{\pi}e^{\frac{\pi i}{4}}}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi}i}$$ It can be shown that $f(z)-f(z+a)=e^{-z^2}$ (I wont prove this but it's most definitely true).  I'm going to integrate this function around the contour which is a rhombus slanting to the right whose bottom two corners lie at $-R$ and $R$.

Making the substitutions $u=z-a$ for the third integral and then $v=1-t$ for the fourth, and then taking $R\rightarrow\infty$, we obtain: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-z^2}dz=\sum_{k\geq 0}\sqrt{\pi}$$ Whew!
