529652,Elementary questions on principal divisors,"I have some elementary questions related to divisors. I will state them below. Question 1: Let $X$ a Noetherian scheme be regular in codimension 1 (every local ring of dimension $1$ is regular). Then in Ravi FOAG's (Jun 2013 version) he defines the following. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an invertible sheaf, $s$ a rational section. Then $\operatorname{div}(s) := \sum_Y \nu_Y(s) [Y]$ where the sum is over all irreducible codimension $1$ subsets of $X$. What is this $\nu_Y(s)$? Do I simply take any $y\in Y$ and calculate the valuation of $s$ in $\mathcal{O}_{X,y}$? Question 2: Suppose $A$ is a domain and $x \in A$ such that $(x)$ a prime ideal. Then is the divisor $[(x)]$ principal, equal to $\operatorname{div}(x)$? Some might say this is pretty much the definition, but I have $\operatorname{div} (x) := \sum_{ Y} \nu_Y(x)[Y]$ where $Y$ is a codimension $1$ closed subset of $\operatorname{Spec} A$. It is not clear to me from this definition that $\operatorname{div}(x) = [(x)]$.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
529656,Why is connection a map from $\Gamma(E)$ to $\Omega^1\otimes\Gamma(E)$?,"On the site Vector Bundle Connection , it gives two definitions of a connection. One is view a connection as a linear map from a section of $E\otimes TM$ to a section of $E$:

Thus for each letter received, two letters are sent out to separate persons chosen at random (irrespective of what happened in the past). What is the probability that in the first $n$ stages the person who started the chain letter game will not receive a letter? I am thinking of solving this through complementation, i.e. what I have so far is that for $n=1$, $$P\{\text{the person who started the chain letter game will receive a letter}\}=0$$ for $n=2$,  $$P\{\text{the person who started the chain letter game will receive a letter from the 1st sender}\}$$  $$=P\{\text{the person who started the chain letter game will receive a letter from the 2nd sender}\}$$ $$=\frac{_{N-2}C_1}{_{N-1}C_2}$$ $$P\{\text{the person who started the chain letter game will receive letters from both 2nd senders}\}$$ $$=\left(\frac{_{N-2}C_1}{_{N-1}C_2}\right)^2$$ Then I would simply calculate the probability of the union of the elementary events, then continue for each $n$.

529745,Why least square problem always has solution for arbitrary b? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Existence of least squares solution to $Ax=b$ (7 answers) Closed 10 years ago . We know from linear algebra, the least square solution of linear equation system :
$$Ax=b$$ always exists. That is, the equation 
$$A^TAx=A^Tb$$ always has at least one solution.
Most of us explain it existence by interpreting least square problem as a matter of orthogonal projection. It's correct, I know. But can we prove this by showing that the rank of matrix $$A^TA$$ is equal to the rank of the augmented matrix:$$[A^TA,A^Tb]$$for any given vector b? I've worked for hours but failed to show that. Although there is a similar thread in mathematics.SX, but I personally think there is no good answer presented there. So I address this problem again. Thanks at first! [update] Now I come up with a proof for this proposition: suppose that rank $A^TA$=k, and the matrix $[A^TA,A^Tb]$ has one more column than $[A^TA]$, so rank $[A^TA,A^Tb]\ge k$. But on the other hand, we have $[A^TA,A^Tb]=A^T[A,b]$, using the rank inequality, we have $rank [A^TA,A^Tb]\le rank A^T$. Since (we can prove that) $ rank A^TA= rank A= rank A^T$ for any given matrix A. So the inequality is actually $rank [A^TA,A^Tb]\le k$.
Combining the two inequalities, we have $rank [A^TA,A^Tb]=rank A^TA$. Q.E.D.","['matrix-equations', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

Now E[W] = E[X1] + E[X2] + E[X3] + ............... + E[Xm] Now E[X1] is same as finding expectation such that 0 comes before any 1. It should be n/n+1. This holds for all Xi's.

After doing the first, I expected the second to produce a sort of mirror, or opposite of it, but that didn't happen (and I suppose it makes sense now thinking about it). However, I would really appreciate if someone could give me an approach to thinking of these things intuitively and understanding where inside the matrix does the magic happen.

529819,Defining conditional quantum probability,"My knowledge of quantum mechanics is very limited, but I will try to ask a purely mathematical question here. If there is a text or resource that explains this, I would definitely appreciate any pointers! I have been unable to find any explanations online (most quantum mechanical resources seem too focused on the physics to ask such questions...). I am coming at this from a computer science angle, so I will talk about qubits. To make things very simple and concrete, suppose I have two qubits in some quantum state:
 $$ a_{00} \left|00\right\rangle + a_{01} \left|01\right\rangle + a_{10} \left|10\right\rangle + a_{11} \left|11\right\rangle $$
where $a_{ij} \in \mathbb{C}$, $\sum_{ij} |a_{ij}|^2 = 1$. Suppose I now measure the first bit. Given that I measure $0$, what is the quantum state of my system? Given that I measure $1$, what is the quantum state of my system? A naive extension of Baye's rule leads me to conjecture that, for instance, if I measure zero for the first bit, then the quantum state is
$$ \sqrt{\frac{|a_{00}|^2}{|a_{00}|^2 + |a_{01}|^2}} \left|00\right\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{|a_{01}|^2}{|a_{00}|^2 + |a_{01}|^2}} \left|01\right\rangle .$$ But is this really correct? The general question would be that if I have a quantum state $\sum_i a_i \left|\phi_i\right\rangle$, and I ""partially observe"" $\phi_i$ (so I guess one would say I ""partially"" collapse the wave function?), how is the new quantum state mathematically determined?","['probability-theory', 'quantum-computation', 'quantum-mechanics']"

It's asserted that there must a point $p$ inside the sphere with the property $\nabla f (p) = 0$. Here's what I've done so far: suppose there's no such point in $B(0;1)$. Since $f$ is real valued and defined in the compact $\bar{B}(0;1)$, it must attain maximum and minimum. Since $f$ has no critical points in the interior, then these points must lie in $S^{2}$, say $x_{0}$ is the maximum and $y_{0}$ is the minimum.

A computer search for solutions with $a,c\le20$ only finds 8-2=9-3, 32-8=27-3, and 256-16=243-3. I would really like there to be only finitely many solutions (even if these 3 aren't the only ones). I have noted that the lower powers on both sides can be factored out, but since all the exponents are arbitrary, I don't think I can use a pattern in modular residues to get the result. This feels vaguely reminiscent of Mihăilescu's theorem, but hopefully it's much easier to prove. Can someone point me towards a relevant reference or give me a nudge towards a method for solving it? Edit: I've read through Gottfried Helms's explanation, and come to some conclusions, but I'm afraid I'm a bit out of my depth, as I have little experience with Euler's totient theorem (and the related theorem of Carmichael), and no prior experience with Zsigmondy's theorem. I've worked on it a bit, and am presenting my thoughts/current understanding here, in the hopes that people can clarify things for me and bring me closer to a solution. Firstly, I noticed that there was no good reason to disallow $b=0$ or $d=0$ in the problem, so I started allowing them. Ideally, I would like to produce a complete list of the finitely many tuples (a computer suggests five) of nonnegative integers $\left(a,b,c,d\right)$ with $a>b\ge0,c>d\ge0$ where the above equation holds (note that if we allowed $a=b$ or $c=d$ , then we would have $a=b\Leftrightarrow c=d$ and that would be an infinite family of trivial solutions parametrized by $b$ and $d$ ). Throughout this discussion, I will follow Gottfried Helms in rewriting the equation as $$\frac{2^A-1}{3^d}=\frac{3^C-1}{2^b}\tag{1}$$ where $A=a-b,C=c-d>0$ , and both sides must be integers. Quick Observations: $2^{b}$ is the highest power of $2$ that divides $3^{C}-1$ , as otherwise the left hand side of (1) is odd and the right side is even. Thus, $b=0$ is impossible. Note that $3^2\equiv1\mod8$ , and $3-1\equiv2\mod8$ can't be divisible by $4$ . Therefore, $3^{C}-1$ is divisible either by $8$ or by $2$ and not $4$ . Hence, by 1., $b=2$ is impossible. If $A=1$ then $d=1$ or else the left side of (1) wouldn't be an integer. If $C=1$ , then $b\le1$ to make the right side of (1) an integer, so $C=1\Rightarrow b=1$ by 2. Zsigmondy's Theorem Zsigmondy's Theorem is a deep theorem I has not heard of before Gottfried's post, and it solves many simpler problems of a similar flavor to this one. An good collection of example applications can be found in this issue of the HKUST Mathematical Excalibur . Two relevant corollaries for us are: Each entry of the sequence $2^{n}-1$ has a new prime divisor the previous entries didn't except for $n=6$ . For example: $2^{2}-1$ has the new prime factor $3$ , which $2^{1}-1$ didn't have. $2^{3}-1$ has the new prime factor $7$ which the previous two didn't have. $2^{4}-1$ has the new prime factor $5$ , and $2^{5}-1$ has the new prime factor $31$ , but $2^{6}-1=3^{2}*7$ . Each entry of the sequence $3^{n}-1$ has a new prime divisor except for $n=2$ . $3^{2}-1$ = $\left(3^{1}-1\right)^{3}$ , but $3^{3}-1$ has $13$ , $3^{4}-1$ has $5$ , etc. More Special Cases: With Zsigmondy's theorem in hand, we can easily handle some more special cases. Case: $b=1$ and $d=0$ : In this case, the equation in the problem gives us $2^{a}-2=3^{c}-1$ , so that $2^{a}-1=3^{c}$ , but $2^{a}-1$ is getting new prime factors other than 3 by Zsigmondy unless $a=0,1,2$ . Since $a>b=1$ , only $a=2$ is allowed. This yields the solution “4-2=3-1
”. Case: $C=1$ : By quick observation 5., $b=1$ , so we have $2^{A}-1=3^{d}$ , which forces $A\le2$ by Zsigmondy. $A=1$ would force $d=0$ and give us the solution from the previous case. If $A=2$ , then $d=1$ and we get “8-2=9-3”. (Note, Mihăilescu's theorem could have been used as extreme overkill for this since $2^{A}-1=3^{d}$ is equivalent to $2^{A}-3^{d}=1$ .) Better arguments? Gottfried seemed to be bringing up Carmichael's strengthening of Euler's totient theorem , but I don't understand how it's being used. The answer made it seem like they were saying something like $a^m\equiv 1\mod n$ for $a=3$ and $n$ coprime to $3$ exactly when $\lambda(n)\mid m$ , which is false. $3^3\equiv1\mod13$ , for instance. Carmichael's theorem may be very useful here, but I don't understand how to apply it. I also don't understand how exactly to use Zsigmondy's theorem repeatedly. I can verify Jack Daurizio's comment manually with modular arithmetic, but it seemed like they were using these theorems to quickly make claims about divisibility in a way I couldn't follow. Any elaboration/explanation on the methods of Gottfried's answer or a different step towards a solution would be much appreciated. Interesting Corollary As an aside, I forgot to mention the initial inspiration for this question. I was thinking about pairs of functions $f,g:\mathbb N\to\mathbb N$ such that $(n,m)\mapsto f(n)+g(m)$ is injective. One class of pairs I know is based on interleaving digits, but if the conjecture about powers of 2 and 3 is true, then $f(n)=2^{n+k}$ with $g(m)=3^{m+k}$ would work for some $k$ .","['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'reference-request', 'prime-numbers', 'diophantine-equations']"

Suppose $|g(x)-g(y)|/|x-y|<M$ in that neighborhood. Then $|g(x)-g(r)|<M|x-r|$ in that neighborhood of $r$ . Therefore $g(x)\rightarrow g(r)$ as $x\rightarrow r$ , and so $g$ is continuous at $r$ . This means $g$ is continuous everywhere in $A$ . What about the converse? I don't think it holds, but can't come up with a counterexample.",['real-analysis']
530611,Derivative of ${x^{x^2}}$,"Studying past exam problems for my exam in ~$4$ weeks, and I came across this derivative as one of the questions. I actually have no idea how to solve it. $$\frac{d}{dx} (x^{x^2})$$ Using the chain rule on it letting $x^2 = u$ led to me getting $2x^{x^2-2}$, which isn't right.

$$\frac{d}{dx} (e^{{x^2}log(x)})$$

However, it is still valid to ask, what is its limit when p goes to 0? My guess is that: If all coordinates are 0, then $l_p=0$, and it remains like this when p=0. If exactly one coordinate, say $x_i$, is non-zero, then $l_p=x_i$, and it remains like this when p=0. If more than one coordinate (say, $x_i$ and $x_j$) are non-zero, then $l_p>x_i$, and because the exponent goes to $\infty$, the value of $l_p$ also goes to $\infty$. Is this correct?

530660,Surface integral for a scalar function defined on a discrete surface,"Imagine a polyhedral, discrete surface embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Its faces are all triangles. For each vertex, one can compute the discrete mean and Gaussian curvatures and evaluate the sum of square principal curvatures, $k_1^2 + k_2^2$. The goal is to evaluate the bending energy at a vertex $v_0$ by computing this integral over all incident triangles at the $v_0$ vertex: $$ \int_{S}{k_1^2+k_2^2 dS} $$ The problem is that there's no analytical expression for the $k_i$ curvatures, they're just scalars associated to each $v_k$ vertex of the mesh. Is there a way to evaluate this particular surface integral? Or, more clearly, given a random triangle in 3D with scalars attached to its vertices, can a notion of surface integral for a function that just interpolates the scalar values over this triangle be established in a consistent way? (then I can just sum the integrals over all triangles and get a numerical estimate). NOTE The purpose of computing that surface integral is to assess the importance of a vertex as a salient feature in a local context for a polyhedral surface. The entire concept should be implementable using a computer programming language (hence the more abstract mathematical quirks and impediments may be overlooked up to an acceptable limit). For a ""quick"" reference, a good survey of how some continuous differential geometry concepts are adapted in the discrete context, you can consult CalTech's Graphics Group tech report on the issue: http://multires.caltech.edu/pubs/diffGeoOps.pdf Solution proposition Let $f(v) = (k_1^2 + k_2^2)(v)$ be a positive scalar function defined on the polyhedral surface. Evaluating $\int_S{f dS}$ can be done by summing all $\int_{\Delta{ijk}}{f dS}$ over all $(v_i,v_j,v_k)$ triangular faces of the surface. Then the problem is reduced to evaluating: $$ \int_{\Delta{ijk}}{f dS} = \int_s \int_t { f(v(s,t)) \left| \frac{\partial v}{\partial s} \times \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}\right| ds dt },$$
where $v(s,t)$ is a parameterization for the $\Delta_{ijk}$ triangle. For example,
$v(s,t) = (1-t)((1-s)v_1 + sv_2) + tv_3$, where $(s,t) \in [0,1]^2$. Now, we require that $f(v(0,0))=f(v_1)=K_1$, $f(v(1,0))=f(v_2)=K_2$ and $f(v(0,1))=f(v_3)=K_3$, i.e. $f(v_i)=K_i$. Hence $f$ can also be a convex combination of $K_1$, $K_2$ and $K_3$, but this time over a triangular domain that is isometric to $\Delta_{v_1v_2v_3}$. There should exist a parameterization $v^*(s,t)$ of the $\Delta_{v_1v_2v_3}$ triangle such that $\left| \frac{\partial v}{\partial s} \times \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}\right| = 1$ ( is this affirmation valid? ). Since the image of $f(\Delta_{v_1v_2v_3})$ is also a triangle (it is a convex combination of $K_i$s), and since there must be a ""canonical"" parameterization $v^*(s,t)$ of $\Delta$, then we can compute the resulting double integral as the volume under the $K_1K_2K_3$ triangle over the triangular domain that is isometric to $\Delta_{v_1v_2v_3}$. This solid object is a generalized triangular prism (its base planes are not necessarily parallel anymore). Is there any obvious flaw in the above solution?","['multivariable-calculus', 'integration', 'differential-geometry', 'discrete-geometry', 'curvature']"

530741,Questions on Gluing Schemes,"I am trying to do an exercise in a book and here is the question. I have attempted it but I am not sure if my answer is correct. I would appreciate if someone corrects my attempt. Note here that the question has 3 parts... Question : Let $Y$ be an integral scheme (a scheme that is reduced and irreducible), and $U$ be a non-empty open subscheme. Let $I$ be a non-empty index and for all $i\in I$, we let $U_{i}:=U_{ii}=Y$ and $U_{ij}=U$ if $i\neq j$. Let $\phi_{ji}:U_{ij}\rightarrow U_{ji}$ be the identity map and $X$ be a scheme glued along $\phi_{ij}$. 1) We need to show that for all $V$ open subset of $X$, and for all $i\in I$, we have an isomorphism $\Gamma(V,\mathcal{O}_{X})\rightarrow \Gamma(V\cap U_{i},\mathcal{O}_{X})$. Attempt Since $Y$ is irreducible and closed, so it has a generic point $\eta$ which lies in every open set, and therefore it lies in $U$. Then $X$ has a generic point which is $\eta$ as well. I consider the inclusion of schemes $i:U_{i}\rightarrow X$. Therefore, this induces the morphism of function fields: $\displaystyle i^{\#}_{\eta}:\mathcal{O}_{X,\eta}\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{U_{i},\eta},$ which is an isomorphism (I think? because $U_{i}\subseteq X$). Therefore, for each $x\in X$, we have an isomorphism $\mbox{Frac}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})\rightarrow \mbox{Frac}((i_{*}\mathcal{O}_{U_{i}})_{x})$, and hence (I believe this to be true) an isomorphism of stalks $i^{\#}_{x}: \mathcal{O}_{X,x}\rightarrow (i_{*}\mathcal{O}_{U_{i}})_{x}$. This means that $i^{\#}:\mathcal{O}_{X}\rightarrow i_{*}\mathcal{O}_{U_{i}}$ is an isomorphism (at this stage I only know that this is a bijection, so I am taking a leap of faith here and conclude that it is an isomorphism), which is exactly what we want (I hope). 2) Assume that $U\neq Y$, conclude from (1) that $X$ is not an affine scheme. Attempt I am stuck on this one for a long time, and this is the best I can come up with. If $X=(\mbox{Spec}A,\mathcal{O}_{\mbox{Spec}A})$, using the previous result, we have an isomorphism $A\rightarrow \Gamma(X\cap U_{i},\mathcal{O}_{X})=\Gamma(U_{i},\mathcal{O}_{U_{i}})=\Gamma(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$. Now, we set $V=U_{j}$ where $j\neq i$. Then again we have an isomorphism $\Gamma(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})=\Gamma(U_{j},\mathcal{O}_{X})\rightarrow\Gamma(U_{i}\cap U_{j},\mathcal{O}_{X})=\Gamma(U,\mathcal{O}_{X})$ (I think this isomorphism is fishy but I will take it with faith). Now my hope is that since $U$ is a proper open subset of $X$, and $X$ is an affine scheme, the restriction to proper open subset of $\mbox{Spec}A$ will never induce an isomorphism of sections. But this is what we see since $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})\cong \Gamma(U,\mathcal{O}_{X})$. 3) Now assume $Y$ is a noetherian scheme and $U\neq Y$. Prove that $X$ is integral and locally Noetherian. Furthermore, show that $X$ is quasi-compact if and only if the indexing set $I$ is finite. To show that $X$ is quasi-compact if the indexing set is finite, this comes from the fact that $Y$ is quasi-compact. To show that $X$ is locally noetherian, since $Y$ admits an open affine covering $V_{i}$ such that $\Gamma(V_{i},\mathcal{O}_{Y})$ is noetherian, so $X$ admits an open affine covering, where the section of each of the covering open affine subset is noetherian. I can't answer why $X$ should be an integral scheme. Remark : I know this is a bit long, but I really appreciate if someone helps me to proof-read my proofs.

530792,Who gave you the epsilon?,"Who gave you the epsilon? is the title of an article by J. Grabiner on Cauchy from the 1980s, and the implied answer is ""Cauchy"".  On the other hand, historian I. Grattan-Guinness points out in his book that ""Weierstrass undoubtedly saw himself as Cauchy's heir in analysis and so helped to create the belief that Cauchy's achievements included ideas that were actually his own"" ( The development of the foundations of mathematical analysis from Euler to Riemann , page 120). In fact, Cauchy apparently never gave an epsilon-delta definition of either limit or continuity .  His infinitesimal definition of continuity (""infinitesimal $x$-increment always produces infinitesimal $y$-increment"") is reproduced in a number of secondary studies, for example in J. Gray ( Plato's Ghost , page 64). The question is then, who in fact gave you epsilon-delta: Cauchy or Weierstrass? Editors are requested to refrain from answers based purely on opinion, but rather to base themselves on published sources supporting either of the two views. In particular, a primary source in Cauchy giving an epsilon-delta definition of continuity would be welcome. Note 1. Grabiner's example cited by @Brian  illustrates the issue well. Cauchy infrequently uses preliminary forms of epsilon, delta arguments (notice the opening ""let delta, epsilon be very small numbers"" which would certainly not make it into calculus texts today) in some of his proofs, but he never gave an epsilon, delta definition . This example suggests that Cauchy never gave such a definition, for if he did, Grabiner would have likely cited it.  Cauchy's definition of continuity is ""infinitesimal $x$-increment always produces an infinitesimal change in $y$"".

the scope of Abstract Algebra felt more natural and intuitive (though
I did have some difficulty with some of the more advanced parts of
those courses). I was told that other then taking some credit points I will get a
question from the supervisor, one that is not solved yet but seems
at a reasonable difficulty to him, and I will have and I will have
to try and find a solution for it. I would like to prepare myself, in this year, to have control over
varies subjects in Abstract Algebra so that I will be more likely
to be able to solve such a question (or even understand it, as there
are some subjects in Abstract Algebra that I have not learned in any
of the courses I took as an undergraduate student). Also, I have lately been aware of some subjects that involve both
analysis and Abstract Algebra, such as topological groups. I would be happy if I could avoid such topics, but I don't know what
type of mathematics is studied in a graduate degree level, so this
leads me to the following questions: What topics of Abstract Algebra should I study in depth ? what
topics in Abstract Algebra should I be familiar with their basics
? Are there any topics in analysis, topology etc' that are likely
to be needed for answering a graduate degree level type of questions
? What should be the focus of my work, should I try to do many exercises
within the text, or focus on the proofs and the theory ? I have the book Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote to study with,
as well as books in other area of mathematics such as Topology by
Monkers that might help me with this goal. I would be extremely grateful for hearing opinions and advices on
this matter! Added: Note 1: I would like to mention that although I try to avoid analysis,
I still had to take courses in that, so I don't lack elementary knowledge
in many topics, I have taken: Introduction to functional analysis,
Real analysis (measure theory), complex analysis, ODE, Introduction
to numerical analysis, Introduction to probability theory (the course
didn't talk about $\sigma$ algebras and etc' but we did talk about
random variables, CLT, etc'). But I don't consider myself to be good at those topics (except maybe
probability that I really liked), I understand them, but I am about
average at them, so I don't expect that I would be able to do something
non-trivial at those topics. I would like to extend my questions to include the complement of my
question to what to study for what I shouldn't spend my time on: 4) Are there topics in Abstract Algebra, or other in other areas that

Claim: $E$ is algebraically closed Let $f \in E[X]$. Then $f(X)=a_0+a_1X+...+a_nX^n$ where $a_i \in E$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. Then $a_i \in \mathbb{Q}_m$ for some $m$. Choose $t$ large enough such that all $a_i \in \mathbb{Q}_t$. Then by the construction , $f$ has root in $\mathbb{Q}_{t+1} \subset E$ Hence, $E$ is an algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$. Can anyone help me to check whether I got the proof correct or not. Because I not sure whether I leave out some details.","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

530903,Covering projective variety with open sets $U_i$ such that $\pi^{-1}(U_i) \cong U_i \times \Bbb{A}^1$: How to improve geometric intuition?,"I am looking at exercise II 6.3 of Hartshorne. In the first part, he asks to show the following. If $V \subseteq \Bbb{P}^n$ is a projective variety (over some field $k$), let $X = C(V)$ denote its affine cone in $\Bbb{A}^{n+1}$, and let $\overline{X}$ be the projective closure of $X$ in $\Bbb{P}^{n+1}$. Then we can cover $V$ with open sets $U_i$ so that under the projection $\pi : \overline{X} - \{P\} \to V$, we have $\pi^{-1}(U_i) \cong U_i \times_k \Bbb{A}^1$. In the case $V= \Bbb{P}^n$, I can see by writing down equations that we can just take $U_i$ to be the standard affine open sets. But what about more general projective varieties? At the moment I have zero idea on how to approach such a problem geometrically without writing down equations. I am ok when it comes to bashing the commutative algebra, but for more geometric things like this I am quite bad. In general, how does one approach a problem like this? How can I improve my geometric intuition?",['algebraic-geometry']
530910,The ratio $\frac{u(z_2)}{u(z_1)}$ for positive harmonic functions is uniformly bounded on compact sets,"I want to prove the following: If $E$ is a compact set in a region $\Omega \subset \mathbb C$, prove that there exists a constant $M$, depending only on $E$ and $\Omega$, such that every positive harmonic function $u(z)$ in $\Omega$ satisfies $u(z_2) \leq M u(z_1)$ for any two points $z_1, z_2 \in E$. This appears as an exercise in Ahlfors' Complex Analysis text, regarding Harnack's inequality: If $u$ is positive and harmonic in the closed disk $\overline{\Delta}(z_0,R)$ then $$\frac{R-r}{R+r} \leq \frac{u(z)}{u(z_0)} \leq \frac{R+r}{R-r} $$ holds, whenever $|z-z_0|=r<R$. My attempt: Let $u:\Omega \to (0,\infty)$  be some harmonic function, and let $E \Subset \Omega$ be a compact subset. $\Omega$ can be covered by $ \left\{\Delta \left(z ,\frac{1}{2}R_z \right) \right\}_{z \in \Omega}$ where the radii $R_z>0$ are chosen such that the closed disks  $\overline{\Delta}(z,R_z) $ remain in $\Omega$. Since $E$ is compact it admits a finite subcover $\left\{ \Delta \left(z_n,\frac{1}{2} R_n \right) \right\}_{n=1}^N$. Consider a disk $\Delta(z_n,\frac{1}{2} R_n)$ of the cover, Harnack's inequality implies that for any $z$ in that disk $$\frac{1}{3} \leq \frac{u(z)}{u(z_n)} \leq 3 .$$
Thus, for any two points $z,z' \in \Delta(z_n,\frac{1}{2} R_n)$ $$\frac{1}{3^2} \leq \frac{u(z)}{u(z_n)} \frac{u(z_n)}{u(z')}=\frac{u(z)}{u(z')} \leq 3^2 .$$ This shows that $\frac{u(z_2)}{u(z_1)}$ is bounded from above by 9, where $z_1,z_2$ lie in the same disk from the cover. My difficulty is extending this idea to the case where $z_1,z_2 \in E$ lie in different disks . Could you please help me? (I thought about taking intermediate steps $z_1 \to z_{i_1} \to \dots \to z_2$ such that each adjacent points lie in the same disk, but if $E$ is not connected this clearly fails). Thanks!","['harmonic-functions', 'inequality', 'complex-analysis', 'analysis']"

If we draw the perpendicular bisectors of each side (although they aren't cevians), they are concurrent too. The same goes for the altitudes , and medians corresponding to each vertex Of course any two non-parallel lines in a plane will intersect, but in triangles, all three lines are concurrent! Is there any special reason behind this? Has it been explained? I couldn't find any reasoning on the net. So far, I've got proofs, but what I am actually looking for is what @GregHill said: Does anyone know a way to explain the idea of ALL triangle concurrences based on something intrinsic about triangles?""

Adding digits to the end of some number $k$ in base $B$ can be written in the form
$k*B^{n} + b$.  Can we use Dirichlet's theorem to guarantee that this will generate some prime number? Motivation: This is how so-called ""illegal primes"" were found, but I'd like to be familiar with the theory of why it works.","['prime-numbers', 'number-theory']"
531060,Are there applications of noncommutative geometry to number theory?,"The marriage of algebraic geometry and number theory was celebrated in the twentieth century by the school of Grothendieck. As a consequence, number theory has been completely transformed. On the other hand, the school of Alain Connes developped a theory to include the study of non-commutative rings in algebraic geometry. As far as I understand, the tree branched off in these two separate directions, with number theory staying mostly on the commutative side of things, for the natural reason that the rings one encounters in number theory are mostly commutative. I'd like to know if the development of noncommutative geometry has had an impact on number theory. Has it led to concrete advancements? Has it influenced the way people think about some topics?
