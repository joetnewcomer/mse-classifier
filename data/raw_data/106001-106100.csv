1503686,Understanding $\sigma$-algebra and power set,"Given the set $S =\{1, 2, 3\}$ and the fact that $\sigma$-algebra is generated by its single subset $A = \{1\} \subset S$ and is denoted by $\sigma(\{1\})$ or by $\sigma(A)$. I don't really understand how $\sigma(A)$ is constructed as well as whether the power set of $S$, $\mathcal{F}(S) = 2^S$, is a $\sigma$-algebra? I have tried to check the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ properties such as:
$$\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}$$ 
$$A \in \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow A^c \in \mathcal{F}$$ $$ A_1,A_2, \dots, A_n, \dots \in \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow \bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} A_k \in \mathcal{F} $$ Therefore, I assumed that $\sigma(\{1\})$ satisfies the properties and therefore may be called $\sigma(A)$. In regard to the power set, I assumed that a legit power set is in the form of $\mathcal{F}(S) = 2^\Omega$ so the question is whether $S=\Omega$? Here I'm a bit confused.",['measure-theory']

Moreover, group props itself doesn't even have a page on it!

1503845,Planar bipartite graph,"I know that the number of edges for a face in a bipartite is at least 4. Clearly, we cannot have 3, because we will need to move back to the other side to have face. But, I'm having difficulty in imagining a face of a planar bipartite graph. Where can I find an example of it? On the other hand, I have found the following equality and inequality, but I couldn't grasp exactly what they are saying, if someone can elaborate for me them, I would be glad. $$2 |E| = \sum_{i \geq 4} i F_i$$ where $i$ is the number of edges of the face $F_i$ and $F_i$ is the number of faces with $i$ edges. Clearly this is somehow consequence of the handshaking lemma, but why multiplying number of edges of a face with the faces give us this result? Shouldn't we use the degree of each vertex for handshaking lemma? The second inequality is this one $$4 \sum_{i \geq 4} F_i \leq \sum_{i \geq 4} i F_i$$ $$4 |F| \leq 2|E|$$ I mean, the second part is form the above equation, but first part the 4 confuses me. Is it because we need at least 4 edges for a face in bipartite graph? If yes, why do we need it actually in this inequality? Second question, why does this inequality hold?

The range of $f$ is a subset of the domain of $f$ . I understand that $f(x) = 3x$ is not surjective and thus not bijective since for example the range does not contain number $2$ . But what would happen if we were to define $f: \mathbb N\rightarrow \mathbb N$ as $f(x) = x$ ? It is a bijective function.

The Journal of Symbolic Logic
Vol. 58, No. 2 (Jun., 1993), pp. 641-647 Real closed fields are fields in which $X^2 + 1$ is irreductible and $F[X] / (X^2 + 1)$ is algebraically closed. They are ordered by setting $x \geq 0$ iff $x$ is a square. A few ideas: -Every order preserving isomorphism between two integer parts in $F$ extends in a unique way as an automorphism of $F$. -Integer parts of real closed fields are exactly models of open induction (PA with induction scheme restricted to quantifier-free formulas). -If $G$ is a subgroup of $(F,+)$ such that $\forall x \in F, \exists ! g \in G, g \leq x < g+1$ then the group $(F,+) / G$ is isomorphic to the ""torus"" $([0;1[_F,\underline{+})$ where $x\underline{+}y = x+y \ \mod 1$. This torus need not be isomorphic to ${{\mathbb{S}}^1}_F = \{(x,y) \in F^2 \ | \ x^2 + y^2 = 1\}$ with $(x,y)\underline{.}(z,t) = (x.z-y.t,x.t+y.z)$. -No integer part over $F$ is definable in $(F,+,.,0,1)$.","['ordered-fields', 'abstract-algebra', 'model-theory']"

1504078,When does continuity with probability one imply mean-square continuity,"Wikipedia's page on continuous stochastic process defines continuity with probability one if $\lim_{s \to t} X_s = X_t$ almost everywhere and mean-square continuity if the process has finite second moments and $\lim_{s\to t} \mathrm{E}|X_s - X_t|^2$. It then goes on stating that neither implies the other. My question is: Under what circumstanes/additional assumptions does one imply the other? Originally, I thought continuity with probability one implies mean-square (for a second-order process) from the continuity of the norm, i.e. $X_t \to X \Rightarrow \|X_t\| \to \|X\|$, where $\|X\|=E|X|^2$, however perhaps this does not hold because we only have an a.e. convergence.

It goes like this: Lets define $\forall n\in \Bbb N\ h_n:X\rightarrow \Bbb R\ $ as $$\ h_n(x)=f_n(x)+g(x)\ \forall\ x\in X$$ So clearly $h_n$ is measurable $\forall n\in \Bbb N$, because $f_n\in M(X,S)\ \forall n\in \Bbb N\ $ and $g\in M^+(X,S)$. And we get that $h_n\ge 0\ (a.e.-\mu)\ \forall n\in \Bbb N$ Now let $$l_m=\inf_{k\ge m} \{ h_k \}\ \forall m\in \Bbb N\ $$

First I noted that $p$ is prime ideal because it's kernel of the map $\phi:k[x,y,z] \to k[t]$ defined by $x \to t^3,y \to t^5,z \to t^7$. Clearly $p^2$ will have many generators. Also as rad$(p^2)=p$, so $p^2$ is not a radical ideal. (Therefore I think it's not easy to decompose $p^2$.) So I was wondering is there really a ""good"" way to find primary decomposition of $p^2$. I don't really see any ""good"" way to find primary decomposition of $p^2$ by hand. Any idea/suggestion? Added: As a hint I was told by my Prof. that the $p$-primary component of $p^2$ will be $p^{(2)}$. But still I'm unable to complete this.

Also clearly $p^2 \subseteq p^{(2)}$, hence $(p^2,f) \subseteq p^{(2)}$. But Macaulay2 says that $(p^2,f)$ is the $p$-primary component.

1505253,Proof that solvable permutation group whose fixed point set is restricted contains regular normal subgroup or Frobenius group on orbits,"Let $p$ be a prime. Let $G$ be a solvable, non-regular, transitive permutation group such that some element fixes no point, and each element fixing some point fixes exactly $p$ points. Suppose that for $g \notin N_G(G_{\alpha})$ we have
  $$
 G_{\alpha}^g \cap G_{\alpha} = 1
$$
  and that $p$ does not divide the order of $G_{\alpha}$. Then $G$ has a regular normal subgroup $R$ or $G$ has an intransitive normal subgroup $F$ of index $p$ which acts as a Frobenius group on its $p$ orbits. Proof: Let $G$ be a counter-example of minimal order. Let $N$ be an elementary abelian normal subgroup of $G$. As $N_{\alpha} \le G_{\alpha}$, but $p$ does not divide the order of $G_{\alpha}$ we have $N_{\alpha} = 1$, i.e. $N$ acts semi-regularly on $\Omega$. Since $G$ is a counter-example, $N$ is not transitive. Let $\Sigma$ be the orbits of $N$, and let $\Delta$ be the orbit containing $\alpha$. Then $G/N$ acts on the set $\Sigma$ and $G_{\alpha}N / N$ is the stabilizer of $\Delta$. 
Let $\overline \alpha$ be the set of fixed points of $G_{\alpha}$. Since $G$ acts transitive, the size of each block divides the order of $G$, and hence $\overline \alpha$ is a minimal $G$-block. Also since the orbits of $N$ are $G$-blocks, we have that either $\Delta \cap \overline \alpha = \overline \alpha$ or $\Delta \cap \overline \alpha = \{\alpha\}$. Let $g \in G_{\alpha}$ and assume that $g$ fixes an orbits $\Delta'$ of $N$, i.e. $\langle g \rangle$ opertes on $\Delta'$. If $g$ would have no fixed point, then we would have by an orbit decomposition that $|\Delta'| = k\cdot o(g)$ for some $k$. But $|\Delta'| = |N|$, which is a $p$-group, and $o(g)$ does not divide $p$, so $g$ must have a fixed point in $\Delta'$ (which must come from $\overline a$). Hence if $\overline \alpha \subseteq \Delta$, $G / N$ acts as a Frobenious group on $\Delta$ and the action of $G/N$ on $\Sigma$ is faithful. I do not understand why $G/N$ acts as a Frobenious group, i.e. that it is non-regular and each $gN$ fixes at most one point. If $gN$ fixes some point, then this is equivalent to the statement that $g$ fixes some orbit $\Delta'$ of $N$, but in general we do not have $g \in G_{\alpha}$, so I do not see how the previous comments apply? Let $R / N$ be the Frobenious kernel. Then $R$ acts regularly on $\Omega$, which is impossible. If $r \in R, r \ne 1$ would fix some $\beta^r = \beta$ and $\Delta'$ denotes the orbit of $N$ containing $\beta$, then as this is a block we would have $(\Delta')^r = \Delta'$, i.e. $rN$ fixes a point, which is not possible by definition of the kernel. So this is clear to me. Therefore each of the orbits of $N$ contains at most one of the points of $\overline \alpha$ and $G / N$ acts in such a way that some element fixes no point, and each element fixing some point fixes exactly $p$ points. Here I do not understand why $G/N$ acts in that way? If $|\Sigma| = p$ then $G$ would not be a counter-example. What condition is precisely violated so that this is not a counter-example? Hence $|\Sigma| > p$ and $G/N$ acts faithfully on $\Sigma$. Therefore the assertion holds for $G/N$. I do not see why the point stabilizers are not divisible by $p$ and the intersection of different conjugates of the point stabilizers is trivial? Again, if $R/N$ acts regularly on $\Sigma$ then $R$ acts regularly on $\Sigma$, which is impossible. Thus $G/N$ has an intransitive normal subgroup $F/N$ of index $p$ acting as a Frobenious group on its $p$ orbits. Each of the $p$ orbits of $F$ on $\Sigma$ contains exactly one of the points of $\overline \alpha$. Hence $F$ acts as a Frobenious group on $\Omega$, and we have a contradiction, proving the assertion. $\square$ I have some difficulty following the arguments in the proof. I have marked the parts I am unsure about. Maybe some additional remark, by saying $\overline \alpha$ is the set of fixed points of $G_{\alpha}$ we used the fact that each element from the point stabilizer has the same set of $p$ fixed points, i.e. the set $\overline \alpha$. This uses the assumption that different point stabilizers intersect trivial, I can supply a proof of this fact if wanted!","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'group-actions']"

1505354,Can I think of Algebra like this?,"This year in Algebra we first got introduced to the concept of equations with variables. Our teacher is doing a great job of teaching us how to do them, except for one thing: He isn't telling us what we are actually doing when simplifying/solving for an equation. Instead of telling us we are adding or subtracting something from both sides, he tells us we are just moving something over the equals sign. Take, for example, this simple equation. $3x+5=2x+10$ We have to get all ""x"" terms on one side, so I originally thought we subtract 2x from both sides, leaving $x+5=10$ But that isn't how he teaches it.
He says: We have to get all ""x"" terms on one side, so we move 2x over the equals sign, and whenever anything goes over the equals sign it becomes negative, so we have: $-2x+3x+5=10$ and then we can combine like terms to get
$x+5=10$ Yes, they are basically doing the same thing, but my teachers way over complicates things a bit, and my main concern is that my classmates seem to think we can move the $2x$ over by ""magic"" and don't know that we are just subtracting it from both sides.

By Poincaré-duality, there exists some $\beta \in H^{n-k}(M,\mathbb Z)$ such that $\alpha \cup \beta$ is generator of $H^n(M,\mathbb Z)$. But $f^*$ is natural with respect to cup products and an isomorphism in top cohomology. We arrive at a contradiction, since $H^k(S^n) = 0$ for $0 < k < n$. Taking $\mathbb Q$ coefficients (thereby killing torsion), we have that $f$ induces an isomorphism on all homology groups with $\mathbb Q$ coefficients. Since $M'$ was assumed to be simply connected, it follows by the rational Hurewicz theorem that $f$ induces an isomorphism on all homotopy groups tensored with $\mathbb Q$ . The Whitehead theorem , however, cannot be imediately applied now. Is there any other way to conclude that $f$ is a homotopy equivalence ?","['homotopy-theory', 'algebraic-topology', 'general-topology']"
1505507,The birthday problem when the order is not important,"Suppose that we are interested in the probability that in a set of $n$ randomly chosen people at least two people share the same birthday. We make the assumption that each day of the year (except February 29) is equally probable for a birthday. Such problem is called the birthday problem . It seems that there are two ways to obtain this probability:
$$
p(n)=1-\frac{365\cdot364\cdot\ldots\cdot(365-n+1)}{365^n}
$$
and
$$
q(n)=1-{365\choose n}\biggl/{365+n-1\choose n}
$$
using stars and bars . When we calculate $p(n)$, the order of people is important. However, when we calculate $q(n)$, the order is not important, we can only tell how many people have a birthday on a particular day. Usually only the probability $p(n)$ is calculated. The probability $p(n)$ is lower than the probability $q(n)$ as we see in the graph. Does it make sense to calculate probability $q(n)$? How can I intuitively understand why these probabilities are different (it might seem that the importance of order should not affect the final answer)? Which one is the right way to calculate the probability in the birthday problem? Any help is much appreciated!","['combinations', 'probability', 'birthday', 'combinatorics']"
1505583,Exact meaning of Lebesgue integral's domain,"As an economist trying to learn probability theory, I have become quite confused regarding some of the essentials of Lebesgue integration. Say we are working with a Lebesgue integral for a non-negative measurable function $f$ on a measure space $(X,E,u)$ with the usual definition: $$\int_{X}^{}f\,du$$ Intuitively, I understand the above to be the area under the graph of $f(X)$, where the x-axis is ""represented"" by the measure $u$. Let's say we wanted to calculate a sub-section of this area. It is then common to see something ala: $$\int_{X}^{}f(x)1_{A}\,du=\int_{A}^{}f(x)\,du$$ where $A \in E$. But what does $\int_{A}^{}f(x)\,du$ actually mean? Is this the integral on $f(x)$ defined on a new measure space $(A,E,u)$? I am especially confused by this, when we start delving into probability theory, where the above integrals would equate to $E[X]$. Here it does not seem possible to me to change the underlying probability space, as I understand $(\Omega, \mathbb{F}, \mathbb{P})$ to be somewhat ""fixed"". Any intuition or explanation of above would be much appreciated!","['probability-theory', 'lebesgue-integral']"

1505669,Eigenvectors and ''eigenrows'',"Usually we search the eigenvectors of a matrix $M$ as the vectors that span a subspace that is invariant by left multiplication by the matrix: $M\vec x= \lambda \vec x$. If we take the transpose problem $\mathbf x M=\lambda \mathbf x$, where $\mathbf x$ is a row vector, we see that the eigenvalues are the same, but the ''eigenrows'' are not the transpose of the eigenvector (in general). E.g., for the matrix 
$$\left[
\matrix{0&1\\2&1}
\right]
$$ we find, for the eigenvalue $\lambda=2$,
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0&1\\2&1

\left[

2\left[

1505680,Prove Two Equivalence Relations are Equal,"I'm doing a self-study through Velleman's ""How to Prove It"" and am working through exercises on equivalence relations.  My proof for the statement below seems unconvincing, and am wondering if someone can help me fill the gaps in the argument. Thanks in advance! Suppose $R$ and $S$ are equivalence relations on $A$ and $A/R = A/S$.  Prove that $R = S$. Proof: Let $(x, y)$ be an element of $R$.  Since $R$ is an equivalence relation, then $x \sim y$, and so $x \in [y]_R$ and $y \in [y]_R$. By definition of $A/R$, we can choose some $X \in A/R$ such that both $x$ and $y$ are elements of $X$.  But since $X \in A/R$,  then $X \in A/S$. And since $S$ is an equivalence relation on $A$, and $x \in X$ and $y \in X$, then $(x, y)$ is also an element of $S$.  Since $(x, y)$ is an arbitrary element of $R$, we have $R \subset S$.  The proof for $S \subset R$ proceeds in the same manner.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"

Is there an instance of PT (a given $a$, $b$ and $c$) where there exists a tiling of all three squares in congruent shapes? Well, yes, there is one, where $a = b$: where it is easy to count the smaller triangles in each square by inspection and add $8 + 8 = 16$. The tiles only happen to be similar to the original triangle. I am curious if there is one where $a < b$, or a proof (or proof idea) that one cannot exist. The tiles can be similar to the triangle or not, as long as they are all congruent. The idea is to give a simple verification of the single PT instance by counting the tiles.","['tiling', 'geometry']"
