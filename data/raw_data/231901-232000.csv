4823629,"Where does ""A family of compact sets with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection"" lie between $T_1$ and $T_2$?","This question is a follow-up of sorts to a recent question by Steven Clontz about the property that (arbitrary) intersections of compact sets are compact (abbreviated "" $IKK$ "" in that question). I am interested in a stronger property ("" $KIP$ "" defined below), and where $KIP+T_1$ lies between $T_1$ and $T_2$ . I'll give definitions and some results, then conclude with my question and attempts. Definition. Throughout, we say a family of sets $\mathcal F$ has the finite intersection property ( $FIP$ ) if every finite intersection $F_1\cap\dots\cap F_n$ , with each $F_k\in \mathcal F$ , is nonempty. Let $X$ be a topological space.  We say $X$ has the compact intersection property (abbreviated "" $KIP$ "") if every family of compact subsets of $X$ with the $FIP$ has nonempty intersection. Below, we shall often abuse grammar and say things like "" $X$ is $KIP$ "" do indicate $X$ has the compact intersection property. It is immediate that any space in which compact subsets are closed ("" $KC$ "") must be $KIP$ .  In particular, this holds for all Hausdorff spaces. Consequences. Lemma 1. $KIP\implies IKK$ Proof. Let $X$ be $KIP$ , and suppose $\mathcal K$ is a family of compact sets.  We wish to show $\bigcap \mathcal K$ is compact. To this end, suppose $\mathcal C$ is a family of (relatively) closed subsets of $\bigcap \mathcal K$ , having the finite intersection property.  Let $\mathcal S$ be the family of all closed subsets $S\subseteq X$ such that $S\cap \bigcap\mathcal K\in \mathcal C$ .  Then for any finite collections $S_1,\dots,S_n\in \mathcal S$ and $K_1,\dots,K_n\in \mathcal K$ , we have $$\bigcap_{i=1}^n(K_i\cap S_i)\supseteq (S_1\cap\dots\cap S_n)\cap \bigcap \mathcal K\neq \emptyset,$$ since the latter intersection is a finite intersection of members of $\mathcal C$ .  Therefore the family $\mathcal K':=\{K\cap S\mid K\in\mathcal K,S\in\mathcal S\}$ is a family of compact sets with the $FIP$ , and thus by $KIP$ has nonempty intersection.  But then $$\emptyset\neq \bigcap \mathcal K'=\left(\bigcap \mathcal K\right)\cap \left(\bigcap \mathcal S\right)=\bigcap \mathcal C.$$ Thus every family of closed subsets of $\bigcap \mathcal K$ with the $FIP$ has nonempty intersection, hence $\bigcap \mathcal K$ is compact. Lemma 2. $KIP+T_1\implies US$ (""Convergent sequences have unique limits."") Proof. Suppose $X$ is $T_1$ , and not $US$ .  Let $x_n\in X$ be a sequence with $x_n\to x$ and $x_n\to y$ , $x\neq y$ .  Since $X$ is $T_1$ , $x_n$ must contain infinitely many distinct members, and so we may suppose with no loss of generality that the sequence $x_n$ consists of distinct elements not equal to $x$ or $y$ .  Letting $S_N=\{x_n\mid n\geq N\}\cup \{x\}$ and $T_N=\{x_n\mid n\geq N\}\cup\{y\}$ , we see that $\mathcal K:=\{S_N\mid N\in \mathbb N\}\cup\{T_N\mid N\in \mathbb N\}$ is a family of compact sets with the $FIP$ , yet $\bigcap \mathcal K=\emptyset$ , so $X$ is not $KIP$ . Equivalent formulation. A perhaps more tangible formulation of $KIP$ is the following: Lemma 3. $X$ is $KIP$ if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied: Pairwise intersections of compact subsets are compact ("" $IKK_2$ ""). Every family of nonempty compact subsets of $X$ , directed under reverse inclusion, has nonempty intersection (""Nonempty nested compact intersections”, or "" $NKI$ ""). Proof. If $X$ is $KIP$ then the first property follows from Lemma 1, and the second is immediate from the definition, since any family of nonempty subsets directed under reverse inclusion must have the $FIP$ . Conversely, if $X$ satisfies the preceding two properties, and $\mathcal K$ is a family of compact subsets of $X$ with the $FIP$ , then the family $\mathcal K'$ of finite intersections of members of $\mathcal K$ is a directed system of nonempty compact sets, and so $\bigcap \mathcal K=\bigcap\mathcal K'\neq \emptyset$ . In $ZFC$ . So far, everything we have said is valid in $ZF$ .  Now, even in $ZFC$ , a family of nonempty sets directed under reverse inclusion need not have a cofinal chain (consider, as a counter-example, the family of cofinite subsets of any uncountable set).  Nonetheless, in $ZFC$ we may replace the directed families in Lemma 3 with well-ordered chains: Lemma 4. In $ZFC$ , $X$ is $KIP$ if and only if the following conditions are satisfied: Pairwise intersections of compact subsets are compact. Every chain of nonempty compact subsets of $X$ , well-ordered under reverse inclusion, has nonempty intersection. Proof. From Lemma 3, $KIP$ spaces certainly satisfy the preceding properties.  Conversely, we suppose the preceding properties are satisfied, and argue by transfinite induction that for every cardinal $\kappa$ , and every family $\mathcal K$ of compact subsets of $X$ , having the $FIP$ , and cardinality at most $\kappa$ , $\bigcap \mathcal K$ is nonempty and compact. To see this, note the claim is true for finite cardinals.  If it is true for all cardinals $\kappa'<\kappa$ , and $\mathcal K$ has cardinality $\kappa$ , then let $\lambda\mapsto K_\lambda$ be a bijection $\kappa\to \mathcal K$ , and for each $\lambda<\kappa$ define $J_\lambda:=\bigcap_{\alpha\leq \lambda}K_\alpha$ .  Then by inductive assumption $\{J_\lambda\}$ is a well-ordered chain of nonempty compact subsets, so by the second property $\bigcap \mathcal K=\bigcap_{\lambda<\kappa} J_\lambda\neq \emptyset$ . Moreover, if $\mathcal C$ is a family of closed subsets of $\bigcap \mathcal K$ with the $FIP$ , then as in the proof of Lemma 1, we let $\mathcal S$ be the family of all closed subsets $S\subseteq X$ such that $S\cap \bigcap \mathcal K\in \mathcal C$ .  Then for each $\lambda<\kappa$ , and any finite collection $S_1,\dots,S_n\in\mathcal S$ , we have $$S_1\cap\dots\cap S_n\cap J_\lambda\supseteq S_1\cap\dots \cap S_n\cap \bigcap \mathcal K\neq \emptyset,$$ so the family $\mathcal S_\lambda:=\{S\cap J_\lambda\mid S\in \mathcal S\}$ has the finite intersection property.  Since $J_\lambda$ is compact, we have $J_\lambda\cap \bigcap \mathcal S=\bigcap \mathcal S_\lambda\neq \emptyset$ .  Therefore $\{J_\lambda\cap \bigcap \mathcal S\}$ is a well ordered chain of nonempty compact sets under reverse inclusion, and so $$\bigcap \mathcal C=\left(\bigcap \mathcal S\right)\cap \left(\bigcap \mathcal K\right)= \left(\bigcap \mathcal S\right)\cap \left(\bigcap_{\lambda<\kappa} J_\lambda \right)\neq \emptyset.$$ Since this holds for any family $\mathcal C$ of closed subsets of $\bigcap \mathcal K$ satisfying the $FIP$ , $\bigcap \mathcal K$ is compact. Question. In general, $KIP$ spaces need not be $T_1$ , and in fact it is easy to see that every finite topological space is $KIP$ .  Moreover, even in a $T_1$ space, the properties $IKK_2$ and $NKI$ from Lemma 3 are insufficient, separately, to guarantee $US$ :  If only $T_1$ and $IKK_2$ are assumed (or even $IKK$ itself), then the cofinite topology on an infinite set will give an example that is not $US$ .    If only $T_1$ and $NKI$ are assumed, $[0,\omega]$ with a doubled endpoint gives an example that fails $US$ . Therefore it seems $KIP+T_1$ spaces may be reasonable objects of study.  Where does this property fall among other properties between $T_1$ and $T_2$ ?  Particularly, those discussed in this answer ? Attempts. We know that $KC\implies KIP+T_1\implies US$ .  Moreover, the second implication is strict, as can be seen by the example of $[0,\omega_1]$ with a doubled endpoint , which is $US$ , but fails $IKK_2$ , hence fails $KI$ . I suspect the first implication is strict as well (it in fact is, see update), with a possible example in $X=\mathbb Q^*\times\mathbb Q^*$ , the square of the one-point compactification of the rationals . $X$ is not $KC$ (the diagonal being compact and not closed), but $X$ is $NKI$ (this follows from the fact that $\mathbb Q^*$ is $KC$ , hence $KIP$ , hence $NKI$ , and it is relatively straightforward to show that a product of two $T_1$ $NKI$ spaces is again $NKI$ ). However, I ran into trouble trying to determine whether $X$ is $IKK_2$ .  I expect there should be either a straightforward proof of this, or a straightforward counter-example, but both have so far eluded me. Update. I neglected to consider the one point compactification of the Arens-Fort space , discussed here .  Subsets there are compact if and only if they are either finite, or contain the point at infinity.  From this, $KIP$ is immediate, yet this space is not $KC$ or even weak Hausdorff , though it is $k_2$ -Hausdorff . Given that the implication $KC\implies KIP+T_1$ is indeed strict, it remains to show how $KIP+T_1$ relates to the aforementioned properties (i.e., does weak Hausdorff imply $KIP$ , and is there an implication in either direction for $k_2$ -Hausdorff?) or any other weak separation axioms. Addendum. Let me add one additional set of observations that I didn't mention originally.  They weren't particularly fruitful for me, but might be of some use that I didn't see: If $X=(X,\tau)$ is a topological space, let $\tau_{cc}\subseteq \mathcal P(X)$ consist of the co-compact subsets of $X$ , together with the empty set.  Then $\tau_{cc}$ is a topology if and only if $X$ is $IKK$ .  In this case $\tau_{cc}$ is always $T_1$ . $\tau_{cc}$ is a compact topology if and only if $X$ is $KIP$ . $\tau_{cc}\subseteq \tau$ if and only if $X$ is $KC$ . $\tau_{cc}\supseteq \tau$ if and only if $X$ is compact.","['separation-axioms', 'general-topology', 'compactness']"
4823753,Magical relationship between Exponential distribution and Poisson process,"Consider i.i.d. random variables $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ satisfying exponential distribution $\operatorname{Exp}(1)$ . Let $Y=X_1+X_2+\ldots+X_n$ . We know that the p.d.f. of $Y$ is the Gamma distribution $$
f_Y(t)=\frac{t^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}e^{-t}, (t\geq 0).
$$ What surprised me is that this is exactly the p.m.f. of a Poisson distribution with parameter $t$ . Define a Poisson process with rate $1$ , $N_t$ , then $\frac{t^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}e^{-t}$ equals $P(N_t=n-1)$ . Since we can define Poisson process with i.i.d. exponentials, we actually can write $$
P\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}X_i\leq t, \sum_{i=1}^n X_i>t\right)= P(N_t=n-1)=\frac{t^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}e^{-t}.

4823846,Less than or equal on random variables,"Casella and Berger exercise 2.15 asks to prove ( $Y$ and $X$ are any random variables): $E[\max(X,Y)] = E[X] + E[Y] - E[\min(X,Y)]$ , in the solution it gives: Assume without loss of generality that $X \le Y$ . Then $\max(X, Y) = Y$ and $\min(X, Y) = X$ . Thus $X + Y = \max(X, Y) + \min(X, Y)$ . Taking expectations $E[X + Y] = E[\max(X,Y) + \min(X,Y)] = E[\max(X,Y)] + E[\min(X,Y)]$ .
Therefore $E[\max(X,Y)] = E[X] + E[Y] − E[\min(X, Y)]$ . How shall I think of $X \le Y$ ""without loss of generality"". Is this stochastic dominance (but then I would not think we can assume it without loss of generality)? Or does it mean something else?","['expected-value', 'statistics']"
4823865,Maximum value of linear combination of sinusoids,"Given a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ , is there a way to calculate the maximum value of the following function? $$f(\theta) = \sum_{j=1}^n a_j \cos(j \theta)$$ More specifically, I need to know whether $f(\theta)$ ever exceeds a given value $N$ . I expect this to be true for most of the sequences being tested. My approach so far has been to simply evaluate the function at 101 different points $\theta = 0, \frac\pi{100}, \dots, \frac{99\pi}{100}, \pi$ . The maximum result, $M$ , is a lower bound on the maximum value of $f$ , and I simply test whether $M \gt N$ . The benefit of this approach is that it can't give a false positive (if $M > N$ , then $f$ certainly exceeds $N$ at some point). But is there an alternative (with similar computational complexity) that could give a tighter lower-bound - and hence reduce the likelihood of a false negative ( $M <= N$ but $f$ still exceeds $N$ somewhere)? Edit: Newton's Method, as described below, is a definite improvement over the above approach. I tested using a set of 100,000 sequences of length 20, for all of which the function $f$ exceeds $N$ at some point. Evaluating $f$ at 100 points, as above, was sufficient to confirm that $N$ is exceeded in 99.6% of cases. Reducing the number of evaluations to 25 took only 30% as much time, but could only confirm 92.6%. Using 25 evaluations and Newton's Method, however, confirmed 99.7% in 50% of the time. Are there other methods, similar to Newton's or otherwise, that might improve things further? Perhaps something specific to sinusoidal functions?","['optimization', 'trigonometry', 'numerical-methods']"
4823901,Probability measures on the hypersphere $\Bbb S^{n-1}$ and the $O(n)$ isomorphisms,"Let $\Bbb S^{n-1}$ denotes the unit sphere in $\Bbb R^n$ and let $O(n)$ be the group of all orthogonal linear transformations on $\Bbb R^n$ . For any (outer) measure $\mu$ on $\Bbb R^n$ , the pushforward of $\mu$ by $T\in O(n)$ is defined as $T_{\#}\mu(E) := \mu(T^{-1}(E))$ . It is clear that the pushforward under $T\in O(n)$ maps a probability measure on $\Bbb S^{n-1}$ to another probability measure on $\Bbb S^{n-1}$ . Suppose that $f\in C(\Bbb S^{n-1})$ satisfies the condition $$
\int_{\Bbb S^{n-1}} f \,d\mu = \int_{\Bbb S^{n-1}} f \,dT_{\#}\mu \quad \text{for all } \ T\in O(n), \tag{*}\label{*}

$$ where $\mathcal H^{n-1}$ is the $n-1$ dimensional Hausdorff measure? Of course, the case where $\mu$ is a Dirac mass $\delta_x$ for some $x\in\Bbb S^{n-1}$ is clear, and, in fact, we can trivially conclude that $f$ must be a constant function. One might be tempted to conjecture that the condition $\eqref{*}$ implies that $f$ must be a constant function, but that is false . We can already find a counterexample to the stronger conjecture by considering $\mu$ to be a sum of Dirac masses: $\mu = \frac1n (\delta_{e_1} + \cdots + \delta_{e_n})$ and $f(x) = x\cdot Ax$ for any $n\times n$ matrix $A$ . Indeed, in this case we have $$
\int_{\Bbb S^{n-1}} f \,d\mu = \frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^n e_i\cdot Ae_i = \frac{\text{Tr}(A)}{n},
$$ and the statement that $\eqref{*}$ holds follows from the well-known fact that the trace of a matrix $A$ is invariant under a change of an orthogonal basis. Clearly, $f$ is not a constant function, but it is not hard to show that $$
\frac{\text{Tr}(A)}{n} = \frac{1}{\mathcal H^{n-1}(\Bbb S^{n-1})} \int_{\Bbb S^{n-1}} x\cdot Ax \,d\mathcal H^{n-1}(x)
$$ using the divergence theorem and that fact that $\text{Tr}(A) = \text{div}\, Ax$ . This question is largely inspired by the example regarding the trace that I mentioned above. I restrict $f$ in this question to be a continuous function since I feel like there might be a beautiful proof using the duality between continuous functions and Radon measures on $\Bbb S^{n-1}$ . I am aware of the existence of the things called measures on homogeneous spaces that generalize Haar measures, but aside from that, I know next to nothing about it. I welcome a proof that uses ideas from that theory, but would like to read a proof that doesn't use it as well, even if it might be longer and less elegant.","['measure-theory', 'fourier-analysis', 'lie-algebras', 'real-analysis', 'probability']"
4823986,"Does there exist a function $\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ whose directional derivatives are infinity in almost every direction, at all points?","For $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbf{r}\in S^1$ (here $S^1=\{\mathbf{r}\in \mathbb{R}^2: \|\mathbf{r}\|=1\}$ ), let us write $f'(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{r})=\infty$ if $\liminf\limits_{t\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(\mathbf{x}+t\mathbf{r})-f(\mathbf{x})}{t}=\infty$ . My question is the following: does there exist a (not necessarily measurable) function $f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , such that for all $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^2$ , the set $$\{\mathbf{r}\in S^1: f'(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{r})=\infty\text{ or }f'(\mathbf{x};-\mathbf{r})=\infty\}$$ has full measure as a subset of $S^1$ ? Here $S^1$ is equipped with the ""arc length"" measure. Can a function $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be ""infinitely steep"" on a set with non-zero Lebesgue outer measure? tells us that on any line parallell to $\mathbf{r}$ , the set of points $\mathbf{x}$ for which $f'(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{r})=\infty\text{ or }f'(\mathbf{x};-\mathbf{r})=\infty$ , is a null set. One is then tempted to argue that by Tonelli's, the set $$A=\{(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{x})\in S^1\times \mathbb{R}^2: f'(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{r})=\infty\text{ or }f'(\mathbf{x};-\mathbf{r})=\infty\}$$ is a null set. On the other hand, Tonelli's seems to imply that when $\{\mathbf{r}\in S^1: f'(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{r})=\infty\text{ or }f'(\mathbf{x};-\mathbf{r})=\infty\}$ has full measure for all $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^2$ , then $A$ has full measure, so there appears to be a contradiction. However, none of these applications of Tonelli are valid, since Tonelli only works when one integrates over a measurable set and a set may be non-measurable even if all of its sections are null sets. Indeed, there are non-measurable subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ for which all sections are singletons (see https://mathoverflow.net/questions/89375/sections-measure-zero-imply-set-is-measure-zero ). All of this is to say, I cannot straightforwardly deduce from the "" $1$ -dimensional case"", i.e. the first link, that that there cannot exist a function with the properties as in my question. My hope is that I have not overlooked some obvious argument here and that either the answer to my question is negative for some ""deeper"" reason, or, even better, that the answer is affirmative!","['measure-theory', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"

4824174,What is the sum of an infinite resistor ladder with geometric progression?,"I am trying to solve for the equivalent resistance $R_{\infty}$ of an infinite resistor ladder network with geometric progression as in the image below, with the size of the resistors in each section double the size of the previous section. For those not familiar with the calculations for summing resistors, here is a quick recap: There are standard solutions in the literature for infinite resistor ladder networks without geometric progression such as the one below (where $R_x$ is simply R multiplied by a factor of x). The trick here is to replace all of the resistors to the right of the first two with a single resistor of value $R_y$ ... ... and realise that because the network is infinite, the first two resistors make no difference and so $R_{\infty} = R_y$ . The problem becomes finding the combined resistance of the two resistors in parallel $R_x$ and $R_y$ which by the rules of adding resistors is $\frac{R_y R_x}{R_y +R_x}$ and simply adding them to the resistor $R$ that is in series with the rest. We then get the equation: $R_{\infty} = \frac{R_y R_x}{R_y +R_x} + R \rightarrow \frac{R_{\infty} R_x}{R_{\infty} +R_x} + R$ and solve for $R_{\infty}$ using the quadratic solution and the result is: $R_{\infty}= \frac R 2 (1+\sqrt{4x +1} )$ For R=1 and x=1, the result is $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$ which interestingly enough is the golden ratio. For the original problem with the geometric progression, all the rungs are not the same and we can not use the standard trick. Doing it the hard way the first few steps of a small finite geometric ladder are: First rung = 2, First 2 rungs = 9/5 = 1.8, First 3 rungs = 41/23 $\approx 1.78260$ , First 4 rungs = 187/105 $\approx 1.78095$ , First 5 rungs = 853/479 $\approx 1.78079$ , which appears to be converging rapidly toward somewhere around 1.7. It is known by the properties of resistors that the result must be between $1<R_{\infty} <2$ After investigating the pattern for a while it emerges that there is a recursive relationship. If we represent the irreducible fraction for the resistance of each step as A'/B' and the previous step as A/B then the recursive relationship is $$\frac {A'}{B'} = \frac {4A+B}{2A+B}$$ . For example, the first step has a resistance of 2/1. The next step has a total resistance of $\frac{4 * 2 +1}{2 * 2 +1}  = \frac 9 5$ . The result always appears to be an irreducible fraction without requiring a reduction step. This is where I get stuck. It does not seem to be possible to find the limit as n goes to infinity for a recursive formula so I was wondering how to convert the recursive formula to a closed form? P.S. Should I remove the preamble where I recap the formulas for finding the equivalent resistance of resistor circuits? I added it because I assumed the mathematic experts here are not necessarily physics experts. P.P.S.

Find at least two extensions of $ℓ(x, y, z) := x$ from $Y$ to $X$ which preserve the norm. What if we take $Y := \{(x, y, z) ∈ X|x + y = 0\}$ ? My first approach (I am pretty unfamiliar with extensions of linear functionals, so I try to be as precise as possible): clearly our linear functional $l(x,y,z)$ is bounded since $|l(x,y,z)| = |x| \leq |x| + |y| + |z| = |(x,y,z)|_{1}$ . At this point, we can say that Hahn-Banach tells us that the existence of such an extension (which preserves the norm!) is guaranteed. So, we have $||l|| \leq 1$ . I am a little bit unsure about this point but by taking $y = z = 0$ , we see that we get equality and I think therefore we can conclude that $||l|| = 1$ (even though I am open to more elaborate suggestions about that). Now, my guess would be that $l(x,y,z) = y$ and $l(x,y,z) = z$ are two extensions of $l$ which also should preserve the norm. However, I am not really able to show that.

To me this seems incorrect but given that it is central to the paper I am seeking a sanity check and likely missing something obvious. Note that the definition of $U$ is irrelevant to the question, $D_G, D$ are symmetric and positive definite matrices, and $\omega$ is some positive constant. Note that the exponent in the LHS can be written as $$
-\|D_G u\|^2_2/2 - \omega \|D u\|^2/2

\tau_t(A) = e^{i t T} A \, e^{- i t T}

Question: How can one prove this equivalence, especially the implication that strong continuity implies boundedness of $T$ ? Since $T$ is self-adjoint, it would suffice to show that $\mathrm{dom}(T) = H$ . I thought about mimicking the well-known proof of the fact that a strongly continuous one-parameter group of operators is uniformly continuous iff its generator is defined everywhere, but this did not work out as I hoped. Context of the question: If $T$ is interpreted as the Hamiltonian of a quantum system, then the group $(\tau_t)$ describes the time evolution of (bounded) observables of the system. Hence, the above statement implies that the quantum dynamical system $(\mathscr{B}(H), \tau_t)$ is a $C^\ast$ -dynamical system iff $T$ is bounded.","['operator-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'mathematical-physics', 'operator-algebras']"

4824472,"Given collinear points $A$, $B$, $C$, a variable line through $C$ meets a conic at $P$ and $Q$. Why does $AP\cap BQ$ trace another conic?","At first, there are a fixed conic curve $\Gamma$ and three fixed collinear points $A,B,C$ . Draw a moving straight line $l$ through point C, intersecting $\Gamma$ at two points $P,Q$ . Find the two intersections $S=AP\cap BQ$ and $T=AQ\cap BP$ . As line $l$ move, $S$ and $T$ generate a locus $\Delta$ . Due to symmetry, $S$ and $T$ must have a common locus. I found that $\Delta$ will be a new conic curve. So the question is: why this is true? Use knowledge harmonic point sequences, the intersection of $ST$ and $AB$ is a fixed point $D$ that form a harmonic point sequences $[A,B;C,D]$ together with points $A,B,C$ . Suppose that $C$ is outside of $\Gamma$ . Make two tangent lines $CM,CN$ from $C$ to $\Gamma$ . Then the line $MN$ is the polar of $C$ in $\Gamma$ . Let $E$ be the intersection of $MN$ and $l$ . Through the image we can guess these two are right: $E$ is also the intersection of $MN$ and $ST$ . $DM,DN$ also tangent to $\Delta$ . The proof of the first guess is not too hard. Let $E'$ be the intersection of $ST$ and $l$ , then all that need to do is to prove $E=E'$ . According to the property of pole $C$ and polar $MN$ , $[C,E;P,Q]$ is a harmonic point sequences; according to the property of complete quadrangle $[A,B;P,Q;S,T]$ , $[C,E';P,Q]$ is also a harmonic point sequences; these two facts indecate $E=E'$ . The second guess suggest that $[C,\Gamma,P,Q]$ and $[D,\Delta,S,T]$ may be symmetric. This inspired me to turn to find that what's the relation between $\Gamma$ and $C,M,N$ . Or, if three points $C,M,N$ have been given, what conditions should a point $P$ meets in order to the locus of $P$ is a conic curve tangenting $CM,CN$ at $M,N$ . If this is finded, we can transfer the condition from $P$ or $Q$ to $S$ or $T$ , then $S$ or $T$ must meet the same condition and the locus of $S,T$ must be a conic curve tangenting $DM,DN$ at $M,N$ . The ratio $\dfrac{\overline{ME}}{\overline{EN}}$ uniquely determines the position of $E$ on $MN$ ; the position of $E$ determine the line $l$ ; and the other ratio $\dfrac{\overline{CP}}{\overline{PE}}$ also uniquely determines the position of $P$ on $l$ . So these two ratio must have a relation when $P$ moving on a fixed conic curve $\Gamma$ . By attempting on some special curve, I find this theorem: Theorem: Let $E$ be a moving point on $MN$ , and $P$ a point on $CE$ , then the locus of $P$ is a conic curve if and only if this equation holds: $$ \left(\frac{\overline{CP}}{\overline{PE}}\right)^2\frac{\overline{ME}\overline{EN}}{\overline{MN}^2}=\text{Const}$$ If the Theorem is true, by Menelaus's Theorem on triangle $\triangle CED$ and transversal line $PSA$ we know $\dfrac{\overline{CP}}{\overline{PE}}\times
\dfrac{\overline{ES}}{\overline{SD}}\times
\dfrac{\overline{DA}}{\overline{AC}}=-1$ .
So there is $\dfrac{\overline{DS}}{\overline{SE}}=
-\dfrac{\overline{DA}}{\overline{AC}}
\times\dfrac{\overline{CP}}{\overline{PE}}$ in which $-\dfrac{\overline{DA}}{\overline{AC}}$ is contant.Then $$
\left(\frac{\overline{DS}}{\overline{SE}}\right)^2
\frac{\overline{ME}\overline{EN}}{\overline{MN}^2}=
\left(\frac{\overline{DA}}{\overline{AC}}\right)^2
\left(\frac{\overline{CP}}{\overline{PE}}\right)^2
\frac{\overline{ME}\overline{EN}}{\overline{MN}^2}
=\text{Const}$$ and give what I want. Now I have these questions: How to prove the above theorem? How to explain the above theorem?

We will count the favorable possibilities. Note that if the leader leaves the building first or second, the agent can not follow the leader. Therefore, we need to consider the leader leaving third, fourth or fifth. If the leader is the third person to leave : the agent will follow him, no matter the order the other gangsters appear in. Number of possibilities: $4! = 24$ If the leader is the fifth person to leave : the second tallest gangster had to leave first or second in order for
the agent to follow the correct person. There are 3 remaining
possibilities for the other gangster leaving first or second. The
order of the remaining two gangsters is fixed: from largest to
smallest. Therefore, there are a total of $2\cdot 3\cdot 1 \cdot 1 =
   6$ possibilities to follow the leader if he appears last. If the leader is the fourth person to leave : We distinguish two cases: If the second tallest gangster appeared first or second, there is no problem. Number of possibilities: $2 \cdot 3! = 12$ . If the second talles gangster did not appear first or second, he needs to appear last. The third tallest gangster should then appear first or second, otherwise the agent will follow him. Therefore, there are $2\cdot 2\cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 4$ possibilities. This totals $24 + 6 + 12 + 4 = 46$ cases. Unfortunatly $46/120$ does not simplify to the desired answer. Question: What cases am I missing? I'm also interested to know other approaches to this problem. EDIT: as pointed out by Heropup and Bram28, I made a mistake in the part where the leader emerges last: the police only follows if a gangster is taller than all previous gangsters. Therefore, if the second tallest gangster left first or second, the police will follow the leader, no matter what order the other three gangster emerge. There are $2 \cdot 3! = 12$ possibilities instead of $6$ .}","['contest-math', 'recreational-mathematics', 'probability']"

Then there is a theorem that states that if there exists some $a_1$ for which: $$\mathcal{F}(a_1)\; \textrm{is well defined} \quad \textrm{and}\quad \partial_af(x,a)\;\textrm{is dominated}$$ Then $\mathcal{F}(a)$ can be redefined to: $$\mathcal{F}(a)=\mathcal{F}(a_1)+\int_{a_1}^{a}\textrm{d}y\int_0^\infty\textrm{d}x\;\partial_yf(x,y)$$ Which is then well defined on $a\in[a_0,\infty[$ .

I guess I'm wondering if with four or more, aside from the obvious chore of writing out all the terms, if there is some inherent lack of symmetry or 'niceness' present in the three-variable case that often rules them out. As an analogy, which is somewhat of a stretch, the cross-product is really only used in three dimensions. It exists in $\mathbb{R}^7$ , and is rotationally invariant, but doesn't satisfy the Jacobi identity : there's something special about $\mathbb{R}^3$ specifically.

Let $O_X(1)$ be a very ample invertible sheaf on $X$ . Then, the category $\operatorname{Coh}(X)$ of coherent sheaves on $X$ is equivalent to the category $\operatorname{qgr}(A):= \operatorname{gr}(A)/{\operatorname{tor}(A)}$ , where $A:= \bigoplus_{i \geq 0} H^0(X,O_X(1))$ and $\operatorname{qgr}(A)$ is the Serre quotient category of the category $\operatorname{gr}(A)$ of finitely generated graded $A$ -modules by the category $\operatorname{tor}(A)$ of finitely generated torsion $A$ -modules. Then, we have an isomorphism \begin{align}
\operatorname{Hom}_{O_X}(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}) &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \operatorname{Hom}_{\operatorname{gr}(A)}(\Gamma_{*}(\mathcal{F})_{\geq n}, \Gamma_{*}(\mathcal{G})_{\geq n})\\
 &(= \operatorname{Hom}_{\operatorname{qgr}(A)}(\Gamma_{*}(\mathcal{F}),\Gamma_{*}(\mathcal{G}))),

In that post the notion of bounded as a set is explained in a bit more detail and the requirements of Arzela-Ascoli theorem delved into as well. Recalling the definition of uniformly bounded, we have A set $M \subseteq C(X, \mathbb{R})$ is uniformly bounded if there exists $L > 0$ such that for all $f \in M$ if we have $sum_{x \in X} |f(x)| \le L$ . In the answer to the post the author @levap prefaces it saying, ""The conditions of Arzela-Ascoli are ""uniformly bounded"" and ""equicontinuous"" and not ""each function is bounded"" and ""each function is uniformly continuous"". The prefixes ""uniformly"" and ""equi"" suggest that those are conditions that are relevant for a set $M$ of functions and cannot be checked for each function $f \in M$ separately."" I thought that the set $M$ has to satisfy this fact that there exists a single constant $L$ that bounds all the functions in the set. In the comments to clarify @levap gives a wonderful example $M = \{nx | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ . He again reiterates his preface of not being able to check for each individual function. This is contrarian to my understanding. I was under the impression that there has to be a single constant that bounds all these functions and does so individually. So in my opinion the example that the author of the answer gave did not and does not satisfy the requirement of uniform boundedness. On the other hand, is the author saying we can do with a weaker condition than the stronger uniform boundedness condition that I have in mind?","['complex-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

4825276,"If two pairs of numbers have equal sums and products, what can we conclude about the pairs?","If two pairs of non-zero real numbers $\{a,b\},\{c,d\}$ have the property that the sum of the first pair equals the sum of the second pair, and the product of the first pair equals the product of the second pair, what can we conclude about the numbers? I believe both pairs must be identical, but am struggling to prove this. I've deleted my failed attempts to prove this from the OP; if you'd like to see them, they're in the history.  Below are the successful proofs, along with how we reached them Based on ""ancient mathematician's"" solution, I asked myself ""How could I come up with that?"" and worked out the following.  I request feedback on how someone could come up with any of these solutions given that the direct approach above did not work. Inspiration, Approach, Solution Intuitively, we suspect that the pairs are equal, since if $c = ar$ , then $b = a/r$ , implying that the $\Delta a$ by multiplying $a$ by $r$ is negative the $\Delta b$ by dividing by $r$ , which suggests $r = 1$ .  However, attempting to formalize this  proves difficult.  Why? Because in fact it's not correct to conclude that $a = c$ , only that $\{a,b\}  =\{c,d\}$ . It is the pairs that are equal, not the numbers .  And equations are about numbers, not pairs! How can we overcome this? One way is to ask ""What object does respect pairs?""  And the obvious answer is: A polynomial of degree 2.  That is, if $f$ and $g$ are polynomials of degree 2 with  identical pairs of roots, then $f = g$ . So we need to form a polynomial with roots $a,b$ .   And remembering ""Math has a tendency to reward you if you respect its symmetries"" , we form a second polynomial $g$ , aiming to show equality: $$f(x) = (x-a)(x-b)\\
g(x) = (x-c)(x-d).$$ Now multiply out $$f(x) = x^2 - (a+b)x +ab \\
g(x) = x^2 - (c +d)x + cd$$ and the result is trivial. Alternately... A similar path, based on ""user's"" solution: We need to prove $a = c \lor a = d$ , which can only be encoded via a 2nd degree polynomial: $(a-c)(a-d) = 0$ .  Working backwards temporarily: $$(a-c)(a-d) = 0\\
a^2 -a(c+d) +cd = 0\\
a^2 - a(a+b) + ab = 0\\
0 = 0.$$ Now let's work forwards: $$a^2 - a(a+b) + ab = 0\\
a^2 -a(c+d) +cd = 0\\
(a-c)(a-d) = 0\\
a = c \lor a = d$$ as desired.","['contest-math', 'algebra-precalculus']"
4825280,"Is $A \vert B$ an event, or is $P(A \vert B)$ an abuse of notation?","Suppose we have a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ .
Thus, when we write $P(A \vert B)$ , either $A \vert B$ is an element of the event space $\mathcal{F}$ (i.e. the domain of $P$ ), or this an abuse of notation.
I suspect that this is simply an abuse of notation, but I'm looking for two things here: Am I interpreting (that is ""unabusing"") this notation correctly? Is it possible to view $A \vert B$ as an event, even if this isn't the standard way of thinking about it? Notational Abuse? Entertaining the second possibility (notational ""abuse"") I can easily imagine how to ""desugar"" this notation into something more formal.
For instance, we could read $P(A \vert B)$ as $P_B(A)$ , where $P_B$ is a probability measure on a new/derived probability space $(B, \mathcal{F}_B, P_B)$ .
That is, this new space has $B$ as its sample space and a different event space derived from our original event space.
We can then define $P_B(A)$ in terms of our original probability measure $P$ as: $P_B(A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$ .
I haven't yet worked out the details (e.g. What is $\mathcal{F}_B$ ? , Is $P_B$ a probability measure? , etc.), but I suspect they're not too difficult. Conditional Events? But, is it possible to view $A \mid B$ as an event (that is, some element of $\mathcal{F}$ )? This section of the Wikipedia article on Conditional Probability states that Conditional probability can be defined as the probability of a conditional event $A_B$ . it then proceeds to define the ""Goodman–Nguyen–Van Fraassen conditional event"", but I haven't been able to decipher this yet. Possible Counterexample However, there appear to be simple examples in which $A \mid B$ just can't be an event.
For instance, suppose we have a sample space $\Omega = \{ TT, TH, HT, HH \}$ and we define a probability measure using the mass function $p : \Omega \to [0, 1]$ like so: $$
\begin{cases}
p(TT) &= \frac{1}{6} \\
p(TH) &= \frac{1}{6} \\
p(HT) &= \frac{1}{6} \\
p(HH) &= \frac{1}{2}
\end{cases}
$$ We can think of this as some experiment involving flipping two coins that are biased in some strange way that makes double-heads more likely than other outcomes.
Then the probability that ( $A$ ) both coins land heads up given ( $B$ ) the first coin lands heads up is $$
\begin{align*}
P(A \mid B) &= \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \\
            &= \frac{P(\{ HH \} \cap \{ HT, HH \})}{P(\{ HT, HH \})} \\
            &= \frac{P(\{ HH \})}{P(\{ HT, HH \})} \\
            &= \frac{p(HH)}{p(HT) + p(HH)} \\
            &= \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{2}} \\
            &= \frac{3}{4}
\end{align*}

Now for any $t\in (0,1)$ , define $p_t,q_t$ by $$
\frac{1}{p_t} = \frac{1-t}{p_0}+\frac{t}{p_1},\quad
\frac{1}{q_t} = \frac{1-t}{q_0} + \frac{t}{q_1}.
$$ Then $T$ is strong type $(p_t,q_t)$ with constant $C_t$ . Moreover, this constant $C_t$ satisfies $$
C_t\leq C C_0^{1-t} C_1^t,
$$ where $C=C(p_0, p_1, q_0, q_1, t)$ is bounded for $0<\epsilon \leq t\leq 1-\epsilon<1$ but tends to infinity as $t\to 0$ or $t\to 1$ . When we say an operator $T$ is of strong type $(p,q)$ with constant $C$ , it means $|| Tf||_q \leq C||f||_p$ . When we say an operator $T$ is of weak type $(p,q)$ with constant $C$ , it means $|| T f ||_{q,w}\leq C||f||_p $ . Every proof of this Theorem (for instance in Folland's ""Real Analysis"" or more accessibly in this writeup ) that I have found has worked by obtaining an inequality involving the distribution function of $Tf$ of the form $$
\lambda_{Tf}(2\alpha)\leq \lambda_{Tg_A}(\alpha)+\lambda_{Th_A}(\alpha).
$$ Then by applying the weak type estimates of $T$ and some clever integral manipulation, one obtains a final inequality like: $$
||Tf||_{q_t}\leq 2 q_t^{\frac{1}{q_t}}\left[C_0^{q_0}(p_0/p_t)^{\frac{q_0}{p_0}}|q_t-q_0|^{-1}+C_1^{q_1}(p_1/p_t)^{\frac{q_1}{p_1}}|q_t-q_1|^{-1}\right]^{\frac{1}{q_t}}=:C_t,
$$ for all $f$ with $||f||_p=1$ . Then the general inequality follows from the linearity of $T$ because $|T(cf)|=c|T(f)|$ for $c>0$ . My question is as follows: I don't see how we can obtain from this that $C_t\leq C C_0^{1-t} C_1^t$ . For example, if we take $q_0=3$ , $q_1=6$ , $t=\frac{1}{2}$ , and $q_t=4$ which satisfies the hypothesis $$
\frac{1}{q_t} = \frac{1-t}{q_0} + \frac{t}{q_1},
$$ then (for some given choice of $p_0, p_1, p_t$ ) the quantity $$
\frac{\left[C_0^3 +C_1^6 \right]^{\frac{1}{4}}}{C_0^\frac{1}{2}C_1^\frac{1}{2}}
$$ should remain bounded with respect to $C_0,C_1$ . But it clearly doesn't (Just take $C_0=1$ or something and ramp $C_1\to \infty$ ). So how do we obtain the inequality $C_t\leq C C_0^{1-t} C_1^t$ ? Is there an alternative proof of this?","['interpolation', 'analysis', 'real-analysis', 'lp-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

By the way, a good statement of Thomason's theorem can be found in Brian Scott's answer . However, in general a graph can have one single Hamiltonian cycle
(such graphs are called uniquely hamiltonian) even if the degree of each vertex is at least three.
The smallest uniquely hamiltonian graph
with minimum vertex degree at least $3$ contains $18$ vertices and is shown in the figure.
This graph was constructed by Gordon Royle .
The cycle $$
C'=\{1,5,6,\ldots,17,4,3,2,1\}
$$ has weight $19$ .
This graph also has a cycle of weight $25$ (apparently the maximum possible). Addition. It's worth noting that exactly this problem is formulated in Tony Huynh's answer to a question from MathOverflow .
Here is the very last sentence of his answer ""I think it should be easy to show that such a graph has a cycle longer than $C$ "". The cycle $C$ is the Hamiltonian cycle of the graph and the length is the weight of the cycle in our terminology. Addition 2. @caduk drew my attention to the following problem posed by Thomassen in the paper On the Number of Hamiltonian Cycles in Bipartite Graphs, page 440: Problem 1. Does every Hamiltonian graph $G$ of minimum degree at least $3$ contain an edge $e$ such that $G-e$ and $G/e$ are both Hamiltonian? Thomassen proved that Problem 1 has an affirmative answer for bipartite graphs. From the affirmative answer to Problem 1, it is easy to get an affirmative answer to my question.
In fact, let there exist an edge $e$ in our graph $G$ such that $G-e$ and $G/e$ are both Hamiltonian.
If $e\in C$ , then we exploit the fact that $G-e$ is Hamiltonian.
If $e\not\in C$ , then we will take advantage of the fact that $G/e$ is Hamiltonian. However, it seems to me that my question is much simpler than Thomassen's problem. Remark. I posted this question на MathOveflow","['graph-theory', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
4826901,Turning over blue and pink cups until the gender of the baby is known.,"I'm trying to do the following problem, and want to know why my approach does not work. A “gender reveal” party is held to announce the gender of an expected newborn. 15 cups are filled in advance with colored beads and covered: if the baby is a boy, 8 are filled with blue beads and 7 with pink. If the baby is a girl, 7 are filled with blue and 8 with pink. When the audience arrives the cups are knocked over (revealing bead colors) in a uniformly random order until the audience has seen 8 cups of the same color (and thereby knows the gender). Let N be the number of cups turned over before the gender is known. Compute the probability that N = k for k ∈ {8, 9, 10, . . . , 15}. Is the probability that N = 15 (and one has to wait to the very end) more or less than 1/2? Let $E_i$ be the event that the gender of the baby is known after the $i^{\text{th}}$ cup is turned over, for $i \in \{ 8,9,10,...,15 \}$ . Let Boy be the event that the baby is a boy, and Girl the event that it is a girl. Then the desired probability is: $$P(E_i) = P(E_i| \text{Boy})P(\text{Boy}) + P(E_i| \text{Girl})P(\text{Girl}) $$ For a particular $i$ , we try to compute $P(E_i| \text{Boy})$ . Given that the baby is a boy, there would be 8 cups filled with blue beads and 7 cups filled with pink beads. If we place the cups in a line, then the outcomes we are interested in, i.e., the ones where we have to turn over the $i^{\text{th}}$ cup (from left to right) before the gender of the baby is known, are the cases where the $i^{\text{th}}$ cup is a cup filed with blue beads (denoted $B$ ), and all the cups to the right of it are filled with pink beads (denoted $P$ ), i.e., the situation in the following diagram: $${\underbrace{\_ \phantom{.} \_ \phantom{.} \_ \dots \underline{B} }_\text{i}} \phantom{.} {\underbrace{\underline{P} \phantom{.} \underline{P} \phantom{.} \underline{P} \dots \underline{P} } _\text{15-i}}$$ In the above diagram, there are $7 \choose {15-i}$ ways to choose the rightmost pink-beads cups, with $(15-i)!$ ways to permute each selection, 8 ways to choose the blue-beads cup at position $i$ , and $(i-1)!$ ways to arrange the remaining cups. So we'd have: $$P(E_i| \text{Boy}) = \frac{{7 \choose {15-i}} \cdot (15-i)! \cdot 8 \cdot (i-1)!}{15!}$$ Given that the situation is similar when the baby is a girl, and that $P(\text{Boy}) = P(\text{Girl}) = \frac{1}{2}$ , we'd have: $$P(E_i) = \frac{{7 \choose {15-i}} \cdot (15-i)! \cdot 8 \cdot (i-1)!}{15!}$$ But this is wrong, since, with $i = 15$ , for example, we'd have $P(E_{15}) \approx 3.73$ .

(Note: $X_{(i)}$ denotes the i-th order statistic) Thought Process: I began by looking at the pdf for order statistics, both marginally and jointly; however, this did not lead anywhere because I am interested in the difference between two order statistics, and not the joint pdf of two order statistics. My other thought was to examine the mgf of each, but I cannot find an explicit method for determining the mgf of an order statistic.","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'exponential-distribution', 'order-statistics']"

My attempt Let $f(n)=$ probability that the sum of squares of $n$ uniformly random real numbers is less than $1$ . The probability that the sum of squares exceeds $1$ for the first time with the $n$ th random number, is $f(n-1)-f(n)$ . Then the expectation is $\sum\limits_{n=2}^\infty n(f(n-1)-f(n))$ .

(in the simplest way possible). Let $(u_n) \in ]0; \infty[$ an increasing function s.t. $u_n \underset{n \to \infty }{\rightarrow} \infty $ . Compute $\lim_{n \to \infty} F(u_n)$ -It is easy to show that $F(\lambda)$ is positive decreasing function. Moreover we we have that $f_{\lambda}(x) = \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1+x^4}e^{\lambda x}} = \frac{\sqrt{x^4}}{\sqrt{1+x^4}e^{\lambda x}} \leq \frac{\sqrt{x^4+1}}{\sqrt{1+x^4}e^{\lambda x}}=\frac{1}{e^{\lambda x}}=g(x)$ Hence $f_{u_n}(x)$ is bounded by $g(x)$ and because $f_{u_n}(x)$ is a continuous mapping we can writte $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_{u_n}(x) = 0$ . So by the DCT we get that: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1+x^4}e^{u_n x}}dl(x)= \int_{0}^{\infty} \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1+x^4}e^{u_n x}}dl(x) =0 $$ Let $(v_n) \in ]0; \infty[$ be a decreasing function s.t. $v_n \underset{n \to \infty }{\rightarrow} 0 $ .

Hence by the MCT we have: $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1+x^4}e^{v_n x}}dl(x)= \int_{0}^{\infty} \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1+x^4}e^{v_n x}}dl(x)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1+x^4}}dl(x) = \infty $$ Prove that the limit $\lim_{\lambda \to 0^+} \lambda F(\lambda)$ exists and find it. -Did not succeed to find a convincing answer.

I'm currently reading Davy Paindaveine & Philippe Spindel (2023) Revisiting the Name Variant of the Two-Children Problem, The American Statistician, 77:4, 401-405, DOI:
10.1080/00031305.2023.2173293 , and, working through some of the preliminary probabilities, I got stuck on something I can't resolve: The second variant rather asks: for a two-children family having at
least a girl whose name is Florida, what is the probability that the
other child is a boy? See, for example, Mlodinow (2008) or Marks and
Smith (2011). If two sisters may be given the same name, then this
variant is strictly equivalent to the previous one: more precisely, if
it is assumed that girls are independently named Florida with
probability r, then the probability that the other child is a boy is
2/(4 − r). To make the second variant of interest, one therefore needs
to assume that two sisters may not be given the same name, in which
case, under the assumptions associated with what we will call Model A
below, the probability that the other child is a boy is 1/2,
irrespective of r I'm trying to reason through the italicized part of the second variant as follows. The siblings are listed in order where $B$ is a boy, $G_F$ is a girl named Florida, and $G_F^C$ is a girl not named Florida: $$\frac{P\{(B,G_F)\cup(G_F,B)\}}{P\{(B,G_F)\cup(G_F,B)\cup(G_F^C,G_F)\cup(G_F,G_F^C)\}}=\frac{2\times.5^2r}{2\times .5^2r+P\{(G_F^C,G_F)\cup(G_F,G_F^C)\}}$$ Now, where I'm getting stuck is resolving $P\{(G_F^C,G_F)\cup(G_F,G_F^C)\}$ . If I reason as follows, I can get the right answer: The probability neither sister is named Florida is $(1-r)^2$ So the probability at least one sister is named Florida is $1-(1-r)^2$ But I don't want to count the probability both are named Florida So I subtract $r^2$ , leaving $1-(1-r)^2-r^2=2r$ So the probability of two girls, one named Florida, is $.5^2\times 2r$ . What's confusing me is that I also feel like I should be able to do it this way: $$P\{(G_F^C,G_F)\cup(G_F,G_F^C)\}=P(G_F^C,G_F)+P(G_F,G_F^C)=P(G_F^C|G_F)P(G_F)+P(G_F|G_F^C)P(G_F^C)$$ $$=.5^2[1r+r(1-r)]=.5^2[2r-r^2]$$ Where is this $-r^2$ term coming from? What's weird is that I was able to confirm that, reasoning this way, $P(G_F^C,G_F)+P(G_F,G_F^C)+P(G_F^C,G_F^C)=.5^2(1)$ . Somehow the $(G_F,G_F)$ event has probability 0 like it's supposed to, but the probability of ""exactly one sister named Florida"" is off by exactly what $P(G_F,G_F)$ would've been if possible. I feel like I'm missing something fundamental here. The only explanation I have is that, as soon as we defined an independent probability $r$ of a girl being named Florida, we lost the right to treat ""two sisters named Florida"" as an impossibility excluded from the overall sample space. That would necessitate the first strategy I used, while invalidating my $P(G_F|G_F^C)=.5r$ and $P(G_F^C|G_F)=.5(1)$ conditionals in the second strategy. ""May not be given the same name"" appears to mean ""exclude the $(G_F,G_F)$ event from consideration"", and not "" $P(G_F,G_F)=0$ "". However, even if this is correct, I still can't explain the fact that the second strategy gave a complete probability distribution. Can anyone shed some light on this?","['conditional-probability', 'probability']"

4827496,(Real) Vector space axioms: Simple example for necessity of axiom of associativity of multiplication,"I'm writing some notes on Linear Algebra and am trying to show the independence of an ""optimal list"" for vector space axioms. I am using the following definition: A vector space is a structure $(V,0,+,\cdot)$ , where $V$ is a set, $0$ is an element of $V$ and $+\colon V\times V\to V$ and $\cdot\colon\mathbb{R}\times V\to\mathbb{V}$ are binary operations such that $v+(u+w)=(v+u)+w$ $v+0=v$ For all $v$ there exists $w$ such that $v+w=0$ . $\alpha(\beta v)=(\alpha\beta)v$ $\alpha(v+w)=\alpha v+\alpha w$ . $(\alpha+\beta)v=\alpha v+\beta v$ $1v=v$ Question : Is there a simple example of a structure which satisfies all axioms except only 4? A few remarks: I used just the ""right-identity/right-inverses"" version of the group axioms in 1.-3., which is well-known to be sufficient for having a group ( see here ) I added "" $0$ "" as a constant because axiom 3. depends on the given $0$ which satisfies 2. This is a way to avoid the usual ambiguities with the way axiom 3. is commonly stated ( see this question and the accepted answer ) It is well known that commutativity is implied by the other axioms (ignoring 4., even), so I ommited it. I am considering only real vector spaces. (So the example in this answer , for example, does not apply) For each axiom in the list except 5. , I have already managed to find a structure which satisfies all other axioms except it. However, my example for axiom 4. is quite complicated: Let $V=\mathbb{R}$ as a $\mathbb{Q}$ -vector space, and $L_{\mathbb{Q}}(\mathbb{R})$ be the $\mathbb{Q}$ -vector space of $\mathbb{Q}$ -endomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}$ . Take any $\mathbb{Q}$ -linear map $\Phi\colon\mathbb{R}\to L_\mathbb{Q}(\mathbb{R})$ which takes $1$ to the identity and $\sqrt{2}$ to the zero map (which can be done by difining $\Phi$ on a basis of $\mathbb{R}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ which contains $1$ and $\sqrt{2}$ ), and let $\lambda x = \Phi(\lambda)(x)$ for $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ and $x\in V$ . Then axioms 1.-3. are immediate for $V$ ; axiom 5. follows from $\Phi(\alpha)$ being $\mathbb{Q}$ -linear (additive) for each $\alpha$ , 6. follows from $\Phi$ itself being $\mathbb{Q}$ -linear, and 7. from $\Phi(1)$ being the identity. Axiom 4. is not true: Taking $\alpha=\beta=\sqrt{2}$ and $v=1$ , we have $\alpha(\beta v)=0$ but $(\alpha\beta)v=2v=2$ . However, this example depends on the axiom of choice (for having a basis of $\mathbb{R}$ as a $\mathbb{Q}$ -vector space) and some linear algebraic facts as well. If we allowed for vector spaces over other fields, then this would give us an example which does not depend on choice simply by taking $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}]$ instead of $\mathbb{R}$ , but this is not what I want. Is there any other simpler example of a structure which satisfies all axioms except 4.? The distributivity axioms actually allow us to prove that such a given structure will be a divisible group , and that in fact the product will be associative for integers (although not necessarily for rationals). It's also not clear to me whether the subjacent group will be torsion-free.","['linear-algebra', 'axioms']"

However, my teacher is pretty sure that it IS solvable by radicals, and he proved it by seeing that its Galois group is isomorphic to $D_5$ (and I think it's not). He considers the roots of the polynomial $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \overline{\alpha_2}, \alpha_3, \overline{\alpha_3}$ , with $\alpha_1 \in \mathbb{R}, \alpha_2, \alpha_3 \in \mathbb{C}\setminus\mathbb{R}$ .
These roots form a regular pentagon, and since two pairs of roots are conjugate, we can consider the rotation $a = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$ and the permutation $b = (2, 5)(3, 4)$ , which generate $$D_5 = \left\langle a, b \mid a^5 = 1 = b^2, ba = a^{-1}b \right\rangle.$$ So then he saw that $D_5$ is solvable by radicals and deduced that the polynomial is solvable by radicals too.

The cards in the deck are shuffled randomly, so there's no way to predict the order of the cards. I'm trying to determine the best strategy for this game to maximise the chances of winning. Also, how would you calculate the probability of winning with this strategy for a given number of cards, $N$ , in the deck? Some clarifications: The number 1 is not considered a prime. You can see and remember the cards that have been drawn out, which can inform your strategy. Knowing the number $N$ , you can identify all the prime numbers within that range beforehand. If all cards are drawn and you haven't said ""stop"" before the last one (even if it's not), you lose.

The intended solutions the book provides for the problem are the following: First assume the expression has a value and call it $x$ , so $x = \sqrt{a\sqrt{a\sqrt{a...}}}$ Then notice that $x = \sqrt{ax}$ , then $x^2 = ax$ , then $x(x-a) = 0$ , then since $a$ is positive the solution is $x = a$ and that's the value of the whole expression. They also offer a second solution that goes like this: If $x = \sqrt{a\sqrt{a\sqrt{a...}}}$ then we can also express it as: $x = a^{\frac{1}{2}}a^{\frac{1}{4}}a^{\frac{1}{8}}...$ , then $x = a^{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+...}$ , and since $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+... = 1$ , then $x = a$ once again. My first question is, how valid are any of these solutions at the university level? Say if this was a real analysis class, would any of those two answers be considered valid? Also, although I haven't taken a real analysis class yet, I have heard of the $\epsilon-N$ for sequences and series, I assume if we want to do the same for this particular problem we would have to look at the sequence $\sqrt{a}, \sqrt{a\sqrt{a}}, \sqrt{a\sqrt{a\sqrt{a}}}, ...$ , then check if it converges using $\epsilon-N$ and if it does then that's the value of he expression $\sqrt{a\sqrt{a\sqrt{a...}}}$ Second question is, is my speculation correct? Would this way of doing it with $\epsilon-N$ constitute a valid way of solving the problem if this was a real analysis class? Lastly, my last question is, how would you solve the problem in a way that is valid for a real analysis class?

Find the length  of the wire. Answer: $400~\pi$ I am a highschool student and with my teacher's help and my own start I came to the bookish answer. The process was like you count the no. of loops to be placed around the cylinder and then multipy the length of wire in 1 loop and no. of loops to get the final length of wire. Everthing was good, it came out to be 40 loops and now the problem starts. According to my teacher and my own second start (At first I thought the same that I am thinking right now but we need to follow our teacher so that's why I stuck with his reasoning.), the length of wire in 1 loop is 10 $\pi$ cm , which is the circumference of the cylinder. My reasoning: I feel that the length of the circular loop of wire will be $2\pi (R+r)$ where R is the radius of cylinder and r is the radius of the wire but according to my teacher it is just the circumference of the circle. To try and to justify this I tried using some items I found at my home and measuring the length of 2 different wires around a cylindrical pencil holder. Although I am getting a different length each time when I change the thickness but I cannot justify this to my teacher. I tried explaining him but he says that it will be same no matter what is the radius of the wire and I cannot explain him how. He is quite understanding btw, just the thing is I don't have any formal explanation to give him and whenever I try I come back with one explanation from him in hand. He says that the wire is touching the circumference so the length will be same as that. I saw that Veritasium's recent video on youtube about the SAT circle problem and can relate this with it  which is how I came us to my reasoning part, but I still don't know if I am correct or not or the length difference is just due to rough measuring?

First, I'm considering the following definition for the first-order derivative at $h(x):\mathbb{R}^d\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ and in direction $g(x):\mathbb{R}^d\mapsto\mathbb{R}$ of the generic functional $F[h]$ , \begin{equation*}
F'[h;g]\triangleq \left[\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}\varepsilon}F[h+\varepsilon g]\right]_{\varepsilon=0}
\end{equation*} we can simplfy this expression by removing the variable $\varepsilon$ (since in the end it will be fixed to the value $\varepsilon=0$ ). Since the internal derivative is a ""conventional"" derivative in $\varepsilon$ , we have \begin{equation*}
F'[h;g]=\left[\lim_{\tau\to 0} \frac{F[h+(\varepsilon+\tau)g]-F[h+\varepsilon g]}{\tau}\right]_{\varepsilon=0}
\end{equation*} then setting $\varepsilon=0$ gives \begin{equation*}
F'[h;g]=\lim_{\tau\to 0} \frac{F[h+\tau g]-F[h]}{\tau}
\end{equation*} Questions The $n$ -th order derivative is defined as \begin{equation*}
F^{(n)}[h;g]\triangleq \left[\frac{\text{d}^n}{\text{d}\varepsilon^n}F[h+\varepsilon g]\right]_{\varepsilon=0}
\end{equation*} Currently I have two questions about this expression. I'm wondering if we can do, like in the previous case, a simplification where we eliminate $\varepsilon$ I'm wondering if, as it happens with conventional derivatives, we can write a recursion of the type \begin{equation*}
F^{(k+1)}[h;g]=F^{(k)}[h;g]
\end{equation*} If the answer of the previous questions is yes, how do you prove it? It will be enough the simple case with $n=2$ .","['gateaux-derivative', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"
4828000,Conjecture: $\sum\limits_{k=1}^nk^m=S_3(n)\times\frac{P_{m-3}(n)}{N_m}$ for odd $m>1 \ ;\ =S_2(n)\times\frac{P_{m-2}'(n)}{N_m}$ for even $m$.,"When I was in high school, I was fascinated by $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k= \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ so I tried to find the general solution for $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^m$ s.t $m \in \mathbb{N}$ . I used a similar approach to
my answer here My approach was turning $n^m$ to $n(n-1)(n-2)\dots (n-m+1)+ f(n)$ and to use the fact that $$\displaystyle\dbinom{n}{k}+\dbinom{n}{k+1}= \dbinom{n+1}{k+1}$$ $f(n) $ will be combination of sums $\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^n k^i$ st $i<m$ which I evaluated before I was able to to find the sum up to $m=6$ .  Here, I tried to search for a pattern to find the general solution of $\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^m $ s.t $m \in \mathbb{N}$ which I failed to do, but I noticed this pattern: $\\[3pt]$ $$S_1(n):={\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k= \frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$$ $$S_2(n):={\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^2= \color{blue}{\frac{n(2n+1)(n+1)}{6}}}$$ $$S_3(n):={\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^3= \color{red}{\frac{\color{red}{n^2(n+1)^2}}{\color{red}{4}}}}$$ $$S_4(n):={\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^4=\color{blue}{\frac{n(2n+1)(n+1)}{6}} \times \frac{3n^2+3n-1}{  5}}$$ $$S_5(n):={\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^5= \color{red}{\frac{\color{red}{n^2(n+1)^2}}{\color{red}{4}}} \times\frac{2n^2+2n-1}{ 3}}$$ $$S_6(n):={\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^6= \color{blue}{\frac{n(2n+1)(n+1)}{6}} \times \frac{3n^4+6n^3-3n+1}{ 7 }}$$ $$S_7(n):={\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^7= \color{red}{\frac{\color{red}{n^2(n+1)^2}}{\color{red}{4}} }\times\frac{3n^4+6n^3-n^2-4n+2}{ 6}}$$ $$S_8(n):={\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^8= \color{blue}{\frac{n(2n+1)(n+1)}{6}} \times \frac{5n^6+15n^5+5n^4-15n^3-n^2+9n+3}{ 15}}$$ $$S_9(n):={\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^9= \color{red}{\frac{\color{red}{n^2(n+1)^2}}{\color{red}{4}}} \times\frac{(n^2+n-1)(2n^4 +4n^3-n^3-3n^2+3)}{ 5}}$$ $$S_{10}(n):={\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^{10}= \color{blue}{\frac{n(2n+1)(n+1)}{6}} \times \frac{ 3 n^8+ 12 n^7+ 8 n^6 - 18 n^5- 10 n^4+ 24 n^3   + 2 n^2 - 15 n +5}{ 11}}$$ $$S_{11}(n):={\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^{11}= \color{red}{\frac{\color{red}{n^2(n+1)^2}}{\color{red}{4}}} \times\frac{2n^8 +8n^7+4n^6-16n^5-5n^4+26n^3-3n^2-20n+10}{ 6}}$$ $\\[6pt]$ I noticed that: For odd $m>1$ , $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^m= \color{red}{\frac{{n^2(n+1)^2}}{{4}}} \times \frac{P_{m-3}(n)}{N_m}$ s.t $P_{m-3}(n)$ is an $m-3$ polynomial with integer coefficients $ \{a_{m-3},\dots a_1,a_0 \}$ such that $\gcd \{ a_{m-3},\dots a_1,a_0 \}=1$ , $N_m\in \mathbb {N}$ . For even $m$ , $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^m= \color{blue}{\frac{n(2n+1)(n+1)}{6}}\times \frac{P_{m-2}'(n)}{N_m}$ s.t $P_{m-2}'(n)$ is an $m-2$ polynomial with integer coefficients $\{ a_{m-2},\dots a_1,a_0 \}$ such that $\gcd \{ a_{m-2},\dots a_1,a_0 \}=1$ , $N_m\in \mathbb {N}$ . When I was in high school I couldn't prove this pattern, and this question reminded me of this observation that I had totally forgotten about. Now, after two years from my first attempt, I tried to prove this pattern again, but I couldn't. EDIT This question has been partly answered in this MathOverflow answer (The answer shows that $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^m$ is divisible by ${n^2(n+1)^2}$ for odd $m>1$ and $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^m$ is divisible by ${n(2n+1)(n+1)}$ for even $m$ ) the only missing part is to show that the denominator is a multiple of $4$ if $m\in 2\mathbb{N}+1$ , and the denominator is a multiple of $6$ if $m \in 2\mathbb{N}$ . Although this question has been almost solved before, I still would like to see if there is any other proofs or methods.

4828059,How do I know whether a local minima is also global?,"In the region $0\leq x\leq 1$ and $0\leq y\leq 1$ I have 1 radio broadcaster placed in $(x_b,y_b)$ and N receivers. The position of the broadcaster is not known.
The position of each receiver however is known: $(x_i,y_i)$ as is the distance from the receiver to the broadcaster: $d_i$ .
There is some noise in the distance measurements that I assume to be normal distributed with mean=0 and the same variance for all receivers. My goal is to estimate the most likely position of the radio broadcaster: $(x_b,y_b)$ . I do this by minimizing: $$
SE = \sum_i \left[\sqrt{(x_b - x_i)^2+(y_b - y_i)^2} - d_i\right]^2
$$ using scipy.optimize.minimize() . This approach seems to work fine. However how do I know that the local minima I find is also the global minima?
In this example I can plot $SE(x_b,y_b)$ : However my real problem is estimating the position: $(x,y,z)$ and the orientation of a camera: $(roll,pitch,yaw)$ .
There is no way I can visualize 6D space.
Therefore I am looking for some other way to check whether a found minima is global. As far as I understand there are only two ways to show that there is only 1 local minima? Method I Show that $$
\frac{\partial SE}{\partial x_b} = \frac{\partial SE}{\partial y_b} = 0
$$ only has 1 solution and that all the eigenvalues of the Hessian of SE in this point are positive. Method II Show that SE is convex by showing that all eigenvalues of the Hessian of SE are positive at all points. Let us try method I. I find that: $$
\frac{\partial SE}{\partial x_b} = \Sigma_i 2 (x_b - x_i) 
\frac{\sqrt{(x_b - x_i)^2 + (y_b - y_i)^2} - d_i}{\sqrt{(x_b - x_i)^2 + (y_b - y_i)^2}}
$$ $$
\frac{\partial SE}{\partial y_b} = \Sigma_i 2 (y_b - y_i) 
\frac{\sqrt{(x_b - x_i)^2 + (y_b - y_i)^2} - d_i}{\sqrt{(x_b - x_i)^2 + (y_b - y_i)^2}}
$$ How many solutions do $$
\frac{\partial SE}{\partial x_b} = \frac{\partial SE}{\partial y_b} = 0
$$ have?
Difficult to tell, I guess it dependens on the $\{(x_i,y_i,d_i)\}$ values? Method II seems even harder.","['optimization', 'multivariable-calculus', 'nonlinear-optimization', 'numerical-methods']"

4828168,Is it possible to fit cosine (or sine) graph into an algebraic curve?,"A set of the form $\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2\,:\,P(x,y)=0\}$ for a nonzero polynomial $P\in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$ is said to be an algebraic curve. This set can be denoted simply by "" $P(x,y)=0$ "". Question: Can we fit the graph of cosine, namely, $\{(t,\cos t)\in \mathbb{R}^2\,:\,t\in\mathbb{R}\}$ , into an algebraic curve? Intuition says ""no"" and that's correct. Indeed, suppose there is some nonzero polynomial $P$ such that $P(t,\cos t)\equiv 0$ . Consider the polynomial $Q_\lambda(x,y):=y-\lambda$ , for $\lambda\in [-1,1]$ . Due to cosine's periodicity, the algebraic curve $Q_\lambda(x,y)=0$ intersects the graph of cosine infinitely many times. This tells us that the algebraic curves $P(x,y)=0$ and $Q_\lambda(x,y)=0$ have an infinite intersection and, by an Algebraic Geometry theorem, $P$ and $Q_\lambda$ must have a nonconstant common factor. Since $Q_\lambda$ is irreducible, this factor must be $Q_\lambda$ itself. So we are saying that $y-\lambda$ is a factor of $P$ for every $\lambda \in [-1,1]$ ... Since $P$ is a polynomial, this is impossible, unless $P\equiv 0$ , which we discarded by hypothesis. Very good. But what if we wanted to answer the ""local"" version of the question? Question (local): Can we fit a piece of the graph of cosine, say, $\{(t,\cos t)\in\mathbb{R}^2\,:\,t\in (a,b)\}$ , into an algebraic curve? Intuition still says that we can't, but I don't know how to prove this. Since we're limited to a piece of the graph, we lose the argument of that infinite intersection...","['algebraic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"
