449681,Geometric description of points in the complex plane,"What does the following inequality look like if sketched in the complex plane: $$\operatorname{Re}(az+b)>0$$ The $a$ and $b$ are both complex numbers (function parameters). I understand that $\operatorname{Re}(z)>0$ will yield all of the complex numbers to the right of the imaginary axis (quadrants 1 and 4). I also understand that $\operatorname{Re}(z+b)>0$ will shift the shaded region $\operatorname{Re}(b)$ to the left of the imaginary axis. What does multiplying the $z$ by $a$ do to the inequality ($\operatorname{Re}(az)>0$)? Complex multiplication involves dilation and rotation, so would the shaded (included) region rotate?",['complex-analysis']

449695,Gaps between primes,"I recently watched a video about the recent breakthrough involving the gaps between primes.  I have an idea that I'm sure is wrong, but I don't know why. If you take the product of all prime numbers up to a certain number and call it x, won't x-1 and x+1 always be primes? And since they always differ by 2, doesn't that make there an infinite number of primes that differ by 2? Once again, I know that I'm wrong, but I would like to know why.","['prime-numbers', 'prime-gaps', 'number-theory']"
449723,Determining whether a set of vectors forms a basis using Gaussian elimination,"Given the following three vectors: $$
b_1 = \begin{pmatrix}

b_3 = \begin{pmatrix}
4 \\ 2 \\3
\end{pmatrix}, \space\space b_1, b_2, b_3 \in \mathbb{R}^3
$$ Does $B = \{ b_1, b_2, b_3 \}$ form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$? I know I can write the vectors as rows of a matrix and then use Gaussian elimination to check for linear independence: $$
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 &  3 & 5 & 0 \\
2 & 1 & 7 & 0\\
4 &  2 & 3 & 0 \\

$$ The elimination algorithm itself is clear to me, as is the correct solution. However, I just can't wrap my head around why the vectors are written line-wise into the matrix (and thus form rows). Intuitively, I would've written the vectors as columns of the matrix. Can anybody give me a brief explanation why they go in line-wise instead of column-wise?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
449740,Thurston's 37th way of thinking about the derivative,"In Thurston's superb essay On proof and progress in mathematics , he makes this observation: Of course there is always another subtlety to be gleaned, but I would like to at least think that I have absorbed the main intuition behind each element of the above list. However: Differential geometry is not my strong suit, unfortunately, so I have had trouble trying to unravel this even at a formal level. Manifolds and vector bundles themselves I am comfortable with, but with connections and connection forms I have trouble moving between formalism and intuition, and ""Lagrangian section"" is not a term I've come across (though I can find its definition online ). So, I have some questions about Thurston's 37th conception of the derivative: To use Thurston's words: can someone "" translate into precise, formal, and explicit definitions "" making the "" differences start to evaporate "" between 37 and the differential of a smooth map ? What is the intuition behind it - why should the notion of ""Lagrangian section"" appear here, what does it mean (intuitively) when a connection makes the graph of $f$ parallel, etc.? My hope is also for answers that are as accessible to as many people as possible, though of course, any explanation has to assume some level of background knowledge.","['intuition', 'derivatives']"

449762,"Spivak's Calculus exercise, possible error in text. Chapter 10, problem 24(a).","Working through all the problems in Spivak's Calculus (3E) and hit a snag here. Given $c, d \in R$, and distinct $x_1, ..., x_n \in R$, show that for any given $1 \leq i \leq n$ there exists a polynomial function $f$ of degree $2n-1$ such that $f(x_i) = c$, $f'(x_i) = d$, and $f$ has a double root at every other $x_j$. Here's what I have so far: In order for it to have a double root at those points, such a function must take the form $f(x) = (x - x_1)^2...(x-x_{i-1})^2(x-x_{i+1})^2...(x-{x_n})^2H(x)$ Where $H(x)$ is some polynomial. Furthermore, since the double roots already give it an order of $2n-2$, $H(x) = ax+b$. So we have $f(x) = (x - x_1)^2...(x-x_{i-1})^2(x-x_{i+1})^2...(x-{x_n})^2(ax+b)$ Or $f(x) = g(x)(ax+b)$ to shorten it. Now we end up with a system of equations with two unknowns $a$ and $b$: $g(x_i)x_ia+g(x_i)b = c$ $(g'(x_i)x_i + g(x_i))a + g'(x_i)b = d$ The determinant of the coefficient matrix is just $(g(x_i))^2$, which is non-zero since its only roots are the other $x_j$, i.e. the matrix is invertible, so it has a unique solution. There's just one problem: What if $c = g(x_i)$ and $d = g'(x_i)$? Then the solution is $(a,b) = (0, 1)$ and our polynomial $f$ has degree $2n-2$ instead of $2n-1$. Am I missing something or is this an error in Spivak? Also, is there a list of errors somewhere online? Tried looking online but couldn't find one.",['calculus']

A sphere has the interesting property that if you take any two parallel planes that both intersect the sphere, and measure the area of the part of the sphere between the two planes, then the answer only depends on how far apart the two planes are, regardless of the positions or orientations of the planes.  Does this property automatically guarantee that a 2-d surface (defined as above) in 3-d is a sphere?  My intuition is that the answer is yes.

449811,Planar Graph with Maximum Number of Edges and 3-Colouring in Eulerian,Show that a planar graph with $n$ vertices and $3n-6$ edges with $\chi=3$ is Eulerian. $\chi=3$ means there is a optimal vertex colouring with three colours. Eulerian means that the graph admits an Eulerian cycle (a cycle which contains each edge exactly once). My thoughts on this: I know that a planar graph has at most $3n-6$ edges and that a planar graph is maximal iff each face is a triangle. So in the present case each face is a triangle. Moreover it would suffice to prove that all vertex degrees are even since this is equivalent to being Eulerian.

You can equally define graph homomorphisms as mappings $f$ satisfying $$\text{R}(x,y) \rightarrow \text{R}(f(x),f(y))$$ or satisfying $$\neg\text{R}(x,y) \rightarrow \neg\text{R}(f(x),f(y))$$ which is equivalent with $$\text{R}(f(x),f(y)) \rightarrow \text{R}(x,y) $$ What is the lesson to be learned from this observation?

Solution: If $AX=B$ has a unique solution for some column vector $B$, then $A$ in reduced row echelon form has a pivot in each column and $A$ can be reduced to $I_n$, for $A$,$\\ n \times n$. Since the number of equations = the number of unknowns, we will have column vector $(n \times 1)$ of $x_i$'s  = column vector $n \times 1$ of $b_i$'s.

449875,Expected value of normal CDF,"I am trying to calculate the expected value of a Normal CDF, but I have gotten stuck. I want to find the expected value of $\Phi\left( \frac{a-bX}{c} \right)$ where $X$ is distributed as $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $\Phi$ is the standard normal CDF. I know I can transform $\frac{a-bX}{c}$ to be a normal random variable $\mathcal{N}\left(\frac{a}{c},\frac{b^2}{c^2}\right)$ where $\frac{b^2}{c^2}$ is the variance of the normal random variable. I'm not sure if this helps though. I think that the expected value of a CDF is $0.5$ but since $\Phi$ is the CDF of a standard normal CDF and $\frac{a-bX}{c}$ is not standard normal I do not think the expected value should be $0.5$ . I tried integrating the CDF, but I do not believe I did it correctly. When $a = -2.3338$ , $b = 0.32164$ , $c = 0.94686$ , I believe the correct answer is approximately $0.009803$ .

449877,pandigital rational approximations to the golden ratio and the base of the natural logarithm,"Steven Stadnicki suggested in a comment that I post the following as a question. The golden ration $\phi$ is given by
$$\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618033988.$$ A rational approximation is given by
$$\frac{987}{610} \approx 1.618032787.$$ This yields the following pandigital formulas:
$$\frac{4 * 3 + 975}{\left(8 + 2\right) * 61}$$
$$\frac{985 + 2}{1 + 7 * \left(6 + {3}^{4}\right)}$$
$$\frac{5 + 984 - 2}{\left(7 + 3\right) * 61}$$
$$\frac{987}{2 + 1 + \left({5}^{4}\right) - \left(6 * 3\right)}$$
$$\frac{7 * \left(98 + 43\right)}{\left(61 * 5\right) * 2}$$ Is there another pandigital rational representation that yields a higher number of accurate digits? The same question may be asked for the base of the natural logarithm $e$:
$$e\approx 2.718281828.$$
A rational approximation is
$$\frac{1457}{536}\approx 2.718283582.$$
It produces the following pandigital formulas:
$$\frac{31 * \left(5 + 42\right)}{\left(76 - 9\right) * 8}$$
$$\frac{\left(\left({3}^{6}\right) * 2\right) - 1}{\left({5}^{4}\right) - \left(97 - 8\right)}$$
$$\frac{\left(6 * \left({3}^{5}\right)\right) - 1}{7 + {\left(\left(8 * 4\right) - 9\right)}^{2}}$$
$$\frac{1 + \left(6 * \left({3}^{5}\right)\right) - 2}{\left(9 * 7 + 4\right) * 8}$$
$$\frac{31 * \left(8 * 5 + 7\right)}{{2}^{9} + 6 * 4}$$
$$\frac{5 + \left(\left({9}^{3}\right) * 2\right) - 6}{8 * \left(71 - 4\right)}$$
$$\frac{31 * \left(\left(8 * 7\right) - 9\right)}{542 - 6}$$
As before we ask for a better rational approximation that produces a higher precision. Furthermore (see this post ) we ask for a more sophisticated non-trivial algorithm to compute these. I was able to obtain an improvement of the running time by a factor of thirty by re-coding the Maple algorithm from the other post in C, including quite a few ideas that are of use to the combinatorics programmmer, like the representation of sets by bit strings or the enumeration of the permutations of a list using the factorial number system. Happy computing! (Another observation is that with the five operations and concatenation at our disposal there are probably threshold values for numerator and denominator of the rational approximations from the continued fraction where we can perhaps give a proof that they cannot be attained.) #include <stdio.h>

That being said, the region is as follows: And the points: Where 1.414 is $\sqrt{2}$ and 0.707 is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. My approach, which I'm in doubt if it's a valid one, was the following: Divide the region into 2 regions and consider each new region a ""case 2"" region and sum the integrals over each region to obtain the integral over the original region: The division is made in order to obtain well-defined functions in each region.

Question: Is $A_2N_2\omega N_2$ an open and dense subset of $GL(2)$ in p-adic topology, or in Zariski topology? I asked this because, if we want to find a sequence of elements in this cell approaching the identity, compute $$\begin{pmatrix} a & \\  & b\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & x \\  & 1 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} & 1 \\ 1 & \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & y \\  & 1 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} ax & a+axy \\ b & by \end{pmatrix}$$ If this product goes to the identity matrix in the p-adic topology, we will get $b\to 0$, $ax\to 1$, $by\to 1$, and $a+axy\to 0$, from which we will have a contradiction. Does this mean the big cell is not dense in the p-adic topology? Or I'm misunderstanding things. Thank you very much for any comment.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-groups', 'lie-groups']"

We can show it converges as follows: suppose $a_n = p_n/q_n = k_n + r_n/q_n$, where $p_n = k_nq_n + r_n$, $0 \leq r_n < q_n$. Then $$a_{n+1} = \frac{p_n/q_n}{1-r_n/q_n} = \frac{p_n}{q_n - r_n},$$so the denominator will keep decreasing until it is a divisor of $p_0$ (maybe 1). Also, note we may take $p_n = p_0$ for all $n$. Further, the limit will be $\leq \frac{p_0}{\operatorname{gcf}{(p_0,q_0)}}$, because if $f \mid p_0$ and $f\mid q_n$, then $f\mid (p_0 - k_nq_n)=r_n$, so $f \mid q_n - r_n = q_{n+1}$. But the limit may be strictly smaller; for instance, $a_0 = 30/7$ converges right away to 6. Can we say anything else about the limit of a sequence starting with $a_0$?

\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}E_{n}

\mathcal S=\left\langle\left\langle x_{n-m+1,m}\right\rangle_{m\in\mathcal N_n}\right\rangle_{n\in\mathbb N},
$$ where $\mathcal N_{n}=\left\{k\in\mathbb N:k\leqslant n\right\}$. Then $\mathcal S$ contains all the elements of $$
T=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}E_{n}.
$$ Observe that $\mathcal S$ is a surjection $\mathbb N\to T$, because for every $n\in\mathbb N$, $\mathcal S$ yields a finite, and thus countable, subsequence. Furthermore, because $\mathcal S$ may contain duplicate elements, an $U\subseteq\mathbb N$ can be found such that $\mathcal S$ is an injection $U\to T$. We have then found a bijection $\mathcal S:U\to T$. Hence, $T$ is countable. $\blacksquare$ Does it sound convincing?

450252,How big is a class of groups with a certain strong amenability condition?,"Let $G$ be a countably infinite discrete group. Let us call $G$ sequentially amenable, if there is a bijection $\mathbb{N}\to G,\; j\mapsto g_j$ such that the sets $F_k = \{g_1,\dots,g_k\}$ form a Folner sequence for $G$. How big is the class of sequentially amenable groups? The only obvious examples I can think of are the groups $\mathbb{Z}^m$ for $m\in\mathbb{N}$ or (a little bit more general) finitely generated abelian groups. (For $\mathbb{Z}^m$, you can see this by counting all $v\in\mathbb{Z}^m$ with $\|v\|_\infty=n$ in increasing order $n=0,1,2,\dots$. Can you think of interesting non-abelian examples? Any answer would be very helpful. Edit: One fairly big class of examples are finitely generated groups with subexponential growth. Let's give a quick proof: Let $G$ be such a group. Pick some finite generating set $S=S^{-1}\subset G$ and define the corresponding length metric
$$\ell: G\to\mathbb{N},\quad \ell(g)=\min\{k \;|\; g=s_1\cdot\dots\cdot s_k\;\text{for some}\; s_i\in S \}.$$
Then it is well-known that the unit balls
$$B_n = \ell^{-1}(\{0,\dots,n \})$$
form a Folner sequence for $G$. This is because of subexponential growth, which means that $\lim_{n\to\infty} |B_n|/|B_{n+1}|=1$. Then define the bijection $j\mapsto g_j$ of $G$ by counting all group elements $g$ with $\ell(g)=n$ in increasing order of $n$. Define $F_k=\{g_1,\dots,g_k \}$ for all $k$. Then it is clear that
$$\forall\; k: \exists n: B_n\subset F_k\subset B_{n+1}.$$
It follows for all $g\in G$ that
$$\lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{|F_k\cap gF_k|}{|F_k|} \geq \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{|B_n\cap gB_n|}{|B_{n+1}|} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{|B_n|}{|B_{n+1}|}\cdot \frac{|B_n\cap gB_n|}{|B_n|} = 1,$$
which confirms that the $F_k$ form a Folner sequence.","['amenability', 'group-theory']"
450260,Showing that $a^{\phi(n)}\equiv 1\pmod n$ when $a$ and $n$ are relatively prime,"I am trying to show that if $a$ is any integer relatively prime to $n$, then $a^{\phi(n)}\equiv 1\pmod n$, where $\phi(n)$ is Euler's totient function whose value is equal to the number of numbers less than $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. This seems number-theoretic, but given the context, is meant to be solved with group theory.  I know that the order of $U(n)$ (the group of all numbers less than and relatively prime to $n$ under multiplication) is $\phi(n)$.  Therefore, for any $g \in U(n)$ we know that $g^{\phi(n)}=1$.  I have been trying to use this fact in my proof.  Clearly $a$ need not be in $U(n)$, but I thought perhaps if it is congruent to a member of $U(n)$ I can get the desired result.  For this reason, I applied the division algorithm to write $a=nm+r$ where $m$ is some integer and $1 \le r \le n-1$, and tried to show that $r$ is relatively prime to $n$, so that $a \equiv r \mod n$.

Also, under somewhat more stringent conditions, $\lim_{x\to\infty}\int_0^\infty  f(x, \eta) \,d\eta = \int_0^\infty  \lim_{x\to\infty} f(x, \eta) \,d\eta$. And of course if we fix $x_0$, of course $\int_0^t f(x_0,\eta)\,d\eta$ is continuous in $t$ by the continuity of the integral. Suppose on the other hand we fix $t_0$. When is $F(x)=\int_0^{t_0} f(x,\eta)\,d\eta$ continuous at $x_0$? Since this should be easier than the improper integral mentioned above, it certainly seems strong enough that $f(x,\eta)$ converges uniformly as $t \to t_0$ in a neighborhood around $x_0$. But can we get by with less? Is it then an easy extension to show when

450280,Erdős-Straus conjecture,"The Erdős-Straus Conjecture (ESC), states that for every natural number $n \geq 2$, there exists a set of natural numbers $a, b, c$ , such that the following equation is satisfied: $$\frac{4}{n}=\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\tag{1}$$ The basic approach to solving this problem outlined by Mordell [Ref1] is described below By defining $t$ and $m$ as positive integers greater than zero and $q$ a positive integer greater than one we can observe that a) There is always a solution for even $n$, since if $n=2^qt$ we have the trivial solution
$$\frac{4}{4t}=\frac{1}{t}$$ In the remaining case $n=2(2t+1)$, a solution in the form of two Egyptian fractions can always be found  e.g.
$$\frac{4}{2(2t+1)}=\frac{2}{2t+1}=\frac{1}{t+1}+\frac{1}{(t+1)(2t+1)}$$ b) If $(1)$ is a solution for some particular prime $n$ then all composite numbers $mn$ divisible by $n$ are also solutions, thus $$\frac{4}{mn}=\frac{1}{ma}+\frac{1}{mb}+\frac{1}{mc}$$ will also be a solution. This means that we can simplify the analysis to the cases where $n$ is a prime greater than 2. Using Mordell's approach we have just shown that we only need to consider the cases where $n$ is prime and where $n \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \;\;[meaning \;\;n=2t+1]$ The argument continues... Mordell goes on to show in turn that the search can be reduced further to the cases when
$$n \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \;\;[meaning \;numbers \;\;n=4t+1]$$
$$n \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \;\;[meaning \;numbers \;\;n=8t+1]$$
$$n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \;\;[meaning \;numbers \;\;n=3t+1]$$
$$n \equiv 1,2,4 \pmod{7} \;\;[meaning \;numbers \;\;n=7t+1,n=7t+2 \;or\;n=7t+4 ]$$
$$n \equiv 1,4 \pmod{5}  \;\;[meaning \;numbers \;\; n=5t+1 \;or\;n=5t+4]$$ Assembling these results together, Mordell showed that the conjecture can be proved in this context except for the cases when
$$n \equiv 1,11^2,13^2,17^2,19^2,23^2 \pmod{840}$$ Mordell stated that since the first prime meeting this condition is 1009, this is proof that the conjecture holds for $n<1009$. This basic approach can be pursued further. Other workers have shown that the conjecture holds for much higher values of $n$ using similar methods as can be seen on the above Wikipedia page. Note that other intermediate results can be constructed from the above congruence's, e.g. $n \equiv 1 \pmod{24}$. The question is: Are there any other elementary approaches to solving this problem than the one outlined by Mordell (and described above)? [Ref1] Louis J.

Also, $|x - 1| = \bigl|(\sqrt{x}-1)(\sqrt{x}+1)\bigr| = |\sqrt{x}-1||\sqrt{x}+1| < \delta$. $\therefore |\sqrt{x}-1|< \frac{\delta}{|\sqrt{x}+1|}$ Now we let $\delta = 1$. Then

-1<x-1<1 \\

450608,Show that $f(x) = x^p -x -1 \in \Bbb{F}_p[x]$ is irreducible over $\Bbb{F}_p$ for every $p$.,"Let $p$ be a prime. a) Show that $f$ has no roots in $\Bbb{F}_p$ . Let $F^*$ be the multiplicative group of $\Bbb{F}_p$ . Then, by lagrange's thoerem for all nonzero $\alpha \in \Bbb{F}_p$ , $\alpha^{p-1} = 1 \implies \alpha^p=\alpha \implies \alpha^p-\alpha=0$ . Of course $0^p=0$ , so this is true for all elements of $F$ and not just the nonzero ones. But then $\alpha^p - \alpha - 1 = -1$ for all $\alpha \in \Bbb{F}_p$ and so it must have no roots in $\Bbb{F}_p$ . I could have also done this using the Frobenius automorphism, right? b) Let $\alpha$ be a root of $f$ (in some algebraic closure of $\Bbb{F}_p$ ). Show that $\alpha + s$ is also a root for all $s \in \Bbb{F}_p$ . Let $\alpha^p - \alpha -1 =0$ . Let $E$ be an algebraic closure of $\Bbb{F}_p$ . Since $E$ has characteristic $p$ , $(\alpha + s)^p = \alpha^p + s^p$ . So we have, $$(\alpha + s)^p - (\alpha + s) -1 = \alpha^p + s^p - \alpha -s -1 = s^p - s = 0.$$ c) Conclude that $f$ is irreducible over $\Bbb{F}_p$ , for every $p$ . By b) and the fact that $\Bbb{F}_p$ has $p$ distinct elements, we know that the roots of $f$ are $\alpha, \alpha+1, ... , \alpha + p-1$ . So if $K$ is a splitting field, we have $$x^p - x -1 = (x-\alpha)(x-(\alpha+1))...(x-(\alpha+p-1)).$$ Now let's assume that $f$ is reducible over $\Bbb{F}_p$ . Then $f=gh$ for some $g$ and $h$ with degrees less than that of $f$ . So $g$ and $h$ must be of the form $(x-(\alpha+s_1))...(x-(\alpha+s_k))$ where k is less than n. Let's say that g has degree 2, because the other cases are similar. So $g =(x-(\alpha + s_i))(x-(\alpha + s_j))$ and the constant term for $g$ is, $$(\alpha + s_i)(\alpha + s_j) = \alpha^2 + s_is_j\alpha + s_is_j.$$ Since $\Bbb{F}_p$ is a field, if $\alpha s_is_j$ is an element of $\Bbb{F}_p$ , then so is $((\frac{1}{s_is_j})(\alpha s_is_j) = \alpha$ , a contradiction. We can show by induction that if we multiply $(x-(\alpha+s_1))...(x-(\alpha+s_k)$ , we get a term that looks like $s_1s_2...s_k\alpha$ . So this is also true for $k>2$ .

450610,Clarification regarding a group theory proof,"In a group we have $abc = cba$. If $c \neq 1$, is the group abelian? See the following link . (I am new to this site but it is my understanding that you cannot PM authors, correct? Which is too bad because it means I have to open this thread) In regards to Math Gem's answer, from the comments I take it he has omitted some of the obvious statements; but I wonder, if one was to give every required statement, what would have to be included? In the proof he requires $c = ba$ which surely is only a small (equal to the order of the group times the number of $c \neq 1$) section of a group. It must hold for all $a,b, c \neq 1$ so the total amount of combinations you would have to verify (say A is the group) would be $\mathrm{T} = \#A \cdot \#A \cdot (\#A-1)$. Say $\#A = x$. Since $c = ba$ is only valid for $x$ distinct couples $(a,b)$ (because of the ""latin square property"", $c = ba$ ""misses"" $\mathrm{T}-(x-1)\cdot\#A$ combinations, right? Taking $Z_4,+$ and $2$ for example, only $2 = 2 + 0$, $2 = 0 + 2$, $2 = 1 + 3$ and $2 = 3 + 1$ so e.g. (4,4,4) and (1,2,4) are invalid for the proof given, yet we do have to take them into account. From the comments, if $ab = 1$ then clearly $ab = ba$ (because $ab = 1 \implies a = b^{-1} \implies 1 = ba$) but then there's still e.g. (4,4,4) and (1,2,4). So the trivial (4,4,4) would have to be mentioned, as well when either $a$ or $b$ is equal to $1$. From inspection of $Z_4,+$ I see that we now have all possible combinations, but should it not be proven? I.e. how do you know there do not exist $a,b, c$ such that $ba \neq c$ and $a,b \neq 1$ and yet $ab \neq ba$? For $Z_4,+$ you can sort of say: the order is 4, so you have to check $4\cdot4\cdot3$ combinations. The proof holds for $c = ba$ and since there 3 elements in $Z_4,+$ that are not equal to $0$, you substract $4\cdot3$. Then you remove (1,b,c) and (a,1,c) so you substract $4\cdot3$ twice. Then for $ab = 1$ you substract $4\cdot3$ again and you are left with $0$. So yeah, it's true for $Z_4$, but it's not exactly a real proof. Maybe there is some peculiar group out there for which there are more elements left? I guess you would just generalize it to some order $x$ but then I don't get $0$ like I did above. So my  question is how do you know you have all possible combinations $a,b, c, \neq 1$ when basically your proof consists of checking different cases.

450624,Conditional Expectation for Geometric Series - Dice problem,"A fair die is rolled repeatedly.  Let $X$ be the number of rolls needed to obtain a 5 and $Y$ the number of rolls needed to obtain a 6.  Calculate $E[X \mid Y=2]$. I found a similar post of this same question here: A question on conditional expectation But I still do not understand the solution after reading it.  If someone could hold my hand a little and provide a more thorough explanation I would really appreciate it. This is what's going through my head: Since $Y=2$, we roll a 6 on the second roll, meaning that we do not get a 6 on the first roll.  Therefore, the first roll has a uniform distribution of the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$.  We also know that $\Pr(X=2 \mid Y=2)=0$ because these events are mutually exclusive.  We can apply the definition of expected value now and I let $Z=X \mid (Y=2)$. $E[Z]=\sum\limits_{z=1,z \ge 3}^{\infty} z \cdot \Pr[Z] \tag{1}$ Now: $\Pr[Z=1]=\Pr[X=1 \mid Y=2] = \Pr[5 \text{ on first roll} \mid 6 \text{ on second roll}]=1/5$ $\Pr[Z=2]=0$ as mentioned above. Now I get confused when I calculate probabilities for $Z \ge 3$, and would appreciate some guidance: $\Pr[Z=3]=\Pr[X=3 \mid Y=2] =\Pr[5 \text{ on third roll} \mid 6 \text{ on second roll}]$ So to calculate this probability, I thought I'd break this case down: Question 1: I thought the first roll only can be from the set:  $\{1,2,3,4\}$.  Second roll = 6, and Third roll = 5.  But I think the solution to this probability is: $(4/5)(1)(1/6)$.  I don't see why the probability of the first roll is (4/5) because for this case, we can only get a 6 on the second roll.  Can someone please explain and perhaps illustrate another example like $Pr[Z=4]$? Question 2: My approach then was to find the equation for $\Pr[Z \ge 3]$ and then apply equation (1) to get the solution.  Is this the best approach?

Also assume that $f$ is never zero and $f(0) = 1$. What is the function? I believe that the problem can be solved in part by using what we refer to as the Cauchy derivative estimates (inequalities in the book). Which tells us: $$|f^{(n)}(z_0)| \le \frac{n!}{R^n} \, \sup_{|z-z_0| = R} |(f(z)|$$
(where the $|z-z_0| = R$ is allowsing $z$ to be on the boundary of the circle of radius $R$. So by letting $z_0$ be arbitrary, we can use the n-th derivative here and the bound for $f(z)$ to show that for large $R$, this limits to 0. My question really revolves around whether or not we can say more. This argument tells us that $f$ is a polynomial of at most degree $n$, and as $f(0) = 1$, we know that the constant term is 1, but can we say anything else to answer ""What is the function""?","['derivatives', 'estimation', 'functional-analysis', 'complex-analysis']"

If $f$ is a polynomial of degree larger than $d$, then $|f|$ grows faster than $|p|$, but the situation is not so clear when the expansion of $f$ has infinitely many nonzero coefficients. I would expect the growth of the function $f$ then to be faster than that of $p$, as with the function $e^z = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^n}{n!}$. However the function $\frac{1}{1-z} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z^n$ also has infinitely many nonzero coefficients and grows slower than any polynomial (as $|z|\to\infty$). I realize this is related to the failure of the power series to converge outside a disk of radius $1$. Also, $log(z)$ grows slower than any polynomial, but any power series representation cannot converge on an infinite radius (The function itself cannot be well-defined everywhere in the complex plane simultaneously). Under what conditions can we say that a power series with infinitely many nonzero coefficients represents a function that grows faster than any polynomial? Is this true for any power series with infinite radius of convergence? Are there such power series which grow at the rate $z^\alpha$, for any $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$?
