implies that 
$$f(ax + (1-a)y) \leq af(x) + (1-a)f(y)\ , a \in (0, 1)\ .$$ I have tried every algebraic manipulation I can come up with to no avail. If I were to assume $f$ and $g$ are both twice differentiable, it is easy to show the second partial derivative of $f(x)$ w.r.t. $x$ is non negative, and hence, $f(x)$ is convex. However, I would like to prove it using the formal definition of convexity.","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

532728,A statistical approach to the prisoners problem,"Two days ago, I found this problem on reddit (I didn't have access to reddit when I did the math, so I did it with 24 instead of 23, and I decided the warden picked someone every day, not ""whenever he feels like it""): A prison warden tells 24 prisoners he has a ""game"" for them. Once per day, the warden chooses one prisoner at random and leads them to the Switch Room. The aptly named Switch Room has two switches, both at the Off position at first, that are connected to nothing. The called prisoner has to toggle exactly one switch. At any time, any prisoner can go to the warden and tell him that the 24 prisoners all went to the Switch Room at least once. If that's true, they're all freed. If not, they're going to be made into sausages for the other inmates or something. The prisoners can come up with a plan now but won't ever be able to communicate again until someone tells the warden. EDIT After some debating with @alex.jordan , I wanted to clarify my intent. My perspective is that this is a metaphor for ""how would you tell that N distinct events, uniformly and randomly happening, all happened at least once if you only had 2 bits to spare"", and has nothing to do with an actual warden (who could be biased in his random choices or use a different distribution model to screw up the prisoners), or actual prisoners. I am solely interested in an answer that assumes a prisoner is selected randomly and uniformly once every day (not ""from time to time"" as stated in the reddit riddle), so you can safely ignore any assumption that the warden is out there to grind the prisoners to sausages or selects people with a bias or just won't ever select anyone. The ""classical"" solution is that the prisoners designate one leader. When a prisoner enters the Switch Room (except the leader), if they've never been there and find the first switch in the Off position, they turn it on. Otherwise, they toggle the other switch. When the leader enters the Switch Room, if he sees the first switch in the On position, he knows that someone who's never been there before has been, so he counts one and turns off the switch. When he has counted to 23, he knows that everyone has been there at least one. The thing is, this solution sucks. Assuming 24 prisoners again, and knowing they're picked at random, we can represent the whole thing as a series of geometric distributions (this also assumes I'm doing it right, which I may not be): $$
X: \text{number of days before the Leader goes to the Switch Room}\\
X \sim Geom\left(\frac{1}{24}\right)\\
E(X) = 24, Var(X) = 552\\
$$
$$
Y_n: \text{number of days before one of the n remaining prisoner}\\
\text{goes to the Switch Room for the first time (n from 1 through 23)}\\
Y_n \sim Geom\left(\frac{n}{24}\right)\\
E(Y_n) = \frac{24}{n}, Var(Y_n) = \frac{24 (24-n)}{n^2}
$$ Since expected values and variance can be linearly added, we can expect that the Leader will tell the warden after on average 642 days, with a standard deviation of 116, by assuming the leader will go $E(X)$ days after any given prisoner went for the first time as modeled by $E(Y_n)$: $$
Z: \text{Number of days before the Leader announces everyone's been to the Switch Room}\\
E(Z) = \sum_{n=1}^{23}E(X) + E(Y_n) = 552 + \sum_{n=1}^{23}E(Y_n) \approx 552 + 89.6229 \approx 641.6229\\
Var(Z) = \sum_{n=1}^{23}Var(X) + Var(Y_n) = 12696 + \sum_{n=1}^{23}Var(Y_n) \approx 12696 + 833.3521 \approx 13529.3521\\
\sigma = \sqrt{13529.3521} = 116.3157
$$ Very simple maths tell us that after 642 days, every prisoner's been on average 26 times to the Switch Room. This looks like a horrible waste of time. I'm pretty sure it's possible to calculate how many days you would need to wait before you have 99% chances (or higher) that each prisoner has been there. Problem is, I'm only halfway through my college stats class, and we've only seen easy distributions where successes are independent, so I'm not too sure how to tackle that. How would you calculate the chances that each prisoner has been to the Switch Room after $Z$ days? EDIT I just made a quick and dirty program to run ""simulations"", and it takes on average 90.6 days until every prisoner has visited the Switch Room, with a standard deviation of 28.5. Making that into a normal distribution, it should be around 157 days before we can say with 99% certainty that each prisoner has visited the Switch Room at least once, and 179 days for 99.9% certainty. Needless to say, you're pretty safe after 641 days... It's an empirical technique and it doesn't really feel mathematically satisfying, so the question is still open for better answers.","['statistics', 'puzzle']"

532907,Tallest bubble tower induction proof,"A hemispherical bubble is placed on a spherical bubble of radius $1$. A smaller hemispherical bubble is then placed on the first one. This process is continued until $n$ chambers, including the sphere, are formed. (The figure shows the case $n = 4$.) Use mathematical induction to prove that the maximum height of any bubble tower with $n$ chambers is $1 + \sqrt{n}$. I can find the relationship of the radii :$$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(R_{n}) = R_{n+1}$$ But, I still do not see how to use the inductive hypothesis to make a proof. Suppose $R$ is the radius of the $n$'th bubble and $x$ is the radius of the $(n+1)$'th bubble.

Then the marble drawn, together with $c > 0$ marbles of the same color, are returned to the urn. Suppose that $n$ such draws are made from the urn. Find the probability of selecting a red marble at any draw. So here is what I have so far: $$\text{P{a red ball in at least one of the $n$ draws}}=1-\text{P{green balls in all $n$ draws}}$$ I noted that $$\text{P{all green balls}}=\text{P{X$_1$$\;$=$\;$green}}\times{...}\times\text{P{X$_n$$\;$=$\;$green$\;$|$\;$X$_1$$\;$=$\;$${...}$$\;$=$\;$X$_{n-1}$=$\;$green}}$$ Thus, I calculated $\text{P{a red ball in at least one of the $n$ draws}}$ as $$1-\left(\frac{g}{r+g}\right)\left(\frac{g+c}{r+g+c}\right){...}\left(\frac{g+(n-1)c}{r+g+(n-1)c}\right)$$ I do not know if my way is correct or not.

532981,What separates rotations from other co-ordinate transformations?,"I am confused about some seemingly elementary ideas. From what I have understood, a rotation is just a specific class of co-ordinate transformations. If this is true, what exactly separates a rotation from the other transformations? I will give an example below. Let us take an $n$-dimensional manifold (we have provided with a metric), to label points on the manifold we use have co-ordinates  $$x^1,...,x^n$$
Let us transform the co-ordinates into new co-ordinates $$x'^k=x'^k(x^1,...,x^n) $$ where $k$ goes from $1$ to $n$. These functions are single valued, continuous and have continuous derivatives. The elements of the metric (for the original co-ordinate system) are $f_{ij}(x_1,...,x_n)$. The elements of the new metric $f'_{ij}$ are related to the old as $$f_{ij} = f'_{kl}{a^{k}_{i}}{a^{l}_{j}}$$ where $a^{r}_{s}$ is an element of the Jacobian. Now, what exactly are the restrictions that must be imposed on the elements ${a^{r}_{s}}$ to constitute a 'rotation'?

Then, I've just been to able to prove the following theorem : Theorem : If $(\star)$ is true, then $\frac{\zeta (5)}{\zeta (2)\zeta (3)}$ is an irrational number. However, I can't prove that $(\star)$ is true. Can anyone help? In the following, I'm going to prove the theorem. Here, note that $(\star)$ is saying that 
$$aI_{4}+bI_{3}+cI_2=0\ (a,b,c\in\mathbb Z)\Rightarrow a=b=c=0$$
where
$$I_m=\frac{1}{{\pi}^{m+1}}\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}x^m\log(\sin x)dx.$$ Lemma : 
$$I_2=-\frac{1}{24}\log 2+\frac{3}{16}\frac{\zeta (3)}{{\pi}^2}.$$
$$I_3=-\frac{1}{64}\log 2+\frac{9}{64}\frac{\zeta (3)}{{\pi}^2}-\frac{93}{128}\frac{\zeta(5)}{{\pi}^4}.$$
$$I_4=-\frac{1}{160}\log 2+\frac{3}{32}\frac{\zeta (3)}{{\pi}^2}-\frac{45}{64}\frac{\zeta(5)}{{\pi}^4}.$$ Proof for lemma : By
$$\log(\sin x)=-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac 1n\cos(2n\pi)-\log 2$$
for $0\lt x\lt \frac{\pi}{2}$, we get
$${\pi}^{m+1}I_m=-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac 1n\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}x^m\cos(2n\pi)dx-\frac{1}{m+1}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{m+1}\log 2.$$
Here, by utilizing partial integration, we get
$$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}x^2\cos(2nx)dx=(-1)^n\frac{\pi}{4n^2},$$
$$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}x^3\cos(2nx)dx=\frac{3}{8n^4}-(-1)^n\frac{3}{8n^4}+(-1)^n\frac{3{\pi}^2}{16n^2},$$
$$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}x^4\cos(2nx)dx=-(-1)^n\frac{3\pi}{4n^4}+(-1)^n\frac{{\pi}^3}{8n^2}.$$
Hence, since we get
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{n^3}=-\left(1-2\cdot\frac{1}{2^3}\right)\zeta(3)=-\frac 34\zeta(3)$$
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{n^5}=-\left(1-2\cdot\frac{1}{2^5}\right)\zeta(5)=-\frac{15}{16}\zeta(5),$$
we get $I_2,I_3,I_4$ as desired. Now the proof for lemma is completed. Proof for theorem : By the above lemma, we can write
$$\left(\begin{matrix}
        I_2  \\
        I_3 \\
        I_4  \\
        \end{matrix}
\right)=\left(\begin{matrix}
        -\frac{1}{24} & \frac{3}{16} & 0 \\
        -\frac{1}{64} & \frac{9}{64} & -\frac{93}{128} \\
        -\frac{1}{160} & \frac{3}{32} & -\frac{45}{64} \\
        \end{matrix}
\right)\left(\begin{matrix}
        \log 2  \\
        {\zeta (3)}/{{\pi}^2} \\
        {\zeta(5)}/{{\pi}^4}  \\
        \end{matrix}
\right)$$
Hence, we get
$$\frac{\zeta(3)}{{\pi}^2}=-\frac 13(1240I_4-1200I_3+264I_2),$$
$$\frac{\zeta(5)}{{\pi}^4}=-\frac 13(120I_4-112I_3+24I_2).$$
Hence, since $\zeta(2)={{\pi}^2}/{6}$, we get
$$\frac{\zeta(5)}{\zeta(2)\zeta(3)}=6\frac{{\zeta(5)}/{{\pi}^4}}{{\zeta(3)}/{{\pi}^2}}=6\frac{120I_4-112I_3+24I_2}{1240I_4-1200I_3+264I_2}.$$
Now if $\frac{\zeta(5)}{\zeta(2)\zeta(3)}$ is a rational number, then there exist natural numbers $r,s$ such that 
$$\frac{120I_4-112I_3+24I_2}{1240I_4-1200I_3+264I_2}=\frac sr.$$
Hence, we get
$$(120r-1240s)I_4-(112r-1200s)I_3+(24r-264s)I_2=0$$
$$\Rightarrow 120r-1240s=112r-1200s=24r-264s=0$$
$$\Rightarrow 3r=31s,\ 7r=75s,\ r=11s.$$
However, there don't exist such $r,s$. Hence, we know that $\frac{\zeta(5)}{\zeta(2)\zeta(3)}$ is an irrational number. Now the proof for theorem is completed. Update : I crossposted to MO .",['integration']

Find the probability that the game will end at the seventh throw. So here is what I have so far. I considered two cases: (1) _ _ _ THHH ; and (2) _ _ _ HTTT. So for the first case, the only ways that the 3 blanks can be filled up are through the outcomes $$\text{HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, and THT}$$ So what I did is that I took the individual probabilities of each sequence, e.g. $$\text{P{HHT}}=p^2(1-p)$$ and so on. So I add all these 5 probabilities and multiplied the sum with having THHH as the last 4 outcomes, i.e. $$\text{P{THHH}}=p^3(1-p)$$ I did the same thing for the second case. Afterwards, I added probabilities for both cases; thus, giving me the result $$(1-p)p^3[1-p(1-p)^2-(1-p)^3-p^3]+p(1-p)^3[1-p^2(1-p)-p^3-(1-p)^3]$$ I would like to ask if I am doing it correctly or not, or whether there is a shorter solution. I read some texts that considered the problem as a renewal process; however, I have trouble understanding it, especially all I have found so far concern with ""expected number of tosses"".

533624,Question about Hartshorne problem (II 4.7),"I am in a weird situation with problem II 4.7 in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry. I can do parts b, c,d and e and I understand what to do in part a. but I am stuck on technical details. Here is the set up. We have a variety over $ \mathbb{C}$ and a degree $2$ automorphism $ \sigma : X \to X$ which conjugates coefficients in $ \mathbb{C}$ . We want to produce a variety $ X_0$ over $ \mathbb{R}$ which base changes to $X$ . Let $G = \mathbb{Z} / 2 $ . Then we have a homomorphism $ G \to {\rm Aut}(X)$ which sends $1 $ to $ \sigma$ . The scheme $ X_0$ should be $ X / G$ . The fact that $X$ is separated and that any two points are contained in an affine subscheme guarantee that $X/G$ exists as a scheme. Also it is obvious that $X/G$ is finite type over $ \mathbb{R}$ . Problem 1: How does one go about proving that such a quotient is separated? Problem 2: How do you prove that $X_0$ base changes to $X$ ? If the equations of $X$ all have coefficients in $ \mathbb{R}$ and $ \sigma$ is just conjugation, then problem 2 is easy. Here is an example of when $ \sigma$ is not just complex conjugation Example: Define $ \sigma : \mathbb{A}^2_{\mathbb{C}} \to \mathbb{A}^2_{\mathbb{C}}$ to be the morphism whose pullback is $ a X^p Y^p \mapsto \overline{a} Y^p X^q $ .

533626,Convergence of the arithmetic mean,"Let $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a convergent sequence with limit $a \in \mathbb{R}$. Show that the arithmetic mean given by: $$s_n:= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \tag{A.M.} $$
also converges to $a$. I have read: arithmetic mean of a sequence converges but unfortunately the answers there don't help me much because I don't understand their substitutions and most of it all, why their substitutions seem to work. What I know from the problem is that since $a_n$ is convergent and $\epsilon >0$ is given, I can say that: $$\exists N_1 \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n \geq N_1: |a_n-a|<\epsilon_1 $$
I also know that since $a_n$ is convergent, it is bound, so $(a_n) < M, \ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ I need to show that: $$\exists N_2 \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n \geq N_2: |s_n-a|< \epsilon_2$$
I started as follows: $$ \left|s_n-a \right| = \left|\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^na_i -a\right|= \left|\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^m(a_i-a)+\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=m+1}^n(a_i-a) \right| \\ \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^m|(a_i-a)|+\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=m+1}^n|a_i-a|$$
I believe to understand that the left sum after the $\leq$ is finite, bound and doesn't depend on the values that $n$ takes on. However, I don't understand where all the substitutions come from and make this proof so seemingly easy to complete. Is there a general idea I can follow to complete such proofs? Because I know that the last step is to show that the given sum is smaller than $\epsilon$. I also know that I should bring the condition $a_n < M$ into place somewhere, but I don't know where. If I choose an $n \geq N: |a_n-a|< \epsilon'$ what does that tell me about $|a_i-a|$? I know that they are seemingly the same just with a different index.","['sequences-and-series', 'analysis']"
533636,Convergence of alternating nested radicals,"Last evening, after reading a couple of questions about nested radicals, I started to wonder about problems involving what I will term ""alternating nested radicals;"" below is an example, which I found here . Prove the convergence of, and evaluate, $\sqrt{7 -\sqrt{7 + \sqrt{7...}}}$ It turns out that this nested radical converges to $2$, and this is not especially hard to argue on an ad-hoc basis. However, I became interested in the general solution of the problem of evaluating $\sqrt{q -\sqrt{q + \sqrt{q...}}} \text{ }\text{ }$ for an arbitrary positive real $q$. Despite some searching, I was not able to find a paper which stated a theorem on this, so I resorted to working it out for myself. I have developed an argument which I believe gives the correct result for all $q > 1.$ I have checked its predictions against several alternating nested radicals, and they agree with computation. Theorem: $\sqrt{q -\sqrt{q + \sqrt{q...}}} = \frac{\sqrt{1 + 4(q-1)}-1}{2}$ Argument: We make two significant assumptions: that $\sqrt{q -\sqrt{q + \sqrt{q...}}} \text{ }\text{ }$ converges; and, inspired by the fact that $\sqrt{q +\sqrt{q + \sqrt{q...}}} \text{ }\text{ } = x$ satisfies $x^2 - x - q = 0$, we assume that $\sqrt{q -\sqrt{q + \sqrt{q...}}} \text{ }\text{ } = x$ satisfies $x^2 + x - a$ for some $a$. By the self-similarity of the alternating nested radical, we find \begin{align} 
\sqrt{q - \sqrt{q + x}} &= x \\
 q - \sqrt{q + x} &= x^2 \\
&= a-x \\
\therefore q + x - \sqrt{q + x} &= a
\end{align} Solving this as a quadratic in $\sqrt{q+x}$ yields $$\sqrt{q+x} = \frac{\sqrt{1 + 4a} + 1}{2}.$$ Again using our second assumption, we have $$x = \frac{\sqrt{1 + 4a} - 1}{2}.$$ But now $$ \sqrt{q+x} - x = \frac{\sqrt{1 + 4a} + 1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{1 + 4a} - 1}{2} = 1$$ and so we get $$ q+x = (1+x)^2$$ and thus $$ x^2 + x - (q-1) = 0.$$ Solving this quadratic for $x$ then gives the theorem. I am pretty sure that my second assumption above would be impossible to defend; so, basically, I have the following questions: How can we rigorously prove that the alternating nested radical converges? How can we show, for a general $q$, that it converges to the value given in the theorem? And one other thing: any general references to ubiquitous convergence theorems or techniques would be greatly appreciated!","['nested-radicals', 'convergence-divergence', 'intuition', 'analysis']"

I have been trying to show that $o(A \cap x B x^{-1})$ equals the number of duplicate terms in the list of all possible products of an element from $A$ and an element from $xB$. Suppose $a_0 \in A \cap xBx^{-1}$. Then $\exists b_0 \in B : a_0 = x b_0 x^{-1}$.

Prove that the sequence $(f_n)$ is uniformly integrable, that is the sequence satisfies the following: i) $\displaystyle\sup\limits_{n} \|f_{n} \|_{1} < +\infty$ ii)  $\displaystyle\sup\limits_{n} \int_{|f_{n}| >M} \left | f_n \right | d \mu \rightarrow 0$ as $M \rightarrow \infty$ iii) $\displaystyle\sup\limits_{n} \int_{|f_{n}| < \delta} \left | f \right | d \mu \rightarrow 0$ as $\delta \rightarrow 0$. I'm working on this problem and am having some difficulty. Part (i) is straight forward from $\left |f_n \right |< \left |f_n -f \right | +\left |f \right |$. Since the sequence is in $L^1$ it follows that $f$ is, so we have that $\int \left | f \right | =A <+\infty$. Let $\epsilon >0$, then we can find an $N$ so that for $n \geq N$ we have $\|f-f_{n} \|_{1} < \epsilon$. If $B = \max\{\|f-f_{1} \|_{1},\|f-f_{2} \|_{1},\ldots, \|f-f_{N-1} \|_{1},\epsilon\}$, then $\| f_n \| < A + B < +\infty$ for all $n$. Part (ii) I'm thinking that we should somehow use the fact that $\{{f_n} >M\} \subseteq \{ \left | f_n-f \right | > \frac{M}{2}\} \cup  \{\left | f \right | > \frac{M}{2}\}$ to break up the integral into pieces which we can control. Part(iii) I'm thinking that we can again use $\left |f \right |< \left |f -f_n \right | +\left |f_n \right |$. For a fixed $n$ we can show that $\int_{|f_n| < \delta} |f_n| \rightarrow 0$ as $\delta \rightarrow 0$ so if we can somehow bound $\int_{|f_n| < \delta} |f-f_n|$ we will be done.

533768,Existence of limit for convergence by measure for Cauchy-in-measure sequence+completeness of metric space?,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to put it. But this question come from a graduate level textbook and seems pretty hard to me, so I hope this is a good place. Anyway, this come from the book Real analysis for graduate students (Bass). Note that in this book they deal mainly with real-valued function. From exercise 10.1: A sequence of measurable function $f_{n}$ is Cauchy in measure if for any $a,\epsilon>0$ then there exist an $N$ such that for all $m,n\geq N$ then $\mu(\{x:|f_{n}(x)-f_{m}(x)|>a\}<\epsilon$. A sequence of measurable function $f_{n}$ converge in measure to measurable $f$ if for any $a,\epsilon>0$ then there exist an $N$ such that for all $n\geq N$ then $\mu(x:|f_{n}(x)-f(x)|>a\}<\epsilon$. Now this question ask that, given any sequence that is Cauchy in measure, prove that it must converge in measure. As you can see, the question do not specify any function $f$ to converge in measure to, so I assume that ""converge in measure"" means ""converge in measure to $f$ for some measurable $f$"". Since the definition of converge in measure require an $f$, the first step would be to acquire one somehow. So here is what I got so far: Constructing $f$ through finite arithmetic operation on these $f_{n}$ also fail. These $f_{n}$ can stay in the realm of rationals and $f$ can still be irrational. Constructing $f$ through pointwise limit fail. The sequence can diverge pointwise everywhere and still have an $f$ to converge-by-measure to. Every theorem in the book already assume existence of $f$, so they are of no help. These $f_{n}$ can be unbounded, or even not integrable, yet an $f$ still exist. And $\mu$ is not required to be $\sigma$-finite (edit: figured out that the problem is reducible to finite measure case; but still can't bound the functions). So this basically throw a wrench into any method that try to use integration. ""Average out"" (that is $f(x)=\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x)}{n}$) also fail, as it can produce the wrong $f$. If $f$ exist, it is unique under the equivalent relation of almost everywhere equal. I am at my wit's end here, what's with all the technique rendered useless. Right now I am trying this direction, but I don't have much hope for this: Define $d([f],[g])=\min\{\epsilon:\mu(\{x:|f(x)-g(x)|>\epsilon\})\leq\epsilon\}$ where the equivalence class is due to equal-almost-everywhere relation. This is not completely well-defined, as the set taking the minimum over might be empty. However, using Cauchy-in-measure property allow us to get to a point in the sequence where we can generate a metric space containing all the remaining function in the sequence; also, the sequence would then be Cauchy in this metric too. Now if I were to be able to prove that this metric space is complete in a way that does not require me to prove the original question, then I can use it to do the problem. However, this space is clearly not compact, so that's one proof technique out (edit: wait, this space is totally bounded; so if it are to be complete, it should be compact. Still, not sure how to prove that it is compact) (edit: nevermind it's not actually totally bounded, I just defined it too small). EDIT: I am investigating the possibility of filtering out a subsequence that converge pointwise almost everywhere. However, it seems like there are many possible subsequence that can converge to many different function. So not much hope here, but I am trying to see if it can be proved that all these function are equal almost everywhere. So can someone shed a light on this? Any helps would be appreciated.

The only difficult part it's to prove that $d(X,Y)=0$ if and only if $X=Y$ almost surely (a.e) and also that $X_n \to X$ in probability if and only iff $d(X_n,X)\to 0$  Thus this metric induces the probability convergence.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'random-variables']"

Usually measurability does not depend on having a measure anyway.  Is this really the right definition?  If so, how is it related to the more natural notion of measurability which would be the Borel $\sigma$ algebra from the norm topology of the Banach space? Since this notion of measurability must be not equivalent to the standard one if the Banach space is $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$, what kind of theorems can we expect about the Bochner integral still being in some sense an extension of the Lebesgue?","['lebesgue-integral', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"

534000,"Is the Cantor set a subset of rational numbers, and is it countable or uncountable?","In Chapter 2 of Rudin's Priniciples of Mathematical Analysis , Rudin takes the Cantor set as an example of a perfect set in $\mathbb{R}^1$ which contains no segment. Here's the construction of the Cantor set and the proof: 2.44 The Cantor set The set which we are now going to construct shows
  that there exist perfect sets in $\mathbb{R}^1$ which contain no segment. Let $E_0$ be the interval $[0, 1]$. Remove the segment $(\frac13,\frac23)$, and let $E_1$ be
  the union of the intervals
  $$[0,\frac13], [\frac23,1].$$
  Remove the middle thirds of these intervals, and let $E_2$ be the union of the
  intervals
  $$[0,\frac19], [\frac29,\frac39], [\frac69,\frac79],[\frac89,1]$$
  Continuing in this way, we obtain a sequence of compact sets $E_n$, such that (a) $E_1\supset E_2  \supset E_3 \dots $; (b) $E_n$ is the union of $2^n$ intervals, each of length $3^{-n}$. The set
  $$P=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty E_n$$
  is called the Cantor set . $P$ is clearly compact, and Theorem 2.36 shows that $P$
  is not empty. No segment of the form
  $$\left(\frac{3k+1}{3^m},\frac{3k+2}{3^m}\right)\tag{24},$$
  where $k$ and $m$ are positive integers, has a point in common with $P$.
  Since every segment $(\alpha,\beta)$ contains a segment of the form (24), if
  $$3^{-m}<\frac{\beta-\alpha}6,$$
  $P$ contains no segment. To show that $P$ is perfect, it is enough to show that $P$ contains no isolated
  point. Let $x \in P$, and let $S$ be any segment containing $x$. Let $I_n$ be that interval
  of $E_n$ which contains $x$. Choose $n$ large enough, so that $I_n\subset S$. Let $x_n$ be an
  endpoint of $I_n$, such that $x_n\ne x$. It follows from the construction of $P$ that $x_n\in P$. Hence $x$ is a limit point
  of $P$, and $P$ is perfect. One of the most interesting properties of the Cantor set is that it provides
  us with an example of an uncountable set of measure zero (the concept of
  measure will be discussed in Chap. 11). I can follow the proof with some effort, but in the end of this section Rudin claims that the Cantor set is an example of an uncountable set of measure zero. How can the Cantor set be uncountable? Corollary of Theorem 2.13 shows the set of all rational numbers is countable. Theorem 2.8 shows that every infinite subset of a countable set is countable. The elements in the Cantor set are the end points of all the intervals in $E_n$, it follows from the construction of the Cantor set that these end points are all rational numbers. Hence $P$ is a subset of the rational numbers and countable. Is there anything wrong with my reasoning here?","['real-analysis', 'cantor-set']"

  then
  $$\cos{x}=\dfrac{1-a^2}{1+b^2},\cos{y}=\dfrac{1-b^2}{1+b^2}$$
  then
  $$\dfrac{\cos{x}\cos{\dfrac{y}{2}}}{\cos{(x-\dfrac{y}{2})}}=\dfrac{1}{1+\tan{x}\tan{\dfrac{y}{2}}}=\dfrac{1-a^2}{1-a^2+2ab}$$
  and
  $$\dfrac{\cos{y}\cos{\dfrac{x}{2}}}{\cos{(y-\dfrac{x}{2})}}=\dfrac{1-b^2}{1-b^2+2ab}$$
  so
  $$\dfrac{1-a^2}{1-a^2+2ab}+\dfrac{1-b^2}{1-b^2+2ab}=1$$
  then
  $$\Longrightarrow (1-a^2)(1-b^2+2ab)+(1-b^2)(1-a^2+2ab)=(1-a^2+2ab)(1-b^2+2ab)$$
  then
  $$(1-b^2)(1-a^2+2ab)=2ab(1-b^2+2ab)$$
