1256091,Shared eigenvectors between $A$ and $A^k$,"$\newcommand\la{\lambda}$
Thanks to the spectral mapping theorem,
we know that if $\la_1,\ldots,\la_n$ are the eigenvalues of a $n\times n$ complex matrix $A$, then $\la_1^k,\ldots,\la_n^k$ are the eigenvalues of $A^k$. Furthermore,
if $v_i$ is an eigenvector of $A$ associated to $\lambda_i$,
then $v_i$ is also an eigenvector of $A^k$ associated to $\la_i^k$.
Indeed,
$A^kv=A^{k-1}\la_i v_i=\cdots=\la_i^kv_i$. So my question is the following: If $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ are the eigenvectors of $A$, are $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ also all the eigenvectors of $A^k$? In other words, is it possible that there is some vector $v$ that is an eigenvector of $A^k$ but not an eigenvector of $A$? It seems intuitive that this should not happen, but I am unable to find an argument to show it.","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'linear-algebra', 'matrices']"

1256150,Proving divisibility of $\sum\limits_{r=1}^{p-1} {r^{p^n}}$ by p.,"Let $p>2$ be an odd number and let $n$ be a positive integer. Prove that $p$ divides $${\sum\limits_{r=1}^{p-1}{r^{p^n}}}$$ My Proof:
From multinomial expansion, we know that $${(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + p-1)}^{p^n}= 1^{p^n}+ 2^{p^n}+....+ (p-1)^{p^n} + \sum\limits_{k_1+k_2+...+k_{p-1}={p^n}}{{p^n}\choose{k_1,k_2,..,k_{p-1}}}\prod\limits_{1\leq r\leq p-1}r^{p^{k_{t}}} $$, where  $k_1,k_2,..,k_{p-1}\neq{p^n}$.
So, we may also write , $${\sum\limits_{r=1}^{p-1}{r^{p^n}}}=\left(\small{\frac{p(p-1)}{2}}\right)^{p^n} - \sum\limits_{k_1+k_2+...+k_{p-1}={p^n}}{{p^n}\choose{k_1,k_2,..,k_{p-1}}}\prod\limits_{1\leq r\leq p-1}r^{p^{k_{t}}} $$
Now, $$\left(\frac{p(p-1)}{2}\right)^{p^n} $$ is divisible by $p$ and $$\sum\limits_{k_1+k_2+...+k_{p-1}={p^n}}{{p^n}\choose{k_1,k_2,..,k_{p-1}}}\prod\limits_{1\leq r\leq p-1}r^{p^{k_{t}}}$$ is also divisible by $p$ since multinomial coefficients consist of $p!$.
Therefore, $${\sum\limits_{r=1}^{p-1}{r^{p^n}}}$$  is divisible by $p$. Please tell me if my proof is correct. If yes, then do I need to provide any more details to my proof? If my proof is incorrect, please help me in proving it,please. Thank you! :)","['number-theory', 'divisibility', 'elementary-number-theory']"

1256386,Spectral measure associated to eigenvector of self-adjoint operator,"Let $A$ be a self-adjoint operator on .the Hilbertspace $H$ and let $\lambda_0$ be an eigenvalue of $A$ with corresponding eigenvector $\psi$.
The spectral theorem tells us,that there is a projection-valued measure $P_A$ such that
$A = \int \lambda dP_A(\lambda)$.
To each vector $x \in H$ we associate a finite Borel measure $\mu_x$ defined by
$\mu_\psi(\Omega) = \langle \psi, P_A(\Omega) \psi\rangle$. 1) I would like first to understand the very basic example of $A$ an operator on finite-dimensional $\mathbb C^n$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_1,...,\lambda_m$, $P_j$ the projection corresponding to eigenspace of $\lambda_j$. Then $A = \sum_j \lambda_j P_j$. I would like to understand why then we have
$\mu_\psi(\lambda) = \sum \|P_j \psi \|^2 \delta(\lambda-\lambda_j)$. 2) Secondly, for a self-adjoint operator $A$ on $H$, if $\psi$ is an eigenvector to eigenvalue $\lambda_0$, $\|\psi\| = 1$, is it possible to give $\mu_\psi$ explicitely? Maybe someone can give a short explanation what I have to understand to find the expression by myself. Edit:
I feel stupid, but one last question: why is $\mu_\psi(\{\lambda_0\}) := \langle \psi, P_A(\lambda_0\}) \psi \rangle = \|\psi\|^2$? (in the case 2 that $\psi$ is an eigenvector to the eigenvalue $\lambda_0$)","['spectral-theory', 'functional-analysis']"
1256403,Proof of $\zeta(2)=\frac{\pi^2}{6}$,"While messing around with some integrals, I have found the following proof for $\zeta(2)=\frac{\pi^2}{6}$, but I'm not sure if it is valid: We take a look at the integral $I=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \ln(\cos(x))\space dx$. Clearly, we have $\Im(I)=0$; to show that the integral converges isn't difficult and consequently, it is real. Now some calculations using $\cos(x)=\frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2}$:
$$
I=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \ln\left(\frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2}\right)\space dx=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \ln\left(e^{2ix}+1\right)-ix-\ln(2)\space dx=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \ln\left(e^{2ix}+1\right)\space dx-i\frac{\pi^2}{8}-\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(2)
$$
Now:
$$
J=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \ln\left(e^{2ix}+1\right)\space dx=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}\cdot e^{2ixk}}{k}\space dx=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}\cdot \left[\frac{e^{2ixk}}{2ik}\right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}}{k}=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}\cdot \left(\frac{(-1)^k-1}{2ik}\right)}{k}
$$
When $k$ is even, then $(-1)^k-1=0$ so those terms cancel out, leaving:
$$
J=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\left(\frac{-2}{2i(2k-1)}\right)}{2k-1}=i\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(2k-1)^2}=i\left(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^2}-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(2k)^2}\right)=i\cdot\frac{3}{4}\zeta(2)
$$
Clearly, we have $\Re(J)=0$ and therefore $0=\Im(I)=\frac{3}{4}\zeta(2)-\frac{\pi^2}{8}$ and thus $\zeta(2)=\frac{\pi^2}{6}$. I'm not sure with all those complex terms which are involved so it would be highly appreciated if someone could tell me wether the steps are valid or not. Edit: The main aspects I'm concerned about are $\ln\left(e^{ix}+e^{-ix}\right)=\ln\left(e^{2ix}+1\right)-ix$ or $e^{i\pi k}=(-1)^{k}$ and in general manipulations involving the natural log of complex arguments, because I'm familar with the fact, that it can take infinitly potential values, but until now I havent had a proper introduction to the subject and learned the major things autodidactically, so I'm not sure about the validity.","['calculus', 'riemann-zeta', 'proof-verification', 'definite-integrals', 'sequences-and-series']"

1256427,Sumo Wrestler partial round robin tournament,"A coworker of mine is a big fan of Sumo. He recently came to me with a problem he's been wondering about for years: In a professional sumo tournament there are 42 wrestlers. A tournament lasts 15 days. Each wrestler fights once per day. Each bout is with a different opponent. There are no repeat matches. Each bout results in either a win or a loss, there are no ties. Each wrestler will finish with a win/loss record that totals 15 (e.g., 15-0, 0-15, 8-7, 7-8). What is the maximum number of wrestlers out of the 42 that can finish with a winning record (8-7 or better )? What is the maximum number that can finish with a perfect 15-0 record? For the purpose of this problem we'll ignore differences in skill and assume that all wrestlers are equal to each other. In reality the wrestler ranked #1 is almost certainly going to beat #42 every time. To keep it simple we'll treat matches as if they were random coin tosses. Additionally the exact pairings can be random. In a real tournament wrestlers only fight other wrestlers around their own rank; #1 would never have to suffer the indignity of fighting #42. Since we're ignoring skill that fact can also be overlooked. We must also assume no wrestler drops out of the tournament before the 15 days are finished. I'm fairly certain that the answer to the second part of his questions is n/2 or 21. If after the first day all of the winners keep fighting losers and keep winning then I believe the tournament will be over before all matches are exhausted. I'm not sure how to prove this though. As for the first part of the problem I'm not even sure where to begin. I was able to find some information about efficiently scheduling partial round robin tournaments but nothing about characterizing their outcomes.",['combinatorics']

To solve that problem, I wanted to use Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem. Therefore, I set $f_n(x) = x^p (\ln x )^r \left( 1 - \frac{x}{n} \right)^n$ . Then we clearly have that $\lim_n f_n(x) = x^p (\ln x)^r e^{-x}$ . Plus $f_n$ are measurable for all $n$ .

That is where I'm stuck, I can't find such a function. At first I wanted to use that $\ln(x) \leq x\ \forall x \geq 0$ , thus $f(x) \leq x^{p+r}e^{-x}$ where $f(x) = \lim_n f_n(x)$ but it doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Any help would be appreciated.

1256473,Prove that cube cannot be partitioned into $n>1$ smaller distinct cubes.,"Prove that cube cannot be partitioned into $n>1$ cubes, such that each of them has different side length.

I assumed that large cube is tiled with a $n>1$ cubes such that at all of small cubes have different side length. Then I tried to use induction. For $n=2$ it is trivial that it is impossible because in that case one side of a small cube must be twice of other side. For $n=3$ it is impossible because wherever we place first small cube, the remaining area cannot be a cuboid so we cannot partition the remaining area into $2$ cubes.

1256554,Integral of a function over the Koch Curve. Is it rigourous enough?,"(I want to investigate the validity of this approach, as I already know this is the correct result) I present a proof that $$\int_{K} (x+y) \ \mu(x,y)={{9+\sqrt 3} \over 18}$$
Where the region of integration is the Koch Curve, and $\mu(x,y)$ is measure such that $\mu(K)=1$ and $\mu(K/3)=1/4$. In terms of iteration, the Koch curve at an iteration $i$ can be constructed from $4^i$ lines of lenth $3^{-i}$. The measure of a particular iterate line is thus given by $4^{-i}$ since $\mu(K)$=1. The measure is approximated by taking the limit as $i$ approaches infinity. However, I'm not sure that the argument is mathematically sound. The Koch Curve maps to itself under these four transformations. $$ w_1=\begin{bmatrix} 1/3 & 0 \\ 0 & 1/3 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}$$ $$w_2={1 \over 3} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & -\sqrt3/2 \\ \sqrt3/2 & 1/2 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix} 1/3 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$ $$w_3={1 \over 3} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & \sqrt3/2 \\ -\sqrt3/2 & 1/2 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix} 1/2 \\ \sqrt3/6 \end{bmatrix}
$$ $$w_4=\begin{bmatrix} 1/3 & 0 \\ 0 & 1/3 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix} 2/3 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$ where x and y are the coordinate points of the Koch Curve. Note that since the transformations share the $1/3$ scaling coefficient, we may rewrite the integral as... $$\int_K (x+y) \mu(x,y)=\int_{K/3} (x+y) \mu(x,y)+\int_{K/3} (1/2 \cdot x-\sqrt3/2 \cdot y +1/3)+(\sqrt3/2 \cdot x+1/2 \cdot y) \mu(x,y)+\int_{K/3} (1/2 \cdot x+\sqrt3/2 \cdot y +1/2)+(1/2 \cdot y-\sqrt3/2 \cdot x+\sqrt3/6) \mu(x,y)+\int_{K/3} (x+2/3+y) \mu(x,y)$$ Since the measure density is uniform we can avoid rewriting the measure function. Adding like terms and noting that the integral and measure functions for each integral are the same, we arrive at... $$\int_K (x+y) \mu(x,y)=3 \cdot \int_{K/3} (x+y) \mu(x,y)+\left({{\sqrt3 +9} \over 2} \right) \cdot \int_K \mu(x,y)$$ This result means (I'd presumably do this by induction correct?) that we may iteratively write the integral as...
$$\int_K (x+y) \mu(x,y)= 3^n \cdot \int_{K/{3^n}} (x+y) \mu(x,y)+\sum_{k=0}^n 3^{k-1} \cdot \left({{\sqrt3 +9} \over 2} \right) \cdot 3^k \cdot \int_{K/{3^k}} \mu(x,y)$$ By the definition of the measure, the integral on the right evaluates to $4^{-k}$... $$\int_K (x+y) \mu(x,y)= 3^n \cdot \int_{K/{3^n}} (x+y) \mu(x,y)+\sum_{k=0}^n 1/3 \cdot \left({{\sqrt3 +9} \over 2} \right) \cdot 4^{-k}$$ As n approaches infinity, I can argue that the measure goes down proportional with $4^n$, however I don't know how to put that in a more rigorous format. The final result is... $$\int_{K} (x+y) \ \mu(x,y)={{9+\sqrt 3} \over 18}$$ Questions: Is my argument rigorous enough? Is my argument for the vanishing of the right hand integral to hand wavy? I'm interested in making my argument more professional. Identifying possible flaws or risks in generalizing this approach would also be appreciated. A better method of evaluating this integral would also be interesting to consider...","['fractal-analysis', 'fractals', 'measure-theory', 'integration']"

I realize that the $\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$ is the best we can do, I just don't really follow the proof. My thought is that the best approximations will be the ratios of increasingly large Fibonacci numbers, and so since those ratios are reduced, you get $b$ increasingly large.

Is $A \cong B$ when $C$ is finite, A and B infinite. (1 answer) Closed 9 years ago . The motivation for this question is in my answer to this post : Compatibility of direct product and quotient in group theory (1) If I take $A$, $B$ and $C$ three groups such that $A\times B$ is isomorphic to $A\times C$ then do we have $B$ is isomorphic to $C$ ? In the post a counter example is given when $A$ is an infinitely generated group. However I cannot get a counter-example when $A$, $B$ and $C$ are assumed to be finite groups. Note that there is no reason a priori if $\phi$ is an isomorphism from $A\times B$ to $A\times C$ that $\phi(A\times\{1_B\})=A\times\{1_C\}$. In the case of finite groups it is true because of the Krull-Schmidt theorem : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krull%E2%80%93Schmidt_theorem . A slightly more general question is the following : (2) If $B$ and $C$ are two finitely generated groups, can I always find a finitely generated group $A$ such that $A\times B$ is isomorphic to $A\times C$? If $A$ is not assumed to verify any property but to be a group we can take : $$A=B^{\mathbb{N}}\times C^{\mathbb{N}} $$ Furthermore replacing :$ \prod_{\mathbb{N}}$ by $\bigoplus_{\mathbb{N}}$ (or more likely the restricted product for groups but I am not sure of a well known notation, it is the subgroup of the product with all but a finite number components being trivial) will give you the same result for countably infinite groups. $\underline{\text{Edit}}$ : To be clear about what I am asking. (1) is kown to be true for finite groups whereas (2) is known to be true when we are considering groups without restriction (even just for countably infinite groups). Let us pretend we are working on the smaller class of groups : the finitely generated groups. Is there any counter example to $(1)$? Is there any counter example to $(2)$? $\underline{\text{Edit 2}}$: Here is a partial answer, from the classification of finitely generated abelian groups $(1)$ is always true if all groups are assumed to be abelian finitely generated groups. Now assume that $A\times B=G=A\times C$. Then you have (derived groups) : $$D(G)=D(A)\times D(B)=D(A)\times D(C) $$ So the abelianizations verify : $$A^{ab}\times B^{ab}=A^{ab}\times C^{ab}$$ Because we are now in the realm of finitely generated abelian groups we get : $$B^{ab}=C^{ab} $$ So $(2)$ cannot be true in general for instance you can take $B:=\mathbb{Z}$ and $C=\mathbb{F}_5$, those two groups have different abelianizations.

It says that A closed differential $k$-form on a contractible space is exact. I wonder if the condition of contractiblity could be weakened. I think the condition of contractilibity is too strong. In case of 1-form, 'simple connectedness' was sufficient. The proof for the case used the fact that a closed 1-form is locally exact, and a 1-form is exact iff the integral of the form on a closed curve is
0. From these facts, we could deduce that integrals of a closed 1-form along homotopic curves are the same, so in a simply connected space any integral of a closed 1-form is 0, and thus the 1-form is exact. I want to generalize this to the case of a $k$-form in appropriate settings. In order to modify the proof for the case $k=1$, I have to check the following questions: Is a closed $k$-form is locally exact? A $k$-form $\omega$ is exact iff $\int_M \omega=0$ for any (orientable) $k$-manifold $M$ without boundary? If they were true, I think it would imply that a closed differential $k$-form in a space which has trivial $k$-th homology group is exact. (Here I use the condition 'trivial $k$-th homology group' because we're dealing with homotopic $k$-manifolds) Are the above questions true? If not, what could be a counterexample and what is the fundamental obstacle that makes it impossible to use the same reasoning in case $k>1$? P.S. I found that the proof of the Poincaré's lemma (in do Carmo's book) was very much similar to the proof of the homotopy axiom of homology groups. I think it is basically because differential forms has a structure of contravariant functor and I heard that it has something to do with de Rham cohomology. Is there a close relation between a space's homology group and its de Rham cohomology? It seems there has to be. For instance Stoke's theorem relates the boundary operator for chain complexes and differential operator for differential forms...","['homology-cohomology', 'differential-geometry', 'algebraic-topology']"

is nonzero for all $t \neq 0$, $1$ if $x$, $y$, $z$ are mutually distinct positive numbers. It can be seen that $2\times 2$ minors are nonzero. Now suppose, on the contrary, that $f(t) = 0$. Then there exist real nonzero $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$ such that
$$
   \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 = 1, \\
   \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y = z, \\
   \lambda_1 x^t + \lambda_2 y^t = z^t.
$$
From the first two equations we find
$$
   \lambda_1 = \frac{y - z}{y-x}, \; \lambda_2 = \frac{z - x}{y-x},
$$
and from the first and last:
$$
   \lambda_1 = \frac{y^t-z^t}{y^t-x^t}, \; \lambda_2 = \frac{z^t-x^t}{y^t-x^t}.

It implies that
$$
   \frac{q^t - 1}{p^t - 1} = \frac{q-1}{p-1},\quad q = \frac{z}{y}, \; p = \frac{x}{y}.

Without loss of generality we can suppose that $p < 1 < q$. It is sufficient to show that the map
$$
   g(t) = \frac{q^t-1}{p^t-1}

is strictly decreasing. It is true in all the examples that I checked in Wolfram Alpha. The straightforward way to show that the map is decreasing is to compute $g'(t)$ and to show that $g'(t) < 0$ for all $t$. But this requires a lot of technical work, the arising expressions are huge. My question is whether it is possible to solve the initial problem using some other considerations or maybe there is an easy (technically) way to show that $g'(t)<0$?","['linear-algebra', 'real-analysis', 'derivatives']"
1257553,A multivariate function with bounded partial derivatives is Lipschitz,"I'm curious if I've done this correctly -- please offer suggestions/corrections if not! I'm new to working in $\Bbb R^n$ so clear insights would be appreciated. The problem: Let $f:\Bbb R^2 \to \Bbb R$ be such that each $D_1f$ and $D_2f$ are defined everywhere and are bounded functions. Prove that $f$ is Lipschitz. My attempt: The definition of Lipschitz that I'm working with is that there exists
some $L > 0$  such that $|f(x) -f(y)| \leq L||x-y||$. Since $D_1f$ and $D_2f$ are bounded, there must exist: $S_1 = \sup \{||D_1f(x)|| : x \in \Bbb R^2\}$ $S_2 = \sup \{||D_2f(x)|| : x \in \Bbb R^2\}$ Now let $a = (a_1,a_2)$ and $b = (b_1,b_2) \in \Bbb R^2$. Then we have:
\begin{align*}
f(a) - f(b) &= f(a_1,a_2) - f(b_1,b_2)
\\
&= f(a_1,a_2) - f(a_1,b_2) + f(a_1,b_2) - f(b_1,b_2)
\end{align*}
Then, by the triangle inequality:
$$|f(a)-f(b)| \leq |f(a_1,a_2) - (a_1,b_2)| + |f(a_1,b_2) - f(b_1,b_2)|$$
And since the partial derivatives exist everywhere in $\Bbb R^2$, we can use the one-dimensional Mean Value Theorem to show that there exists some $c$ such that:
$$\frac{f(a_1,a_2)-f(a_1,b_2)}{a_2-b_2} = D_2f(a_1,c)$$
And noting how we defined $S_2$, it follows that
$$|f(a_1,a_2) - f(a_1,b_2) \leq S_2 |a_2 - b_2|$$
And similarly
$$|f(a_1,b_2) - f(b_1,b_2)| \leq S_1 |a_1-b_1|$$
And using the statement we got from the triangle inequality, we have that
$$|f(a)-f(b)| \leq S_1|a_1-b_1| + S_2|a_2 - b_2|$$
And by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have that
$$S_1|a_1-b_1| + S_2|a_2 - b_2|
\leq 
\sqrt{S_1^2 + S_2^2}\cdot
\sqrt{(a_1-b_1)^2+(a_2-b_2)^2}
=
\sqrt{S_1^2 + S_2^2} \cdot
||a-b||$$
Whereby
$$|f(a)-f(b)| \leq \sqrt{S_1^2 + S_2^2} \cdot ||a-b||$$
So $f$ is Lipschitz with $L = \sqrt{S_1^2 + S_2^2}$.","['proof-verification', 'real-analysis', 'lipschitz-functions', 'analysis', 'multivariable-calculus']"

Intuitively one might say that (1) is fulfilled if ${\bf A} \succeq {\bf B} \succ {\bf 0}$ holds. This intuition will (usually) also be confirmed by numerical tests with random positive semidefinite matrices ${\bf A}, {\bf B}, {\bf Z}$. But inequality (1) is not true in general. Since the matrix square is not operator monotone we have
$$ {\bf A} \succeq {\bf B} \quad \rightarrow \quad {\bf A}^2 \nsucceq {\bf B}^2.
$$
For a counter example, assume that ${\bf A}^2 - {\bf B}^2$ has some negative eigenvalue $\lambda({\bf A}^2 - {\bf B}^2) < 0$ with corresponding eigenvector $\bf u$. If matrix $\bf Z$ is chosen as ${\bf Z} = {\bf u} \bf{u}^H$ then we have $$\text{Tr}\left( \left( {\bf A}^2 - {\bf B}^2 \right) {\bf Z}\right) < 0$$
i.e., inequality (1) is not fulfilled. So I wonder if we can make any statements on the trace inequality if we only know the bounds $\mu_{\text{max}}$ and $\mu_{\text{min}}$ on the eigenvalues of ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$ and the eigenvalues of ${\bf Z}$. My current approach is as follows: Define ${\bf C} = {\bf A}^2 - {\bf B}^2 \nsucceq {\bf 0}$ which is a hermitian matrix with real eigenvalues. Further define the sorted eigenvalues of $\bf C$ and $\bf Z$ as 
$$\lambda_1({\bf C}) \geq \ldots \geq \lambda_M({\bf C}) \quad \text{ and } \quad \lambda_1({\bf Z}) \geq \ldots \geq \lambda_M({\bf Z})\geq 0.\tag{2}$$ Then we can bound the trace in (1) as follows
$$
\sum_{m=1}^M \lambda_m ({\bf C}) \; \lambda_{M-m+1} ({\bf Z}) \leq 
\text{Tr} ( {\bf C} {\bf Z} ) \leq
\sum_{m=1}^M \lambda_m ({\bf C}) \; \lambda_{m} ({\bf Z}) \tag{3}
$$
(see ""A Trace Inequality for Matrix Product"" by Lasserre). Also, since
$$ \text{Tr} \left( {\bf A}^2 - {\bf B}^2 \right) =
\text{Tr} \left( \left( {\bf A} + {\bf B} \right) \left( {\bf A} - {\bf B} \right) \right) \geq 0 \tag{4}
$$ 
we know that the sum of eigenvalues is nonnegative. Further, by Weyl's theorem we can bound the eigenvalues of $\bf{C}$ as
$$ 
\mu_{\text{min}}^2 - \mu_{\text{max}}^2 
\leq \lambda_M^2( {\bf A} ) - \lambda_1^2({\bf B}) 
\leq \lambda_M( {\bf A}^2 - {\bf B}^2 ) 
\leq \; ... \quad\quad\quad \\ \quad\quad\quad ... \;
\leq \lambda_1( {\bf A}^2 - {\bf B}^2 ) 
\leq \lambda_1^2( {\bf A} ) - \lambda_M^2({\bf B})  
\leq \mu_{\text{max}}^2 - \mu_{\text{min}}^2  \tag{5} $$
where the lower (more interesting) bound is quite loose. From equations (2)-(5) we can form a set of linear inequalities. For better illustration assume that $M=4$. Then we have
$$
\left[
\begin{matrix}
-\lambda_4({\bf Z}) & -\lambda_3({\bf Z}) & -\lambda_2({\bf Z}) & -\lambda_1({\bf Z}) \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{matrix}
\right]
\left[ 
\begin{matrix}
\lambda_1({\bf C}) \\ \lambda_2({\bf C}) \\ \lambda_3({\bf C}) \\ \lambda_4({\bf C}) 
\end{matrix}
\right]
\geq
\left[

0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \mu_{\text{min}}^2 - \mu_{\text{max}}^2  \\ \mu_{\text{min}}^2 - \mu_{\text{max}}^2
\end{matrix}
\right] \tag{6}
$$
where the 1st ineqaulity stems from (3), the 2nd stems from (4), 3rd to 5th stem from (2) and 6th and 7th stem from (5). If the ineqaulities in (6) describe an empty set for eigenvalues $\lambda_m({\bf C})$, then inequality (1) must be true. Farka's lemma can be used to see if (6) is infeasible. I get good results if I have a good lower bound for (5), but the lower bound by Weyl's theorem is too loose. Are there any better lower bounds than Weyl's theorem?","['inequality', 'trace', 'matrices']"
1257832,Classify groups of order 171,"This is a problem from Stanford Algebra Qualifying Exam, Fall 1998.
I know the standard way is to use Sylow theorems and semidirect product. $171 = 9\cdot 19$.
By Sylow theorems, $n_3|19$ and $n_3\equiv 1\text{ mod }3$, hence $n_3 = 1\text{ or }19$.
$n_{19}|9$ and $n_{19}\equiv 1\text{ mod }19$, hence $n_{19} = 1$.
Denote one Sylow $3$-subgroup by $K$ and one Sylow $19$-subgroup by $N$.
$N$ is normal because $n_{19} = 1$.
$NK = G, N\cap K = \{e\}$ and $N$ is normal.
Hence, $G$ is the semiproduct of $G = N\rtimes K$. Case 1: $G$ is abelian. Since a finite abelian group is isomorphic to direct product of cyclic groups of prime power orders, $G\cong C_9\times C_{19}$ or $C\cong C_3\times C_3\times C_{19}$. Case 2: $G$ is not abelian. The structure of $G$ is determined by $N, K$ and homomorphism $\varphi: K\to\text{Aut}(N)$, which stands for conjugation.
What's more, $N, K, \varphi$ and $N, K,\varphi'$ define two isomorphic groups if there exists automorphism $\alpha:K\to K$ such that $\varphi' = \varphi\circ\alpha$.
Since $N\cong C_{19}$, $\text{Aut}(N)\cong C_{18}$.
Since $G$ is not abelian, the image $\varphi(K)$ is not the trivial group. 
Denote the generating element in $\text{Aut}(N)\cong C_{18}$ by $z$.
When $K\cong C_9$, there are two possiblities for $\varphi(K)$: $\varphi(K) = \{1, z^6, z^{12}\}$ or $\varphi(K) = \{1, z^2, z^4,\ldots,z^{16}\}$.
When $C\cong C_3\times C_3$, $\varphi(K)$ can only be $\{1,z^6,z^{12}\}$.
What's more, given $\varphi,\varphi':K\to C_{18}$ with $\varphi(K) = \varphi'(K)$, there exists automorphism $\alpha:K\to K$ such that $\varphi' = \varphi\circ\alpha$.
Therefore, when $G$ is nonabelain, it has two isomorphism classes when $K\cong C_9$ and one isomorphism class when $K\cong C_3\times C_3$. I think I've solved this problem. Thanks for your help.

1257835,Solution Invariant Explanation Trick,"Suppose not all 4 integers, $a,b,c,d$ are equal. Start with $(a,b,c,d)$ and repeatedly replace $(a,b,c,d)$ by $(a−b,b−c,c−d,d−a)$. Then show that at least one number of the quadruple will become arbitrarily large. Solution: We have
  $$(a_{n+1},b_{n+1},c_{n+1},d_{n+1}) = (a_n-b_n,b_n-c_n,c_n-d_n,d_n-a_n)$$
  As you have rightly observed, the invariant is $a_n+b_n+c_n+d_n = 0$ for all $n \geq 1$, where $a_0 = a$, $b_0=b$, $c_0 = c$ and $d_0 = d$. Let us now look at $a_{n+1}^2+b_{n+1}^2 + c_{n+1}^2 + d_{n+1}^2$. We have
  \begin{align}
a_{n+1}^2+b_{n+1}^2 + c_{n+1}^2 + d_{n+1}^2 & = (a_n-b_n)^2+(b_n-c_n)^2+(c_n-d_n)^2 + (d_n-a_n)^2\\
& = 2(a_n^2+b_n^2+c_n^2+d_n^2) - 2(a_nb_n+b_nc_n+c_nd_n+d_na_n) & (\spadesuit)
\end{align}
  We shall now show that $ - 2(a_nb_n+b_nc_n+c_nd_n+d_na_n)$ is non-negative for $n \geq 1$. Since $a_n+b_n+c_n+d_n=0$, we have
  \begin{align}
0 & = (a_n+b_n+c_n+d_n)^2 = (a_n+c_n)^2 + (b_n+c_n)^2 + 2(a_n+c_n)(b_n+d_n)\\
& = (a_n+c_n)^2 + (b_n+c_n)^2 + 2a_nb_n + 2b_nc_n + 2c_nd_n + 2d_na_n
\end{align}
  This gives us
  $$-2(a_nb_n+b_nc_n+c_nd_n+d_na_n) = (a_n+c_n)^2 + (b_n+c_n)^2 \geq 0 \,\,\, (\clubsuit)$$
  Making use of $(\clubsuit)$ in $(\spadesuit)$, we obtain that
  $$a_{n+1}^2+b_{n+1}^2 + c_{n+1}^2 + d_{n+1}^2 \geq 2(a_n^2+b_n^2+c_n^2+d_n^2)$$
  This gives us
  $$a_{n+1}^2+b_{n+1}^2 + c_{n+1}^2 + d_{n+1}^2 \geq 2^n(a_1^2+b_1^2+c_1^2+d_1^2)$$
  Since $a, b,c,d$ are distinct, one of the terms $a_1,b_1,c_1$ or $d_1$ is non-zero. Hence, $a_{n+1}^2+b_{n+1}^2 + c_{n+1}^2 + d_{n+1}^2$ grows unbounded, which means the largest of the terms must keep growing unbounded. I understand everything until the end. I got: $$a_{n+1}^2 + b_{n+1}^2 + c_{n+1}^2 + d_{n+1}^2 \ge 2(a_n^2 + b_n^2 + c_n^2 + d_n^2)$$ How do you get to: $$a_{n+1}^2+b_{n+1}^2 + c_{n+1}^2 + d_{n+1}^2 \geq 2^n(a_1^2+b_1^2+c_1^2+d_1^2)$$","['contest-math', 'elementary-number-theory', 'algebra-precalculus']"
