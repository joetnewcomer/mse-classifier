1919718,Proving that a set is countable,"My attempt is as follows: We will start by considering each ‘walk’ as some set of steps. 
So a walk of length $m$ can be represented by the set $S_m =$ {$x_1, x_2, x_3, … , x_m$}. 
To each of these steps we assign at random a value of $0$ or $1$. The number of possible walks of a certain length, say $n$, is the same as the number of functions from $S_n$ to {$0, 1$}, which is $2^n$. 
Now, the question tells us that the number of steps in a certain walk can get ‘very large’ so, assuming we begin the walk at the entrance to the pub, it would be silly to have walks consisting only of a ‘very large’ number of backward steps. It may, therefore, be better to write the number of possible walks of length $n$ as being $\leqslant 2^n$
The set of all possible random walks is then the disjoint union 
$S = \bigcup_{r = 1}^{L} S_r$, where $L$ is possibly a very large number, the cardinality of which is $\leqslant 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... +2^L$ So the cardinality is bounded above by a finite quantity, so there is a bijection $f : \mathbb{N}_{i} \mapsto S$ for some $1 \leqslant i \leqslant 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... +2^L$ hence the set is countable. The context is a little peculiar, so I'm not entirely convinced that my interpretation of the question is correct, so if anyone could give me some feedback on this that'd be great.","['functions', 'proof-verification']"
1919767,"integrate $\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \, dx$","I am solving an ODE $$y^2 \, dx + \left(x\sqrt{y^2 - x^2} - xy\right)dy=0$$ I let $y=xu$ and did some algebra, and I ended up with this $$\ln(x)+C=\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{u^2 - 1}} \, du - \int \frac{1}{u} \, du$$ I don't know how to solve the first right hand side integral. I tried to let $u^2 - 1 = t$, so it becomes $$\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{u^2 - 1}}=\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\frac{1}{2u} \, dt = \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{t-1}} \, dt,$$ which doesn't seem to work.

1919776,Is a Rotation Matrix Still a Rotation Matrix under a Non-Standard Basis?,"Let us work in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Consider the following rotation matrix: $$

But would it still represent a rotation if we changed the basis to something non-standard (in both the domain and the codomain), say $\beta_1 = \{1, 1), (1, -1) \}$? That is, would we have that $$

1919788,Cycles in a 2-connected graph,"I have been working on some problems within introductory graph theory, and I ran
into one problem that I am having difficulty trying to prove. I want to
prove that a $2$-connected graph contains a cycle. Note that a $k$-connected
graph is a graph that contains at least $k+1$ vertices, but does not contain a
set of $k-1$ vertices whose removal disconnects the graph. Hence, let us consider a graph $G$ such that $|V(G)| \geq 3$ such that there
is no cut set of size $1$. I imagine what I am looking to force onto this
graph is a cycle of size $3$, and thus I should probably condition on all
vertex subsets of size $3$ in the graph $G$. I tried finding a contradiction
after I assume that none of these subsets  contained an odd cycle, but I
haven't been able to contradict $2$-connectedness with this statement.
Is it possible that I should condition on a single
vertex, and find a way to construct a cycle using the fact that this
vertex does not have the ability to disconnect the graph after its removal?","['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1919804,Showing that $X \times \mathbb{A}^1$ is regular in codimension one.,"I am reading the proof of Proposition 6.6 in Hartshorne which states that $\operatorname{Cl} X \cong \operatorname{Cl} (X \times \mathbb{A}^1)$. Let $X$ be a noetherian, integral, separated scheme which is regular in codimension one. We want to show $X \times \mathbb{A}^1$ is regular in codimension one. Hartshorne starts out be describing points in $X \times \mathbb{A}^1$ which are of codimension one. I am already confused at this point. First of all, we talk about codimension for closed, irreducible subsets of $X$ but I am not sure how we know that a point in $X \times \mathbb{A}^1$ is necessarily closed and irreducible. More importantly, how does knowing what the points of codimension one are help us show that the stalks of dimension one are regular? I don't understand the motivation here at all. I notice the next claim in the proof was asked about but never answered: $X \times \mathbf{A}^1$ is regular in codimension 1 (I am also very lost as to what Hartshorne is trying to say in that claim however I didn't add it to this question as it has already been asked but was never answered).",['algebraic-geometry']
1919837,Expected Value Problem with a Polar Bear Using a Typewriter,"A polar bear starts to write an $80$ character word on a typewriter, where each
letter is equally likely to occur (no other symbols or spaces can occur,
just letters). I want to find out the expected number of times the phrase
""PANDA"" occurs in the sentence. I can see that ""PANDA"" can occur a maximum of  $\frac{80}{5} = 16$ times within
the word. I can see generally a sketch of how to get the first term, since
I originally thought that
I can place ""PANDA"" in $76$ spaces, then place the rest of the possible
letters $(26)^{75}$ ways. When we compare to the number of $80$-character
letter strings available, on initial guess, one would think that the first term
would be
$$\frac{76 (26)^{75}}{(26)^{80}},$$ but obviously this also counts the instances where ""PANDA"" also shows up
in the other $75$ characters in the string. Is there a reasonable way to
remove those observations from this term? I would like to know this so
I can also account for their removal in later terms. Otherwise, is there
a more reasonable way to compute this expected value?","['combinatorics', 'probability']"

1919875,"What's the name of ""truth set of stronger condition is subset of truth set of weaker condition""?","This principle almost certainly has a name, it has occurred to me that it can be very useful in many areas of math, and perhaps even in life in general, so I want to know its name to remember it better: Given two statements/conditions $A, B$ such that $A \impliedby B$ . In other words, $B$ is a stronger condition than $A$ , and and $A$ is weaker (thus more general) than $B$ . Then it follows that $$\{ x\in X: A(x) \text{ is true}   \} \supset \{x \in X: B(x) \text{ is true}  \} $$ This is an attempt to generalize the accepted answer to a previous question of mine Is the notion of ""affineness"" more general than ""linearity"", or vice versa? . This idea is why there are ""more"" affine subspaces than linear subspaces, and also why $X \subset Y \implies X^{\perp} \supset Y^{\perp}$ . Another example is how there being more open sets in finer topologies implies that there are fewer compact sets. I like this idea in particular because it demonstrates quite nicely how there is often a duality between the partial order of subsets under inclusion and the partial order of statements under implication. I've used this sort of partial order duality (along with the partial order of the real valued functions) many times in probability theory (e.g. $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) \le \mathbb{P}(A) \le \mathbb{P}(A \cup B)$ ), so I am not sure why it has never occurred to me before to wonder what its name is.

1919968,Negating an existential quantifier over a logical conjunction?,"I was wondering how one would negate an existential quantifier over a logical conjunction. As an example, suppose that I have the statement: ""There exists a car that is white and doesn't use diesel"". I am recognizing this as saying: $\exists x \in C: \ (P(x) \land Q(x))$, where $C$ is the set of all cars, and $P$ is the statement that ""a car is white"" while $Q$ is the statement ""doesn't use diesel"". My question is if the statement can be represented using these quantifiers, and if so, what the negation would be. Would the negation be: $$
\neg \exists x \in C: \ (P(x) \land Q(x)) \implies \forall x \in C \ : \ \neg P(x) \lor \neg Q(x)

1919980,Determine if $y = x^2$ is injective,"I realize that $y=x^2$ is not injective. It is not one-to-one ($1$ and $-1$ both map to 1, for example). However, in class it was stated that a function is injective if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies $x = y$. Or if $x$ doesn't equal $y$, then this implies that $f(x)$ doesn't equal $f(y)$. This is where I'm confused. (Or maybe tired.) For $x = 2$, $y = 4$. So, $f(x) = 4$, but $f(y) = 2$ ($\sqrt{y} = x$). Therefore, $x$ and $y$ are not equal, so it's not injective. However, according to the contrapositive, $x$ doesn't equal $y$ implies that $f(x)$ doesn't equal $f(y)$. This fits. Do both the contrapositive and the contrapositive of the contrapositive have to be true for it to be injective? Or am I doing something stupid?",['functions']

1920390,Banach space that is not a Banach lattice,"There is a well-known criterium that distinguishes Banach spaces into the following two classes: those Banach spaces that can be made into a Hilbert space $(X, \langle .,. \rangle)$ and those that cannot. A norm $\lVert . \rVert$ is induced by an inner product $\langle ., . \rangle$ iff $\lVert \cdot \rVert$ satisfies the parallelogram identity $\lVert x + y \rVert^2 + \lVert x - y \rVert^2 = 2(\lVert x \rVert^2 + \lVert y \rVert^2)$ in which case one can set $\langle x, y \rangle := \frac{1}{4}(\lVert x + y\rVert^2 - \lVert x - y \rVert^2)$. Is there also a criterium that similarly distinguishes Banach spaces from Banach lattices? Let us split this question into two questions: Given a Banach space $(X, \lVert . \rVert)$, is there a partial order $\leq$ on $X$ such that $(X, \leq, \lVert . \rVert)$ is a Banach lattice meaning that (i) $(X, \leq)$ is a Riesz space and (ii) $\lVert . \rVert$ is a Riesz norm? If question 1 has a negative answer, under what additional (possibly sufficient and necessary) conditions on the Banach space $(X, \lVert . \rVert$) does question 1 has a positive answer? Note that we start here with a Banach space structure and search for a compatible lattice structure. In contrast, if we start with a Riesz space structure $(X, \leq)$, then it is known (Fremlin, Measure Theory, 355Xb) that there is at most one norm $\lVert . \rVert$ (up to equivalence) that turns $(X, \leq, \lVert . \rVert)$ into a Banach lattice. Added: Maybe this is also helpful to make an abstract Riesz space more concrete: any Riesz space $(X, \leq)$ can be represented as a subspace of a quotient of some $\mathbb{R}^X$ (Fremlin, Measure Theory, 352L). In more detail, there exists a set $Y$, a solid linear subspace $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^Y$ and an injective Riesz homomorphism $\varphi : X \to \mathbb{R}^Y / V$.","['functional-analysis', 'banach-lattices', 'banach-spaces']"

There are several variations of this questions which are pretty much equivalent : one can drop the $L^1$ hypothesis and just assume mesurability of $f$, one could also assume that $f$ is the indicator function of a measurable subset of $[0;1]$. What i already know : The first thing to say is that $f_\tau$ converges to $f$ in $L^1$ norm when $\tau$ goes to zero. One way to prove that is to say that this is true for compactly suported continuous functions (because of absolute continuity) and conclude by density. Since the $f_{t_n}$ are converging in $L^1$ norm there exists a subsequence $t_{\sigma(n)}$ such that $f_{t_{\sigma(n)}}$ converges almost everywhere to $f$. However one cannot directly use this result to conclude with the convergence a.e. of $f_{t_n}$, indeed there are many examples of sequences of functions that are converging in $L^1$ norm but not convergent a.e. In fact this show that the a.e. convergence does not corespond to any topological convergence, since the caracterisation of convergence with sub-sub-sequences doesn't apply here. Another thing to note is that if $f$ is continuous at $x$ then $f_{t_n}(x)\to f(x)$ automatically, so if we search some $f$ such that $f_{t_n}$ does not converges a.e. to $f$ it has to be a function discontinuous on a set with positive measure. In fact for every function $g=0$ a.e. one must have that $f+g$ is discontinuous on a set with positive measure. I believe the answer to my question is yes, but it's mostly an intuition, i don't even have euristic arguments for that. So i tried to find an example, the two kind of $f$ i have thought of are : $f=\chi_{C}$ where $C$ is a fat cantor set or something like this kind of set and $$f(x)=\chi_{[0;1]}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{2^{-k}}{|x-q_k|^{\alpha}}$$ where $q_n$ is an enumeration of the rationals of $[0;1]$.

It is an even function, so $$\int_{-1}^{1} e^\frac{1}{x^2-1}\cos{ax}\,dx = 2 \int_{0}^{1} e^{\frac{1}{x^2-1}}\cos{ax}\,dx.$$ I have also managed to express it as something like looks like a Fourier transform, but I got stuck at the end: $$\int_{-1}^{1} e^\frac{1}{x^2-1}\cos{ax}\,dx.$$ Following Euler's Formula, $e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$, $$\cos\theta = e^{i\theta} - i\sin\theta$$ $$\int_{-1}^{1} e^\frac{1}{x^2-1}\cos{ax}\,dx$$ $$=\int_{-1}^{1} e^\frac{1}{x^2-1}\left(e^{iax} - i\sin{ax}\right)\,dx$$ $$=\int_{-1}^{1} e^\frac{1}{x^2-1} e^{iax}\,dx - i\int_{-1}^{1} e^{\frac{1}{x^2-1}} \sin{ax}\,dx.$$ Since the $\sin{ax}$ part of the equation is odd, it goes to zero (it also goes to zero since it's imaginary, and our original function is real): $$=\int_{-1}^{1} e^\frac{1}{x^2-1} e^{iax}\,dx.$$ By substituting $x\rightarrow t$ and $a\rightarrow \omega$, we get something that is essentially a Fourier transform, $$=\int_{-1}^{1} e^\frac{1}{t^2-1} e^{i\omega t}\,dt,$$ or $$=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)\, e^{i\omega t}\,dt,$$ where $$f(t) = 
\begin{cases} 
e^\frac{1}{t^2-1} & -1 < t < 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}.$$ While I can't seem to solve the example of $\mathcal{F}[f(t)]$, it occurs to me that I may be able to solve the example of $\mathcal{F}[\ln{f(t)}]$: $$\mathcal{F}[\ln{f(t)}] = \mathcal{F}\left[\frac{1}{t^2-1}\right],$$ which Wolfram Alpha gives as, $$=-\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\operatorname{sgn}\omega\sin\omega.$$ However, that doesn't seem to help. I can get this far: $$\frac{d}{dt}\ln f(t) = \frac{f'(t)}{f(t)},$$ and $$\mathcal{F}\left[\frac{d}{dt}f(t)\right] = i\omega\mathcal{F}[f(t)],$$ therefore $$\mathcal{F}\left[\frac{d}{dt}\ln f(t)\right] = i\omega\mathcal{F}[\ln f(t)] = \mathcal{F}\left[\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)}\right],$$ however, I don't think that gets me any closer to solving for $\mathcal{F}[f(t)].$ I also looked at this short discussion about determining $\mathcal{F}\left[e^{f(t)}\right]$ in terms of $\mathcal{F}[f(t)]$, but I didn't really get anywhere.

1920627,"Alternative definition of a submartingale, problem with the Radon-Nikodym theorem.","Assume you have a stochastic base $(\Omega, \mathcal{F},P,\mathbb{F})$. A submartingale is usually defined as an adapted process for each $t$ $E(|X_t|)<\infty$ and $E(X_t|\mathcal{F}_s)\ge X_s$ a.s. However, in a book I am reading I have come over another definition, which is almost the same, but it does not require integrability, but reguires that $E(X_t^+)< \infty$. (The author also adds càdlàg paths as a requirement, I am not sure if that is relevant for my question.) This creates a problem for me. Because I am not sure then how to construct the conditional expectation $E(X_t|\mathcal{F}_s)$ using the Radon-Nikodym theorem. The most natural step is constructing $E(X_t^+|\mathcal{F}_s)$ and $E(X_t^-|\mathcal{F}_s)$ and defining $E(X_t|\mathcal{F}_s)=E(X_t^+|\mathcal{F}_s)-E(X_t^-|\mathcal{F}_s)$. Because of the integrability, there is no problem using Radon-Nikodym to define $E(X_t^+|\mathcal{F}_s)$, the problem is defining $E(X_t^-|\mathcal{F}_s)$. The first step is defining a measure on $(\Omega,\mathcal{F_s},Q)$ such that $Q(A) = E(X^-_t\mathcal{X}_A), A \in \mathcal{F}_s$. In order to use the Radon-Nikodym theorem we need $\sigma$-finiteness. But I can not see that we have that in this case? We could define $E_n = \{X^-_t<n\}$, since $X_t^-$ are $\mathcal{F}_t$ measurable, these sets are in $\mathcal{F}_t$, so we do have that $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}_t,Q)$ is $\sigma$-finite. But the sets may not be $\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable, so how do we get $\sigma$-finiteness on the space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F}_s,Q)$? Update: I get the same problem in this book: Continuous Martingales and Brownian motion . However I can't find how they construct the conditional expectation in this book either. There must be a simple answer for this since it is used in many books.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'martingales', 'measure-theory', 'conditional-expectation']"

One might conjecture that these are the only $q$'s that work, but actually whenever $p\in(1,\infty)$ we also get $\ell_2$ complemented.  Here's how. Theorem 1. $(\oplus_n\ell_p^n)_\infty$ is isomorphic to $\ell_\infty(\ell_p)$. This is just from Remark 3.4 in Cembranos/Mendoza.  Let us give some more info from that paper. Corollary 1. The space $\ell_q$, $q\in[1,\infty]$, is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of $(\oplus_n\ell_1^n)_\infty$ if and only if $q=1$ or $q=\infty$. (See Prop. 6.1.)  On the other hand, Cembranos/Mendoza showed in Proposition 3.5 that $\ell_2$ is complemented in $\ell_\infty(\ell_p)$ whenever $1<p<\infty$.  Hence: Corollary 2. The space $\ell_2$ is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of $(\oplus_n\ell_p^n)_\infty$ if and only if $1<p<\infty$. Using Theorem 1 above to replace ""$\ell_\infty(\ell_p)$"" with ""$(\oplus_n\ell_p^n)_\infty$"" in Proposition 4.3 of Cembranos/Mendoza, we also have the following. Corollary 3. If the space $\ell_q$, $q\in(1,\infty)$, is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of $(\oplus_n\ell_p^n)_\infty$, $p\in(1,\infty)$, then either $1<p\leq q\leq 2$ or $2\leq q\leq p<\infty$.","['functional-analysis', 'lp-spaces', 'banach-spaces']"

1921071,Points of differentiability of $f(x) = \sum\limits_{n : q_n < x} c_n$,"Let, $\{q_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be an enumeration of rational numbers. Consider the function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ given by, $$\displaystyle f(x) = \sum\limits_{n : q_n < x} c_n$$ where, $\displaystyle \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n$ is an absolutely convergent positive series. The function is clearly monotone increasing, discontinuous at rationals (with jump exactly $c_n$ at $x = q_n$) and continuous at irrationals. $1.$ I wish to ask about the points of differentiability of $f$? Since $f$ is monotone it should be differentiable a.e. but how do we identify these points of differentiability? (as in a way of representing this set in a compact way) Intuitively, it seems they should be related to the particular enumeration of the rationals $\{q_n\}$ at hand. For example if we have an enumeration such that for $\alpha \in \mathbb{R \setminus Q}$, we have $q_n \notin (\alpha - \delta_N , \alpha + \delta_N)$ for $1 \le n \le N$ (i.e., say $|q_n - \alpha| > \delta_n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ where, $\delta_n \downarrow 0^{+}$ as $n \to \infty$) and now if we impose further the 'nice' property: $\displaystyle \frac{f(\alpha + \delta_N) - f(\alpha)}{\delta_N} = \frac{1}{\delta_N}\sum\limits_{n : q_n \in (\alpha, \alpha + \delta_N)} c_n \to \lambda$, (as $N \to \infty$) and similarly one for the left derivative, we have $f'(\alpha) = \lambda$. So, intuitively I can see how to choose an enumeration that makes the derivative equal $\lambda$ at $x = \alpha$ (or blows up at $\alpha$, i.e., $\lambda = + \infty$). To clarify what I am asking: Given an enumeration of rationals, how do we come up with relevant definitions/concepts relating to said enumeration, which helps us identify which $\alpha$'s we should expect to be a point of differentiablity. $2.$ Is there a way to estimate the derivative at these points? Has these questions been addressed/answered in literature before? I'd love it if I could get some reference in this matter. Thanks! :-)","['real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'analysis']"

I am very weak in topology so please bear with me. The authors define a manifold by saying that it is locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ everywhere (as well as being Hausdorff and second countable). That is, for every $x \in M^n$ there exists an open set $U \subset M^n$ and a homeomorphism $h:U \to U' \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. Now they say that this condition does not imply Hausdorff and then proceed to give a counter example. Take the set $\mathbb{R} \cup \{ p \}$, where $p$ is an isolated point. Let us ""define our topology"" by letting $\mathbb{R}$ be open and that neighborhoods of $p$ are the sets $\{ U -\{0\} \} \cup \{ p \}$ where $U$ is a neighborhood of $\mathbb{R}$ at $0$. ${\bf Question \ 1}$: What is the dimension of this ""set"" (I suppose it is not a manifold as it is apparently not Hausdorff)? If it is locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ then I would think $n=2$ due to the presence of the point $\{ p \}$. But it's weird to me because I think of homeomorphisms as deformations, and this set doesn't nicely deform into $\mathbb{R}^2$. ${\bf Question \ 2}$: What is the topology of this set?

1921205,"Showing that a quotient space of $X$ is homeomorphic to a quotient space of its subspace, which meets all equivalence classes.","While reading Topology: An Introduction to the Point-Set and Algebraic Areas (1995) of Donald.W.Kahn, I found a sentence I cannot understand. It may be good to quote the whole paragraph for the context. (p.119~120) I contend that in forming a quotient space $D_1/\sim$, it suffices to consider a subspace $D_0\subseteq D_1$ which contains at least one point in each equivalence class. For we may define a map $$h:D_0/\sim \ \to \ D_1/\sim$$ by sending each class in $D_0$ into the class to which it belongs in the bigger $D_1$. Since $D_0$ contains at least one element in every class, $h$ is immediately onto. $h$ is 1-1 because if two points are equivalent in $D_1$, and they both lie in $D_0$, then they are equivalent in $D_0$; in fact, it is the very same equivalence relation. This map is clearly continuous, so that it must be a homeomorphism (see Problem 11 after Theorem 4.2) when $D_1$ is compact. Without too much difficulty I could understand that $h$ is bijective and continuous. What I don't understand is the last sentence, which claims that $h$ must be a homeomorphism if $D_1$ is compact. The problem to which the writer refers states that if $X$ is a compact space and $Y$ is a Hausdorff space, then  any continuous $f$ from $X$ onto $Y$ is a closed map. To apply this result to show that $h$ is a closed map, we should show that $D_0/\sim$ is compact and $D_1/\sim$ is Hausdorff. But I didn't succeed with showing either of this, when the only given condition is $D_1$ being compact. Am I missing an obvious way to show these, or misunderstanding the purpose of the writer?

Question: Suppose there exist linearly independent vector fields $X$ and $Y$ on $M$ such that $\nabla_XY = \nabla_YX = 0$ , i.e. each is parallel along the other.

1921298,Understanding power series and their representation of functions,"Below is my current level of understanding about Power Series (my understanding could be completely wrong, in which case please correct me), and I want to know if it is correct. I feel that Power Series is something that it treated very poorly in most (introductory) textbooks. It seems as though authors keep on dodging the central ideas of Power Series, and their relation to functions, for seemingly unknown reasons. My Understanding of Power Series Let's say we have a power series, call it $p(x)$ (as power 
series are functions themselves) and it converges to a finite set of values, $S$ over an interval of convergence $R$ then it can be used to represent $f(x)$ within that interval of convergence $R$ $$\underbrace{f(x)}_\text{Some analytic function} = \underbrace{p(x)}_\text{A power series representation} \ \ \underbrace{\forall\  |x| < R}_\text{within the power series' radius of convergence}$$ An analytic function is equal to its power series representation within the power series' radius of convergence An Example: The Geometric Series Take the famous geometric series (note the LHS is $f(x)$ and the RHS is $p(x))$ $$\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \ ...$$ it has a radius of convergence of $|x| <1$, now what this means is that only for $x \in (-1, 1)$, can it actually be used as a representation of $f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}$. Outside of this interval ( of convergence ), equality is broken and we can't really use it anymore as a representation of $f$, therefore if we let $f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}$ and $p(x) = 1+ x + x^2 + x^3 + \ ...$, the the following two statements are true: $$f(x) = p(x) \ \ \ \forall \ |x| <1$$
$$f(x) \neq p(x) \ \ \ \forall\ |x| >1$$ This is the reason why we talk about convergence of Power Series, and why we need Power Series to converge because if it didn’t converge, our power series representation $p(x)$, would never equal $f(x)$ and we could never use it as a way to evaluate $f(x)$. Another example: $e^x$ In the case of $e^x$, the Power Series representation of it can actually be used as one of the definitions of it, because the Power Series representation of $e^x$ is valid for all $x \in \mathbb{C}$ $$e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!}  \ ... \ \ \forall x \in \mathbb{C}$$ Why are Power Series important? Take the example of $e^x$ I've given above. So if we have a power series representation , $p(x)$ of some function $f$, then we can use $p(x)$ to define $f(x)$ for all $x$ inside the radius of convergence of the power series! Power Series/Taylor Series and Polynomial Approximations (The Big Picture) A polynomial approximation (a Power Series with finite terms) of any analytic function approaches the actual function as the number of terms in the polynomial approximation (the Power Series with finite terms, or the partial sums of a Power Series) tends to infinity, at which point it is equivalent to the analytic function. This is the reason why transcendental functions, like $e^x$, $\sin(x)$ etc. are transcendental, because they need a power series to represent/define them. They can't be defined by a finite sequence of terms. Thus the only way to define transcendental functions is via Power Series. Furthermore Power Series, provide us with a deep way to express non-polynomial functions, such as trigonometric functions, as polynomial functions (via a Power Series). It's one of the neat shortcuts that an infinite amount of terms provides us with, the ability to represent non-polynomial functions as polynomial functions. Questions: Is my understanding correct? Is there anything that you can add to what I've written above that would make Power Series clearer to those learning about them? Furthermore are their higher levels of understandings of Power Series from Complex Analysis, Real Analysis, etc?","['real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'complex-analysis', 'power-series']"

Diamond (Dover edition); my first question has been answered . Let $R=\mathcal O_K$ be the ring of integers of an algebraic field $K=\mathbb Q(\theta)$ for some $\theta$ algebraic over $\mathbb Q$. If $I\ne\{0\}$ is an ideal of $R$ and $\beta\in K$ is such that $\beta\alpha\in I$ for all $\alpha\in I$, prove that $\beta\in R$. It is important that $K$ and $R$ be so defined, otherwise the result won't be true, as the counterexamples in my first question show. By studying the counterexamples, I presume that what may be important here are principally generated ideals. The ideal $I$ need not be principal but (by Theorem 8.13 on p.109 of the book) there exists an ideal $J\ne\{0\}$ such that the product $IJ$ is principally generated by a rational integer, i.e. $IJ=(c)$ where $c\in\mathbb Z$. I suspect this may be useful in solving the problem. Another notion which may be useful is, given an ideal $I$, the set defined as $I^{-1}=\{\gamma\in K:\gamma\alpha\in R\ \text{for all}\ \alpha\in I\}$. Thus $\beta\in I^{-1}$ in the problem. If $J$ is an ideal, $JI^{-1}$ is defined as the set of all finite sums of products of elements of $J$ and of $I^{-1}$; if $J\subseteq I$ then $JI^{-1}$ is an ideal.

1921359,Different way to solve Hartshorne Question 1.4.7,"Firstly I am aware that this has been answered before, but the answers there used different methods to answer this question. I would like to understand the specific solution given here. http://math.uchicago.edu/~drewmoore/researchnotes/Hartshorne1_4.pdf (at the top of page three) Here is the question, vertabim, from Hartshorne. Let $X$ and $Y$ be two varieties. Suppose there are points $P\in X$ and $Q\in Y$ such that the local rings $\mathcal{O}_{P,X}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{Q,Y}$ are isomorphic as $k$-algebras. Then show that there are open sets $P\in U\subset X$ and $Q\in V\subset Y$ and an isomorphism of $U$ to $V$ which sends $P$ to $Q$. I am completely cool with assuming $X$ and $Y$ are affine and translation. That is all good. I also understand that $\mathcal{O}_{P,X}\cong \mathcal{O}_{Q,Y}$ implies that $A(X)_{m_{0}}\cong A(Y)_{m_0'}$. Note here, unlike the document I am letting $m_{0}=\{f\in A(X)|f(0)\neq 0\}$ and $m_{0}'=\{g\in A(Y)|g(0)\neq 0\}$ in order to avoid confusion. Now this is where I begin to get confused This induces an ismorphism of $K(X)$ with $K(Y)$. I don't see how this comes about, I have checked Hartshorne extensively, especially theorems 3.2, 4.4 and corollary 4.5. Maybe one of these theorems does imply this, but I am not seeing this. Anyway, assuming the above is true then I have that from corollary 4.5 in Hartshorne that $X$ and $Y$ are birationally equivalent. And thus there will exist open $U\in X$ and $V\in Y$ such that $U$ is isomorphic to $V$. However at this stage we don't know if $P$ is in $U$ or if $Q$ is in $V$.

1921384,Prove $\int_0^{\pi/2}x^2\sqrt{\cot x} \ dx=\frac{\sqrt2}{8}\left( \frac{5\pi^{3}}{12}-\pi^2\ln2-\pi \ln^22 \right)$,"I came across the follwing integral: $$\int_0^{\pi/2}x^2\sqrt{\cot x} \ dx=\frac{\sqrt2}{8}\left( \frac{5\pi^{3}}{12}-\pi^2\ln2-\pi \ln^22 \right)$$ I try to do it like the following: Consider $$I(a,b)=\int_0^{\pi} \frac{\cos ax}{\sin^b x}\ dx=2\int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\cos 2ax}{\sin^b 2x}\ dx$$ Then $$I''(a,b)=-8\int_0^{\pi/2}x^2 \frac{\cos 2ax}{\sin^b 2x}\ dx$$ Let $a=1/2,b=1/2$ $$I''(1/2,1/2)=-8\int_0^{\pi/2}x^2 \frac{\cos x}{\sqrt{\sin 2x}}\ dx=-\frac{8}{\sqrt2}\int_0^{\pi/2}x^2\sqrt{\cot x} \ dx $$ Back to $I(a,b),\quad I(a,b) $ can be expressed by beta fuction by Wolfram Mathematica. $$I(a,b)=\int_0^{\pi} \frac{\cos ax}{\sin^b x}\ dx=\frac{\pi \cdot 2^b\cdot\cos (\pi a/2)\cdot \Gamma(1-b) }{\Gamma(a/2-b/2+1) \cdot \Gamma(-a/2-b/2+1)} $$ Then we can get $I''(a,b)$ approach from other way.
Finally,we can get $\int_0^{\pi/2}x^2\sqrt{\cot x} \ dx$ ,but it seems a little complex. For a similar integral: $$\int_0^{\pi/2}x\cdot\tan^p x \ dx=\frac{\pi}{4\sin (p\pi/2)}\left(\Psi\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)-\Psi\left(\frac{1-p}{2}\right) \right)$$ The above integral can be solved by method of parametric development.Let $p=-\frac{1}{2}$ ,We can get $$\int_0^{\pi/2}x\sqrt{\cot x} \ dx=\frac{\pi\left(\pi-2\ln 2\right)}{4\sqrt2}$$ But to this one, it seems to be difficult with method of parametric development.

The Quantile function is defined as follows: $$Q(p)=\inf\{x\in \mathbb{R}:p\leq F(x)\}, \hspace{.1cm} 0<p<1$$ But I don't really see an example of a distribution function for which $\inf$ can't be replaced with $\min$, because CDF is necessarily a right continuous function.

1921469,Is the normed space of all bounded functions under the supremum norm isomorphic to $L^ \infty$?,"We are familiar with the space $L^ \infty$, i.e., the space of all essentially bounded measurable functions, i.e., $$L^ \infty(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)=\{f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}| f \text{ is measurable and } \exists M>0 \ni: \mu \{x \in \mathbb{R} | |f(x)> M\}=0 \}$$ under the essential supremum norm, $$||f||_ \infty=\text{esssup}_{x \in X} |f(x)|:= \inf \{M>0 |\text{ } \mu \{x \in X \text{ }|\text{ } |f(x)|> M\}=0\}$$ (i.e., the infimum of all essential  bounds). This is known to be a Banach space. This is also the natural analogue of the usual $L^p(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$, $1\leq p<\infty$ for $p=\infty$, in the sense that $$\lim_{p \rightarrow \infty} ||f||_p =||f||_\infty $$ whenever there exist $q<\infty$ such that $f \in L^\infty(X,\mathcal{M},\mu) \bigcap L^q(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$. What can also be considered, and in fact what is more natural in a sense, is the space of all (actually) bounded functions $$\mathscr{L}^\infty(X)=\{f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}| \exists M>0 \ni: |f(x)| \leq M \forall x \in X\}$$ under the (actual) supremum norm, $$||f||=\sup_{x \in X} |f(x)|$$
Unlike the analogous cases of $1\leq p<\infty$, it can easily be seen that $||.||$ itself is a norm (and not just a semi-norm) on $\mathscr{L}^\infty(X)$. As such there is no real necessity to go for equivalence classes here. It can also be seen that this is a Banach space (see Is the space of bounded functions with the Supremum norm a Banach Algebra ? for example). But is this different from our $L^\infty (X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$? The latter depends on the measure, while the former doesn't. On the one hand, there are more functions than there are measurable functions (w.r.t. any measure), while on the other, there are more essentially bounded functions than there are bounded functions. So, my questions are: Is $\mathscr{L}^\infty(X)$ isomorphic to $L^\infty (X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ as vector spaces? Is $\mathscr{L}^\infty(X)$ under ||.|| isometric or isomorphic to $L^\infty (X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ under $||.||_\infty$ as Banach spaces? If not, is there any interesting relation between them? We know that $$L^\infty (X,\mathcal{M},\mu)=\mathscr{L}^\infty(X)/\mathcal{N}(\mu)$$ as vector spaces, where $\mathcal{N}(\mu)=\ker(||.||_\infty)=\{f \in \mathscr{L}^\infty(X) | f=0 \text{ }\mu.a.e.\}$.","['banach-spaces', 'lebesgue-measure', 'functional-analysis', 'lp-spaces', 'measure-theory']"
1921486,Tangent space to a differentiable manifold,"I was trying to write the kinetic energy by following, step by step, the construction of tangent vectors and then inducing the scalar product from $\mathbb{R}^3$. Theorically, all the construction is quite clear to me, but I find myself in trouble when trying to apply it (I guess it is not that clear). 
Let's take, for example, a Paraboloid. I can define a chart (which also is an atlas): $\phi(\rho,\theta)=(\rho\cos\theta,\rho\sin\theta, \rho^2+1)$ Now, I could also think that $\rho=\rho(t)$ and $\theta=\theta(t)$. In this case, i have a curve on the manifold. I can now define a derivation: $X_{p,\phi}f=(f\circ \phi(t))'(0)$ with $\phi(0)=p$. Now, it is easy to express this tangent vector thinking of it as immersed in $\mathbb{R}^3$, but I was trying to espress it in the basis $\bigg\{\frac{\partial}{\partial\rho},\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\bigg\}$. Frankly, and this makes me feel really stupid, i can't.
The thing is that taking the vector I found and feeding it (two times, since it is a quadratic form) to the induced scalar product: $S=(S_{11},S_{12},S_{21},S_{22})=(1,0,0,\rho^2)$ does not reproduce the kinetic energy I wanted, which is: $T=\dot\rho^2(1+4\rho^2)+\rho^2\dot\theta^2$ I'm grateful for any help you can give me, because I really need to deeply understand these basic concepts!","['mathematical-physics', 'differential-geometry']"

$$4y \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{9x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}$$ Then we can integrate with respect to $x$: $$4\int y\frac{dy}{dx} \, dx = \int \frac{9x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \, dx$$ which, by canceling $dx$ and integrating the left hand side by $y$ and the right hand side by $x$, we have that: $$4 \frac{y^2}{2} + C_1 = 9\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + C_2$$
$$2y^2 = 9\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + C$$ which, given the initial condition $y(0) = −3$: $$C = 2(-3)^2 - 9\sqrt{1} = 18 - 9 = 9$$ So finally: $$y = \sqrt{\frac{9\sqrt{x^2 + 1} + 9}{2}}$$ But sadly this is not the correct answer.

  local diffeomorphism $g(t) = (\cos 2\pi t, \sin 2\pi t)$. Define $G : \Bbb R^2 \to S^1 \times S^1$ by
  $G(x, y) = (g(x), g(y))$. $G$ is a local diffeomorphism of the plane onto the
  torus. In fact, looking at $G$ on the fundamental unit square, one may consider
  it to be a construction of the torus by gluing opposite sides of the square
  together. Now define a map of $\Bbb R$ into the torus by restricting $G$ to a straight line through the origin in $\Bbb R^2$ with irrational slope. Since G
  is a local diffeomorphism, this is an immersion that wraps $ \Bbb R$ around the
  torus. Moreover, the irrationality of the slope implies that the
  immersion is one-to-one and that its image is a dense subset of the torus! On explaining what goes wrong here they continue: Notice
  that the injective immersion behaves strangely because it maps too
  many points ""near infinity"" in $\Bbb R$ into small regions of the image. Perhaps
  prohibiting this behavior will sufficiently tame immersions. The general
  topological analog of points ""near infinity"" is the exterior of a compact subset
  in a given space, the compact set being thought of as very large. Now, my interpretation of ""mapping too many points ""near infinity"" into small regions of the image"" is if we take any $\epsilon$ ball $B_{\epsilon}$ such that $B_{\epsilon}\cap S^1 \times S^1 \neq \phi$ and any $R>0$, we can find infinitely many points $x>R$ such that $f(x)\in B_{\epsilon}\cap S^1 \times S^1$. Is my interpretation correct? And if so, how does that cause a problem here? Why does the topological analog of points ""near infinity"" require the set to be compact?
