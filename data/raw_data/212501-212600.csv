4287304,Multivariate Calculus: finding mass,"Consider a solid $E$ bounded by the $yz$ -plane, the $xy$ -plane, the cone $z^2 = x^2 + y^2$ and the surface $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2y=0$ .

Find the mass of the chunk of metal. What I did so far: $$\iiint_Ef(x, y, z) \,\mathrm dV =\iiint_E \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\,\mathrm dV$$ with $$E = \{(ρ\sinϕ\cosθ, ρ\sinϕ\sinθ, ρ\cosϕ): 0≤θ≤{π\over 2}, 0≤ϕ≤{π\over 4}, 0≤ρ≤2\sinϕ\sinθ\}.$$ Would appreciate any help on how to solve.

But this problem doesn't suppose the knowledge about Lebesgue integral theory. Thus this seems to be solved without using the  knowledge about Lebesgue integral theory. Is there the reason why I can change $\lim$ and $\int$ without Lebesgue integral theory, or the reason why $f$ is differentiable ?","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"
4287540,What is the difference between KL Divergence and merely subtracting entropy measurements?,"I'm wondering what the difference between KL divergence and just subtracting one entropy measurement from another is. I can see what the difference is mathematically...but I'm having a hard time grasping what it means. Throughout this I'm thinking of entropy measurements of English text, but I'm not sure that matters. Consider that you have two models for some random variable X, p (the good model), and q (the less-good model). If we compute entropy $$H(X) = -\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} p(x) \log(p(x)) = let's\,say\,2\,bits\,per\,character$$ and $$H(X) = -\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} q(x) \log(q(x)) = 3\,bits\,per\,character$$ we can obtain a difference measure simply by subtracting: $$H_{diff}(p(x),q(x)) = -\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} q(x) \log(q(x)) - -\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} p(x) \log(p(x)) = 1\,bit\,per\,character$$ simplified a bit to be analogous in form to a common statement of KL Divergence... $$H_{diff}(p(x),q(x)) = \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} p(x)\log(p(x)) - q(x)\log(q(x)) = 1\,bit\,per\,character$$ Okay, so that makes a sort of intuitive sense. If we've got 1000 characters then on average for model q we'll see 3000 bits, whereas on average for model p we'll see 2000 bits. Got it, I think? But we can also use KL divergence, which is very similar: $$D_\text{KL}(p \parallel q) = \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} p(x) \log\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right)$$ Rearrange a bit... $$D_\text{KL}(p \parallel q) = \sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} p(x)\log(p(x)) - p(x)\log(q(x)) $$ So, really the only difference between simply taking the difference of the two entropy calculations and KL Divergence is p(x) vs. q(x) in the second term on the right-hand side, which is cross-entropy in the case of KL divergence and regular old entropy in my first example. I've been thinking about it for a while here and I can't come up with an answer. What, intuitively, is the difference between these two distance measures?","['statistics', 'entropy', 'information-theory']"
4287555,Expected number of cards drawn to get 4 consecutive spades,"Here's a question from my probability textbook: A person draws cards one by one from a pack and replaces them till he has drawn four consecutive spades.

However, the answer in the back of my book is $340$ . And the answer following the equations given here: The expected number of draws until four successive cards of the same suit appear $\mu_{3}=1+\frac{3}{4}\mu_{1}$ $\mu_{2}=1+\frac{3}{4}\mu_{1}+\frac{1}{4}\mu_{3}$ $\mu_{1}=1+\frac{3}{4}\mu_{1}+\frac{1}{4}\mu_{2}$ $\mu_{0}=1+\mu_{1}$ Gets us the answer $\mu_0 = 85$ according to Wolfram Alpha: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=d+%3D+1+%2B+%283%2F4%29b%2C+c+%3D+1+%2B+%283%2F4%29b+%2B+%281%2F4%29d%2C+b+%3D+1+%2B+%283%2F4%29b+%2B+%281%2F4%29c%2C+a+%3D+1+%2B+b So there's three possible answers of $82$ , $340$ , $85$ . Which one is correct? EDIT: I see the error of my ways, my equation is missing a term.

4287574,"How can an average rate of change be smaller, yet the function be larger?","Torty, the Tortoise and Harry the Hare question. Problem Description [This question] centers around the following situation, describing a 100m race.  [...] Situation: Torty and Harry are competing in a 100m sprint race. Torty's average speed on any 5 second interval is always less than Harry's average speed on any 5 second interval, but Torty wins the race! (Note: for consistency, let's say they keep running after 100 meters so that their speeds can always be calculated by looking forward in time, but we stop the race at 100 meters.) Prompt: Discuss as a group (using the definitions of constant and average rate of change) how it is possible that Torty wins the race. Post an initial conjecture by describing the properties of Torty's and Harry's distance-time relationships that would allow for Torty to win under the constraints of the race. [...] specifically address how properties of Torty and Harry's distance-time relationships do or do not match with the definitions of constant and average rate of change and and do or do not fit the constraints of the race. [...] create a neatly drawn or computer generated graph that shows Torty's and Harry's distance-time relationships that visualize the described race. Some context- I am a tutor.  This question has come up at least a couple of times from students.  Most recent is a student at Embry Riddle University.  Due to constraints with my employer, this is most of what I know about the context, no ability to ask any more clarifying questions, etc.  It's probably safe to assume Calculus I methods, so little or no analysis.  This is an education context, so the answer should probably incorporate ""how their described properties of Torty and Harry's distance time relationships do or do not match with the definition of constant and average rate of change and do or do not fit the constraints of the race."" My answer- Torty gets a head start. Any other graph I can think of with Torty winning the race has Torty has a higher average rate of change over at least one 5 second interval. Also, note ""Torty's average speed on any 5 second interval is always less than Harry's average speed on any 5 second interval.""  implies A. strictly less than, not equal to and B. The words any could compare unlike intervals.  For example, compare Harry's first 5 seconds, with Torty's last 5 seconds, etc.","['calculus', 'algebra-precalculus']"
4287587,Determining whether this equation is linearly independent,"I am given 2 sets of equations and I want to determine if they're linearly independent or not. $e^{-x}, -2e^{2x}+5e^{-x}$ $x|x|, x^2$ The definition of linear independence: if there are no constants $a, b \not= 0$ such that $ax_1(t)+bx_2(t)=0$ . For the first set of equations, I can tell that this is linearly independent because of the term $-2e^{2x}$ will never go away. For the second set of equations, I'm not so sure. If $x \geq 0$ , then this equation is not linearly independent. But $x \geq 0$ is not stated as a restriction.

4287617,Potential function for vector field $\frac{1}{r} \hat{\phi}$?,"Question. Does the vector field $\vec{F}(r, \phi) = \frac{1}{r} \hat{\phi}$ have something like an associated potential function? Context. I know that $\vec{F}$ is not conservative, and so I should not expect $\vec{F}$ to have a potential function that is defined everywhere . But could $\vec{F}$ nevertheless have a potential function that is defined almost everywhere ? Specifically, I know that taking line integrals around closed paths through $\vec{F}$ leads to a result of either 0 or $2\pi$ , and this depends on whether the closed path encircles the origin or not. So it seems like $\vec{F}$ acts like a conservative vector field when you're away from the origin. I also find it strangely suspicious that $\vec{F}$ itself will be undefined when $r = 0$ , i.e. at the origin. So I'm wondering if maybe there is an associated potential function that is defined everywhere except the origin, and has an essential singularity at the origin, so that integrating around the singularity leads to nonzero results?","['vector-fields', 'multivariable-calculus', 'line-integrals']"

4287707,"Is $\mathcal{D}_k(k[x])$ generated by $\partial_1,\partial_p,\partial_{p^2},\ldots$ and multiplication maps?","Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p>0$ , and let $\mathcal{D}=\mathcal{D}_k(k[x])$ be the ring of differential operators on $k[x]$ . That is, we define $$

Then is it true that $\mathcal{D}$ is generated as a $k$ -algebra by $\{\partial_1,\partial_p,\partial_{p^2},\ldots\}\cup\mathcal{D}_{\leq 0}$ ? Playing around a bit I think that every $\partial_n$ can be expressed in terms of $\{\partial_{p^i}\}_{i\geq 0}$ , so the question reduces to whether $\{\partial_n\}_{n\geq 0}\cup\mathcal{D}_{\leq 0}$ generates $\mathcal{D}$ . Is that the case? This question is motivatet by trying to understand the ring of differential operators in positive characteristic.

4287730,"Are packing (i.e., independence) numbers arbitrarily smaller than fractional packing (i.e., Rosenfeld) numbers?","Take a graph $G=(V,E)$ . One of the equivalent ways of defining its independence number (also known as $1$ - packing number ) is $$\alpha = \max\left\{ \sum_{v\in V}f(v) : \forall v\in V, f(v) \in \{0,1\}\text{ and } \forall \text{ clique }C, \sum_{v\in C} f(v) \le 1\right\}$$ In words, it is the maximum number of $1$ 's that can be obtained by assigning either $0$ or $1$ to each vertex, with the constraint that each clique can have at most a $1$ . The Rosenfeld number (also known as fractional packing number ) is similarly defined by $$\alpha^\star = \max\left\{ \sum_{v\in V}f(v) : \forall v\in V, f(v) \in [0,1]\text{ and } \forall \text{ clique }C, \sum_{v\in C} f(v) \le 1\right\}$$ where the only difference is that now vertices can be assigned any real number in $[0,1]$ . By their definition, it is clear that $\alpha \le \alpha^\star$ , and I am aware that it can happen that $\alpha < \alpha^\star$ for some graphs.
However, in all the examples I could find, the two differ only by a small constant (see., e.g, Hales, 9172, Examples 2 and 4 , where $\alpha = \beta$ and $\alpha^\star = \rho$ ).
This does not really allow me to see the big picture, so I wonder... Question: Is it possible that $\alpha^\star \gg \alpha$ ? I am assuming the answer is yes (it is hard to believe that people would introduce two different quantities that are always essentially the same), but noting that $\alpha^\star$ is the relaxation of the integer linear program that defines $\alpha$ , I feel it could also be possible to prove that the two always differ by a (multiplicative and/or additive) constant.
That said, I have zero experience with LP techniques and it could very well be the case that one could find a sequence of graphs $(G_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ with $\alpha(G_n)= const$ but $\alpha^\star(G_n) \approx |V_n| \to \infty$ as $n\to \infty$ .","['graph-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'linear-programming', 'combinatorics', 'integer-programming']"

Fullerene graphs are mathematical models of fullerene molecules, i.e., molecules comprised only by carbon atoms different than graphites and diamonds. We give a survey on fullerene graphs from our perspective, which could be also considered as an introduction to this topic. Different types of fullerene graphs are considered, their symmetries, and construction methods. We give an overview of some graph invariants that can possibly correlate with the fullerene molecule stability, such as: the bipartite edge frustration, the independence number, the saturation number, the number of perfect matchings, etc. and later in Section 4.1 Cyclic connectivity: ...An example of a fullerene graph, in which the twelve pentagonal faces are partitioned into four clusters containing 1, 2, 4, and 5 pentagons each, is depicted on Figure 14. It is easy to see that this graph is not a nanotube. I have annotated it and figured out how to get the twelve pentagons as four clusters containing 1, 2, 4, and 5 pentagons each by following the directions of making a second mirror copy, starting at one point and gluing them together. The final result would be the second copy directly above (or below) the first. Question: But what does ""...such that the 3-regularity is preserved."" mean? I'm not a a mathematician, and a term like ""regular"" can be used so many different ways in mathematics. Figure 14: A half of a fullerene graph, which is not a nanotube, but it is possible to separate six pentagonal face from the other six.

4288011,Representing Collatz sequences with Pascal's simplices modulo 2?,"In this binomial coefficient pdf (from a Russian summer school?), I found a curious identity (page 2, solution on page 10) pointed out by the authors, which ties the modulo 2 Pascal's triangle (first image below) to numbers of the form: $3^{a_1} + 2\cdot 3^{a_2} + \cdots + 2^n \cdot 3^{a_n}$ where $a_1 > a_2 > \cdots > a_n$ . Specifically these $a_j$ come from the binary representation of a row index of this triangle. This is very similar to the series one obtains from iterates of the Collatz function ( $2^{a_1} + 3\cdot 2^{a_2} + \cdots + 3^n \cdot 2^{a_n}$ ). Except that we obtain every power of two and only some powers of three. Whereas for the Collatz sums the reverse is true. The identity arises due to each triangle in Pascal's triangle mod 2 being followed by two 'child' triangles of equal size. Hence the sum of the first 2^n rows has 3^n '1's. So I thought of whether this correspondence could be made closer, and wagered that Pascal's pyramid (next picture) modulo 2 (final picture) is the logical choice. Here each pyramid is followed by three child pyramids. Hence one obtains a correspondence of the form: $4^{a_1} + 3\cdot 4^{a_2} + \cdots + 3^n \cdot 4^{a_n}$ by a similar argument as in the linked pdf. My question is whether there is an approach to turn these 4s into 2s (to therefore create a representation of the Collatz sequences vs simplical side length) either thru algebra or by using a related approach? The problem is that its hard to conceive of a simplex or fractal that has the required properties: branching factor three, with a doubling factor between some object and its child objects. I guess there might be a proof that no such construction could exist at least in the stated way.

4288017,How might one make this Gaussian integral derivation of Stirling's approximation more airtight?,"I will be following an argument presented by the YouTuber Flammable Maths - which is in fairness not their own, they're just giving simplified content to their audience! Their derivation is appealingly intuitive, but I definitely feel there is some rigour lacking - however I am not able to follow the only other proof I have seen, so I will be trying to improve upon the argument they make. We want to show: $$z!\sim z^ze^{-z}\cdot\sqrt{2\pi z}$$ We begin with: $$\begin{align}z!=\Gamma(z+1)&=\int_0^\infty e^{-t}t^z\,dt=\int_0^\infty\exp(z\ln(t)-t)\,dt\\&=\int_{-1}^\infty\exp(z\ln(z(1+x))-z(1+x))\cdot z\,dx\\&=z^{z+1}e^{-z}\int_{-1}^\infty\exp(z\cdot(\ln(1+x)-x))\,dz\end{align}$$ So far, no problems at all. However, these next lines of argument (paraphrased by me) feel... wishy-washy: As the expression $\ln(1+x)-x\lt0$ for all non-zero $x$ , the integrand is $\exp(-s)$ for some large quantity $s$ , as $z\to\infty$ . On the interval $(-1,0)$ , $\ln(1+x)-x$ diverges rapidly to $-\infty$ , even more so in multiplication by large $z$ , and hence the exponential decays quickly to $0$ . Likewise, on the interval $(0,\infty)$ the integrand goes sharply to $0$ . We may then consider the integrand as non-negligible for $x$ in a small neighbourhood of $0$ , and as such the Maclaurin expansion of $\ln(1+x)$ may be used to get the integrand as $\exp(-z\cdot\frac{x^2}{2})\cdot\exp(-z\cdot O(x^3))$ as $x\to0$ . As $z$ gets larger, the neighbourhood in which the integrand is non-negligible gets smaller, and thus the $O(x^3)$ term vanishes. We now obtain: $$z!\approx z^{z+1}e^{-z}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\exp\left(-z\cdot\frac{x^2}{2}\right)\,dx$$ For large $z$ , extending the lower bound to $-\infty$ as that extra area is again negligible. The Gaussian integral now returns $z!\approx z^{z+1}e^{-z}\sqrt{2\pi/z}=z^ze^{-z}\sqrt{2\pi z}$ There are many problems here, in my view. We first are discarding the majority of the range of integration, invoking a Maclaurin approximation but discarding the $O(x^3)$ term without proof that this does not affect things (for example, could I not simply include the $x^3$ term as well, losing the beloved Gaussian integral, and then truncate at $x^4$ instead), and then re-instating a much larger range of integration - the entire real line - of a different function . We also have not shown that the negligible portions of the integral remain negligible even under multiplication by $z^{z+1}e^{-z}$ . We are also missing the important aspect of asymptotic equivalence: we have only (heuristically) shown that $z!\in\Theta(z^ze^{-z}\sqrt{2\pi z})$ . The curious thing is, all the steps I balk at are in fact, as visually corroborated by Desmos, fairly good approximations anyway - but I have no idea how to show that, as there are too many moving parts and shortcuts in this argument for me to handle. My question: is the argument rigorously salvageable, or should I give up and look to another approach? Many thanks.","['gamma-function', 'approximation', 'asymptotics', 'real-analysis']"

Here $\bigsqcup_i X_i$ denotes the coproduct of the family $(X_i)$ in the category of topological spaces. If the path components functor $\pi_0\colon \mathrm{Top}\to\mathrm{Set}$ preserves colimits, then here is a short proof: $$\pi_0(\bigsqcup_i X_i)\cong \bigsqcup_i \pi_0(X_i)\cong \bigsqcup_{i\in I} \{\bullet\}\cong I.$$ For this to work it would be nice to have: Question 1: Does $\pi_0$ have a right adjoint? Does it at least preserve all colimits (not just of path-connected spaces)? Question 2: Is it true that $\pi_0(\bigsqcup_i X_i)\cong I$ ? I think $[(x,i)]\mapsto i$ , where $[(x,i)]$ is the path component of $(x,i)\in \bigsqcup_i X_i$ , $x\in X_i$ , is a bijection, but I'm stuck in the formal verification of that. What needs to be checked is that there is a path from $(x,i)$ to $(y,j)$ if and only if $i=j$ (which intuitively makes sense). Okay, now that I write about it, the ""if"" part should follow from the path-connectedness of $X_i$ for all $i\in I$ . But the ""only if"" part seems hard.

I believe that there must exist a subset (submultiset) $S' \subset S$ such that the elements of $S'$ sum to $n$ . For example, $n$ could be 6, and $S$ could be $[1,1,1,2,2,3]$ . In this case, the conjecture is true, because $S'$ could be $[1,1,1,3], [1,1,2,2],$ or $[1,2,3]$ . Must such an $S'$ always exist? Partial results: If $n$ is a prime power, such an $S'$ always exists. In particular, if we order the elements of $S$ from largest to smallest, some prefix of that ordering must sum to exactly $n$ . More generally, if every element of $S$ is divisible by all smaller elements of $S$ , then an $S'$ exists which is a prefix of the largest-to-smallest ordering. If $S$ had $\sigma(n)$ elements, rather than just $n$ elements, then there would always exist such an $S'$ whose elements were all the same integer.","['number-theory', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Same question as 3. but the balls not placed back. My answers: This one I used hyper geometric distribution.

The problem is that I would have to prove that this relation never changes for every $a,b\in I$ . So once positive/negative means, always positive/negative, which is not immediate. I can not come up with a counterexample to this, but this looks like it should need continuously differentiable, as $f'(x)\neq 0$ implying that $f'(x)$ is already always positive/negative seems like an intermediate-value kind off argument, and I wonder if you can walve this additional condition, when we have a connected interval.

4288606,Power Series Solution of Non-homogeneous Differential Equation: $(1-x^2)y'' + y' + y = xe^x$,"I am attempting to solve the non-homogeneous differential equation $(1-x^2)y'' + y' + y = xe^x$ via power series solution, but am running into an issue once I have expanded all the necessary terms and combined all series with like powers of $x$ into a common series. Please allow me to elaborate further. The differential equation $(1-x^2)y'' + y' + y = xe^x$ can be represented in the following power series form: $$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_nn(n-1)x^{n-2} - \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_nn(n-1)x^{n}+ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c_nnx^{n-1}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nx^{n}  = x\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}$$ These terms will hereafter be referred to as terms 1, 2, 3, 4, and sum, respectively. My aim was to convert all powers of $x$ to the like power of $x^n$ , however I feel this may be the decision that resulted in issues further down the road. Note that the highest index of a $x^n$ term is found in term 2, therefore all other terms will be expanded to put their summations in a form with an index of 2. To convert term 1 to a like power of $x$ , the substitution $n = n+2$ was made. The series was then expanded to an index of 2.  The resulting series is as follows: $$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_nn(n-1)x^{n-2} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n+2}(n+2)(n+1)x^{n} = 2c_2 + 6c_3x + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_{n+2}(n+2)(n+1)x^{n}$$ Term 2 is already in the form of a like power of $x$ with a common index of 2. To convert term 3 to a like power of $x$ , the substitution $n = n+1$ was made. The series was then expanded to an index of 2. The resulting series is as follows: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c_nnx^{n-1} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n+1}(n+1)x^{n} =  c_1 + 2c_2x + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_{n+1}(n+1)x^{n}$$ Term 4 is already in the form of a like power of $x$ , however does not share a common index. The series was expanded to an index of 2. The resulting series is as follows: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_nx^{n} = c_0 + c_1x + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_nx^{n}$$ The sum term is already in the form of a like power of $x$ , however it does not share the common index of 2. The series was expanded to an index of 2. The resulting series is as follows: $$x\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!} = x + x^2 + x\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}$$ Combining all of these terms and like power series, the result is as follows: $$c_0 + c_1 + 2c_2 + x(c_1 + 2c_2 + 6c_3) + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}(c_{n+2}(n+2)(n+1) + c_{n+1}(n+1) + c_n(2-n))x^{n} = x + x^2 + x\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}$$ This is where the issue is found. The $0$ th order constant terms can be equated to $0$ , and the $1$ st order constant terms can be equated to $1$ . However, there are no terms on the left hand side of the equation that will equal the $x^2$ term on the right hand side, unless the series is expanded, resulting in a loss of common indices between the two series. The series is also problematic, as the internal constant expression on the left hand side can be evaluated to $\frac{1}{n!}$ , but the series will never be equal due to the $x$ multiplier on the right hand side. In summary, I appear to be missing a power of $x$ on the left hand side of my equation. As stated earlier, I have an inclination that my choice to set the common power of $x$ to $x^n$ may have been a mistake. If the $x$ is factored into the series expression for $e^x$ , the power of $x$ would be $x^{n+1}$ , which could potentially resolve my issue if I restate my terms in the form of that power. However, I figured I would pass it by Stack Exchange and hopefully gain some insights as to what I am doing wrong here. Thank you for your time! It is much appreciated, many thanks!","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'eulers-number-e', 'power-series', 'sequences-and-series', 'homogeneous-equation']"

4289064,Generalisation of this circular arrangement of numbers from $1$ to $32$ with two adjacent numbers being perfect squares,"I got this interesting arrangement of numbers from $1$ to $32$ in a group in Facebook- This being an interesting property to look at, I was trying to figure out whether $32$ is something special, or does this hold for other numbers as well. So, let's say, we want to construct one such circle for a general $n$ . My idea was to take any $m\in \mathbb N_n=\{1,2,\dots ,n\}$ and find two different integers $x,y\in\mathbb N_n$ so that both $(m+x)$ and $(m+y)$ are perfect squares. Then, we need to find $x^\prime, y^\prime\in \mathbb N_n$ different from $x$ , $y$ and $m$ such that both $(x+x^\prime)$ and $(y+y^\prime)$ are perfect squares. Then, we can continue in this manner. Now, for any two $a,b\in \mathbb N_n$ , we have $2\leq a+b\leq 2n$ . So, for our given $m$ , when we are looking for the mentioned $x$ and $y$ , we only need to check through all the perfect squares in the interval $[m,2n]$ . So, to reduce our work, we can take our initial choice $m$ to be equal to $n$ . But, now comes the main problem. Let's say, we want to work it out for $\mathbb N_{33}$ . So, let's say, our initial $m$ is $33$ . The values of $x$ and $y$ can be from the set $\{3,16,31\}$ . The question is, which two of these three to choose so that eventually we don't run into a repitition. Note that, in the $\mathbb N_{32}$ case (which is the one in the diagram), taking $m=32$ leaves us with an advantage of having only two choices $4$ and $17$ . But, in the next step, for finding the appropriate $x^\prime$ for $x=4$ , we have the choices $\{5,12,21\}$ (since $32$ is already taken). The given diagram uses $x^\prime =21$ . I tried using $x^\prime =5$ and then using values of my choice, but soon ran into an unavoidable repitition. So, is there a way to make more circles with other values of $n$ , or does $32$ have some profound property which makes it the only possible choice for $n$ ? I thought, maybe $32$ being a power of $2$ has to do something with it. So, I tried using $n=2,4,8,16$ . But, these are trivially NOT solutions since there aren't enough perfect squares in $[n,2n]$ for these values of $n$ . Note that this ""not enough squares"" angle immediately gives a lower bound of $n\geq 19$ by trial and error. Peter Taylor pointed out in the MathOverflow post that this ""not enough squares"" argument also rules out $n\le 30$ since $18$ is always a vertex of degree $1$ otherwise. So, we have a lower bound of $n\ge 31$ . Also, I was too lazy to even attempt $n=64$ . So, is this case a rare coincidence, or can we have other values of $n$ satisfying this property as well? If there are other values, what family do they belong to? Also, for any case, is that arrangement unique? Edit: I got one interesting answer that uses graph theory. But, that has a computer program to check that it holds for all $100\geq n\geq 32$ . However, I want more ""mathy"" arguments. I want to see why this happens instead of to only confirm that it happens. I want to know whether it happens for all $n$ or whether there are cases where it breaks down. Please consider these questions as well. Also, here's the MathOverflow post of the same question. This answer gives two sequences in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, A071983 and A071984 which seems somewhat relevant.","['puzzle', 'graph-theory', 'number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'square-numbers']"

Line $GH$ is perpendicular to $AG$ and line $FH$ is perpendicular to $AF$ . The question: Show that the locus $e$ of $H$ (red) as $K$ moves on $d$ is a conic. An observation: the points $A,G,F,H$ are concyclic.  This suggests that the construction can be run in reverse.  Start with conic $e$ instead of $d$ .  Let $H$ be a point on $e$ and let $G,F$ be the intersection of circle $c$ with the circle whose diameter is $AH$ .  Then the line $GH$ envelopes a conic as $H$ runs through $e$ . I've unsuccessfully tried a few things, such as showing that $e$ is the intersection of two projective pencils showing that the conic cross ratio is preserved by the mapping $K\to H$ (it appears to be preserved) simplifying by assuming that $d$ is a circle.

(x-1)^2 = 16 \tag{1}

(1): \sqrt{(x-1)^2} =& \sqrt{16} \\
\Leftrightarrow x-1=-4 \quad \vee& \quad x-1 =4\\
\Leftrightarrow x=-3 \quad \vee& \quad x=5
\end{align} Although the solutions are right, I think this method is wrong because it does not ensure the square root of the clearly nonnegative $(x-1)^2,$ i.e. $(x-1),$ is nonnegative. Method B: ensuring the nonnegativity of the square root with absolute values \begin{align}
(1): \sqrt{(x-1)^2} =& \sqrt{16} \\
\Leftrightarrow |x-1| =& 4 \tag{2}

|x-1|=\begin{cases}
x-1 &\text{ if } x\ge 1 \\
-x+1 &\text{ if } x<1.

&|x-1| = 4 \\
&\Leftrightarrow x-1=4 \quad \vee \quad -x+1=4 \\
&\Leftrightarrow x=5 \quad \vee \quad x=-3.

(1): &\Leftrightarrow (x-1)^2 -16 = 0 \\
&\Leftrightarrow (x-1-4)(x-1+4) = 0\\
&\Leftrightarrow x=5 \quad \vee \quad x=-3.

If Method A is indeed wrong, then how do we justify the more commonly used method for solving equations of type \begin{align}

x &= \pm 2

4289475,Betting on the appearance of HHT or HTH in a series of coin flips,"Suppose that we bet on the outcomes of coin flips in the following way. Each of us chooses a different series of three flips, and we flip a coin until three consecutive flips, in order, match your choice or mine. For example, you might pick HHT while I pick HTH, and we flip until either HHT or HTH. Is one of us more likely to win? My friend Shimon argues as follows. If you pick HHT and I pick HTH, a long stream of flips will sooner or later include HH, the first two flips in your choice; and at that moment you have won, because there's no way that later flips can produce my HTH streak before it produces your HHT streak. But no corresponding situation exists for the other side; should HT, the first two flips in my choice, arise, it's still possible for you to win, because the next flips could be THHT, so that the six flips HTTHHT would be another win for you. I consider this total nonsense. It's obvious that the next three flips are as likely to be HHT, or HTT, or any of the six other possible sets of three flips. His approach of asking whether wins are possible given certain strings of past flips is mind-boggling, working without any clear sample-space and defying mathematics. I suggested a simulation. The simulation I produced is an Excel spreadsheet that flips sets of 65 flips. In each set, it finds the first flip that begins your choice or mine, and assigns a winner. The following screen shot shows that simulation. Blue is associated with HHT, and pink is associated with HTH. In the first set, HHT began in flips 2, 10, 16, 20, 29, 36 and 50. HTH began in flips 3, 5, 11, 13, 21 and 51. Because HHT arose first, there's a 1 in the blue vertical bar beside the first set. As you may be able to see, HHT won 8 sets of the pictured 10 sets. In my little experiment, HHT won far more often, and often by dramatic margins. I've looked around this stack exchange, and found a few questions almost exactly like mine – like this one and this one -- and several questions at least very similar to mine -- like this one and this one . They all seem to believe that Shimon is right, and some sequences are more likely than others. But despite that seeming (if not very clearly stated) unanimity, and despite my own simulation, I just cannot believe it. Obviously every possible set of three flips is equally likely.

$$ We just have to prove that $$\oint_{C_{N}} \pi \cot(\pi z)f(z) dz  \to 0 \quad N \to \infty$$ But it can be proven that $$|\cot(\pi z)|$$ is bounded in $C_{N}$ : $$|\cot(\pi z)|\leq A$$ Then $$\left| \oint_{C_{N}} \pi \cot(\pi z) f(z) dz\right| \leq \frac{\pi A M}{N^2}(8N+4)$$ since the lenght of the path $C_{N}$ is $8N+4$ .

4290046,Regular singular points on curves,"The reference for this post is $11^{th}$ section of the article, N. Katz, Nilpotent connections and the monodromy theorem . Suppose $k$ is a field of characteristic $0$ and $K/k$ is the function field of a smooth, projective, irreducible curve over $k$ , $W$ is a finite-dimensional $K$ -vector space. A connection $$\nabla : W \to \Omega^1_{K/k} \otimes W$$ is simply an additive map satisfying the Leibniz rule just almost as same as the cases for connection of vector bundle over smooth manifolds, read $$\nabla(fw) = df \otimes w + f\nabla (w) \ \forall f \in K, w \in W.$$ Equivalently, we can define a connection to be a map $\nabla: \mathrm{Der}_k(K,K) \to \mathrm{End}_k(W)$ . Now suppose $\mathfrak{p}$ is a closed point, $\mathcal{O}_{\mathfrak{p}}$ its local ring, $\mathfrak{m}_{\mathfrak{p}}$ its maxiaml ideal, $\mathrm{ord}_{\mathfrak{p}}: K \to \mathbb{Z} \cup \left \{\infty \right\}$ the discrete valuation at $\mathfrak{p}$ , so in particular $$\mathcal{O} = \left \{f \in K \mid \mathrm{ord}(f) \geq 0 \right \}$$ $$\mathfrak{m} = \left \{f \in K \mid \mathrm{ord}(f) \geq 1 \right \}.$$ We now have an equality $$\left \{D \in \mathrm{Der}_k(K,K) \mid D(\mathfrak{m}) \subset \mathfrak{m} \right \} = (h\frac{d}{dh})\mathcal{O}.$$ If there is a base $\mathbf{e}$ of $W$ (over K) such that $$\nabla\left(h\frac{d}{dh}\right)\mathbf{e} = B\mathbf{e} \ \text{for some} \ B \in M_{\mathrm{dim}(W)}(\mathcal{O})$$ then $\mathfrak{p}$ is called a regular singular point . A theorem of Turrittin asserts that there is a closed relation between regular singular points and cyclic vectors, i.e. vector $w \in W$ such that there exists a non-zero derivation such that $w,(\nabla(D))(w),...,(\nabla(D))^k(w),...$ span $W$ over $K$ . In that case, we say $(W,\nabla)$ is cyclic and $w$ a cyclic vector Theorem . [Turrittin] Assume that $(W,\nabla)$ is cyclic with a cyclic vector $w$ , $\mathfrak{p}$ a closed point and $h$ a uniformizer at $\mathfrak{p}$ . Then the following statements are equivalent $(W,\nabla)$ does not have a regular singular point at $\mathfrak{p}$ . In terms of the basis $$\mathbf{e} = \left(w, \nabla\left(h\frac{d}{dh}\right)(w),...\nabla\left(h\frac{d}{dh}\right)^{n-1}(w) \right)^t,$$ the connection is expressed as $$\nabla\left(h\frac{d}{dh}\right)\mathbf{e} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & ... & 0 &0 \\
. &  &...  &  & ...\\
0 & 0 &  & 0 & 1\\
-f_0 & -f_1 & . &  .& -f_{n-1}
\end{pmatrix}\mathbf{e}$$ and for some $i$ , $\mathrm{ord}(f_i) < 0$ . From the theorem, we deduce that if $A$ is a $K$ -algebra, then any $K$ -linear map $W \to A$ compatible with the connection is one-one corresponding to an element $f \in A$ satisfying the differential equation $$\frac{d^n f}{dh^n} + f_{n-1}\frac{d^{(n-1)}f}{dh^{(n-1)}}+...+f_0=0.$$ Here we're back to diffential equation ""in the"" analytic world, such a equation of the form above is said to have a regular singular point at $a$ if $f_{n-i}$ has a pole of order at most $i$ at $a$ . If so, the equation can be solved by the so-called Frobenius method . The matrix appears in the theorem is nothing but making a change of variables, i.e. transforming a $n$ -order equation into a system of $n$ 1-order equations and a cyclic basis in this case is just $(f,f',f^{""},...,f^{(n-1)})$ . If we view the resulting system of equations as a connection on the trivial bundle then the connection has form $$\nabla_{\frac{d}{dz}} = \frac{d}{dz} +  \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & ... & 0 &0 \\
. &  &...  &  & ...\\
0 & 0 &  & 0 & 1\\

Maybe I'm confused now but let's pick up a concrete example, say $f^{""}+\frac{p}{z}f'+\frac{q}{z^2}f=0$ ( $p,q$ holomorphic), it obviously has a regular singular point at $z=0$ but its matrix is $\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1\\ 
 \frac{q}{z^2}& \frac{p}{z} 
\end{pmatrix}$ so by Turrrittin's theorem, it does not have a regular singular at $z=0$ ? What is the reason for this contradiction? Perhaps I missed some point, any explanation is appreciate. Is there any motivation for considering the condition $D(\mathfrak{m})\subset \mathfrak{m}$ ? Update .

4290100,Proof of $\operatorname{Aut}(C_p)\cong C_{p-1}$ by means of permutations?,"This is a different approach than this other of mine , but to the same task: try to prove the result without explicitly mention fields (see e.g. here ). In the spirit, I think this is similar to this other question . Let $p$ be a prime and $C_p=\{e,a,\dots,a^{p-1}\}$ the cyclic group of order $p$ . Every automorphism of $C_p$ permutes the nontrivial elements of $C_p$ , namely $\varphi\in\operatorname{Aut}(C_p)\Longrightarrow\exists\tau\in S_{p-1}$ such that $\varphi(a^i)=a^{\tau(i)}, i=1,\dots,p-1$ . I assume as already known $\left|\operatorname{Aut}(C_p)\right|=p-1$ . Now I'm trying to prove $\operatorname{Aut}(C_p)\cong C_{p-1}$ by showing that there is a $(p-1)$ -cycle $\sigma\in S_{p-1}$ such that, if $\varphi\colon G\to G$ is defined by $\varphi(e)=e$ and $\varphi(a^i)=a^{\sigma(i)}$ for $i=1,\dots,p-1$ , then $\varphi\in\operatorname{Aut}(C_p)$ . My idea was to deploy some low- $p$ case, in order to reveal a ""pattern"", suitable for a guessed generalization to every $p$ (to be later proven by a lemma). For $p=5$ and $p=7$ , as suitable $\sigma$ 's I've come up to the following ones: $p=5$ : $\sigma=(1342)$ , ​ $\sigma=(1243)$ ; $p=7$ : $\sigma=(154623)$ , ​ $\sigma=(132645)$ , namely: for all the above $\sigma$ 's, the map $\varphi(e)=e$ , $\varphi(a^i)=a^{\sigma(i)}$ is an automorphism of $C_5$ or $C_7$ , and $|\varphi|=4$ or $|\varphi|=6$ (so $\operatorname{Aut}(C_5)\cong C_4$ and $\operatorname{Aut}(C_7)\cong C_6$ are proved). Differently from my hope, none of the four pairs $(\sigma_{p=5},\sigma_{p=7})$ gives me any hint for a guessed generalization for a $\sigma$ valid for every $p$ . Am I wrong in expecting such an approach to succeed, or is there indeed such a sought $\sigma=\sigma(p)$ ? Edit . In principle, it is not necessary to explicitly show such a $(p-1)$ -cycle; it's enough to prove its existence. And it exists if and only if the system of $\frac{(p-1)^2-(p-1)}{2}+p-1-\frac{p-1}{2}=\frac{1}{2}(p-1)^2$ linear congruences modulo $p$ in the $p-1$ unknowns $\sigma(1),\dots,\sigma(p-1)$ , arising from imposing the operation-preserving condition , has a solution which is a $(p-1)$ -cycle. Maybe this is always the case? Edit#2 . Seemingly, the system mentioned in the previous Edit has solutions: \begin{alignat}{3}
&\sigma(1) &&= (p-1)c &&&\pmod p \\
&\sigma(2) &&= (p-2)c &&&\pmod p \\
&\dots \\
&\sigma(p-2) &&= 2c &&&\pmod p \\
&\sigma(p-1) &&= c &&&\pmod p \\
\tag 1
\end{alignat} where $c$ is a parameter. So, we'd be left to prove that, for every $p$ , there is a value of $c$ such that $(1)$ is a cycle. Perhaps this is easy(?), but even if so, we'd firstly need to prove $(1)$ , which is just an educated guess based on the worked out $p=5,7,11$ cases. Edit#3 . As pointed out in the comments, this approach turns into the problem of proving that there is a primitive root modulo $p$ for any prime $p$ . In fact (modulo the fact that $(1)$ is still just an educated guess...), $(1)$ is a cycle if and only if, set $l:=p-c$ (with then $2\le l\le p-2$ ), $l$ is such that: $$l^k\not\equiv 1\pmod p$$ for every $k=1,\dots,p-2$ , i.e. if and only if $l$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ (which in turn is equivalent to $\Bbb Z_p^\times$ being cyclic).

x^2-y^2 &= -1\\ x^2 - y^2 &= 1\\ x+y &= 1\\ x+y &= 3

However, the professor found $$\det J_F(x, y) = -2x - 2y = -2s$$ and proclaimed that $$\det J_{F^{-1}}(s, t) = -\frac {1}{2s}.$$ I think this shouldn't work, because the inverse function theorem says that in general, $$J_{F^{-1}}(s, t) = [J_F(F^{-1}(s, t))]^{-1}$$ and to me it seems like the professor did $$J_{f^{-1}}(x) = [J_f((x))]^{-1}.$$ However, I calculated $$F^{-1}(s, t) = \left(\frac 12s + \frac {t}{2s}, \frac {12}s - \frac{t}{2s} \right)$$ and used this to calculate $\det J^{-1}(s, t)$ , and I also got $-\frac {1}{2s}$ .

4290215,"If an embedding of $S^1\times I$ has nice edges, are the edges ambiently isotopic?","Let $f_t(x)$ , $~t\in I$ , $~x\in S^1$ be an embedding of $f:S^1\times I\to\Bbb R^3$ . (Thus for example the images of $f_{t_0}$ and $f_{t_1}$ are disjoint if $t_0\ne t_1$ .) It's known that the images of $f_0$ and $f_1$ need not be ambiently isotopic. An easy construction of this is to ""ribbon-ify"" the Fox–Artin wild arc so that it's an embedded disc, and then delete a small disc in the interior so that it's an embedded cylinder. No knot containing the Fox–Artin wild arc, much less two of them, can be ambiently isotopic to the unknot. But what if the functions $f_0$ and $f_1$ are smooth? (This doesn't mean that the function $f:S^1\times I\to\Bbb R^3$ is smooth at $t=0$ or $t=1$ , because the $t$ coordinate can be very bad; only that they're smooth purely in the $x$ -coordinate. It does mean, though, that the boundaries of the cylinder are tame knots.) In this case, must the images of $f_0$ and $f_1$ be ambiently isotopic? So what we have is a cylinder with nice edges but a very crinkly, fractal-y, potentially Alexander horn-filled interior. A first attempt is to try to smooth $f$ somehow, but the worry is that this will have self-intersections that will be difficult to get rid of.

4290287,An inequality involving two i.i.d. standard Gaussians.,"Short question :
Let $ r,t,h\ge0 $ and $ G_1,G_2 $ be i.i.d. standard Gaussians.
Is it true that $$ \Pr[\{(r+G_1)^2\le t\}\cup\{(r+G_1)^2+G_2^2\le h\}]\le\Pr[\{G_2^2\le t\}\cup\{(r+G_1)^2+G_2^2\le h\}]. $$ Motivation :
I formulated the inequality in such a way since there is nice geometry behind it.
In the following figure, $\mathcal{D}_0$ denotes the green disk and $\mathcal{D}_1,\mathcal{D}_2$ denote the vertical and horizontal (infinite) bands with the disk clipped out, respectively. Then the LHS of the inequality is the probability that $(G_1,G_2)$ falls into the region $\mathcal{D}_1\sqcup\mathcal{D}_0$ , and the RHS is the probability that $(G_1,G_2)$ falls into the region $\mathcal{D}_2\sqcup\mathcal{D}_0$ .
The inequality is nontrivial only when $r>0$ and $t>0$ .
It's clearly true when $t\ge h$ since the disk is contained in the bands.
According to numerics, I believe it's true for any $r,t,h\ge0$ .
However, I could not prove it.
Any help is much appreciated. Disclaimer :

I have a plausible generalisation, and I'm trying to apply it to a nice Bregman sphere, but out popped this particular equation. I do understand that such a solution will not involve elementary functions. I have no real skillset with special functions, so all I could do was try solving it with a CAS. I don't have Maple or Mathematica on my computer, but I tried using Wolfram Alpha and SageMath. The latter was useless, returning $\alpha = \frac{x^\alpha + y^\alpha}{x + y}$ . The former gave me nothing, simply telling me that computation time was exceeded. Indeed, even when I substituted a particular value for $y$ , Wolfram Alpha still gave me no results. Only once I substituted two particular values for $x$ and $y$ would it give me an approximation with no closed form.

4290365,Why aren't derivatives defined on metric spaces?,"I'm studying the book by Ambrosio on gradient flows in metric spaces. It's stated that the usual notion of gradient flow, $$ x'(t) = -\nabla_x f(x),$$ is not defined on metric spaces because we don't have a definition for $x'(t)$ nor $\nabla_x$ . This is stated as obvious but it's not 100% clear to me. I guess that since derivatives on a metric space would be defined as $$ f'(x) = \lim_{h\downarrow 0} \frac{d(f(x), f(x+h))}{h}$$ (where $d$ is a metric), we need to ensure that limits exist in the metric space. I thought of the discrete metric space where $d(x,y) = 0$ if $x=y$ and $1$ if $x\neq y$ . But in this case, we can't define differentiable functions other than ones that are constant on singleton points. Is there a better example? Another thing that might be needed to define derivatives is the idea of direction . Since
the gradient is essentially a set of directional derivatives in the basis vectors of the  underlying space (correct me if this is wrong?), we may not be able to define this in a metric space that doesn't have ""directions"". What are some pathological examples of metric spaces that don't have directions or for other reasons we can't define derivatives?

What I tried to do: For every integer $n ≥ 0$ ... That means it's any number greater than or equal to $0$ , so it's infinite elements. Then $n2+n$ is divisible by $2$ ... I must replace $n$ with an integer value that matches the statement $n ≥ 0$ . I can start with $0$ itself. So I multiply $0$ by $2$ and then add $+ 1$ . So I get to the final result, and all I have to do is check if, in fact, this theorem is correct. I created a table, testing 4 possible cases only, because the cases are infinite. So, I arrived at the thesis (conclusion). And so, the theorem doesn't match, it's not true that: every integer $n ≥ 0$ , then $n2+n$ is divisible by $2$ . There will always be elements that are not divisible by two, they will be the odd numbers. I could also write using existential connective: $∃ n ∈\Bbb Z ≥ 0 \mid n ¬ / 2$ I'm not sure how to use quantifier connectives. But the idea is that: there is an integer n greater than or equal to 0 that is not divisible by 2. Again, I would like to know if my line of reasoning makes sense and if I am correct.

4290632,Integrating over curve of constant modulus,"In a paper of Raphael M. Robinson, which can be found here (given Jstor privileges, but I have included screenshots relevant to my question) the author defines a rational function $h(z) \in \mathbb{C}(z)$ such that $|h| < 1$ on some compact set $E \subset \mathbb{C}$ . He then chooses some $\lambda < 1$ for which $|h| < \lambda$ on $E$ , and integrates some meromorphic function $T$ over the closed curve $C = |h|^{-1}(\lambda)$ . He also claims this curve 'encloses' $E$ . I am wondering why $|h|^{-1}(\lambda)$ is one of the usual closed curves we can integrate over in complex analysis (so basically, piecewise $C^1$ ), and I am also unsure exactly what the meaning of 'enclose' here is. I suppose it means $\eta(C,e) = 1$ for all $e \in E$ . Here are the relevant screenshots: $h$ "" /> Also important is that the $q_k,p_k$ are finite (in fact they are integers, but this part does not seem necessary for my question), and $A_r \neq 0$ (in fact $|A_r| \geq 1$ but again I do not think this part is necessary for my question). Edit (partial solution): Here is a possible hacky way to circumvent the issue I brought up earlier, $h=\frac{P}{Q}$ is a rational function, i.e. some holomorphic map $\hat{\mathbb{C}} \rightarrow \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ , and in particular it is a branched cover in the sense that if we treat it as a map $\hat{\mathbb{C}} \setminus \{q_1,..., q_k \} \rightarrow \hat{\mathbb{C}} \setminus \{\alpha_1,...,\alpha_j \}$ (where the set we removed from the domain are the branch points and the set we remove from the range are the critical values), then it is a bonafide covering map. Now we can just select $\lambda < 1$ so that the circle of radius $\lambda$ does not contain any of the critical values, and lift the circle parameterized positively via the rational function. The rational function is a degree $\max(\deg(P),\deg(Q))$ cover, so there will be exactly these many disjoint lifts, all of these lifts will be smooth closed curves. Now I am guessing because of how close $h$ is to a covering map, there will be a way to modify this approach for arbitrary $\lambda$ . The risk with this hacky way is that it is possible $\lambda<1$ being arbitrary so that $|h|<\lambda$ on $E$ is essential for the rest of the proof, luckily it turns out this is not the case. So the disjoint union (after removing lifts that are reparameterizations of other lifts) of these lifts will be the entire preimage of $|h|^{-1}(\lambda)$ , which is a cycle (not exactly a closed curve, but we can still apply the usual residue theorems for cycles so this isn't an issue). Finally because $h(\infty) = \infty$ each connected components of $|h|^{-1}[0,\lambda]$ will coincide with the closure of the regions bounded by the lifts, and because these curves have winding number $+1$ with respect to points in their interior, we get the result for all but finitely many $\lambda$ . I suppose for the bad $\lambda$ there may be some continuity argument to show this still holds.","['complex-analysis', 'complex-geometry', 'complex-integration', 'analysis']"
