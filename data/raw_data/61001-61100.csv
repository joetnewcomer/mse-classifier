684683,Number of ways to choose two disjoint subsets of a set,"Let $A$ be a set of $n$ elements.

684690,Confusion about the quotient $G/B$,"Let $G$ be an affine, complex, reductive algebraic group and $B$ a Borel of $G$. I have seen and understood the proof that $G/B$ is projective. Now, on the other hand, I have made the following reasoning which must be false: Let $U$ be the unipotent radical of $B$ and $T$ a maximal torus of $G$ such that $B=UT$. Then, $\newcommand{\C}{\mathbb{C}}\C[G]^U$ is a finitely generated $\C$-algebra. Hence, $G/U$ is an affine variety. On this affine variety, we have an action of the torus $T$, which is affine and reductive. The (categorical) quotient of an affine variety by an affine reductive group is affine, so 
$$\C[(G/U)/\!/T] =\C[G/U]^T=\C[G]^{UT}=\C[G]^B$$
 is finitely generated. This seems to imply that $G$ has an affine, categorical quotient by $B$. But since geometric quotients are also categorical quotients and those are unique, $G/B$ would be affine and that's not true. Where exactly is the mistake?","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-groups', 'reductive-groups']"
684747,Geometric series of an operator,"In solving a first order linear differential equation $(1-D)y=x^2$ where $D\equiv \frac{d}{dx}$ the way I learnt was that we proceed as $y=\frac{1}{1-D}x^2=(1-D)^{-1}x^2=(1+D+D^2+D^3+\cdots)x^2=x^2+2x+2+0+0+\cdots=x^2+2x+2.$ Now the question that comes to mind is that what justifies our saying that $$(1-D)^{-1}=1+D+D^2+D^3+\cdots$$ When I asked my teacher about this he said that it is not the case that the inverse operator of $1-D$ is $1+D+D^2+D^3+\cdots$ (whose meaning is unclear anyway). What is true instead is that $$(1-D)(1+D+D^2+\cdots+D^m)x^m=x^m$$ and that we are actually using this fact. Although I understand this, but I am not entirely satisfied for two reasons. Firstly the resemblance with the expression for the geometric series must be there for a reason which I want to know. Secondly can an appropriate norm be given to an appropriate function space in which we can actually prove this geometric series to be true? (The answer to the second question also covers the first).

684909,Representation as a sum of two squares,"Recently, I have been wandering that what natural numbers can can be written as a sum of squares of two coprime positive integers in two different ways, order being irrelevant, or with the help of notations, Find all natural numbers $a,b,c,d,n$ such that $$n=a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}+d^{2}$$ where gcd$(a.b)$$=$gcd$(c,d)$$=1$ and $a\lt c \lt d \lt b$. My little progress: The prime decomposition of $n$ must look like $2^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_r^{a_r}$ where $a_1 \in \{0,1\}$ and the $p_i$ 's are primes of the form $4k+1$. Proof: Suppose there existed a prime $p \equiv 3 \pmod 4$ in the prime decomposition of $n$, then we would have $a^2+b^2 \equiv 0 \pmod p$. But then we would have $a\equiv b \equiv 0 \pmod p$, contradicting gcd$(a,b)$$=1$ (For , if $a \not \equiv 0 \pmod p$, then $(a,p)=1$ and hence $\exists c$ such that $ac \equiv  1 \pmod p$ wherefrom we see that $(ac)^2+(bc)^2 \equiv 0 \pmod p$ and the contradiction $1+(bc)^2 \equiv 0 \pmod p$). Also, if $4|n$, then gcd$(a,b)$$=1$ forces us to conclude that both $a$ and $b$ are odd but then $0 \equiv a^2+b^2 \equiv 2 \pmod 4$. Contradiction!","['elementary-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

684976,Find the mistake in my proof of partial derivatives exisiting implying differentiability.,"Let $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R} ^2$ be open. Let the function $f: \mathbb{R} ^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ have partial derivatives $f_x'$ and $f'_y$ at every point in $\Omega$. I will now try to prove that $f$ is differentiable on $\Omega$. What we want to show is the following:
$$
f(x+h,y+k) = f(x,y) + Ah + Bk + \sqrt{h^2+k^2}R(h,k) \qquad \text{(1)}
$$
for some $(x,y)\in\Omega$, $h$ and $k$ sufficiently small (so that $(x+h,y+k)\in\Omega$), some real numbers $A$ and $B$ and a function $R: \mathbb{R} ^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ such that $R(h,k) \rightarrow 0$ when $(h,k) \rightarrow (0,0)$. We introduce the following functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$:
$$
\phi(x)=f(x,y+k)
$$
$$
\psi(y) = f(x,y).
$$ (Here comes the crucial step, is this the mistake?) We realize that, because the partial derivatives of $f$ exist, $\phi$ and $\psi$ are differentiable. Therefore we have:
$$
\phi(x+h) = \phi(x) + \phi'(x)h + h\rho_1(h)
$$
$$
\psi(y+k) = \psi(y) + \psi'(y)k + k\rho_2(k),
$$
where $\rho_1(h)\rightarrow 0$ when $h\rightarrow0$ and  $\rho_2(k)\rightarrow 0$ when $k\rightarrow0$. Adding these together, noting that $\phi(x) = \psi(y+k)$, gives:
$$
\phi(x+h) = \psi(y) + \phi'(x)h + h\rho_1(h) + \psi'(y)k + k\rho_2(k),
$$
or:
$$
f(x+h,y+k) = f(x,y)  + f_x'(x,y+k)h + f_y'(x,y)k + h\rho_1(h) + k\rho_2(k).
$$
The above is on the form $(1)$ because, since $\lvert\frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2+k^2}}\rvert\leq1$ (and the same thing for $k$), we can set $R(h,k)= \frac{h\rho_1(h) + k\rho_2(k)}{\sqrt{h^2+k^2}}$ and see that $R(h,k) \rightarrow 0$ when $(h,k) \rightarrow (0,0)$. (Right?) So we have shown that $f$ is differentiable. Now, I know this has to be wrong (I've seen counterexamples). So either I have used somewhere that the partial derivatives are continuous, or I have made some other sort of reasoning error. It's just that I can't find it, so I would be thankful if someone could point it out for me! Thanks! I also know that $A$ and $B$ should be the partial derivatives at $(x,y)$, but in the definition of differentiability (at least in my text book) it only says they need to be some reals. Only later it's proven that they are in fact the partial derivatives - which makes my proof seem all the more fishy.","['multivariable-calculus', 'proof-verification']"

685215,A club for some special prime numbers: new members welcome,"Given an integer $i$, find an integer $n$ ( $2^{j-1}\le n <2^j$), and a prime divisor $p$ of $M_n=2^n-1$, so that $v= j+i$; where $p$ is written as $k2^v+1$, $k$ odd. In other words, $j$ is such that $2^{j-1}\le ord_p(2) <2^j$ where $ord_p(2)$ is the multiplicative order of $2$ in $Z/pZ^*$. Any odd number $p$ can be assigned such an $i$ value, but, when $p$ is prime, most of the times $v$ is smaller than $j$ and $i$ is negative. Most of the times $i$ is close to $-Log_2(p)+1$. When only $i\ge 0$ are allowed, these primes $p$ become quite rare, and all the more that $i$ is large. I wonder whether some real mathematician ever investigated this. $65537 = 1.2^{16}+1$ is a divisor of $2^{2^5}-1$: here $v=16; j=6$ and $i=10$. This used to be the largest $i$ that I know. $59393=29.2^{11}+1$ is a divisor of $2^{29.2^3}-1$: here $v=11; j=8$ and $i=3$. $115201=225.2^9+1$ is a divisor of $2^{225}-1$: here $v=9; j=8$ and $i=1$. For a Mersenne prime, $v=1$, (or $i=1-j$, it is always negative). For a Fermat prime $p=2^{2^l}+1$, $v=2^l$, $j=l+2$, and $i=2^l-l-2$ can grow very big. Conversely, if one could prove that, for primes, $i$ as defined above is limited, wouldn't one also prove in the same time, as a corollary, that there are only finitely many Fermat primes? I checked all primes below $4278255361$ and found only about $60$ primes (out of more than $200000000$) with $i\ge0$.  This club is made more ""select"" if you let only the larger $i$ in: only about $30$ have $i\gt0$. $51453953(i=0); 126074881(i=1); 115201(i=1)$ which are divisors of Mersenne number $M_n$ where $n$ is odd, were introduced to me here by Peter Košinár. Other guys that you know are welcome in the club, if they qualify (larger than $4278255361$ and not already in the list for larger numbers hereafter). V.I.P. lounge access for $i>0$ only. It seems that apart from Fermat primes themselves, prime divisors of Fermat numbers (like $2424833 (i=5)$) may provide some of the largest $i$ values. It can be demonstrated that prime divisors of Fermat numbers all have $i\ge0$. ... On the other hand, it seems  that prime divisors of Mersenne numbers of prime index can very hardly have $i\ge0$... But some very large $i$ are also obtained for primes which are not divisors of Fermat numbers. For now, the top 13 is as follows: N°13: $2424833 (i=5)$ N°12: $536903681 (i=8)$ N°11: $65537 (i=10)$ N°10: $140737471578113 (i=16)$ N°9: $18446744069414584321 (i=24)$ Its $i$ almost matches that of $F_5=2^{2^5}+1 (i=25)$. $F_5$ would be in the top 10... if it was prime. This make me think of $18446744069414584321$ as a sort of 'failed' Fermat prime, though it is not even a divisor of a Fermat prime. Actually it is $(2^{3.2^5}+1)/F_5$. N°8: $9444732965601851473921 (i=28)$ N°7: $604462909806215075725313 (i=31)$ N°6: $10384593717069655112945804582584321 (i=48)$ N°5: $2854495385411919762116496381035264358442074113 (i=66)$ N°4: $182687704666362864775461208552445184771578920961 (i=69)$ N°3: $11692013098647223345629483497433542615764159168513 (i=72)$ N°2: $187072209578355573530071639244871112681892570202113 (i=74)$ N°1: $883423532389192164791648750371459256584513952652893606156996040365965313 
    (i=110)$ Congratulations! It seems that $Q_{p,j}=(2^{p.2^j}+1)/F_j$ has $i=2^j-j-2-Floor(Log_2(p))$. Therefore, just after Fermat primes, primes with large $i$ are to be looked for amongst $Q_{p,j}$, with $p$ as small as possible, whenever they are prime. The question is whether prime $Q_{p,j}$s are less rarities than prime $F_j$s... This might be so, since they have two indexes. Also N°12, N°10 and the top 8 can be written as $p=2^q\pm2^{(q+1)/2}+1$ which is a divisor of $2^{4q}-1$, thanks to the Aurifeuillean factorization, therefore $ord_p(2)=4q$, $v=(q+1)/2$ and hence leads to $i=(q+1)/2 -3 -Floor(Log_2(q))$. This can be used to look for large $i$s, when $p=2^q\pm2^{(q+1)/2}+1$ is prime for a large $q$. Primes like this seem much more easy to find than prime $Q_{p,j}$. Can someone find new primes for the top ten, which are not of the $2^q\pm2^{(q+1)/2}+1$ kind ? Any non-Proth prime in the club?  yes! $262657=513.2^9+1$. This is probably not the only one..

685260,Alternative definition of strong/weak operator topology.,"Given two normed spaces $(X, ||\cdot||_X)$ and $(Y,||\cdot||_Y)$ the space of bounded linear maps $\mathcal{B}(X,Y)$ can be equipped with the strong operator topology (SOT) as follows: The initial topology with respect to [*] The topology induced by the family $S := \{s_x : x \in X\}$,
  $$s_x : \begin{cases} &\mathcal{B}(X,Y) &\to &[0,\infty)
\\ &T &\mapsto &||T(x)||_Y
\end{cases}
$$ (Definition taken from my lecture notes, but seem to coincide with Operator topologies - Wikipedia )
$S$ is a separating family of seminorms, so this yields a locally-convex topological vector space. In a similar fashion, we can define the weak operator topology (WOT) as The initial topology with respect to $W :=\{w_{x,y'} : x \in X, y' \in Y'\}$.
  $$w_{x,y'} : \begin{cases} &\mathcal{B}(X,Y) &\to &\mathbb{C}
\\ &T &\mapsto &y'(T(x))
\end{cases}
$$
  $Y'$ representing the topological dual space of $Y$. Now my questions are: Why do we have to go all the way to $[0,\infty)$ and $\mathbb{C}$, respectively? 
  Could these topologies be defined as the initial topologies with respect to the family
  $P:= \{ p_x : x \in X\}$ of pointwise evaluation
  $$p_x :
\begin{cases} &\mathcal{B}(X,Y) &\to &(Y,\mathcal{T})
\\ &T &\mapsto &T(x)
\end{cases}
$$
  only this time we equip $Y$ with either the norm topology $\mathcal{T} := \mathcal{T}_{||\cdot||_Y}$ or the weak topology $\mathcal{T} := \mathcal{T}_w$ instead? and also Wikipedia describes the weak-topology in a slightly different way, namely using extra absolute values
  $$|W| :=\{|w_{x,y'}| : x \in X, y' \in Y'\}.$$
  Are there any benefits in doing this? (I guess this has something to do with the connection of separating families of seminorms and point separating subspaces of the algebraic dual.) *Edit:

Having nothing better to call it I have referred to it as ""The fundamental theorem of discrete calculus"" due to it's similarity to the fundamental theorem of calculus.  Anyway, here is the theorem (presented much more clearly then I did back in high school). Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $d$ have the following representation in the binomial basis,  $$p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^d a_i \binom{x}{i}$$ Also let $C$ be an arbitrary constant and let$$P(x) = \sum_{i=0}^d a_i \binom{x}{i+1} + C$$ Then $$\sum_{i=a}^b p(i) = P(b+1) - P(a)$$ This is clearly analogous to the fundamental theorem of calculus where $P$ is like a ""discrete antiderivative"" of $p$. Also of note is that this trivializes many of the induction proofs that we go through when first learning induction, such as $$\sum_{i=1}^n i = \binom{n+1}{2}$$ So anything you can tell me about the history of the theorem or the subject of ""discrete calculus"" (which I don't even know if that is the proper name) would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!","['math-history', 'calculus', 'discrete-mathematics']"

an example of this sigmoid function ; $$w = \frac{w_{\text{max}}}{1 + e ^{-k (t - t_m)}}$$ ( from the online file ; ""a flexible sigmoid function of determinate growth"" ) here, I understand that the $-k$ represents a value indicating how steep the slope of growth is
and that $t = \text{time}$ , and that $t_m$ represents the max ceiling of time, so Im guessing that here
we'd subtract a current time from a max time???  That seems a bit confusing also. Then I found a better example at this website ; http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/math120/01f/ The file here is called ""logistic.pdf"" In this example they show the function of ; $$y = \frac{C}{1 + Ae ^{-Bx}}$$ $A =$ # of times initial population must grow to reach ( $C$ ) Also $A$ describes the relation betwen initial and limiting output values $B =$ Here in the example the definition is left ambiguous through out the document all it really says is that this value increases / decreases
when the function is positive / negative The document says ( $B$ ) can be derived with the inflection point coordinates
but it doesnt really say exactly why or how, it gives only a very vague
generic description on page 6 where it says $\frac{\ln 12.8}{0.0266} = 95.8$ But on page 3 it says
""The parameter $B$ is much harder to interpret exactly. We will be content to
simply mention that"" On page 4 it says  ""It turns out that $A = 12.8, B = 0.0266, C = 11.5$ are parameter values that yield a logistic function with a good fit to this data:"" This seems completely confusing, the value for $B$ seems arbitrarily assigned and they simply say that this value ""turns out"" to be a good paramter fit.... I totally dont understand how or why this value of $0.0266$ has been chosen and I dont understand what it means that this value
""turns out"" to be a good fit??!! $X =$ some input $C =$ A ceiling or limit but is representing long run behaviour of the function So, if possible I would really honestly appreciate some basic answers to these questions ; What IS ( $B$ ) actually representing here? And how, why, and where did they assign it the value of $0.0266$ ??? And lastly, how can we determine what parameters to use for a sigmoid function? I can understand that the first value passed to $e$ , like $-k$ can represent the growth slope angle; $$w = \frac{w_{\text{max}}}{1 + e ^{-k (t - t_m)}}$$ But how do we determine what other parameters can be used and is there any online resource
or simple method available that can describe how we choose the other parameters we want
and then how do we determine the proper syntax of these parameters for the function? Thanks for any meaningful feedback you can provide! :)","['exponential-function', 'functions']"

$r\gt 0$. Suppose that $P$ is not the monomial $a_nX^n$, in other words
there is at least an $i<n$ such that $a_i\neq 0$. Denote by $C$ the 
circle $\big\lbrace z \ \big| \ |z|=r\big\rbrace$. Clearly,
the continuous function $|P|$ attains a minimum value (let us denote it
by $\mu$) on the compact set $C$. Let $M=\big\lbrace z\in C
\ \big| \  |P(z)|=\mu\big\rbrace$.
 How many elements can we have in $M$ ? When $\mu=0$, $M$ contains
 only roots of $P$, so that the maximum cardinality is $n$. For $l\in[-n,n]$, let us put 
 $$b_l=\sum_{j=-n+{\sf max}(0,-l)}^{n+{\sf min}(0,-l)}
 \bar{a_j}a_{j+l}r^{2j+l}, B(X)=\sum_{l=-n}^{n}b_lX^{l+n}, D(X)=\frac{B(X)}{X^n}
 $$. Then we have the identity $|P(re^{i\theta})|^2=D(e^{i\theta})$ for any $\theta\in{\mathbb R}$.
 Since $D'(X)=\frac{XB'(X)-B(X)}{X^{n+1}}$, we see that 
 $|M| \leq |M'|$ where $M'=\big\lbrace z \in {\mathbb C} \ \big| \ zB’(z)-B(z)=0, |z|=1
 \big\rbrace$. Remark that $D'$ is zero iff $B$ is a monomial in $X$, iff
 $P$ itself is a monomial in $X$. As the degree of $XB'(X)-B(X)$ is exactly $2n$, we deduce $|M| \leq 2n$. Note however that we have only counted local extrema here, and the question is about the global extrema. Thus, one expects $|M|$ to be significatively
 lower than the upper bound $2n$. In fact, I conjecture the following : Conjecture. $|M| \leq n$. I have checked this conjecture on a few random numerical examples.

685854,Player statistics as estimate of surreal number of game,"This is a rather complex question; it may require nontrivial assumptions about human cognition. But, I'm interested in getting mathematicians' perspective. With some finagling, you can associate many popular games, plus starting positions, with surreal numbers -- or more generally with games in Conway's sense. The number (or game) tells you which player has a winning strategy. Some of these games have online clients with tens of thousands of users, accumulating huge amounts of raw data. In particular, we can look at the win percentage for player one versus player two. That should give us some information about the surreal number or game (Conway) of the game. In the former case, perhaps an estimate or a bound. In the latter case, perhaps whether or not the game is comparable with zero, and if so where it falls. My question is: what kind of estimate can we get? How good would we expect it to be? And what other statistics might we consider looking at? I realize that in the case of e.g. standard chess, with a symmetric starting position, we can probably get a confidence estimate for whether the game is zero or incomparable in some obvious way. But I'm interested in the general case -- weird starting positions and so on. With advanced players this will lead to 100% win rates in all but the smallest (or incomparable) games, but we might still get some information about the larger games from beginner players, or more generally from statistics about win rate versus player rank.","['statistics', 'combinatorial-game-theory']"

But I am not sure this is the correct definition of fibration in Algebraic Geometry; in that case, any correction is much appreciated.

Here $F$ is called the fiber of $f$ (in particular, Zariski locally trivial fibrations do have isomorphic fibers). One example I came up with is that of an étale cover of curves: the fibers are discrete of the same size, hence isomorphic, but it is not Zariski locally trivial in general. Another example might be the Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb F_n\to \mathbb P^1$, with $n\neq 0$.

Clearly $\mathfrak a\subseteq\mathfrak m_{\alpha}$ so we have a closed point $\overline{\mathfrak m_{\alpha}}$ in $X$; we have defined the function $\lambda:\alpha\mapsto\overline{\mathfrak m_{\alpha}} $ and we must show that $\overline{\mathfrak m_{\alpha}}\in X(K)$.

I see that the denominator of the two functions is never equal to zero, because for $\pi$ the only possible case would be (0,0,1) but this has another value and for $\psi$ is always greater than 1 and for this reason we can say that $\psi$ is continuous since composition of continuous functions. I've also shown that $\pi(\psi(z))$ = z and that $\psi(\pi(x_1,x_2,x_3))$ = $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ (This tells us that $\pi$ is the inverse function of $\psi$ and viceversa.) My problem tells me to show that $\pi$ and $\psi$ are continuous in infinity, but I don't know how to show this.

686165,Does X = Y in distribution and X being Y-measurable imply Y is X-measurable?,"Suppose $X,Y$ are random variables taking values in some Borel space, $X \overset {d}{=} Y$, and $X$ is $Y$-measurable. It follows from the fact that $X$ is $Y$-measurable that there exists a measurable $f$ such that $X = f(Y)$ a.s. Is it the case that there exists a measurable $g$ such that $Y = g(X)$ a.s.? It seems plausible, and is true for finite-valued, discrete random variables. EDIT: I've thought about it a bit, and one consequence is $X \overset {d}{=} f(X)$, which may or may not be helpful.","['measure-theory', 'probability']"
686167,$\frac{1}{1-e^{\frac{ik\pi}{n+1}}}+\frac{1}{1-e^{-\frac{ik\pi}{n+1}}}=1$?,"I'm working on an assignment where part of it is showing that $S_k=0$ for even $k$ and $S_k=1$ for odd $k$, where $$S_k:=\sum_{j=0}^{n}\cos(k\pi x_j)= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=0}^{n}(e^{ik\pi x_{j}}+e^{-ik\pi x_{j}}) $$ Here $x_j=j/(n+1)$. So, working through the algebra: $$\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=0}^{n}(e^{ik\pi x_{j}}	+e^{-ik\pi x_{j}})	=\dots
		=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1-e^{ik\pi}}{1-e^{\frac{ik\pi}{n+1}}}+\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1-e^{-ik\pi}}{1-e^{-\frac{ik\pi}{n+1}}}
 $$ Obviously $S_k=0$ for even $k$'s, since $e^{i\pi\cdot\text{even integer}}=1$. But when $k$ is odd we get $$\frac{1}{1-e^{\frac{ik\pi}{n+1}}}+\frac{1}{1-e^{-\frac{ik\pi}{n+1}}}$$
which isn't obviously one to me, at least. Wolfram alpha confirms it equals 1. My question: How does one see that it equals 1?","['complex-numbers', 'sequences-and-series']"
686190,Some technical details about regular functions on quasiprojective varieties,"I have some confusion about some very basic notions in algebraic geometry.  I am using Shafarevich but I find the book to be pretty unclear at times. First, given a quasi projective variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{k}$ (meaning $X$ is an open subset of a closed subset of projective space) when defining what it means for a function $f:X\to \mathbb{k}$ to be regular on $X$ is it the same thing to say ""there are homogeneous polynomials $p$ and $q$ in $n+1$ variables of the same degree such that at every $x\in X$ we have $f(x) = p(x)/(q(x)$"" and ""about each point $x\in X$ there is an open neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ such that $f$ is the quotient of two homogenous polynomials in $n+1$ variables of the same degree""?  In other words I am asking if, in the Zariski topology, a function locally looks like a quotient of two rational functions must it globally look like a quotient of two rational functions?  This is obviously not true in the usual topology on $\mathbb{C}$ for example but I am confused about the case of the Zariski topology. Something else I am confused about is the following.  If we have a regular function $f$ on a quasiprojective variety $X$ then the set $X - Z(f)$ is an affine variety.  This I understand.  But it is stated in Shafarevich that that the ring of regular functions on $X-Z(F)$ is the ring of regular functions of $X$ adjoin $\frac{1}{f}$.  It is clear that this is contained in the ring of regular functions, but I don't understand how we know that this is the entire ring.",['algebraic-geometry']

686208,Hockey Classics at Matheletics '13,"I'm trying to solve a challenge from Matheletics '13 : Micheal Nobbs is organizing a training camp for identifying new talents in Indian Hockey. The camp witnessed a total of ($3K+1$) players. Each of the players was given a unique number between $1$ and $3K+1$. On the first day of the camp, Micheal Nobbs wants all the players to align in a line for a brief introduction about the camp. He wants that players must align themselves in such a way that: “For each player $P$, the sum of numbers given to each player standing before $P$ in the line, including the number given to player $P$, should not be divisible by $3$”. In how many ways the players can align themselves according to the condition given by Michael Nobbs? The number of ways can be very large, so output the number of ways modulus $1000000007$ i.e. ($10^9 + 7)$. Small Case: $K=200$ Large Case: $K=10^8$ I have solved some other challenges, where by using mathematical framework I was able to get the right solution or to simplify the proposed problem to a much simpler one. I assume this is the same case since going through all permutations is very time expensive. Since now I was unable to find a property by which the statement $$3 \nmid \sum_{i=1}^{k} P_{perm_i}, k \in [1, 3K+1]$$ or the whole problem can be simplified. Can anybody help with a suggestion on how to successfuly solve the problem for small and large case?","['elementary-number-theory', 'algorithms', 'summation', 'recreational-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

686303,Why can one multiply by zero,"Dividing by zero isn't allowed because it results in the same answer (infinity) for every input and therefore is considered ""undefined.""  Multiplying by zero is allowed, even though it results in the same answer for every input (zero).  It also allows me to start with the assumption (1 != 2), multiply both sides by 0, and prove that 0 != 0.  Why is zero not treated like a limit, so that multiplying by zero would not become a black hole for information.  Please forgive the fact that I didn't reach calculus, and haven't touched math in years, and explain to me where understanding is wrong or my reasoning went astray. Edit/Update: Good answers, thanks.  Can anyone include an example of something that can't be solved easily without multiplying by zero, to show me that it's necessary to allow the operation, rather than just not contradictory?  I know of proofs in formal logic that require assuming ""x = X"", so I imagine there's an obvious example of the need to multiply by zero?",['limits']
