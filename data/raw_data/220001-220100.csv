4500985,Counting Binary Sequences Arising from a Numerical Semigroup,"This is a sequel to this question , though none of the background there should be necessary. Yly's excellent answer to that question gives a few different ways of stating the below question for $n = 2$ , which may be helpful. Short version: Consider a set of positive integers $A =\{m_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with $m_i < m_{i+1}$ and $\mathrm{gcd}(A) = 1$ . Form an infinite binary sequence $s$ with $x$ $1$ s and arbitrarily many $0$ s subject to the following constraint: If there is a $0$ in position $j$ , i.e., $s_j = 0$ , then $s_{j+m_i} = 0$ for all $i$ . Let the first entry of $s$ be $s_0$ , and set $s_0 = 0$ . How many such sequences are there for fixed $x$ and $\{m_i\}$ ? More details: It quickly follows that the positions of the entries in $s$ which must be $0$ s are the elements of a numerical semigroup, i.e., an infinite set of nonnegative integers containing $0$ that is closed under addition. (Wikipedia link here.) If $S$ is a semigroup, it has a minimal set of generators, i.e., the smallest set of relatively prime non-negative integers $\{m_i\}$ such that every element in $S$ can be written in the form $\sum_i a_i m_i$ for non-negative $a_i$ . By removing superfluous $m_i$ if necessary, we can take $A$ from above to be the minimal set of generators of the semigroup $S$ that gives the positions of the required $0$ s in the sequence. The positive integers not contained in $S$ are called the gaps of $S$ , denoted $G(S)$ . The number of gaps, called the genus of $S$ , is denoted $g(S)$ . For our sequence, the gaps are the possible positions of the $1$ s. A few results quickly follow from this picture. If for fixed $\{m_i\}$ , we let $N_0(x)$ be the number of sequences beginning with a $0$ and with $x$ $1$ s, then $N_0(x = g(S)) = 1$ , when all the gaps are filled, and $N_0(x) = 0$ for $x > g(S)$ . It can also be shown that $N_0(1) = m_1 - 1$ , as only the gaps before the first generator can be filled by a solitary 1, since if $s_i = 0$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, m_1$ , then $s_i = 0$ for all $i$ . However, finding $N_0(x)$ for $1 < x < g(S)$ seems much more difficult. For example, Let $A = \{3,7\}$ . We see that $G(S) = \{1,2,4,5,8,11\}$ and $g(S) = 6$ . Let $x = 2$ . Clearly we can take $s_1 = s_2 = 1$ . We see that if we fill the gap at position 1 with a $0$ , i.e. set $s_1 = 0$ , then $s_4 = s_8 = s_{11} = 0$ as well. It follows that if $s_1 = 0$ , we must have $s_2 = s_5 = 1$ . If we instead take $s_1 = 1$ and $s_2 = 0$ , then $s_5 = s_8 = s_{11} = 0$ , so we can either take $s_2 = 1$ or $s_4 = 1$ . Note that setting $s_2 = 0$ in the latter case does not force $s_4 = 0$ . Thus we find $N_0(2) = 3$ , with the gaps filled with $1$ s and the actual sequences being $$(1,2) \text{ and } (1,4) \text{ and } (2,5), \qquad 011 \text{ and } 01001 \text{ and } 001001,$$ with the infinite trailing $0$ s suppressed. We can do similar computations to find $N_0(x) = 2, 2, 1$ for $x = 3, 4,$ and $5$ , respectively. The gaps filled with $1$ s and the sequences are $$\begin{matrix}
x = 3: & (1,2,4) \text{ and } (1,2,5) & 01101 \text{ and } 011001\\
x = 4: & (1,2,4,5) \text{ and } (1,2,5,8) & 011011 \text{ and } 011001001\\
x = 5: & (1,2,4,5,8) & 011011001\\
\end{matrix}.$$ It is unclear how to systematize this method. Clearly some understanding of how the gaps of $S$ ""knock out"" some of the subsequent gaps when the entries of $s$ corresponding to the gaps are set to $0$ is necessary. It seems like thinking about the residues of the gaps modulo the $m_i$ might be useful, but I've been unable to make much progress for general $\{m_i\}$ . There is reason to believe (see Yly's answer to the question linked at the top) that the solution involves counting integer partitions subject to various restrictions, so a closed form for $N_0(x)$ is likely impossible, but a generating function or an expression in terms of objects derived from $S$ would still be useful.","['binary', 'semigroups', 'combinatorics', 'sequences-and-series']"
4501009,Integrating $\int^{\infty}_0\frac{x^n}{e^x-1}\text{ d}x$ using contour integration only,"I have the integral $$I=\int^{\infty}_0\frac{x^n}{e^x-1}\text{ d}x$$ for real $n>0$ that I want to evaluate only with contour integration. (I already know the identity that $\Gamma(s)\zeta(s)=\int^{\infty}_0\frac{x^{s-1}}{\exp(x)-1}\text{ d}x$ ) I let $$f(z)=\frac{z^n}{e^z-1}$$ noting that there is a removable singularity at $0$ , and poles every $z=2\pi im$ for $m\in\mathbb{Z}, m\neq0$ . As a result, I set up the following contour $\mathcal{C}$ shown below, where I would take the limit as $R\rightarrow+\infty$ and $\epsilon\rightarrow+0$ . By the Residue theorem, $$\oint_{\mathcal{C}}f(z)\text{ d}z=\int_{\text{Right}}+\int_{\text{Top}}+\int_{\text{Left}}+\int_{\text{Bottom}}+\int_rf(z)\text{ d}z=0$$ Parameterizing the integrals yields $$\int^{2\pi}_0\frac{(R+iy)^n}{e^R e^{iy}-1}i\text{ d}y + \int^{\epsilon}_{R}\frac{(2\pi i+x)^n}{e^{2\pi i}e^x-1}\text{ d}x + \int^{0}_{2\pi-\epsilon}\frac{(iy)^n}{e^{iy}-1}i\text{ d}y + \int^{R}_0\frac{x^n}{e^x-1}\text{ d}x + \int^{-\frac\pi 2}_{0}\frac{(2\pi i+\epsilon e^{i\theta})^n}{e^{2\pi i}e^{\epsilon e^{i\theta}}-1}i\epsilon e^{i\theta}\text{ d}\theta=0$$ Since $f(z)$ approaches $0$ as $\Re(z)$ becomes large, $\int_{\text{Right}}f(z)\text{ d}z=\int^{2\pi}_0\frac{(R+iy)^n}{e^r e^{iy}-1}i\text{ d}y$ should go to $0$ . More rigorously, I moved the limit as $R\rightarrow +\infty$ inside (the function should uniformly converge I think so this is legal?) and indeed it would go to $0$ . $\int_{\text{Bottom}}f(z)\text{ d}z=I$ so we can ignore that for now. I'm thinking that we possibly could use a Laurent series for $\int_rf(z)\text{ d}z=\int^{-\frac\pi 2}_{0}\frac{(2\pi i+\epsilon e^{i\theta})^n}{e^{2\pi i}e^{\epsilon e^{i\theta}}-1}i\epsilon e^{i\theta}\text{ d}\theta$ since we're taking the limit $\epsilon\rightarrow +0$ but honestly I'm not sure how. If I directly take the limit $\epsilon\rightarrow +0$ of the integrand, Wolfram Alpha tells me it's equal to $(2\pi i)^n$ , which would mean the entire integral is equal to $2^{n-1}(i\pi)^{n+1}$ , but since it's such a complicated function I'm not sure if it uniformly converges on those bounds and thus if it is legal or not... I also tried using the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality on $\int_{\text{Left}}f(z)\text{ d}z=\int^{0}_{2\pi-\epsilon}\frac{(iy)^n}{e^{iy}-1}i\text{ d}y$ where $$\left|\int^{0}_{2\pi}\frac{(iy)^n}{e^{iy}-1}i\text{ d}y\right|\le \int^{0}_{2\pi-\epsilon}\frac{\left|i^n\right|\left|y^n\right|}{\left|e^{iy}-1\right|}|i|\text{ d}y = \int^{0}_{2\pi-\epsilon}\frac{y^n}{\left|e^{iy}-1\right|}\text{ d}y\le \int^{0}_{2\pi-\epsilon}\frac{y^n}{\left|\left|e^{iy}\right|-\left|1\right|\right|}\text{ d}y$$ where the last part follows from $\frac{1}{|a-b|}\le\frac{1}{||a|-|b||}$ but this makes the denominator $0$ which is illegal so I probably did something wrong here. So in the end, I would have the following equation: $$I-\int^{\infty}_{0}\frac{(2\pi i+x)^n}{e^x-1}\text{ d}x - \int^{2\pi}_{0}\frac{(iy)^n}{e^{iy}-1}i\text{ d}y=2^{n-1} (i\pi)^{n+1}$$ And... I'm stuck. If anyone can help it would be really appreciated! Thanks in advance! :D","['integration', 'improper-integrals', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration', 'complex-integration']"
4501034,Is there an efficient way to determine whether a given contiguous sequence can appear within a de Bruijn sequence?,"I am curious whether an efficient algorithm exists to determine whether a sequence $S$ can appear within a de Bruijn sequence of order $n$ . For example, for $n=3$ , I believe the only de Bruijn sequence is 00010111 (and its rotations/reflection). By definition, any sequence of length $3$ or less will appear at some point, assuming you allow wrapping around or the equivalent. However, 0110 does not appear; you can even prove it cannot fairly easily, as it would still require 111 at some point, granting you a total of 5 1 -bits, where the maximum can only be $2^{n-1}=4$ of the 1 -bits. For larger values of $n$ where there are a great many distinct de Bruijn sequences, it seems like deciding whether some sequence may ever appear might turn out to be very difficult to work out. Or perhaps there's some easy trick to it. If anyone can describe how you could do this/point me towards an algorithm for it, or alternatively confirm that it is difficult after all (in the rough sense of being not computationally feasible past more than the first handful of $n$ ), I'll consider this answered.","['computer-science', 'computational-complexity', 'combinatorics', 'sequences-and-series']"

Let $n_d(G)$ denote the number of elements of order $d$ where $d$ is a divisor of $|G|$ .

4501166,Finding the greatest sum of 10 integers with a given set of constraints.,"This is a problem that comes up often in my job. Not as transparently as this (it's not a heavily-math focused job, haha), but at a fundamental level it does, and I was wondering if it can be generalised in any way. I'm not a very math-savvy person, so please bear with my phrasing of this like a textbook question: You have a linear sequence of 10 spaces labelled A through J. Into each space you may place 1 and only 1 counter. You have 4 types of counter: four counters marked ""2"", three counters marked ""3"", two counters marked ""4"", and two counters marked ""5"". You may place counters into each space as you see fit, as long as you respect the following rule: A counter marked with $x$ cannot be placed within $x$ spaces of another counter marked with $x$ . For example, if a ""2"" counter is placed in space A, no ""2"" counters can be placed in spaces B or C. If a ""2"" counter is placed in space C, no ""2"" counters can be placed in spaces A, B, D, or E. Finally, you are not required to place a counter in every space. Given the above constraints, what is the greatest possible value for the sum of the numbers marked on the counters placed in spaces A through J? Like I said, the problem in practice is not usually that transparent, so I'm more interested in whether the answer can be generalised in some way (like into a formula of some kind), or if it's too complex for that.

4501184,The pullback of a foliation,"I would like to know how to prove that the pullback of a foliation is actually a well-defined concept. To be precise, if $M$ is an $n$ -dimensional smooth manifold, a $k$ -dimensional foliation $\mathcal F$ of $M$ is a set of nonempty, connected, mutally disjoint, immersed $k$ -dimensional submanifolds of $M$ called the leaves of the foliation, such that their union covers $M$ and for each $p\in M$ there exists a flat chart for $\mathcal F$ , that is, a chart $(U,\varphi)$ of $M$ such that $\varphi(U)$ is a cube in $\mathbb R^n$ and the intersection of $U$ with each element of $\mathcal F$ is either the empty set or a countable union of slices of the form $x^{k+1}=c^{k+1},\dots,x^n=c^n$ . Lets recall that if $\mathcal F$ is a foliation of a smooth manifold $M$ and $f:N\rightarrow M$ is a smooth map transversal to the leaves of the foliation, then there exists a unique foliation on $N$ , the pullback of $\mathcal F$ , denoted by $f^*\mathcal F$ , such that $f$ becomes a foliation-preserving map (it maps leaves of $f^*\mathcal F$ into leaves of $\mathcal F$ ). I have seen how to apply the transversality of $f$ in order to construct a flat chart for $f^*\mathcal F$ , but I don't know how to prove that the connected components of $f^{-1}(L)$ , where $L$ is a leaf of $\mathcal F$ , are actually immersed submanifolds of $N$ . For instance, I don't know hot to prove that such sets are Hausdorff, etc., and I have not seen a proof of this fact anywhere. It may be a technicality, but proving that there are flat charts does not suffice to conclude that the given set is a foliation.

Then, its complement in the first topology is closed, so the complement of the set is equal to its own closure in the first topology, which is equal to the complement’s closure in the second topology.

Then $k$ is said to be a symplectomorphism , if $k^*\sigma = \sigma$ . Let $\nu$ is a differential $m$ -form and $X$ be a vector field. Then, the contraction of $\nu$ by $X$ is defined as the $(m-1)$ -form $(X\lrcorner \nu)(w) = \nu(X, w), w \in (\mathbb{R}^n)^{m-1}$ . Let $f$ be a smooth function defined on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ . Then the Hamiltonian vector field $H_f$ is a vector field such that $\forall w \in \mathbb{R}^{2n}:\sigma(w, H_f) = df(w)$ where $d$ is the differential 1-form. Preamble: I am trying to understand an intermediary step in a proof for Jacobi's theorem, that is $H_f = k_*(H_{k^*}f)$ , where one needs the equality $k^*(H_f)\lrcorner k^*\sigma = k^*(H_f\lrcorner \sigma)$ . If I write out the LHS I get $(k^*(H_f)\lrcorner k^*\sigma)(w) = k^*\sigma(k^*(H_f), w) = \sigma(k^*(H_f), w) = -\sigma(w, H_f \circ Jk)$ ( $\sigma$ is antisymmetric), where I am not sure how to either ""move"" the $Jk$ or argue why $H_f \circ Jk$ is necessarily a Hamiltonian vector field. The RHS evaluates nicely to $(k^*(H_f\lrcorner \sigma))(w) = (H_f\lrcorner \sigma)(Jk w) = \sigma(H_f, Jk w) = -\sigma(Jk w, H_f) = -df(Jk w)$ . Question: Is there a neat way to show the equality $k^*(H_f)\lrcorner k^*\sigma=k^*(H_f\lrcorner\sigma)$ ? If there is, what is it?

My thoughts directly went to the inverse function but than I started having doubts because if the domain is bigger than the co-domain the inverse function would have to have more than one value for every input and than g wouldn't be a function.

4501538,"Is it possible to evaluate $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}\operatorname{sech}^2(\frac{x}{2})\,dx$?","I am curious to know if it is possible to evaluate the following integral: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}\operatorname{sech}^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\,dx$$ Here is the context: Someone had asked me about the error when using the trapezoidal rule on the integral $$I=\int_{0}^{1} \exp\left(-\ln^2\left(\frac{x}{1-x}\right)\right)\,dx= \int_{0}^{1} \exp\left(-\ln^2\left(\frac{x}{x-2}\right)\right)\,dx$$ I was however interested to potentially find a closed-form for this integral. Here are my attempts: After setting $u=\ln \left(\frac{x}{1-x}\right)$ one can show that $$I=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{e^{u-u^2}}{(1+e^u)^2}\,du\stackrel{\text{IBP}}{=}-2\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{u e^{-u^2}}{1+e^u}\,du$$ Here I tried to use contour integration, however, the residue sum diverges rapidly, so I was stuck with this attempt. Splitting the integral at $0$ , and using $$\frac{1}{1+e^u} =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} e^{-n u}$$ one can determine $$I=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} n \sqrt{\pi} e^{n^2/4} \operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)$$ but I’m not sure how to evaluate this series. Performing some substitutions on $I$ one can arrive at $$I=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x e^{-x^2} \tanh\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\,dx\stackrel{\text{IBP}}{=}\frac{1}{4}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \operatorname{sech}^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\,dx=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-x^2}}{e^x+e^{-x}+2}\,dx$$ which appears like an integral that potentially contour integration can be applied to but I still arrive at the same rapidly-diverging residue series. I also arrived at the radically different form $$I=1-\frac{4}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin (t) \left(\Im \left(\psi \left(\frac{\sqrt{it}}{2\pi}\right)-2\psi\left(\frac{\sqrt{it}}{\pi}\right)\right)+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\, dt$$ where $\psi$ is the digamma function. This doesn’t appear too hopeful, however, since integrals of the form $\sin (x) \psi (x)$ generally don’t have closed-forms and can only be expressed in terms of a logarithm series of similar form to my question on $\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} \frac{\ln (k)}{k^2-4}$ due to the results known about the Laplace transform of the digamma function, but perhaps the case $\sin (x) \psi (\sqrt{x})$ works out nicer- I will also accept some logarithmic series of similar form for $I$ .

4501583,Is there a name for $(\det JJ^\top)^{1/2}$ where $J$ is a non-square Jacobian matrix?,"Background: Let $f: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^m$ be a differentiable vector-valued function, with components $f_i: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R, \textrm{ for }1\le i\le m$ .  Then the Jacobian matrix is the $m \times n$ matrix $$\textbf{J} = \begin{bmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\dfrac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n} \end{bmatrix}$$ As is well-known, in the case in which $n = m$ the Jacobian matrix is square, and its determinant, the Jacobian determinant , is the scalar $J = \det \textbf{J}$ . The Jacobian determinant has many uses, including when using a substitution during integration. But what if $m \ne n$ ? In this case, $\textbf{J}$ is not square, so $\det \textbf{J}$ is not defined.  However, in this case, the quantity $\left(\det \textbf{J} \textbf{J}^\top \right)^{1/2}$ is still meaningful, and generalizes the idea (and some of the uses) of the Jacobian determinant: For example, consider a function $\vec r: \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^3$ , which we can regard as a parametrization of a surface in $\mathbb R^3$ . If we write $\vec r(u,v) = \langle x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v) \rangle$ , then the Jacobian matrix is $\textbf{J} = \begin{bmatrix} x_u & y_u & z_u \\ x_v & y_v & z_v \end{bmatrix}$ ; in this situation it can be shown that $\left(\det \textbf{J} \textbf{J}^\top \right)^{1/2} = \| \vec r_u \times \vec r_v \|$ .  We recognize the quantity that relates area in the surface to area in the domain: $dS = \| \vec r_u \times \vec r_v \| \, dA$ . On the other hand consider a function $\vec r: \mathbb R^1 \to \mathbb R^n$ , which we can interpret as a parametrization of a path in $\mathbb R^n$ .  If we write $\vec r(t) = \langle x_1(t), x_2(t), \dots, x_n(t) \rangle$ then in this case $\left(\det \textbf{J} \textbf{J}^\top \right)^{1/2} = \left| \frac{d\vec r}{dt} \right|$ . Once again we recognize the quantity that relates arc length in the path to length in the domain: $ds = \left| \frac{d\vec r}{dt} \right| \, dt$ . Finally we note that if $n = m$ then $\left(\det \textbf{J} \textbf{J}^\top \right)^{1/2}$ is identical to the ""usual"" Jacobian determinant $J$ . My question: Does the quantity $\left(\det \textbf{J} \textbf{J}^\top \right)^{1/2}$ have a standard name in the case of a non-square Jacobian matrix $\textbf{J}$ ?  The phrase ""Jacobian determinant"" seems, as far as I can tell, to only be used in the context of square matrices, despite the fact that the quantity generalizes quite naturally to the non-square case, and encompasses several ""special formulas"" in a single neat form.

The map $f$ is therefore regular there, and its fiber at such a point has $|S_n| = n!$ points, so $f$ is finite. Finally, a finite holomorphic map between compact complex manifolds of the same dimension is surjective, either by general differential topology facts about finite maps and the orientability of complex manifolds, or by Grauert and Remmert's open mapping theorem and standard topological arguments involving compactness and Hausdorff spaces. Therefore any polynomial of degree $n$ splits into linear factors, so $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed. There are of course algebraicially closed fields $k$ that are not the complex numbers. Question: Suppose we do the same thing but over an arbitrary field $k$ . Then we have a finite morphism between algebraic varieties.

The Riesz theorem (let me state it for $\mathbb{R}$ not to complicate things) says that the dual of $C_0 (\mathbb{R})$ is the set $\mathcal{M} (\mathbb{R})$ of finite Radon measures on $\mathbb{R}$ , where $C_0$ denotes the functions vanishing at infinity. So $$(C_0 (\mathbb{R}))^* = \mathcal{M} (\mathbb{R}) $$ The main advantage here is that for a bounded sequence of finite Radon measures (with respect to the total variation if I am not mistaken), we have weak-star compactness by standard functional analysis results. Really nice. Now, very often it's used (implicitly) another version of the theorem, which basically says $$ (C_c (\mathbb{R}))^* = \mathcal{M}_{loc} (\mathbb{R}),$$ where $C_c (\mathbb{R})$ denotes the set of continuous functions supported in a compact set and $\mathcal{M}_{loc}$ . And so the weak-star convergence here is with respect to the functions in $C_c$ . The question is: are these two always interchangeable? I mean, the first veriosn provides a sort of more ""global"" behavior, the second one a completely local one. After all, the restriction of a locally finite Radon measure to a compact set is a finite Radon measure. I am asking this because many times in various courses there is a theorem and in the book it talks about finite Radon measures, while in class it is proved for locally finite Radon measures (one example that comes to my mind now are, Reshetnyak semicontinuity/continuity theorems). I know it's not a big deal but I want to be sure once and for all. Is it really true that one can take a theorem which uses finite Radon measures weak-star converging (with respect to functions in $C_0$ ) to something and simply change the statement by taking locally Radon measures (and weak-star convergence with respect to $C_c$ ) to have a local version of the theorem?

Also, a die is thrown, and then both Alice and Bob will see the number. Then, they will lie/say truth accordingly. My attempt: Case $1$ : Number $1$ showed up. Chance of all this happening = $\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \big(\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{5}\big) = \frac{1}{180}$ Case $2$ : Number $3$ showed up Chance of all this happening = $\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \big(\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{5}\big) = \frac{1}{120}$ Case $3$ : Other number showed up Chance of all this happening = $\frac{4}{6} \cdot (\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{5}) \cdot (\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{5}) = \frac{1}{450}$ So, total = $\boxed{\frac{\frac{1}{180}}{\frac{29}{1800}} = \frac{10}{29}}$ Is my attempt correct?

4502089,Textbook for graduate analysis over a general complete valued field?,"At my university, the standard sequence of first-year graduate analysis courses is taken by students who plan to go into analysis, differential equations, and applied math. These students know why they have to learn analysis. The first-year graduate analysis courses are also taken by students who plan to go into algebraic topology, algebraic number theory, and algebraic geometry. These students sometimes are disinterested in learning classical analysis (over the real or complex numbers), because their perspective is not yet broad enough to see the fundamental importance of analysis and/or how it is related to the subjects they plan to specialize in. My efforts to explain to these students why they ought to care about analysis have generally not been successful. My colleagues and I are considering the possibility of running our first-year graduate analysis courses as courses in analysis over a general complete valued field. Over the archimedean fields, we would recover classical analysis over the real and complex numbers; over the non-archimedean fields, we would recover many cases of interest to the students who plan to study algebra, particularly analysis over p-adic fields. We hope the resulting courses would be of interest and of use to all our students. But it is not yet clear to us that this idea makes sense; perhaps some topics (e.g. integration theory) are simply too different in the non-archimedean case to treat them, at this level, alongside the classical treatment. There are many good references on functional analysis which work over non-archimedean fields, or which allow the base complete valued field to be archimedean or non-archimedean. However, I do not know of a graduate analysis textbook (not just functional analysis, but rather roughly the contents of a standard first year of graduate analysis) which works over a general complete valued field. Do you know of any such textbook? Thanks.","['analysis', 'reference-request']"

4502097,How much truth does Hensel's Analogy really hold?,"F. Gouvêa's "" $p$ -adic Numbers. An Introduction"" motivates the titular object in mainly two different ways. First, there is the idea of succesively lifting solutions modulo prime powers formalised by Hensel's Lemma and, second, there is something he dubs Hensel's Analogy . Let me expand on the latter (which is more or less the table on page $1$ here ). Recall that any positive integer $n$ can be expanded into powers of any fixed prime number $p$ defining its $p$ -adic expansion. More explicitly, there are non-negative integers $a_k$ for $k=0,\dots,m$ so that $0\le a_i<p$ and $$
n=\sum_{k=0}^m a_kp^k\,.
$$ Put differently, any positive integer is expressible as a polynomial in $p$ with coefficients between $0$ and $p-1$ . It then seems natural to ask whether this can be extended to all (positive) rational numbers by somewhat simplifying the resulting fraction of polynomials. Drawing from complex analysis we know that for polynomials $P(z),Q(z)\in\mathbb C[z]$ we can expand $$
\frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}
=\sum_{k=-m}^\infty a_k(z-\alpha)^k
$$ for, say, $\alpha$ a root of $Q(z)$ . This is the Laurent series of the rational function. Jumping ahead, the $p$ -adic numbers $\mathbb Q_p$ give a way of making sense of such infinite series in powers of the fixed prime $p$ corresponding to the ""local"" study at $p$ . The crucial technical part here is to introduce a sensible notion of convergence to allow infinite power series in place of mere polynomials. We arrive then at $\mathbb Q_p$ having as elements $$
\sum_{k=-m}^\infty a_kp^k
$$ with integers $0\le a_k<p$ . This naturally extends the $p$ -adic expansions we are used to while simultaneously introducing a very useful and powerful number theoretic tool. However, I was wondering: Is there more to Hensel's Analogy then formal similarities? Conceptually, studying the local fields $\mathbb Q_p$ is a way of focusing on the prime $p$ . For example, any number field $K/\mathbb Q$ has a corresponding local extensions $K_{\mathfrak p}/\mathbb Q_p$ with $\mathfrak p\mid p$ in which we can more easily study the, say, ramification behavior of $K/\mathbb Q$ at $p$ . So the $p$ -adic numbers provide a framework for the ""local"" study near $p$ similar to what a Laurent series expansion does for a rational function (which is also an idea close to algebraic geometry). Hence the analogy seems to hold some truth. But how much truth does Hensel's Analogy really hold? That is, what non-trivial techniques or results (if any) can be carried over from complex analysis to number theory? What can be said besides the things which follow from the formal equity to the Laurent series? Thanks in advance!","['complex-analysis', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'p-adic-number-theory']"

4502120,Actions on Bernoulli space have almost the same orbits,"Let $(\mathbb{B}, \nu)$ be the binary space with probability measure $\nu(0) = \nu(1) = \frac{1}{2}$ . The map $T : \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}} \to \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ is defined as left addition with carry, i.e. if $x = (1, \ldots, 1, 0, x_k, \ldots)$ then $T(x) = (0, \ldots, 0, 1, x_k, \ldots)$ . This map is a measure preserving Borel isomorphism. We can define two actions on the product space $(\mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}, \nu^{\otimes \mathbb{N}})$ as follows: $\mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}} \curvearrowright \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ through componentwise addition modulo 2. $\mathbb{Z} \curvearrowright \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ through $k \cdot x := T^k(x)$ . Show that these actions are orbit equivalent, in other words, there exists a Borel isomorphism $\varphi : \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}} \to \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ which is measure preserving and satisfies $\varphi(\mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}} \cdot x) = \mathbb{Z} \cdot \varphi(x)$ for almost every $x \in \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ . I'm pretty stumped on this problem. If I'm not mistaken the orbit $\mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}} \cdot x$ should be the entire space $\mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ itself. Since $\varphi$ is supposed to be an isomorphism I assume this means $\mathbb{Z} \cdot \varphi(x) = \mathbb{B}^{\mathbb{N}}$ as well. However the former seems to be a countable set, while the latter isn't? Is there something obvious I'm seeing wrong here? This problem is taken from the paper A. Ioana's lecture notes ""Orbit Equivalence of Ergodic Group Actions"" , Exercise 1.21. Edit: So I thought of a potential solution, but I'm not sure I can take it all the way to its end, so here goes. For any $x \in \mathbb{B}^\mathbb{N}$ , it seems clear on one hand that $\mathbb{B}^\mathbb{N} \cdot x = \mathbb{B}^\mathbb{N}$ . On the other hand, the set $\mathbb{Z} \cdot x$ contains all sequences that eventually have the same tail end as $x$ , in other words it contains all the following sets: $$
\begin{align}
\{x_0\} \times \{x_1\} \times \{x_2\} &\times \cdots \\
\mathbb{B} \times \{x_1\} \times \{x_2\} &\times \cdots \\
\mathbb{B} \times \mathbb{B} \times \{x_2\} &\times \cdots \\
&\vdots
\end{align}
$$ Hence if we define the Borel sets $Z_k = \mathbb{B}^k \times \{x_k\} \times \{x_{k+1}\} \times \cdots$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ it follows from $Z_k \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \cdot x$ that $\bigcup^\infty_{k=0} Z_k \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \cdot x$ . At this point I'd use the measure of the union as a lower bound for the measure of $\mathbb{Z} \cdot x$ but I now realize that's not as obvious as it first looked.","['topological-dynamics', 'measure-theory', 'ergodic-theory', 'group-actions', 'dynamical-systems']"

In particular, suppose the center is the vector $C$ and the three points through which the ellipse passes are $P_1, P_2, P_3$ then a parametric equation of this ellipse is $ P(t) = C + F_1 \cos(t) + F_2 \sin(t) $ where $F_1$ and $F_2$ are called the conjugate semi-diameters, and are not unique.  So now define $V_1 = P_1 - C , V_2 = P_2 - C , P_3 - C $ then Then the shifted ellipse has the equation $ V(t) = F_1 \cos(t) + F_2 \sin(t) $ We can choose $V(0)$ to be $V_1$ , then $ V(t) = V_1 \cos(t) + F_2 \sin(t) $ At times $t_1$ and $t_2$ we have $ V(t_1) = V_2 = V_1  \cos(t_1) + F_2 \sin(t_1) $ Now, since we are in $2D$ , then $V_3 = c_1 V_1 + c_2 V_2$ , and $F_2 = a V_1 + b V_2 $ where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are known, while $a$ and $b$ are unknown. With this, and from the linear independence of $V_1$ and $V_2$ , it follows that $ 0 = \cos(t_1) + a \sin(t_1) \hspace{15pt}(1)$ $ 1 = b \sin(t_1) \hspace{15pt}(2)$ And finally, at $t = t_2$ we have $ V(t_2) = V_3 = c_1 V_1 + c_2 V_2 = V_1 \cos(t_2)+ (a V_1 + b V_2) \sin(t_2) $ From which we get another two equations $ c_1 = \cos(t_2) + a \sin(t_2) \hspace{15pt}(3) $ $ c_2 = b \sin(t_2) \hspace{15pt}(4)$ Eliminating $a$ and $b$ from equations $(1)-(4)$ yields the system of two equations above in $t_1 $ and $t_2 $ .","['calculus', 'trigonometry']"

Let $M_f$ be the set of matrices in $M_n \Bbb Z$ with characteristic polynomial $f$ . The Latimer-MacDuffee theorem (Theorem 2.1 in the notes) establishes a bijection between the conjugation classes of matrices in $M_f$ and the ideal class monoid $ICM(\Bbb Z[\alpha])$ of $\Bbb Z[\alpha]$ . Namely, we send a fractional ideal $I$ to the matrix (in some $\Bbb Z$ -basis $B$ ) associated to multiplication by $\alpha$ , viewed as a $\Bbb Z$ -linear map $L_\alpha \colon I \to I$ . In Remark 2.7 of the aforementioned notes, it is claimed that if we instead consider $SL_n \Bbb Z$ conjugacy classes of elements of $M_f$ , then we need to replace the notion of equivalent ideals by narrow equivalence in the following sense: two fractional ideals $I$ and $J$ are narrowly equivalent if there exists $x \in \Bbb Q(\alpha)$ such that $N_{\Bbb Q(\alpha)/\Bbb Q}(x) > 0$ and $I = xJ$ . (This is not in general the relation defining the narrow class group.) I think I have found a counterexample to the claim above, either that or I cannot find the error in my argument.

If $\alpha = i$ and $f = X^2+1$ , the norm of elements in $\Bbb Q(i)$ is always non-negative and $\Bbb Z[i]$ is the maximal order of $\Bbb Q(i)$ . Thus, if the claim were true, $SL_2 \Bbb Z$ -conjugacy classes of integer matrices satisfying $A^2 = -I$ should be in correspondence with $Cl(\Bbb Z[i]) = 0$ . In other words, every two such matrices should be $SL_2 \Bbb Z$ -conjugate. However, if we put $A = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\ -1 & 0\end{pmatrix}, B = \begin{pmatrix}0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}$ any matrix $C = \begin{pmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{pmatrix}$ such that $CA = BC$ must satisfy $a=-d, b = c$ and so $$\det(C) = -(a^2+b^2) \le 0.$$ Now the more general situation: suppose for simplicity that $O := \Bbb Z[\alpha]$ is the maximal order of $K:= \Bbb Q(\alpha)$ . Put $PN(K)$ for the elements of positive norm of $K$ and $PN(O) = PN(K) \cap O$ . Let $NCl(O)$ be the narrow class group in the aforementioned sense and $Cl(O)$ the usual class group. There is an exact sequence $$0 \to O^\times/PN(O) \hookrightarrow K^\times/PN(K) \to NCl(O) \to Cl(O) \to 0,$$ this follows from a similar argument that yields an exact sequence comparing $Cl(O)$ and the usual narrow class group (e.g. as noted here ). Now, $PN(K) = \ker(K^\times \xrightarrow{N} \Bbb Q^\times \xrightarrow{\mathrm{sgn}} \{-1,1\})$ , hence $K^\times/PN(K)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $G_2 = \{-1,1\}$ , it will be non-trivial only if there exists an element of negative norm. Likewise $O^\times/PN(O)$ will be either $G_2$ or $1$ depending on the existence of a norm $-1$ integral unit. In particular, $NCl(O) = Cl(O)$ if and only if one of the following holds: there exists $x \in O^\times$ of norm $-1$ . every element in $K^\times$ has positive norm. If the claim of Remark 2.7 were true, then these conditions should characterize when the $SL_n \Bbb Z$ conjugation classes coincide with the $GL_n \Bbb Z$ ones. However, I think the conjugation classes coincide only when (1) holds (hence the counterexample for $\Bbb Q(i)$ ). The relevant direction (for the counterexample) argument is roughly as follows: If $GL_n \Bbb Z$ and $SL_n \Bbb Z$ conjugacy classes coincide for a given matrix $A$ , then $A$ and $DAD^{-1}$ for some matrix such that $\det D= -1$ are $SL_n \Bbb Z$ conjugate. Thus $A = (UD)A(UD)^{-1}$ for some $U$ such that $\det U = 1$ . Hence $A$ commutes with a determinant $-1$ matrix. Now suppose that there exists $A\in M_f$ such that its $GL_n \Bbb Z$ and $SL_n \Bbb Z$ conjugacy classes coincide. By the Latimer-MacDufee theorem,there exists $I$ a fractional ideal and $B$ a $\Bbb Z$ -basis of $I$ such that $A$ is $GL_n \Bbb Z$ conjugate to $X := [L_\alpha \colon I \to I]_B$ . By hypothesis $X$ and $A$ are $SL_n \Bbb Z$ conjugate. Thus the $SL_n \Bbb Z$ and $GL_n \Bbb Z$ conjugacy clases of $X$ also coincide since $$(SL_n \Bbb Z) \cdot X = (SL_n \Bbb Z) \cdot A = (GL_n \Bbb Z) \cdot A = (GL_n \Bbb Z) \cdot X.$$ Thus it must exist $D$ such that $\det D = -1$ commuting with $X$ . In basis $B$ , this defines an $O$ -linear iso $I \to I$ , which must me multiplication by some $x \in K^\times$ . In particular $-1 = \det D$ is the norm of $x$ . Since $xI = I$ , multiplying by $I^{-1}$ it follows that $x \in O^\times$ . I would very much appreciate a sanity check on whether my reasoning is correct and, if so, any comments on how one could compute the $SL_n  \Bbb Z$ conjugacy classes in terms of ideal classes.","['matrices', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'solution-verification']"

I know this is a lot longer than what it is necessary to be, but I want everything in the proof to be crystal clear to me. I also bolded the part that I am unsure about: Let $(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ be the measure space. Suppose $f_n \xrightarrow{a.u.} f$ . That is, for all $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists $E_\epsilon \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $\mu(E_\epsilon) < \epsilon$ and $$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sup_{x \in X - E_\epsilon}|f_n(x) - f(x)| = 0.
$$ We wish to show for all $c > 0$ that $$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(\{ x \in X: |f_n(x) - f(x)| \geq c \}) = 0.
$$ To this end, for all $c > 0$ and $n \in \mathbf{N}$ , we define $A_c^n = \{ x \in X: |f_n(x) - f(x)| \geq c \}$ . Then for all $c > 0$ and $\epsilon > 0$ , we must have $A_c^n \cap (X - E_\epsilon) = \emptyset$ for $n$ large enough.
To see this, let $\epsilon > 0$ . Then we must have some $E_\epsilon \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $\mu(E_\epsilon) < \epsilon$ and $$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sup_{x \in X - E_\epsilon} |f_n(x) - f(x)| = 0.
$$ Therefore, for all $a > 0$ , there exists $N(a, \epsilon) \in \mathbf{N}$ such that if $n \geq N(a, \epsilon)$ , then $$
\sup_{x \in X - E_\epsilon} |f_n(x) - f(x)| < a.
$$ Thus we must have if $n \geq N(a, \epsilon)$ , then for all $x \in X - E_\epsilon$ that $$
|f_n(x) - f(x)| \leq \sup_{x \in X - E_\epsilon} |f_n(x) - f(x)| < a.

In particular, this implies for all $\epsilon > 0$ and $c > 0$ , there exists $N(c, \epsilon) \in \mathbf{N}$ such that if $n \geq N(c, \epsilon)$ , then $A_c^n \subseteq E_\epsilon$ . Therefore, we have for all $\epsilon > 0$ and $c > 0$ , there exists $N(\epsilon, c) \in \mathbf{N}$ such that if $n \geq N(\epsilon, c)$ , then $$
\mu(A_c^n) \leq \mu(E_\epsilon) < \epsilon.
$$ Thus, we have for all $c > 0$ and $\epsilon > 0$ that $$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(A_c^n) \leq \epsilon.
$$ Thus we have for all $c > 0$ that $$
0 \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(A_c^n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(\{ x \in X: |f_n(x) - f(x)| \geq c \}) \leq 0.
$$ In particular, we must have for all $c > 0$ that $$

(a) Assuming that $f$ is never $0$ , use Problem 20(b) to prove that $|f(x)|=le^{cx}$ for some number $l>0$ . It follows that $f(x)=ke^{cx}$ for some $k$ . (b) Show that this result holds without the added assumption that $f$ is never $0$ . Hint: show that $f$ can't be $0$ at the endpoint of an
open interval on which it is nowhere $0$ . I am interested specifically in the solution to part $(b)$ . A question about this problem has been asked before . However, I am not fully satisfied with the accepted answer where it pertains to item $(b)$ . Though I understand the reasoning in that answer, I felt that the final part was left a bit vague we can continue the same argument by replacing $a$ with $(a+p)$ (or $(a-p)$ ) and thereby extend the region where $f$ does not vanish.
Using the same argument repeatedly we can show that $f$ does not
vanish at any point in $I$ . How exactly do we use the same argument repeatedly (ie, I would like to see what that looks like formally)? I think I reached a similar point in my own attempt at a proof, and that is why I am asking this question. Here is my attempt Our only assumption is that $$f'=cf\tag{1}$$ on some interval. Let $[a,b]$ be the interval. $(1)$ implies that $f$ is differentiable
and hence continuous on $[a,b]$ . First, there is a trivial case: $f(x)=0=0\cdot e^{cx}$ . Now let's consider the case where $f\neq 0$ at some point $x_1$ .
Suppose $f(x_1)>0$ . Then, by continuity, there is an interval $(m,n)$ around $x_1$ such that $f(x)>0$ for $x\in (m,n)$ . By part $(a)$ , $f(x)=ke^{cx}$ for $k>0$ on $(m,n)$ . Suppose $f(n)\leq0$ . But $\lim\limits_{x\to n^-} ke^{cx}=ke^{cn}>0\neq f(n)$ . Thus $f$ is
discontinuous at $n$ , which contradicts our assumptions. Therefore, $f(n)>0$ . Analogously, we can show that $f(m)>0$ . So, if the above is correct (is it?), I am at a similar point to the linked answer. I need to extend my argument such that $m$ and $n$ move outwards to encompass all of $[a,b]$ . How do I finish this proof? Edit: I had forgotten to check the solution manual, but I just did and it is also kind of terse. It uses the same argument I used above, but leaves the part I am asking about as a hint. It says On an interval where $f$ is non-zero it has the form $f(x)=ke^{cx}$ .
But this can't approach $0$ at the endpoint of the interval; so $f$ couldn't be $0$ at the endpoints. This proves that if $f$ is non-zero
at one point $x_0$ , then it is nowhere $0$ (consider $\sup\{x>x_0:f(x)\neq 0\}$ and $\inf\{x<x_0:f(x)\neq 0\}$","['logarithms', 'calculus', 'solution-verification', 'derivatives', 'exponential-function']"

What is the probability of getting the sum of numbers appearing on top of all the dice as 35? If we calculate manually, I think it's pretty tedious with no calculators allowed. So, I thought of approximating the answer. We know that rolling $10$ dice, has total number of ways as $6^{10}$ which is ~ $ 1e7$ which makes it ideal for using a normal distribution. So, mean of $10$ throws is $35$ and SD of 10 throws is ~ $ 5.4$ and so $Z = \dfrac{(X-35)}{5.4}$ and so we want $P(\leq35) - P(\leq34)$ as my answer, $P(\leq35) = 1/2$ and the other one can be obtained from the Normal graph and hence, we have the answer.

My attempt Up to this point in the book, a set can be constructed only by applying one of the following Axioms: Specification, Pairing, Union, Powers. Therefore it seems clear to me that given the set $X$ and the equivalence relation $R$ in it, we first construct the power-set $\mathcal{P}(X)$ by applying the Axiom of Powers, then we extract $X/R$ by applying the Axiom of Specification in the following manner: $$ X/R = \{Y\in\mathcal{P}(X)-\{\emptyset\}: [\exists x \in X:(\forall y \in Y, (x, y) \in R)]\}$$ in which we have an embedding set (namely $\mathcal{P}(X)-{\emptyset}$ ) and the specifying condition contains $Y$ as a ""free variable"" (it appears at least once without being preceded by a quantifier). Edit As pointed out in the comments, the above specification is not right. Therefore I changed it into: $$ A = \{Y\in\mathcal{P}(X): [\exists x \in X:(y \in Y \iff (x,y) \in R)]\}$$ Now, we need to show that $A = X/R$ . In order to do so, we shall prove that if $Y \in A$ and $x \in Y$ , then $Y = x/R$ (that is, $Y$ is the equivalence class of $x \in X$ modulo $R$ ). In fact, suppose $y \in Y$ , then $(x, y) \in R$ , hence $y \in x/R$ and, viceversa, suppose $y \in x/R$ , then $(x, y) \in R$ , hence $y \in Y$ . Since from this it is clear that $A \subseteq X/R$ , it suffices to show that if $Y \in X/R$ , then $Y \in A$ . In fact, $Y \in X/R$ implies that $Y$ is the equivalence class of some $x \in X$ modulo $R$ , hence there exists $x \in X$ such that $x \in Y$ (by the Reflexivity of $R$ ) and such that $Y$ contains exactly the elements to which $x$ stands in relation. Therefore, $Y \in A$ . Thus, the proof is concluded.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-writing', 'solution-verification', 'set-theory']"

F_{t}(x, y)=F_{s, x}(s+t, y), \quad t>0 .
$$ Since $F_{s, x}(s+t, y)$ does not depend on $s, \frac{d}{d s} F_{s, x}(s+t, y)=0$ . This implies the second equality below: $$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} F_{t}\left(x, y_{0}\right)=\frac{\partial}{\partial(s+t)} F_{s, x}\left(s+t, y_{0}\right)=\left.\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial s} F_{s, x}\left(u, y_{0}\right)\right)\right|_{u=s+t} .

I don't know how to attack the problems, for example if $M$ were an orientable manifold of genus $3$ then it can be thought of as a $3-$ torus then using Schwartz's theorem comes to mind: Let $M$ be a two-dimensional differentiable manifold of class $C^2$ compact and connected. Let $\varphi: \mathbb R \times M \to M$ be a flow of class $C^2$ in $M$ .

4502734,An example which disproves $\|p(T)\|_{op} = \|p\|_\sup$ in arbitrary Banach spaces (Gelfand theory).,"Let me go straight to the question and then write some discussion about it. Question: Does there exist a Banach space $X$ , an operator $T:X\rightarrow X$ with operator norm $\|T\|_{op}\leq 1$ and a sequence of polynomials $p_n:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ so that $\sup_{x\in D} |p_n(x)|\rightarrow 0$ as $n$ goes to infinity, where $D$ is the unit dist, but $\|p_n(T)\|_{op}=1$ (or any constant greater than zero that is independent on $n$ )? Equivalently, the map $p\mapsto p(T)$ from $(\mathrm{Poly}(D),\|\cdot\|_\infty)$ to $(\mathcal{L}(X),\|\cdot\|_{op})$ is not continuous. Two notes: (1) It is not likely, but it could be that there are no such examples, in that case a proof or reference would be nice :-) (2) It is much appreciated if you can provide an example in the case where $X=L^p(\Omega)$ for every $p>2$ , where $\Omega$ is some measured space (say $\Omega=[0,1]$ ). Discussion:
I do know that there is no counterexample in the case where $X$ is a Hilbert space (edit: and $T$ is normal), but that result requires the use of Gelfand theory, which is not valid for arbitrary Banach spaces (because we do not have natural $C^\star$ algebras). Let $H$ be a Hilbert space and $T:H\rightarrow H$ be a continuous operator. For a polynomial $p(x) = \sum_n a_n x^n$ we can define a new operator $p(T) = \sum_n a_n\cdot T^n$ on $H$ . A well known, seemingly trivial, but extremely deep result in functional analysis is the fact that the operator norm of $p(T)$ is exactly the supremum of $p$ on the spectrum of $T$ . The main key point in the proof is the fact that for an operator $T$ , if $\sigma(T)$ is the spectrum of $T$ then $$\|T\|_{op} = \max \sigma(T).$$ This combined with the fact that $\sigma(p(T))=p(\sigma(T))$ gives the assertion above immediately. (The equality, $\|T\|_{op} = \max \sigma(T)$ , does not seem to be true for arbitrary Banach spaces, at least I fail to incorporate the original proof, because Gelfand theory is not valid.) Now, if we assume that $\|T\|_{op}\leq 1$ , we can already deduce that $\sigma(T)\subseteq D$ . Therefore, if $p_n$ are polynomials so that $\|p_n\|_{\infty,D}\rightarrow 0$ , then $\|p_n(T)\|_{op}\leq \|p_n\|_{\infty,D}\rightarrow 0$ . This proves that if $X$ is an Hilbert space then there is no example of the form I am looking for. I suspect that this is not true for arbitrary Banach spaces. A concrete example will help me greatly.","['operator-algebras', 'operator-theory', 'lp-spaces', 'gelfand-representation', 'functional-analysis']"
4502740,Fundamental group of the boundary of a torus with a point removed,"The question below is from an old topology qualifying exam. I am mostly stuck on parts (c) and (d). Let $X$ be a 2-dimensional torus $T^2$ with the interior of a small disk $D \subset T^2$ removed (this space is also called a handle). (a) Prove that $X$ is homotopically equivalent to a bouquet of two circles $S^1 \vee S^1$ . To do this, it’s convenient to represent $T^2$ as a unit square with the opposite sides
identified. I am fine with part (a) - I understand that if you puncture the torus, it deformation retracts to $S^1 \vee S^1$ . (b) Compute the fundamental group $\pi_1(X)$ of $X$ and present its generators explicitly
as loops in $X$ . And for part (b), I can use Van Kampen on $S^1 \vee S^1$ - however, I'm confused by the wording, and wonder if $\pi_1(X) = \langle a\rangle * \langle b\rangle$ is the correct answer. (c) Explicitly express the class of $\partial X = \partial D$ in $\pi_1(X)$ in terms of the generators from part (b). I tried to find the boundary in $\mathbb{R}^2$ using the definition: $$ \partial A = \overline{A} \cap \overline{(\mathbb{R}^2 - A)}$$ and the identification of $X$ as a square with a disc removed from part (a). I found that $\overline{T^2 - D}$ is $T^2 - D$ plus the boundary of $D$ (the picture on the left), and $\overline{(\mathbb{R}^2 - A)}$ is everything outside the square (including the boundary)[picture on the right]. So if I intersect them, I get that the boundary would be a circle inside a square (where both are not filled in)[the bottom picture]. Am I thinking of that correctly? I have no idea what the fundamental group of this would be (I can only guess it's $S^1 \vee S^1$ plus the circle on its own, which doesn't make sense to me. And by class, does that mean all the elements of the fundamental group, $\pi_1(X)$ , that are along the boundary of $X$ ? (d) Prove that $\partial X$ is not a retract of $X$ . Hint: What is $\pi_1(\partial X)$ ? Visually, it makes sense that the boundary can't retract to $X$ if I'm thinking of $\partial X$ correctly. I think for this part the best thing would be to find $\pi_1(X)$ , but I can't without part (c). I apologize for the atrocious pictures.

In association football, three points are awarded to the team winning a match, with no points awarded to the losing team. If the game is drawn, each team receives one point. Firstly, I worked with points percentage — points divided by available points, which I set to the number of matches multiplied by adjusted 3-pointer. The general form was: $${\rm points}\,{\rm percentage}= \frac{{\rm goals}\,{\rm scored}^{\mathcal{A}}}{{\rm goals}\,{\rm scored}^{\mathcal{A}}+ {\rm goals}\,{\rm allowed}^{\mathcal{B}}}$$ The league tables' total points percentage is almost sure not an integer . This is Pythagorean expectation (only for wins/losses, not for draws) with two forced different exponents! Football presents a Pythagorean challenge because about a quarter of its matches end in draws (*related to trimean ? no .), worth one point each in the league tables. Because wins are worth three points, the most accurate Pythagorean analyses overestimate most teams’ points totals, as football analyst Howard Hamilton has found . I call adjusted 3-pointer instead of three because how many average points each team receives are not same. I want to achieve 'reasonable' relationship among adjusted 3-pointer (not parameter, but formula like Pythagenport , Pythagenpat ), goals scored and goals allowed for each team: $${\rm points}_{predicted}= {\rm points}\,{\rm percentage}\cdot{\rm adjusted}\,3{\rm -pointer}$$ If you treat adjusted 3-pointer as parameter : Here is the win estimator (Python Code) # 17 Th12 '12

 \langle T^*v, u_0 \rangle_2 = \langle v, Tu_0\rangle_{L^2(0,1)}
\end{align*} Since $T$ is defined in an implicit way through the given differential equation, I assumed that $T^*$ has to be definite in a similar way through another ODE. I tried the following: \begin{align*}
\langle T^*v, u_0 \rangle_2 = \langle v, Tu_0\rangle_{L^2(0,1)} = \int_0^1 v(t) \cdot Tu_0(t) dt = \int_0^1 v(t) \cdot u(t) dt 
\end{align*} Then I tried to use integration by parts but that didn't seem to help since there are no derivatives in the integral. Can someone give me a hint? Edit: I am looking for a representation of $T^*$ that derives from the solution of the corresponding adjoint problem. So I tried to derive equations that have to be satisfied by $v$ . Unfortunately, I wasn't very successful so far. Thanks in advance:)","['adjoint-operators', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
4502967,$x^{10}+x^{11}+\dots+x^{20}$ divided by $x^3+x$. Remainder?,"Question: If $x^{10}+x^{11}+\dots+x^{20}$ is divided by $x^3+x$ , then what is the remainder? Options: (A) $x\qquad\quad$ (B) $-x\qquad\quad$ (C) $x^2\qquad\quad$ (D) $-x^2$ In these types of questions generally I follow the following approach: Since divisor is cubic so the remainder must be a constant/linear/quadratic expression. $\Rightarrow F(x)=(x^3+x)Q(x)+ax^2+bx+c$ For $x=0$ , we get $c=0$ But since $x^3+x$ has no other roots so I can't find $a$ and $b$ .
Please help. Answer: Option (B)","['contest-math', 'roots', 'calculus', 'polynomials', 'algebra-precalculus']"

4502996,Approximating the roots of $\sum_{k=1}^n{\sin{\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)}}$ for large $n$ and large $x$.,"Here is the graph of $\sum_{k=1}^{n}{\sin{\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)}}$ for $n=1000$ .

4503017,What are the possible values of $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \prod_{i=1}^n (1+ y_i^{\frac 1n}/n)$?,"For any sequence $(y_i)_{i=1}^\infty$ of positive real numbers, let $(X_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be another sequence defined by $$X_n = \prod_{i=1}^n \left(1+\frac{y_i^{\frac{1}{n}}}{n}\right).$$ It is clear that $X_n >1$ for all $n$ . Question: For any $c\ge 1$ , can one find a sequence $(y_i)$ of positive real numbers such that $\left(X_n\right)$ converges to $c$ as $n\to \infty$ ? In an answer to a previous question , it is shown that if $y_i, y_i^{-1}$ grows slower than polynomials, then the limit of $(X_n)$ is always $e$ . There are also simple examples $\left(y_i = \left(i^2\right)^i\right)$ which shows that $(X_n)$ might be unbounded. Some remarks: One can find $(y_i)$ such that $(X_n)$ is bounded, but has no limit (this can be done by choosing $y_i$ to be $1$ most of the time, and a huge number once in a while), Changing finitely many members of $(y_i)$ do not alter the limit of $(X_n)$ . Think of $(y_i)$ as a function $y: \mathbb N \to (0,\infty)$ . Then $f_n : \mathbb N \to (0,\infty)$ defined by $f_n(i) = y_i^{1/n}$ is a sequence of functions which converges pointwisely to the constant function $1$ . If the convergence is uniform, then limit of $(X_n)$ exists, but again the limit is $e$ .","['limits', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"
4503051,A property of the convergents of the continued fraction expansion of a rational number,"I'm looking for a proof of the following result (theorem 6.14 of the book Cryptography. Theory and practice by Paterson and Stinson): Theorem 6.14 Suppose that $\text{gcd}(a,b) = \text{gcd}(c,d) = 1$ and: $$\Bigl\rvert \frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{d}\Bigr\rvert < \frac{1}{2d^2}$$ Then $c/d$ is one of the convergents of the continued fraction expansion of $a/b$ . I already know the analogous result for irrational numbers (theorem 7.14 of the book An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers by Niven, Zuckerman and Montgomery with a slight change of notations to avoid ambiguities): Theorem 7.14 Let $\xi$ denote any irrational number. If there is a rational number $c/d$ with $d \geq 1$ such that: $$\Bigl\rvert \xi - \frac{c}{d} \Bigr\rvert < \frac{1}{2d^2}$$ Then $c/d$ equals one of the convergents of the continued fraction expansion of $\xi$ . However, it seems to me that the proof of theorem 7.14 cannot immediately be generalized to the case of rational numbers: one calls $h_j/k_j$ the $j$ -th convergent of the simple continued fraction expansion of $\xi$ and then one uses the fact that $\lim k_j = +\infty$ to pick an integer $n$ such that $k_n \leq b < k_{n+1}$ . This cannot be done in the case of rational numbers (theorem 6.14) simply because the convergents of the continued fraction expansion of $a/b$ are finite: it might be the case that the convergents of $a/b$ are $h_0/k_0,h_1/k_1,\dots,h_m/k_m = a/b$ and that $b \leq d$ . So, how exactly is theorem 6.14 established?","['number-theory', 'cryptography', 'continued-fractions', 'inequality', 'rational-numbers']"

A coin is selected randomly and flipped. a) what is the probability of selecting a fair coin? b) what is the probability of head from the flipped coin? c) what is the probability of selecting a fair coin and having head on the top? So A and B are relatively simple, because A is $1/2$ and for B its $3/4$ but I am concerned with C Shouldn't be the chance of having a fair coin $+$ head
is basically $1/4$ ? Correct me if I am wrong but If I want to pick a fair coin, the probability is $0.5$ , lets say we picked it, and now we are going to throw it, isn't also chance between head and tail is $0.5$ ?
Which effectively means that getting a head from a fair coin the intersection between them is $0.5\times0.5$ which equals $0.25$ ?","['probability-theory', 'probability']"
