494970,What is a function that is equidistant from two functions?,"For example, let $f(x)$ be $x^2$ and $g(x)$ be $x^3 + 1$.

Then, what is a general form of a fucntion $h(x)$ that has the same distance between both of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ ? *If it is hard to define $h(x)$ over all range of $x$, limiting a range of $x$ is possible.","['functions', 'euclidean-geometry']"
495017,Interesting but difficult board game question?,"I have a 3 by 3 board game. A black marble is randomly place in one of the nine squares. Distance between squares is measured as one if either diagonal or horizontal/vertically next each other, and two otherwise (so max distance of two). With an initial black marble, all squares within distance one of this black marble contains a blue one. The rest of the squares are then filled with a red marble. All 9 squares are covered. How many minimum cups (and which ones) do I need to look at in order to figure out where black marble is? \begin{array}{ccc}
a & b & c \\
d & e & f \\
g & h & i \end{array} So my thinking is that the center one will be blue with probability $8/9$ and black with probability $1/9$. If the black marble is one the corners (probability $4/9$), then $e$ must be blue and two of $b, d, f, h$ must be blue. This seems to be a lot of case work, but I get that the minimum is 4? Has to be symmetric?","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

495053,St. Petersburg Paradox,"A fair coin will be tossed until a heads results. You will then be paid $2^{n-1}$ dollars where $n$ equals the number of flips. Now why is the expected pay out infinite?  $$ \sum_{n \geq 1} (\frac{1}{2^n})2^{n-1} = \sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{2^{n-1}}{2^n}  $$ Why does this give the payout? The payout shouldn't be infinite, it should be a potential infinity.   For example, if I flip the coin once and it is a tails, then I will receive two dollars for certain. On the second flip there is a $25$ percent chance that I will receive a minimum of $4$ dollars. but a $75$ percent chance that I will receive only two dollars. And so on as the chances of receiving more money decreases and eventually approaches $0$. Why then is it suggested that an investor pay any amount of money for such an opportunity? Source : A Brief History of the Paradox, Philosophy and Labyrinths of the Mind Obviously this appears false by intuition, but I'd like to know the argument for the paradox; why one would pay a trillion dollars to enter such a game. The argument just seems far too fallacious to me. How many times would one have to play? After almost twenty thousand plays, we are still making less than 8 dollars. IF every twenty thousand plays we increased our winnings by 8 dollars, we would have to play hundreds of billions of times just to start to have an average earnings equal to one trillion... we'd run out of time in the universe it seems...

Why do they occur at all?","['intuition', 'probability', 'paradoxes']"
495065,Extending integrals from continuous functions to bounded Borel functions,"Let $X$ be a compact, Hausdorff space. Let $B(X)$ be the Banach space of bounded, Borel-measurable, complex-valued functions on $X$ under the uniform norm. Let $C(X) \subset B(X)$ be the closed subspace of continuous, complex-valued functions. By the Riesz representation theorem, we have an isomorphism $M(X) \cong C(X)^*$ where $M(X)$ denotes the (finite) regular, complex Borel measures on $X$ under the total variation norm. The isomorphism sends $\mu \in M(X)$ to integration against $\mu$. By the Hahn-Banach theorem, the element of $C(X)^*$ corresponding to $\mu \in M(X)$ extends to an element of $B(X)^*$ with the same norm. In fact, since the functions in $B(X)$ can also be integrated against $\mu$, we have a rather canonical choice of extension. It is not difficult to see that $f \mapsto \int_X f \ d\mu$ is in $B(X)^*$ and has the same norm as its restriction to $C(X)$. Question: Is it true that every functional in $C(X)^*$ has a unique norm-preserving extension to $B(X)^*$ (given by integration against the corresponding measure)? Or, if not, what sort of functional analysis-type statements can be made in order to single out this extension which is obviously the preferred one from a measure theory standpoint?","['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

495111,Existence for linear wave equation using energy inequality.,"I'm reading through Sogge's Lectures on Nonlinear Wave Equations and am confused by the proof of existence for the linear inhomogeneous problem. Sorry for the long setup. (Theorem) Let $s \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then for every $f \in H^{s+1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, $g \in H^s(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $F \in L^1([0,T];H^s(\mathbb{R}^n))$ there is a unique
$$
u \in C([0,T];H^{s+1}) \cap C^1([0,T];H^s)
$$
solving
$$
\begin{cases}
Lu=F, &0 < t <T \\
u_{t=0}=f, \partial_tu_{t=0}=g
\end{cases}
$$
where
$$
L=\sum_{j,k=0}^n g^{jk}(t,x)\partial_j\partial_k u + \sum_{j=0}^n b^j(t,x)\partial_j u + a(t,x)u
$$
has $C^\infty$ coefficients with uniform bounds on each derivative. Here $g^{jk}$ is symmetric and close to the d'Alembertian in the sense:
$$
\sum |g^{jk}(t,x)-g_0^{jk}| < \frac12
$$
where $g_0^{jk}=\text{diag}(1,-1,\dots,-1)$ are the coefficients of $\square$. The proof makes use of the following energy-type inequality:
$$
\sum_{|\alpha|\leq1} \|\partial^\alpha u(t,\cdot)\|_{H^s}
 \leq C_{s,T}\left( \sum_{|\alpha|\leq1} \|\partial^\alpha u(0,\cdot)\|_{H^s} + \int_0^t \|Lu(\tau,\cdot)\|_{H^s} \; d\tau\right). \tag{1}
$$ The relevant text: Proceed assuming $f=g=0$. If $\psi \in C_0^\infty((-\infty,T)\times\mathbb{R}^n)$ then applying the above energy inequality to $L^*$, with $t$ replaced by $T-t$, yields
$$
\|\psi(t,\cdot)\|_{H^{-s}} \leq C\int_0^T\|L^*\psi(\tau,\cdot)\|_{H^{-s-1}} \; d\tau. \tag{2}
$$
Hence, since $H^s$ and $H^{-s}$ are dual spaces, for fixed $F \in L^1([0,T];H^s)$ we have
$$
|\langle F,\psi \rangle|
  = \left|\int_0^T \langle F(t,\cdot),\psi(t,\cdot)\rangle \; dt\right|
  \leq C' \int_0^T \|L^*\psi(t,\cdot)\|_{H^{-s-1}} \; dt. \tag{3}
$$
So, by the Hahn-Banach Theorem, there is a $u \in L^{\infty}([0,T];H^{s+1})$ satisfying $u=0$ when $t<0$ and, moreover,
$$
\langle F,\psi \rangle = \langle u,L^*\psi \rangle,
 \qquad \forall \psi \in C_0^{\infty}((-\infty,T)\times\mathbb{R}^n).
$$
Consequently, $Lu=F$ in $(0,T)\times\mathbb{R}^n$ in the sense of distributions. Questions: When applying the energy inequality (1), how does $L^*\psi$ end up in the $H^{-s-1}$ norm in (2)? How exactly is the Hahn-Banach Theorem applied? The linear functional $\langle F, \cdot \rangle$ is bounded by the sublinear function on the right hand side of (3) for all $\psi \in C_0^\infty((-\infty,T)\times\mathbb{R}^n)$.

It now seems to me that not only is it undefined, but so is $0^1$. What mistake, if any, am I making here? (Yes, I know, you can simply define values for both and hope no contradictions arise, but I don't find such an approach to be very satisfying.) In the natural numbers, exponents greater than 1 are naturally defined as follows: $x^2=xx$ $x^3=xxx=x^2x$ $x^4=xxxx=x^3x$ $x^5=xxxxx=x^4x$ and so on. Therefore $x^{n+1}=x^nx$ for $n\gt 1$. What about $x^0$ and $x^1$? Suppose $x^1x=x^2$. Then $x^1=x^2/x = x$ for $x\ne 0$. Suppose $x^0x=x^1$. Then $x^0=x^1/x = 1$ for $x\ne 0$. Thus $x^0$ and $x^1$ are both undefined for $x\ne 0$.

495159,Different Ways of Integrating $3\sin x\cos x$,"I am asking this question for my son who is in (equivalent) twelfth
grade and I failed to answer his query. When he tries to integrate $3\sin x\cos x$, he finds that
this can be done in at least following three ways.
And these three ways do not produce equivalent results. ONE Let us assume, $\sin x = z$. This gives,
\begin{align*}
  \cos x &= \frac{dz}{dx}\\
  \cos x dx &= dz
\end{align*} So, we can write, \begin{align*}
  \int 3\sin x\cos x dx  &=3 \int zdz\\
  &=3 \frac{z^2}{2}\\
  &=\frac{3}{2} \sin^2 x\\
  &=\frac{3}{4}\times 2\sin^2 x\\
  &=\frac{3}{4} (1 -\cos 2x)\\
\end{align*} TWO Let us assume, $\cos x = z$. This gives,
\begin{align*}
  -\sin x &= \frac{dz}{dx}\\
  \sin x dx &= -dz
\end{align*} So, we can write, \begin{align*}
  \int 3\sin x\cos x dx  &=-3 \int zdz\\
  &=-3 \frac{z^2}{2}\\
  &=-\frac{3}{2} \cos^2 x\\
  &=-\frac{3}{4}\times 2\cos^2 x\\
  &=-\frac{3}{4} (1 +\cos 2x)\\
\end{align*} THREE \begin{align*}
  \int 3\sin x\cos x dx  &=\frac{3}{2}\int 2\sin x\cos x dx\\
  &=\frac{3}{2}\int \sin 2x dx\\
  &=-\frac{3}{2}\times\frac{1}{2} \cos 2x\\
  &=-\frac{3}{4} \cos 2x\\
\end{align*} The results found in above three methods are not the same. If we try a simple approach of evaluating the integration results at, $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$, we get as follows. From the first one, $\frac{3}{4} (1 -\cos 2x) = \frac{3}{4} (1 -\cos \frac{2\pi}{6})
= \frac{3}{4} (1 -\cos \frac{\pi}{3})
= \frac{3}{4} (1 - \frac{1}{2})
= \frac{3}{4}\times\frac{1}{2}
= \frac{3}{8}$ From the second one, $-\frac{3}{4} (1 +\cos 2x) = -\frac{3}{4} (1 +\cos \frac{2\pi}{6})
= -\frac{3}{4} (1 +\cos \frac{\pi}{3})
= -\frac{3}{4} (1 + \frac{1}{2})
= -\frac{3}{4}\times\frac{3}{2}
= -\frac{9}{8}$ From the third one, $-\frac{3}{4} \cos 2x=-\frac{3}{4} \cos \frac{2\pi}{6}
= -\frac{3}{4} \cos \frac{\pi}{3}
= -\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{2}
= -\frac{3}{8} $ Clearly, we are getting some nonequivalent results. We have failed to find
the mistakes or explanations behind this. Your help will be appreciated.","['calculus', 'integration']"

  is well-defined and an isometric isomorphism. Updated my answer: The functional $$ x \mapsto \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_{n}y_{n} $$ is bounded, since \begin{align*}
|\Phi_{x}(y)| &= \left|\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_{n}y_{n} \right|\leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |x_{n}y_{n}| = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |x_{n}||y_{n}| \\
 &\leq \|y\|_{\infty}\|x\|_{1}.
\end{align*} Because the functional is bounded by $\|x\|_{\infty}$, the mapping $$ \Phi: \ell^{1}\rightarrow \mathcal{L}(c_{0};\mathbb{K}),$$
defined by
$$y\mapsto\left( x \mapsto \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_{n}y_{n} \right)$$ is well-defined. (Question 1. Is this correct?) Note that if $|x_{j}|=\|x\|_{\infty}$ and if we take $y_{j}=e_{j}$, where $e_{j}$ is the $j$-th unit vector, then $|\Phi_{x}(e_{j}) |=1$. Thus $$\|\Phi f\|_{\mathcal{L}(c_{0};\mathbb{K})}=\|f\|_{\ell^{1}} \phantom{x}\mathrm{for}\phantom{x}\mathrm{all}\phantom{x}f\in \ell^{1} .$$ (Question 2. Is this correct or am I on the wrong path, is there are a better way to show this? ) We claim that $\Phi$ is also surjective and hence it is an isometric isomorphism. If $\phi$ is a functional on $c_{0}$ let us denote $\phi(e_{j})$ by $x_{j}$. Then $$\phi_{x}(y) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\phi(e_{n})y_{n}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\phi(y_{n}e_{n})=\phi(y),$$ (the last equality holds because $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}y_{n}e_{n}$ converges to $y$ in $c_{0}$ and $\phi$ is continuous in $c_{0}$) (Question 3. Is this correct and how do I prove my convergence argument?) so $\Phi(x)=\phi$. (Question 4. Struggling the most with this part.

495506,Homotopy invariance in Fulton's book.,"I have a question about a proof in Fulton's Intersection theory.
In the first chapter, he wants to prove that Chow groups are invariant with respect to homotopy, and the usual reductions tell us that's it's tantamount to proving it for $X$ an integral affine scheme, and for the trivial bundle $X\times \mathbb{A}^1$. One can assume that our cycle $[V]$ in $X\times \mathbb{A}^1$ is mapped dominantly to $X$, and that the dimensions of $X$ and $V$ match. In this case, he says that the cycle $V$ is defined by an ideal $I$, that becomes principal after tensoring with $K$, the fraction field of $A$ (with $X= \operatorname{Spec} A$). And then he states that $$\operatorname{div}(f)=[V]-\sum [V_i]$$
where $V_i$ are varieties that are not dominantly mapped to $X$. I don't really seem to grasp that last point. I've tried to work out on a baby example with $X=\mathbb{A}^1$, but in this case everything is trivial, and $\operatorname{div}(f)=[V]$. I have an intuition that it might have to do with the fact that $\operatorname{div}(f)$ is essentially $[f=0]-[f=\infty]$ (this is not ""rigourous"" but i hope you see what i mean), and thus that $[V]=[f=0]$ whence $[f=\infty]=\sum[V_i]$, but i cannot see clearly how it works.

The official proof given used sequences/convergent subsequences and didn't appeal to my intuition. When I saw the problem, my immediate instinct was that an isometry should be ""volume-preserving"" as well, so the volume of $f(X)$ should be equal to the volume of $X$, which should mean surjectivity if $X$ is compact. The notion of ""volume"" I came up with was the minimum number of $\epsilon$-balls needed to cover $X$ for given $\epsilon > 0$. If $f$ were not surjective, then because $f$ is continuous this means there must be a point $y \in X$ and $\delta > 0$ so that the ball $B_\delta(y)$ is disjoint from $f(X)$. I wanted to choose $\epsilon$ in terms of $\delta$ and use the fact that an isometry carries $\epsilon$-balls to $\epsilon$-balls, and show that given a minimum-size cover of $X$ with $\epsilon$ balls, that a cover of $X$ with $\epsilon$-balls could be found with one fewer ball if $f(X) \cap B_\delta(y) = \emptyset$, giving a contradiction.

495848,The family of analytic functions with positive real part is normal,"I'm having difficulty with the following exercise in Ahlfors' text, on page 227. Prove that in any region $\Omega$ the family of analytic functions with positive real part is normal. Under what added condition is it locally bounded? Hint : Consider the functions $e^{-f}$. Here is what I've tried: I will start with a remark: Apparently, Ahlfors wants us to show that the family is ""normal in the classical sense"". That is, every sequence of functions in the family has a subsequence which converges uniformly on compact subsets or tends uniformly to $\infty$ on compact subsets . In order to see why this is the right definition, consider the sequence $f_n(z)=n$. It is contained in the family but has no appropriate subsequence (in the sense of definition 2 in the text with $S=\mathbb C$). Now, to the attempt itself: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb C$ be a fixed region, and consider the family $$\mathfrak F=\{f: \Omega \to \mathbb C | f \text{ is analytic and } \Re(f) >0 \}. $$
We would like to show that $\mathfrak F$ is normal in the classical sense. Following the hint, we examine the family $$ \mathfrak G=\{e^{-f}:f \in \mathfrak F \}.$$ $\mathfrak G$ is locally bounded (since $|e^{-f}|=e^{- \Re (f)}<1$ for every $f \in \mathfrak F$), thus it is normal with respect to $\mathbb C$ (theorem 15), and obviously, it is normal in the classical sense as well. Let $\{ f_n \}$ be a sequence in $\mathfrak F$, and consider the sequence $\{ g_n \}=\{e^{-f_n} \}$ in $\mathfrak G$. According to normality it has a convergent subsequence $\{ g_{n_k} \}=\{e^{-f_{n_k}} \}$ which converges uniformly on compact subsets of $\Omega$ to some function $g$ (which is analytic by Weierstrass' theorem). Since each $\{ g_{n_k} \}$ is nonvanishing, the limit function $g$ is either identically zero, or non vanishing as well (Hurwitz's theorem). In the former case it is easy to show that the subsequence $\{ f_{n_k} \}$, obtained by the same indices, tends to $\infty$ uniformly on compact sets.

One way to get these is from spectral measures on $X$. See IX.1.12 in A Course in Functional Analysis by John B. Conway. I'm not sure whether this is all of them, though. What this all boils down to is a question about the following continuity condition. Let $\pi : B(X) \to B(H)$ be a unital $*$-representation of $B(X)$ on a Hilbert space $H$. Suppose that $E_1,E_2,\ldots$ is a countable pairwise disjoint collection of Borel measurable subsets of $X$. Let $E = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n$.

Deduce that every group of order $p^2$ has a normal subgroup of order $p$. If $G$ is a finite group of order $n$ and $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $|G|$, then any subgroup of index $p$ is normal. Since $p$ is a prime, $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $|G|$, hence every subgroup of index $p$ is normal in $G$. For second one, I can show until that any subgroup $H$ with order $p$ is normal in $G$. But I was not able to come up with one, except for using Sylow's theorem. But this excercise appears before that. Maybe I'll end up proving Sylow's theorem to show the existence of order $p$ subgroup? My very basic solution $\ \ \ $  $^\dagger$Compare to Mariano's fancy congugacy Given $p$ a prime and $G$ is a group of order $p^2$, then every subgroup of index $p$ is normal in $G$. This is equivalent to say that any subgroup of order $p^2/p = p$ is normal in $G$. So now we set out to show that $G$ must have a subgroup with order $p$. Suffice to show that $G$ must have a cyclic subgroup with order $p$. The order of a cyclic group is equal to the order of its generator. Since by Lagrange's Theorem, the order of the subgroup divides the group, we know that the order of cyclic subgroup is either 1, $p$, or $p^2$. Hence, the order of the generator needs to be 1, $p$, or $p^2$ respectively. When the order of generator is 1, iff the generator is identity. We skip this case and show a cyclic subgroup of order $p$ exist when the order of generator is $p$ or $p^2$. If the order of the generator is $p$, we are done. Finally, we check that the order of the generator is $p^2$. However, we know that all order $p^2$ cyclic group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}$. And in this group, $p$ has order $p$. Hence in any group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}$, it has an element with order $p$. Hence every group of order $p^2$ has a normal subgroup of order $p$.","['proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra']"

For $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ we define the parallel curve $\gamma_{\lambda}: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}$ by $\gamma_{\lambda}(t) = \gamma(t) + \lambda N(t)$. Calculate the curvature $\kappa_{\lambda}$ of those curves $\gamma_{\lambda}$ which are regular. Attempt to solution: First, we need to now when $\gamma_{\lambda}$ is regular, i.e., when $\dot{\gamma}_{\lambda} \neq 0$. $\dot{\gamma}_{\lambda}  = \dot{\gamma}(t) + \lambda \dot{N}(t)$, so if $\dot{\gamma}(t) \neq -\lambda\dot{N}(t)$, then $\gamma_{\lambda}$ is regular. Secondly, we need to calculate the curvature, and we have that $\kappa(t) = \langle\dot{T}(s), N(s)\rangle$, if $\{ T(s), N(s) \}$ is the Frenet frame for a curve $\gamma(s)$, if $\gamma$ is parametrized by arclength. However, our curve $\gamma_{\lambda}$ is not parametrized by arclength so I don't think we can use the scalar product directly to calculate the curvature. So I am not sure how to continue.

Thus there are $x_1,\ldots,x_r \in S_1$ such that $S = S_0[x_0,\ldots,x_r]$, hence $S$ is Noetherian. Let $M$ be a finitely generated $S$ - module; necessarily $M$ is Noetherian since $S$ is. I want to show: The natural map $\alpha_d : M_d \to \Gamma(X,\widetilde{M(d)})$ is an isomorphism for sufficiently large $d$. Now I have been trying to get my head around this problem for many days but I don't even have a clear approach. The facts I know are patchy; one fact I do know is that because $S =S_0[x_0,\ldots,x_r]$ with the $x_i$'s in degree $1$, we have that $X= \operatorname{Proj} S$ is covered by finitely many $D_+(x_i)$'s. However even though I know this I can't say why $\alpha_d$ is injective which is very frustrating: If $\alpha_d(m) = 0$, then there are $n_i$'s for which $x_i^{n_i}m = 0$. How can I conclude $m = 0$? My question is: What are some general strategies of attacking problems like this? Edit: Here are some extra thoughts now after the discussion with Martin. Since $M$ is  Noetherian we have a filtration
$$0 = M^0 \subseteq M^1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq M^r = M$$
such that for every $0\leq i\leq r-1$,  we have $M^{i+1}i/M^{i} \cong (S/p_i)(n_i)$ where $p_i's$ some homogeneous prime ideals of $S$. We can then consider the diagram $$\require{AMScd}

  0 @>>> M^i @>>> M^{i+1} @>>> (S/p_i)(n_i) @>>> 0\\

  0 @>>> \Gamma(X,\widetilde{M^{i}}) @>>> \Gamma(X,\widetilde{M^{i+1}}) @>>> \Gamma(X,\widetilde{S/(p_i)}(n_i)).

Suppose we know for all $i$ that there is $d_i$ sufficently large for which $(S/p_i)(n_i)_{d_i} \cong  \Gamma(X,\widetilde{S/(p_i)}(n_i))_{d_i}.$ Then in the inductive step we know that the left vertical map is an isomorphism for some $d_i$ sufficiently large, and the right most vertical map an isomorphism for some $d_{i+1}$ sufficiently large. Taking $e = \operatorname{max}(d_i,d_{i+1})$ and using the Snake lemma shows that the middle map is an isomorphism for $d \geq e$.

496231,Find the constant term in the development of $(2x^2 + \frac{1}{4x})^{99}$,I am struggling with the following problem: Find the constant term in the development of $(2x^2 + \frac{1}{4x})^{99}$ This is a combinatorics problem where I should find what the constant term is when $x^0$. I have made the following developments: $$\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n=99}  \binom {99} {k} 2^{n-k}x^{2(n-k)} \times (\frac{1}{4x})^k = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n=99} \binom {99} {k} 2^{99-k}x^{(198-2k)} \times \frac{1}{2^{2k}x^k}$$ This sum terms could be written together like this: $$\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n=99} \binom {99} {k} \frac{2^{99-k}x^{(198-2k)}}{{2^{2k}x^k}} = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n=99} \binom {99} {k} 2^{99-3k}x^{(198-3k)}$$ This gives me that $x^0$ when $198-3k = 0$ But this is the wrong answer.... My textbook says that the constant term will be when $3k-99 = 0$ which gives that $k = 33$ and $\binom {99} {33} \times 2^{99-198}$ Where did I make a mistake? Thank you!,['combinatorics']
496233,Why is only the first (highest) term of the divisor in polynomial long division used to divide?,"There is one small matter that has always stumped me with polynomial long division. In the example from the Wikipedia on Polynomial long division , why is the equation only divided by the first/highest divisor term? This is the correct way, and it obviously works, but I don't understand why . What about the other terms? I realise that they get involved with the multiplying and subtraction, but can't quite see how it all fits together. Many thanks!","['algebra-precalculus', 'intuition', 'polynomials']"
496254,"If $A\leq B$ or $B\leq A$ for any $A,B\leq G$ then $G$ is a cyclic group","The question is : Suppose $G$ is a $p$ group ($|G|=p^n$)and $A\leq B$ or $B\leq A$ for any $A,B\leq G$ then, Prove that $G$ is cyclic. Suppose $A,B$ are two subgroups of $G$ of same order (say $p^m$ for some $m<n$) As we have $A\leq B$  or $B\leq A$, in any case we can not have $A$ properly contained in $B$ (or the other way). Thus, we should have $A=B$. I mean no two subgroups having same order can be different. Thus, I see any subgroup is normal (As $|gAg^{-1}|=|A|$ for any $g\in G$). Any subgroup is normal... This does not even say that $G$ is abelian :( :(.. Highly disappointed with this... But, as i think this is the only ""considerable conclusion"" i have concluded from given data I think i will include in the question.. I would be thankful if someone can suggest me an approach/ give me a hint to approach the problem.... Thank You EDIT : Just after this Question it is sited that : ""This Statement is also true without the assumption that $G$ is a p-group"" As now, I have understood the proof for p-groups, I would like to work on the general statement.

  since
  $$\int_{\dfrac{j}{n}}^{\dfrac{j+1}{n}}\dfrac{dx}{1+x^2}<\dfrac{1}{1+\left(\dfrac{j}{n}\right)^2}\cdot\dfrac{1}{n}<\int_{\dfrac{j-1}{n}}^{\dfrac{j}{n}}\dfrac{dx}{1+x^2}$$
  so
  $$\int_{\dfrac{1}{n}}^{\dfrac{n^2+1}{n}}\dfrac{dx}{1+x^2}<S_{n}<\int_{0}^{n}\dfrac{dx}{1+x^2}$$ and note $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{\dfrac{1}{n}}^{\dfrac{n^2+1}{n}}\dfrac{dx}{1+x^2}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{0}^{n}\dfrac{dx}{1+x^2}=\int_{0}^{infty}\dfrac{dx}{1+x^2}=\dfrac{\pi}{2}$$

496386,Proof for solar declination angle?,"This geometry occurs in the definition of the angle of solar declination. Planes $X$ and $Y$ intersect along line $AF$. The angle between the two planes is defined as $a_0$ which is equivalently the angle $\angle BAC$. Now the side $AB$ is rotated to a new position denoted by $AD$ by an angle $p$ (or $\varphi$, but $p$ is what's in the image). The new angle $a_1 = \angle DAE$ is a function of $a_0$ and $p$. What is the expression for $a_1$ in terms of $a_0$ and $p$? Note that the angle $p = \angle DAB$, all of which points lie in plane $X$. The triangles $ABC$ and $ADE$ are drawn to show the geometry but are not required to define the problem. This problem occurs between Earth and the Sun as Earth rotates around the Sun. The angle $p$ is $0$ or $180^\circ$ at solstice. The angle $a_0$ is the maximum declination angle of $23.45^\circ$. An approximate answer appears to be $\sin(a_1) = \sin(a_0) \sin(90-p)$. How can this be proven? @Peter gave a rigorous vector based proof. The following is a geometry based proof. Please see if the logic is correct. . The geometry is constructed by choosing vectors AC and AE with unit length. Extended line CE meets AF at point Q. Once the triangles QAB and QBC are constructed as shown, the lengths of remaining sides are established using length/sin rule for a triangle. Observe that the rotation angle ""q"" instead of ""p"" is used to determine the lengths QE and EC. Then using similarity rule for triangles the ration of sides DE:BC is equated to QE:QC. The  trigonometric formula Cos(A-B)=CosA CosB + SinA SinB allows L1/(L1+L2) to be reduced to Cos(q). If the rotation angle ""p"" is referenced instead of ""q"" then the proof is repeated with vectors AB and AD with unit length. In this case the lengths of sides BC and DE becomes tan(a0) and tan(a1) which will results in tan(a1)=tan(a0)*cos(p). Does this make sense? @Peter any comment? Since angle p and q are not identical and they are linked to each other, the results makes sense. 9/20/2013  Simplest Geometry-based Proof: Please refer to the following figure. Objective is to link angles a0 and a1 to the rotation angle either ""p"" or ""q"". The angle between the two planes X&Y is defined as a0. Hence the plane ABC is normal to both planes X and Y. By rotating the plane ABC to a new plane ADE by amount ""p"" (defined by BAD in plane-X) or by amount ""q"" (defined by CAE in plane-Y) the new angle ""a1"" is obtained. Note that the plane BCED is generated by drawing it parallel to line AF while keeping it normal to plane-X. This generates the rectangle BCED. Once BCED is understood to be a rectangle the derivation of the relationship is simple as shown in the figure. In the definition of solar declination angle, plane-X encompasses the orbit of earth around the sun and is referred to as ecliptic plane. Plane-Y is the equatorial plane which is normal to the axis of rotation of the earth. In one year as earth orbits the sun, the angle ""p"" evolves from 0 through 360 degrees at a constant rate of 360/365.25 degrees per day. Note that angle ""p"" is zero when the earth axis is tilted towards the sun on June 21 (solstice) at a maximum of 23.45 degrees (=a0). It is of interest to estimate a1 vs. p as earth orbits the sun. In the solar literature the relation ship sin(a1)=sin(a0)*cos(p) is used where as it should be tan(a1)=tan(a0)*cos(p). The angle ""q"" is approximately same as ""p"" but it will evolve not at constant rate of 360/365.25 degree/day.  Is this observation correct?",['geometry']
