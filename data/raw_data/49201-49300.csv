500515,"How prove that for sufficiently large $n$ the functions $x(t)^{i}y(t)^{j},0\le i,j\le n$ are linearly dependent","An algebraic curve in $\mathbb R^2$ is the locus of zero of a polynomial $f(x,y)$ in two variables. By a polynomial path in $\mathbb R^2$ we mean a parametrized path $x=x(t),y=y(t)$ , where $x(t),y(t)$ are polynomials in $t$ . Show that every polynomial path lies on a real algebraic curve by showing that, for sufficiently large $n$ , the functions $x(t)^{i}y(t)^{j}$ , $0\le i,j\le n$ are linearly dependent.

We have built its right derived functors $R^iF$. I see no reason why $R^iF$ should be left or right exact (of course $R^0F\cong F$ is left exact, but apart from this I see nothing else; or are $R^iF$ necessarily left exact?). My question is: What does it mean, for $F$, to have exact derived functors? What are
  examples of this behavior? I put the ""algebraic geometry"" tag because I have in mind functors like $F=\Gamma=H^0(X,-)$ where $X$ is a scheme, or (more generally) $F=f_\ast$ for $f:X\to Y$ a morphism of schemes.","['category-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'derived-functors']"

500674,Number of surjective functions from A to B,"Am I on the right track? I am not sure about my reasoning... Number of surjective functions from $A$ to $B$ $$A = \{1,2,3,4\} ; B = \{a,b,c\}$$ We must count the surjective functions, meaning the functions for which for all $b \in B$ , $\exists~a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$ , $f$ being one of those functions. In order for a function $f:A\rightarrow B$ to be a surjective function, all 3 elements of $B$ must be mapped. We need to count how many ways we can map those 3 elements. We will subtract the number of functions from $A$ to $B$ which only maps 1 or 2 elements of $B$ to the number of functions from $A$ to $B$ (computed in 4.c : 81). Only 1 element of $B$ is mapped The first $a \in A$ has three choices of $b \in B$ . The others will then only have one. Total functions from $A$ to $B$ mapping to only one element of $B$ : 3. Exactly 2 elements of $B$ are mapped Similarly, there are $2^4$ functions from $A$ to $B$ mapping to 2 or less $b \in B$ . However, these functions include the ones that map to only 1 element of $B$ . So there are $2^4-3 = 13$ functions respecting the property we are looking for.

500700,Neighborhood and upper limit topology homework help,"EDIT: This has been edited so please only take a look at the 2nd question D. I'm not very good with topology but I would like some advice on my homework and also if possible to verify if what I've done is correct. While I'm still very new to topology I would like some advice to help me figure out the correct answer to those I've gotten incorrect. The first question. We let $X=\{1,2,3\}$ and a function $N$ on $X$ given by: $N(1)=\{\{1,2\},\{1,2,3\}\}$ $N(2)=\{\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\}\}$ and $N(3)=\{\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\}\}$ A)
Prove that $N$ does not define a neighborhood topology on $X.$ My answer: Following from the 4th neighborhood axiom, $\{1\}$ is not contained in $\{2,3\}$ therefore $N$ does not define a neighborhood topology on $X.$ B) Add a minimal number of neighborhoods to the above definition $N$ to indeed obtain a neighborhood topology. My answer: I make the following changes to obtain a neighborhood topology: $N(1)=\{\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1,2,3\}\},\ N(2)=\{\{1,2\},\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\}\},\\ 
N(3)=\{\{1,3\},\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\}$ The second question: Consider the upper limit topology: $N(x)=\{N \subseteq \Bbb R\mid \exists a,b\in\Bbb R: x \in (a,b] \subseteq N\}$ A) Prove that $N$ is a neighborhood topology on $\Bbb R$ (real numbers) My answer: I assume this is just where I show the 4 definitions that define a Neighborhood and rewrite it to fit this topology. B) What does a convergence of a sequence in this topology mean? My answer: If $X_n$ converges to $x$ in this topology then it means: $ \forall a,b \in \mathbb{R}: a<x \le b: \exists n_0 \in \mathbb{N}: \forall n>n_0: X_n \in (a,b]$ Which basically means that if $X_n$ converges in this topology then it converges in the ordinary topology. C) Prove or disprove that $1/n$ converges to $0$ in this topology. My answer: It does not converge because if we have $(-1,0],$ it contains $0$ but it does not contain any points of $1/n.$ D) If ${a_n}$ and ${b_n}$ converge, which of the following limit rules are still valid? 1: $\lim_{n \to \infty}(a_n+b_n)=\lim_{n \to \infty}(a_n)+\lim_{n \to \infty}(b_n)$ 2: $\lim_{n \to \infty}(ca_n)=c \lim_{n \to \infty}(a_n)$ 3: $\lim_{n \to \infty}(a_n b_n)=\lim_{n \to \infty}(a_n) \lim_{n \to \infty}(b_n)$ 4: $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n}= \frac{\lim_{n \to \infty}(a_n)}{\lim_{n \to \infty}(b_n)}$ 5: The existence of $\overline{n}$ with $a_n \le b_n$ for all $n \ge \overline{n}$ implies $\lim_{n \to \infty}(a_n) \le \lim_{n \to \infty}(b_n)$ My answer: I apply 3 ""lemmas"" which states the following: 1: If $x_n$ converges to x in the upper limit topology then it converges in the ordinary topology. 2: $|x_n > x|=\infty$ implies that $x_n$ does not converge in the upper limit topology 3: $|x_n > x|<\infty$ and $x_n$ converges in the ordinary topology then it also converges in upper limit topology. This means the following for each rule: 1: This one is still valid and it follows from the 3rd lemma. 2: This one is also valid following from the 3rd lemma however only for $c>0$ 3: I don't think this one is valid following the 2nd lemma unless both are greater than 0. 4: I can rewrite $\frac{1}{b_n}=c$. If 3 is false or true then the same applies to this one. 5: I honestly have no idea how to do this so I would like a hint. Any help or verification is appreciated.",['general-topology']

For Pell equations, $$x^2-dy^2 = 1\tag{1}$$ and $d<100$, the largest fundamental solution is for $d = 61$ (which happens to be the 6th power of a fundamental unit), $$x+y\sqrt{61} = 1766319049+226153980\sqrt{61} =\left(\frac{39+5\sqrt{61}}{2}\right)^6$$ In general, for prime $d = 8n+5$ and odd fundamental solution to $u^2-dv^2=-4$, then initial solution to $(1)$ will be a 6th power and thus huge.

500756,Does $Re\left( \int_{\gamma} f \right) = \int_{\gamma} Re(f)$?,"I'm currently studying complex analysis. My current thinking is as follows: Let $f(t)=x(t)+iy(t)$. By definition, $$\int_{\gamma} f(t) \, \mathrm{d}t = \int_{a}^{b} f(\gamma(t)) \gamma'(t) \, \mathrm{d}t$$
and so by substitution, $$\int_{\gamma} f(t) \, \mathrm{d}t = \int_{a}^{b}x(\gamma(t))\gamma'(t) \, \mathrm{d}t + i \int_{a}^{b} y(\gamma(t))\gamma'(t) \, \mathrm{d}t.$$

500920,Word origin / meaning of 'kernel' in linear algebra,"It may be the dumbest question ever asked on math.SE, but... Given a real matrix $\mathbf A\in\mathbb R^{m\times n}$, the column space is defined as 
$$C(\mathbf A) = \{\mathbf A \mathbf x : \mathbf x \in \mathbb{R}^n\} \subseteq \mathbb R^m.$$ It is sometimes called image or range . I'm OK with the name 'column space' because $C(\mathbf A)$ is the set of all possible linear combinations of $\mathbf A$'s column vectors. I'm OK with the name 'image' because if I consider $\mathbf A \mathbf x$ as a function then $C(\mathbf A)$ is this function's image (the subset of a function's codomain ). I'm OK with the name 'range' because I can consider $C(\mathbf A)$ as a range of a function $f(\mathbf x) = \mathbf A \mathbf x$. Unfortunately, I'm not happy with the name kernel .
$$\ker(\mathbf A) = \{\mathbf x: \mathbf A\mathbf x = \mathbf 0\}\subseteq \mathbb R^n$$ The kernel is sometimes called null space and I can fairly understand where this name came from -- it's because this set contains all the elements in $\mathbb R^n$ that are mapped to zero by $\mathbf A$.

501007,When does gradient flow not converge?,"I've been thinking about gradient flows in the context of Morse theory, where we take a differentiable-enough function $f$ on some space (for now let's say a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ ) and use the trajectories of the gradient flow $x'(t) = - \operatorname{grad} f(x(t))$ to analyse the space. In particular the (un)stable manifolds $$W^\pm(p) = \{ x \in M | x \to p \textrm{ under gradient flow as } t \to \pm \infty\}$$ of critical points $p$ must fill up the whole space, which means that the gradient flow from each point must converge to a critical point of $f$ . Most references (I've been using Jost's Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis ) simply claim that when $f$ is Morse (has non-degenerate Hessian at all critical points) the gradient flow always converges and then move on, without any discussion of what can go wrong in the degenerate cases. For the purposes of Morse theory this is no problem (since there are a wealth of Morse functions anyway), but I'm curious about what the counterexamples look like. I have no trouble proving that the flow converges in the Morse case, but I've had trouble finding an example of a function and an initial point for which the flow does not converge. In such a case the flow would necessarily be asymptotic to some subset of the critical set of $f$ , just not necessarily to a single critical point. I discussed this with someone a while ago and was told that the flow would always converge in the real-analytic category, so any local examples would be given by non-analytic $f$ . It was suggested to me that a function whose graph over a flat subset looked like an infinitely long ""groove"" cut out of a bump (something like with the edges of the groove smoothed out) would do the job (with the flow proceeding down the groove forever); but upon further thought it seems such a function would fail to be differentiable at the accumulation circle. (Edit: in retrospect, I think this idea does work - if the depth of the groove decayed fast enough, such a function can be differentiable, just not analytic.) Does anyone know any non-trivial (there are the obvious examples of unbounded functions on non-compact manifolds) examples of how the a trajectory of gradient flow can fail to converge? I'm particularly interested in the simple case of compact manifolds, but anything is welcome. Necessary conditions (or sufficient conditions less restrictive than Morse) for convergence might also be interesting.","['dynamical-systems', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'differential-geometry', 'morse-theory', 'gradient-flows']"

$$\lim_{n\to\infty}S(3^n)=\infty.$$ Question 2 :How about $S(m^n)$ for $m\ge 4$ except some trivial cases? Motivation : I've got the following : 
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}S(2^n)=\infty.$$ Proof : The point of this proof is that there exists a non-zero number between the ${m+1}^{th}$ digit and ${4m}^{th}$ digit. If 
$$2^n=A\cdot{10}^{4m}+B, B\lt {10}^m, 0\lt A,$$
then $2^n\ge {10}^{4m}\gt 2^{4m}$ leads $n\gt 4m$.
Hence, the left side can be divided by $2^{4m}$. Also, $B$ must be divided by $2^{4m}$ because ${10}^{4m}=2^{4m}\cdot 5^{4m}$. However, since
$$B\lt {10}^m\lt {16}^m=2^{4m},$$
$B$ can not be divided by $2^{4m}$ if $B\not=0$. If $B=0$, then the right side can be divided by $5$ but the left side cannot be divided by $5$. Hence, we now know that there is a non-zero number between the ${m+1}^{th}$ digit and ${4m}^{th}$ digit. Since $2^n$ cannot be divided by $5$, the first digit is not $0$. There exists non-zero number between the second digit and the fourth digit. Again, there exists non-zero number between $5^{th}$ digit and ${16}^{th}$ digit. By the same argument as above, if $2^n$ has more than $4^k$ digits, then $S(n)\ge {k+1}$. Hence,
$$n\log {2}\ge 4^k-1\ \ \Rightarrow \ \ S(n)\ge k+1.$$
Now we know that 
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}S(2^n)=\infty$$
as desired. Now the proof is completed. However, I've been facing difficulty for the $m=3$ case. I've got $\lim\sup S(3^n)=\infty$. Proof : Suppose that $3^n$ has $m$ digits. Letting $l=\varphi({10}^m)+n$, then 
$$3^l-3^n=3^n(3^{\varphi({10}^m)}-1).$$
Since this can be divided by ${10}^m$, we know that the last $m$ digits of $3^l$ are equal to those of $3^n$. Hence, we get $\lim\sup S(3^n)=\infty$. However, I can't get $\lim\inf S(3^n)$. Can anyone help? Update : I crossposted to MO .","['limits', 'number-theory']"
