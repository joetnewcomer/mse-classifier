1898290,Why are structures interesting?,"Structures are sets together with some constants, relations, and functions on that set. They are studied in many areas of mathematics: For example, universal algebra studies algebraic structures (i.e. structures with no relations, only functions and constants) in general. Also, model theory studies the connection between a formal logic and structures. As a last example, let me mention abstract algebra. This field studies more concrete structures, such as groups, fields, rings, monoids, and so on. Okay. Structures are very important in mathematics. I am interested in the history and the motivation of the definition of structure . What makes structures so interesting? Why gives us the study of structures so powerful tools? What is the motivation behind the definition of the term structures ? (For example, why can't structure have more than one carrier set?) How did the term structure historically develop? What were the first motivating examples? Why did one choose the name ""structure""? I personally interpret this word (""structure"") as being some kind of pattern. What has this to do with the mathematical notion of structures?","['model-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'universal-algebra', 'logic', 'soft-question']"

1898456,Why are the continued fractions of non-square-root numbers ($\sqrt[a]{x}$ where $a>2$) not periodic?,"Ok, so it is quite amazing how the continued fractions for $\sqrt[2]{x}$ are always periodic for all whole numbers of $x$ (and where $x$ is not a perfect square): Here is a link I suggest at looking at: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PeriodicContinuedFraction.html ... The following is in the simple continued fraction form:
$$\sqrt x = a_1+ \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \cfrac{1}{a_4 + \cfrac{1}{a_5 + \cfrac{1}{a_6 + \cfrac{1}{a_7 + \cdots}}}}}}$$ For example: The continued fraction of $\sqrt 7$ is as follows: 
$[2;1,1,1,4,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,4,\ldots]$ the period in this case is $4$... and the continued fraction can be written as: $$[2;\overline{1,1,1,4}]$$ Some other examples: $\sqrt2 = [1;\overline{2}]$ Period is 1 $\sqrt3 = [1;\overline{1,2}]$ Period is 2 $\sqrt{13} = [3;\overline{1,1,1,1,6}]$ Period is 5 $\sqrt{97} = [9;\overline{1,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,18}]$ Period is 11 There are many other sources which show this... but why does this not work for others, such as cubic roots?

1898487,"Function totally differentiable in $(0,0)$","I asked this question here but didn't have an account yet and I can't comment yet on another question. So please forgive me for asking again. Consider the following function: $$f:\mathbb R^2\rightarrow\mathbb R,(x,y)\mapsto\begin{cases} x,&y=0 \\ y,&x=0\\0,&\text{else}\end{cases}$$ So far I have, that this function is continuous in $(0,0)$, as for every sequence $(x_n,y_n)\rightarrow (0,0)$ we have
$$f(x_n,y_n)=\begin{cases} x_n,& y_n=0 \\ y_n,&x_n=0 \\ 0,&\text{else}\end{cases} \rightarrow 0.$$ Further I have calculated all directional derivatives: If $(v_1,v_2)\in\mathbb R^2\setminus\{0\}$ with
$v_1\cdot v_2\neq 0$, we have $\frac{1}{t}f(tv_1,tv_2)=0.$ For $v_1=0,v_2\neq 0$ we have $\frac{1}{t}f(tv_1,tv_2)=\frac{1}{t}\cdot tv_2=v_2$ and for $v_1\neq 0, v_2=0$ we get $\frac{1}{t}f(tv_1,tv_2)=v_1$. Thus we get for the partial derivatives:
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(0,0)=1,\quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(0,0)=1.$$ I now want to know, if this function is totally differentiable in $(0,0)$. The partial derivatives are not continuous in $(0,0)$, so I can't use that to say that the function is totally differentiable. But as $f$ is continuous in $(0,0)$ I can't rule out that the function is not totally differentiable. I know that by definition $f$ is totally differentiable in $(0,0)$ if there exists a Matrix $T$ and a function $\varphi$ with
$$f(x,y)=f(0,0)+T\cdot \left((x,y)-(0,0)\right)+\Vert (x,y)-(0,0)\Vert\cdot\varphi(x,y)$$ but I don't know how to calculate $T$ and $\varphi$. Regarding the comment if I'm sure that the partial derivatives are not continuous: For $(x,y)\neq (0,0)$ I get $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)=\begin{cases} 1, & y=0\\0,&\text{else}\end{cases}$ which seems to me not continuous in $(0,0)$.

1898520,Tangent space of $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ at I,"Working thorugh the exercises in Thorpe's book ""Elementary Topics in Differential Geometry"" I've got stuck on the last step of this one: Prove that tangent space of $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ at $I=\begin{pmatrix}1
 & 0  \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ is the set of all matrices of trace zero. Following the hints I get that if $$\alpha(t)=\begin{pmatrix}x_1(t) & x_2(t)  \\ x_3(t) & x_4(t) \end{pmatrix}$$ is a parametrized curve in $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ with $\alpha(t_0)=\begin{pmatrix}x_1(t_0) & x_2(t_0)  \\ x_3(t_0) & x_4(t_0) \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}1
 & 0  \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, then $(dx_1/dt)(t_0)+(dx_4/dt)(t_0)=0$. This is true because since $\alpha(t)\in SL_2(\mathbb{R})$, it follows that $x_1(t)x_4(t)-x_2(t)x_3(t)=1$. Derivating respect to $t$ and evaluating at $t_0$: $$\frac{dx_1(t_0)}{dt}x_4(t_0)+x_1(t_0)\frac{dx_4(t_0)}{dt}=\frac{dx_1(t_0)}{dt}\cdot 1+1 \cdot\frac{dx_4(t_0)}{dt}=0$$ Now for the last step it says: ""Then use a dimensional argument"" I'm not sure how to proceed.

The integral seems quite problematic to me. If the limits were finite, I would do this: $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^4+a^4}+\sqrt{x^4+b^4}}=\frac{1}{a^4-b^4}(\sqrt{x^4+a^4}-\sqrt{x^4+b^4})$$ Then, for one of the integrals we will have: $$\int_A^B \sqrt{x^4+a^4} dx=a^3 \int_{A/a}^{B/a} \sqrt{1+t^4} dt$$ This integral is complicated, but quite well known. On the other hand $\int_0^\infty \sqrt{1+t^4}dt$ diverges, so I can't consider the two terms separately. But the integral behaves like I can! If we look at the final expression, it seems like $\int_0^\infty \sqrt{1+t^4}dt=\frac{\Gamma(1/4)^2 }{6 \sqrt{\pi}}$ even though it can't be correct. I have to somehow arrive at Beta function, since we have a squared Gamma as an answer. I'm interested in this integral, since it represents another kind of mean for two numbers $a$ and $b$. If we scale it appropriately: $$I(a,b)=\frac{8 \sqrt{\pi}}{\Gamma(1/4)^2 } \int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^4+a^4}+\sqrt{x^4+b^4}}= \frac{4}{3} \frac{a^2+ab+b^2}{a^3+ab(a+b)+b^3}$$ So, $1/I(a,b)$ is a mean for the two numbers.","['means', 'improper-integrals', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'beta-function']"

I found that if $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c(a,b,c\in\mathbb{Z},a\neq0)$ always form a pefect square number for all $x\in\mathbb{Z}$,Then there must exists $s,t\in\mathbb{Z}$ so that  $f(x)=(sx+t)^2$,but I cannot prove it.

1898590,Subsets $\Omega\subseteq X$ such that any continuous $f:\Omega\to Y$ can be extended continuously to $F:X\to Y$,"This is a reference request.  Below is a prelude to the main questions. Let $n$ be a positive integer.  Characterize all subsets $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that any continuous function $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$ can be extended to a continuous function $F:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{C}$.  Here, $\Omega$ inherits the subspace topology from $\mathbb{R}^n$, and of course, $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{C}$ are equipped with their standard topologies. The answer to the question above is that $\Omega$ must be a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.  A slightly more generalized question is given below. Question I: What are all subsets $\Omega$ of a topological space $X$ such that any continuous function $f:\Omega\to \mathbb{C}$ can be extended continuously to $F:X\to\mathbb{C}$?  As usual, $\Omega$ is equipped with the subspace topology inherited from $X$. Of course, without any nice properties on $X$, it seems impossible to make a characterization of such subspaces $\Omega$.  Hence, with some additional properties on the topology of $X$, the answer may be completely known. I know that, if $X$ is normal, then all closed subsets $\Omega$ of $X$ have the required property, using the Tietze Extension Theorem.  Is there an example of a normal topological space $X$ which contains a non-closed subset $\Omega$ such that any continuous function $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$ has a continuous extension to $X$? Question II: Even more generally, let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces.  Find all extendable subsets $\Omega$ of $X$, namely, all subsets $\Omega\subseteq X$ such that any continuous function $f:\Omega\to Y$ can be extended continuously to $F:X\to Y$. Of course, niceness constraints on $X$ and $Y$ may be needed for a complete characterization.  For example, if $X$ is a metric space, $Y$ is a convex subset of a locally convex topological vector space, and $\Omega$ is a closed subspace of $X$, then any continuous function $f:\Omega\to Y$ can be extended to a continuous function $F:X\to Y$.  See for example here (although there is no mentioning that closed sets are all such sets). This paper discusses strongly good pairs , namely, pairs $(X,Y)$ of topological spaces such that every $\Omega\subseteq X$ is extendable.  It also discusses good pairs , namely pairs $(X,Y)$ of topological spaces such that, for every $\Omega\subseteq X$ and for any continuous function $f:\Omega\to Y$, there exists a function $F:X\to Y$ extending $f$ such that $F$ is continuous at every point in $\Omega$.  This gives me an idea for my final question. Question III: Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. What are all weakly extendable subsets $\Omega$ of $X$, namely, subsets $\Omega\subseteq X$ such that, for any continuous function $f:\Omega\to Y$, there exists a function $F:X\to Y$ extending $f$ such that $F$ is continuous at every point in $\Omega$.  We shall call such an extension $F$ a weakly continuous extension of $f$ (relative to $\Omega$). In the case where $X=\mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $Y=\mathbb{C}$, it is known that any subset $\Omega$ of $X$ is weakly extendable.  In fact, if $Y$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space and $X$ is metrizable, then $(X,Y)$ is a good pair.  What are other resources where a full characterization of weakly extendable subsets is known?","['reference-request', 'separation-axioms', 'functions', 'continuity', 'general-topology']"
1898594,Norm of self-adjoint member of $C^*$-algebra,"This question arose from the proof of proposition $1.11(e)$ in chapter $8$ of  John B. Conway's A Course in Functional Analysis .  This portion of the proposition can be stated: Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a $C^*$-algebra, and let $a\in\mathscr{A}$ be given. If $a=a^*$, then $\|a\|=r(a)$. (Here, $r(a)$ denotes the spectral radius of $a$.) The proof, as stated in the book, proceeds as follows: Since $a^*=a$, $\|a^2\|=\|a^*a\|=\|a\|^2$; by induction, $\|a^{2n}\|=\|a\|^{2n}$ for $n\geq1$  That is, $\|a^{2n}\|^{1/2n}=\|a\|$ for $n\geq1$.  Hence $r(a)=\lim\|a^{2n}\|^{1/2n}=\|a\|$. Now I was able to show by induction that
$$ \|a^{2^n}\|=\|a\|^{2^n} \qquad (n\geq1),$$
from which the result follows, but I could not prove it as it is stated in the book. So my question is:  How can we prove (presumably by induction) that $\|a^{2n}\|^{1/2n}=\|a\|$ for $n\geq1$?

1898622,A group of order 2010 has a normal subgroup of order 5,"I am studying for a qualifying exam and am working on the following problem. If G is a group of order 2010=2*3*5*67, then G has a normal subgroup of order 5. I know that the number of 67-Sylow subgroups is 1, lets's call it H.  So H is normal in G. We also know that the order of H is 67. Since sylow-p subgroups exist, there is a subgroup K with order 5. Since H is normal and K is a subgroup, HK is a subgroup of G. Since the orders of H and K are relatively prime, their intersection is trivial so the order of HK is 5*67. Also since the orders of H and K are prime, they are cyclic, and again because they are relatively prime, HK is cyclic and hence abelian. Since abelian groups have a subgroup the size of each divisors of its order, then HK has a subgroup of order 5, call it M. This is where I am stuck.  My study buddy says HK is normal, but can't give me a reason. He states exactly that ""M is a subgroup of HK, HK is normal in G, and since HK is cyclic, we can conclude that M is normal in G.""

where $\lambda$ is a (unique) Borel measure? One example I am very tempted to conjecture right off the bat is the ""evaluation-at-a-point functional"" which for some $a \in E$ is given by
$$J_{a}[f]=\int_{E} f \, d\delta_{a}=f(a) $$
where $\delta_{a}$ is the Dirac measure. Obviously the Dirac measure is locally finite and both inner and outer regular so it is a Borel measure. So am I correct in my thinking here? I also assume that there is some unique Borel measure $\nu$ that one could ""represent"" for example the total variation functional $V_{a}^{b}: BV([a,b]) \to \mathbb{R}_{+}$ as 
$$
V^{b}_{a}[f]=\int_{[a,b]} f \, d\nu
$$
and that this would hold for any positive linear functional defined on the space of compactly supported continuous functions? Also, I read somewhere that measures are special cases of distributions and I've been trying to wrap my head around that idea and it seems to me that this theorem is pointing me in that direction. Can someone help me connect the dots here? I feel like I'm so close to seeing the big picture of how all of this fits together but I'm missing that key insight. Edit: Another flash of insight I just had: for $\varphi \in \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R})$ where $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R})$ is the space of test functions and $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ say we have a distribution acting on a test function $\varphi$ given by
$$
\langle T_{f},\varphi\rangle =\int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) \varphi(x) \, d\mu(x)
$$
and for a Borel measure $\mu$ we have a distribution acting on $\varphi$ given by
$$
\langle T_{\mu},\varphi \rangle=\int_{\mathbb{R}} \varphi(x) \, d\mu(x)
$$
so perhaps $\varphi$ is a ""smoothed out"" version of the indicator function?","['riesz-representation-theorem', 'distribution-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory']"

The functor $\mathcal F$ assigns an algebraic structure to each open set of $X$. For any point $x$ we get a set of neighbourhoods $\{U_i\}$ ($x\in U_i$ for all $i\in I$), which forms a directed system by inclusion: we have a ""direction"" $U_i \to U_j$ iff $U_i\subset U_j$. As I understand it, the concept of a stalk $\mathcal F_x$ of $x\in X$ tries to capture the sheaf's local behavior around a point $x\in X$. To realize this, I would expect to have inclusions $\mathcal F_x\subset U_i$ for each $i\in I$. The stalk $\mathcal F_x$ should be something very small around $x$. Now, the stalk $\mathcal F_x$ of $x$ is defined as the direct limit of the directed system $\{U_i\}$, which is the colimit of the directed system as a functor. This means that instead of the inclusions $\mathcal F_x\subset U_i$, we have arrows (directions, i.e. inclusions) $U_i\to\mathcal F_x$, i.e. $U_i\subset\mathcal F_x$. I think that cannot be correct.

As everybody interested in ultrametric calculus knows, the $p$-adic exponential function defined by series $$\exp_p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{k!}$$ converges only on a small ball $\mathcal B$ around $0$ equal to $p\mathbb Z_p$ (for $p \ge 3$) or $4 \mathbb Z_2$ (otherwise). Inspired by my previous post ,, About $\lim \left(1+\frac {x}{n}\right)^n$ '' I have decided to check whether this alternative representation is also true here, in $p$-adic context. As a side note, an analytical function $f$ from convex neighbourhood of zero satisfying $f = f'$ or $f(x+y) = f(x) f(y)$ must be identically zero (this is exercise 25.J from Schikhof's book). Let's fix $\varepsilon > 0$ and $x \in \mathcal B$. We have $$\left|\exp_p x - \Bigl(1 + \frac xn\Bigr)^n\right| = \left(\sum_{k=n}^\infty \frac{x^k}{k!}\right) + \sum_{k=2}^n \left(\frac{x^k}{k!} - {n \choose k} \frac{x^k}{n^k}\right).$$
because $(1 +x/n)^n = 1 + x + \ldots$.
For sufficiently large values of $n$, the left sum can be made smaller than $\varepsilon / 2$. Now I have tried to rewrite the summand as $$\frac{x^k}{k!} \cdot \left(1-\frac{n!}{(n-k)! \cdot n^k}\right)$$
and assumed that $n$ is of the form $p^m + p^{m-1} + \ldots + 1$, which implies $v_p(n!) =n - p^m$ by the Legendre formula and $|n|_p^k = 1$ by direct check. Now $v_p((n-k)!)$ is certainly not larger than $p^m / (p-1)$ and therefore $$v_p(n!) - v_p(k!) \ge \frac{p-2}{p-1} \cdot p^{m-1} + p^{m-2} + \ldots + 1 \to \infty.$$ It seems that $\exp_p (x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} (1 + x/n)^n$.

\int_{0}^{2\pi}\{9a^2cos^2tsin^2t(cos^2t + sin^2t)\}^{1/2}$$ Since $cos^2t + sin^2t = 1$ that simplifies to $$\int_{0}^{2\pi}\sqrt[2]{9a^2cos^2tsin^2t} = \\
\int_{0}^{2\pi}{3a\cos{t}\sin{t}}$$ Since $costsint = \frac{1}{2}sin2t$ the above simplfies further to:

After looking on Wikipedia, it seems that the PAT that he described is wildly different from what most of the internet says. The professor said that the PAT tells us that any quadratic form $Q(x)$ can be ""transformed"" (what does that even mean???) into the quadratic form $Q(y) = y^T Dy$ with no cross product term (the cross product term is defined as the $x_1\cdot x_2$ term in the quadratic form), where $D$ is a diagonal matrix. His proof used the fact that $Q(x) = x^T Ax = (x^T Q)D(Q^T x) = y^T Dy$ for some $y$.
What does the ""transformed quadratic form"" represent? Why is it significant? All my professor did was define these things, and didn't explain any intuition.","['quadratic-forms', 'linear-algebra']"
1899176,Constructing groups of order 16 from knowledge of their subgroups,"So I am rather curious about known techniques for constructing groups from knowledge of their subgroups. For instance, if I told you that a particular order 16 group had 3 order 8 subgroups, all isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$, it is possible to immediate conclude that the group is $2$-generated because it is an order 16 group with 3 order 8 subgroups. Moreover, it turns out that there are exactly two possibilities, but I only know this because I have analyzed all 14 groups of order 16. The possibilities are the abelian group $\mathbb{Z}_4\times\mathbb{Z}_4$ and a non-abelian semidirect product, $\mathbb{Z}_4\rtimes_\varphi\mathbb{Z}_4$, where $\varphi$ is surjective (onto $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_4)\simeq\mathbb{Z}_2$). My admittedly somewhat general question is this: what methods would sufficient to construct all 14 groups of order 16 from just knowledge of the groups of order 1, 2, 4, and 8? I know they can all be represented as semi-direct products, but the same group can often be represented in quite a few different ways as semidirect products, which makes determining which groups are which (up to isomorphism) tedious. From analyzing the 14 different groups, most of them are readily distinguishable from each other via much more readily noticed properties (especially from a constructive perspective). For instance, it's easy to distinguish the two possibilities mentioned previously by looking at whether or not elements commute (curiously, they have identical subgroup lattices, sans that the entire group is not isomorphic). Likewise, distinguishing the modular group $M_{16}$ from the previous two is trivial if you have access to their subgroup lattices (the one for $M_{16}$ is clearly different from the other two, moreover, it has a cyclic subgroup of order 8, which the other two do not). A closely related question: If I gave you an operation table for a 'mystery group' of order 16, what things would most quickly (quickly in terms of ease to compute) allow you to identify its isomorphism class? (I can usually get it down to at most two possibilities very quickly, from just knowledge of subgroups, but at some point, that alone may not be enough, as evidenced with the above example)","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'group-isomorphism']"

If $h$ undershoots the target number, then you are penalized $t - h$ points.  If you overshoot, you are penalized $k(h - t)$ points where $k$ is a real $ \ge 1$.  You get to choose the exact probability your coin comes up heads, $p$.  What is the optimal $p$ to choose to minimize your expected cost for a given $n$, $t$, and $k$? What I've figured out When $k=1$ the obvious strategy is to choose $p = \frac{t}{n}$.  When $t$ is very small and $k$ is very large, I think the best strategy might be to choose $p=0$ and accept the fixed cost of $t$. Generally, though, there will be some $p = \frac{t}{n} - \epsilon$ that minimizes expected cost. The probability of flipping $i$ heads is $\dfrac{\binom{n}{i}}{2^n}p^i(1-p)^{n-i}$, so the exact expected cost of any $p$ can be calculated as $$\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \left((t-i)\dfrac{\binom{n}{i}}{2^n}p^i(1-p)^{n-i}\right)

1899620,Solutions to $f'=f$ over the rationals,"The problem is as follows: Let $f: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$ and consider the differential equation $f' = f$, with the standard definition of differentiation. Do there exist any nontrivial solutions? (Note that of course $f \equiv 0$ is a solution - by ""nontrivial solutions"", I mean anything else). Observations: Differentiation and continuity are much weaker concepts on the rationals. For example, $H(x-\sqrt{2}) : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$ is continuous and everywhere differentiable, where $H$ is the Heaviside step function. If there exists a nontrivial solution $f_0$, then there are uncountably many solutions. For example, $H(x-\alpha)f_0$ is also a solution for any irrational $\alpha$ (which already gives uncountably many solutions), and thus any* linear combination $k_0 f_0 + \sum_{\alpha \in A} H(x-\alpha)k_\alpha f_0$ (with $A \subset \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$) is also a solution, by linearity of the DE. We can answer in the negative if there is a way to show that any such solution could be extended to a solution to $f' = f$ on $\mathbb{R}$, because those solutions are simply $ke^x$, which takes irrational values over the rationals unless $k = 0$. Unfortunately, the solutions $f : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$ for the a differential equation $\mathcal{L}y = 0$ are not, in general, a subset of the real solutions. e.g. $y' = 0$ has solution $H(x-\sqrt{2})$ but every solution on $\mathbb{R}$ must be constant. If the answer is ""yes"", maybe we'd hope to be able to construct a solution via some iterative method, but since Cauchy sequences are not in general convergent, we'd need some sort of machinery to guarantee rational limits. *you can either insert the word ""finite"" here, or stipulate that the $k_\alpha$ are such that the quantity $\sum_{\alpha<q} k_\alpha$ is finite and rational for all $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, but the point is that we can construct a bunch of ""different looking"" solutions.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'analysis', 'rational-numbers']"
1899628,"Finding the minimal polynomial, the eigenvalues, and the characteristic polynomial of $T(A)=A+A^t$","Let $M_n$ denote the vector space of all $n\times n$ real valued matrices and for any matrix $A\in M_n$ let $A^t$ denote its transpose. Define the linear map $T:M_n\rightarrow M_n$ as

What is the minimal polynomial of $T$? What are the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenspaces of $T$? What is the characteristic polynomial of $T$? I learned about minimal polynomials of operators from $\textit{Linear Algebra Done Right}$ by Axler. In his description he explains how in order to find the minimal polynomial you must find the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $T^m$ is a linear combination of $I, T, T^2, \ldots, T^{m-1}$. That is, the smallest integer $m$ such that
$$T^m = a_0I+a_1T+a_2T^2+ \cdots +a_{m-1}T^{m-1}.$$ As for the eigenvalues...since we are working with real-valued matrices, then $A$ and $A^t$ have the same eigenvalues, so if $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ (and hence of $A^t$) wouldn't $2\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $A+A^t$?

The arithmetic sum/mean of a sufficiently large number of iterates of independent random variables approaches a normal distribution. These variables should be independent.

1899679,Apostol Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem,"Theorem . If a bounded set $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ contains infinitely many points, then there is at least one point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which is an accumulation point of $S$. Proof . (for $\mathbb{R}^1$) Since $S$ is bounded, it lies in some interval $[âˆ’a,a]$. At least one of the subintervals $[âˆ’a,0]$ or $[0,a]$ contains an infinite subset of $S$. Call one such subinterval $[a_1,b_1]$. Bisect $[a_1,b_1]$ and obtain a subinterval $[a_2,b_2]$ containing an infinite subset of $S$, and continue this process. In this way a countable collection of intervals is obtained, the $nth$ interval $[a_n,b_n]$ being of length $b_n -a_n = a/2^{n-1}$. Clearly the $\sup$ of the left endpoints $a_n$ and the $\inf$ of the right endpoints $b_n$ must be equal, say to $x$. The point $x$ will be an accumulation point of $S$ because, if $r$ is any positive number, the interval $[a_n,b_n]$ will be contained in $B(x;r)$ as soon as $n$ is large enough so that $b_nâˆ’a_n<r/2$. The interval $B(x;r)$ contains a point of $S$ distinct from $x$ and hence $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$. My Questions Why is it obvious that the $\sup$ of the left endpoint $a_n$ is equal to the $\inf$ of the right endpoint $b_n$? Also how does one consider the $\sup$ or $\inf$ of a single number? I don't understand why we need $b_nâˆ’a_n<r/2$. Instead, why do we need to halve $r$?  If $b_nâˆ’a_n<r$ then wouldn't $[a_n,b_n]$ still be contained in $B(x;r)$?","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

1899801,Formal definition of trigonometric functions,"I want to define trigonometric function (say sine) formally with the definition that the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. But there is a problem with defining an angle (and the measure of an angle) without knowing trigonometric functions. Some people say that the measure of an angle is the ratio of the lenth of the arc to the lenght of the radius. But I don't know how to define an arc without trigonometric functions. The solution may be to define sine and cosine with power series. I know this approach and it's fine, but I'm interested in classical definition. So I came up with my own idea. Let $x\in (0,90)$ and let $P$ be a model of Hilbert's plane euclidian geometry, $\mu$ is segments measure, $\nu$ is angles measure such that the emasure of the right angle is $90$, and $\triangle abc$ is a right triangle in which $\nu(\angle abc)=x$. Then $\sin x=\frac{\mu(ac)}{\mu(ab)}$. This definition requires proving many theorems (for instance existance of measures and triangle with given angles) and you have to prove that the definition doesn't depnd on the choice of the model, choice of the segments measure and choice of the right triangle. The question is: Can we define angles and sine without referring to Hilbert' theory? Maybe it's possible to define measure of angles in euclidian model $\mathbb{R}^2$. I think the key part of the definition must be additivity of the measure, as it is in Hilbert's theory.","['axiomatic-geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'trigonometry', 'geometry']"

1899979,Is the order inevitable in constructing the real numbers?,"There are several ways to construct real numbers, such as the Dedekind cut , monotone bounded sequences and Cauchy sequences . It is obvious that the former two involves the order of the rational numbers, but whether the order is needed in constructing the real numbers via the Cauchy sequences is not clear at the first glance. However, there are many people claimed that it is because the Cauchy sequence doesn't require the order of the set, we can generalize this concept, using Cauchy sequence to complete the incomplete metric space. But I'm not quite convinced, so I ask here. Although the way to defining real numbers by Cauchy sequences requires only the rational numbers to be a metric space, in order to discuss $\forall \varepsilon\in\mathbb{Q}^{+},~ \exists N\in\mathbb{N},~ \forall m,n\in\mathbb{N},~m,n>N\Rightarrow d(x_m,x_n)<\varepsilon$, how did we define the metric here? It's $d(x,y)=|x-y|$ for any $x,y\in\mathbb{Q}$, and the absolute function is defined as the following way: $|a|:=
\begin{cases}
a~~~~~~~,a\geq 0\\
-a~~~~,a<0
\end{cases}$ So there is the situation to compare a number with $0$, hence the order relation involved. Therefore, it seems the Cauchy sequences way also requires the order relation.","['order-theory', 'real-numbers', 'cauchy-sequences', 'analysis']"

PROPOSED SOLUTION: The lower bound is fine as it is, so we shall leave it alone. Note that $$\begin{align*}
\left ( \frac{n}{n-1} \right )^n &= \left ( 1+\frac{1}{n-1} \right )^{n} \\ &= 
\left ( 1+\frac{1}{n-1} \right )^{n-1} \left ( 1+\frac{1}{n-1} \right )

Choose $a,b$ such that $a \geq b$ , then: $$I(a,b)=\frac{1}{a^2} \int_0^\infty \frac{dt}{\sqrt{(t^3+1)(t^3+b^3/a^3)}}=\frac{1}{a^2} I \left(1, \frac{b}{a} \right)$$ $$\frac{b^3}{a^3}=p, \qquad I \left(1, \frac{b}{a} \right)=I_1(p)$$ $$I_1(p)=\int_0^\infty\frac{dt}{\sqrt{(t^3+1)(t^3+p)}}=2 \frac{d}{dp} J(p)$$ $$J(p)=\int_0^\infty\sqrt{\frac{t^3+p}{t^3+1}}dt=\int_0^\infty\sqrt{1+\frac{p-1}{t^3+1}}dt=$$ $$|p-1| \leq 1$$ $$=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \left( \begin{array}( 1/2 \\ ~k \end{array} \right) (p-1)^k \int_0^\infty \frac{dt}{(t^3+1)^k}$$ Now this is the most problematic part. The first integral of this series diverges. However, it's a constant in $p$ , so if we differentiate, it formally disappears: $$I_1(p)=2 \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left( \begin{array}( 1/2 \\ ~k \end{array} \right) k (p-1)^{k-1} \int_0^\infty \frac{dt}{(t^3+1)^k}$$ Now, every integral in this series converges. The integtals can be computed using the Beta function, if we substitute: $$t^3=\frac{1}{u}-1$$ Finally, we rewrite: $$I_1(p)=\frac{\Gamma (1/3)}{3 \sqrt{\pi}} \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^2}{k!^2} \Gamma \left(k- \frac{1}{2}\right) \Gamma \left(k- \frac{1}{3}\right) (1-p)^{k-1}$$ Or, using the Pochhammer symbol: $$I_1(p)=\frac{2 \pi}{3 \sqrt{3}} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(k+1)^2}{(k+1)!^2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)_k \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)_k (1-p)^k$$ My questions are: Is the method I used valid (see the 'problematic part')?

If the method I used is correct, it can be used for any integral of the form ( $m \geq 2$ ): $$I_m(a,b)=\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{\sqrt{(x^m+a^m)(x^m+b^m)}}$$","['hypergeometric-function', 'integration', 'definite-integrals']"
