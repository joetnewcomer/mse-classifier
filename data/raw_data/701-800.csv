4741,A good lower bound on the maximum curvature in a loop,"Suppose $\alpha: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ is a $C^\infty$
curve, parameterized by arc length ($\left\|\alpha'(t)\right\| = 1$),
and with $\alpha(0) = \alpha(\ell)$.  Show that
there exists a $t_0 \in [0,\ell]$ such that
$
\left\| \alpha''(t_0)\right\| \geq \frac{2\pi}{\ell}.
$ If we had that $\alpha'(0) = \alpha'(\ell)$, then the result would
follow from Fenchel's theorem, but we don't. Actually there is a nice
extension to Fenchel's theorem described in Toponogov's book
``Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces: A Concise Guide'',
under the name Fenchel-Reshetnyak, which gives lower bounds on the
integral curvature in an open curve. This can be adapted to our
situation to show that $\left\| \alpha''(t_0)\right\| \geq
\frac{\pi}{\ell}$, but that bound is only half as good as it
presumably could be. It makes sense that the integral curvature bound
will be only half as good if we don't constrain $\alpha'(0)$
w.r.t. $\alpha'(\ell)$ (in particular, one may be the negative of the
other), but nonetheless it seems that the original bound on the maximum curvature in the loop should still stand. How can we
recover it?",['differential-geometry']

Generally, for showing the set is dense, one proceeds, by finding out what is $\overline{A}$ of this given set. And if $\overline{A} = [-1,1]$, we are through with the proof, but i having trouble here!

4781,Complexity - why is RL=NL when omitting the demand for polynomial run-time?,"The complexity class RL is described at the complexity zoo as: Has the same relation to L as RP does to P. The randomized machine must halt with probability 1 on any input. It must also run in polynomial time (since otherwise we would just get NL). The question is - how can we get NL when omitting the demand for polynomial time? I have a solution of my own but it seems strange to me. My solution: If suffices to solve ST-CON. We can use the same NL algorithm for ST-CON (guessing a path) with one major difference - we count the number of steps we make, and if it suppresses the number of vertices in the graph, we restart the computation, without remembering ANYTHING. This means we can play this game indefinitely. If the graph is not ST-connected, then we'll never halt, but if it's ST-connected we'll halt in probability 1 (this is the same as saying that a geometric random variable obtains a finite value in probability 1). However, since we do not halt for NO-instances, this solution ""feels wrong"" to me. Is there another solution? And is my solution correct?","['computer-science', 'probability', 'algorithms']"

4785,Terminology for weighted projective spaces,"For a sequence of positive integers $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ and a base ring $R$ there is a graded ring $R[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ where $x_i$ is in degree $a_i$ .  We can then apply Proj and get a scheme, and this is usually called a weighted projective space; if all of the $a_i$ are 1, then the resulting scheme really is projective space. However, the way that this arises is as the quotient of $\mathbb{A}^n \setminus 0$ by an action of the multiplicative group, given by $(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \simeq (\lambda^{a_1} x_1, \ldots, \lambda^{a_n} x_n)$ for all $\lambda$ .  This is a ""coarse"" group quotient. There is an alternative version where one instead takes the associated quotient stack/orbifold, and this has a number of nice properties (including possession of a line bundle $\mathcal{O}(1)$ ); this is true more generally of a graded ring. What is the appropriate terminology for the stack-theoretic version of this construction if ""weighted projective space"" is taken?","['algebraic-geometry', 'terminology']"
4787,Motivation behind standard deviation?,"Let's take the numbers 0-10.  Their mean is 5, and the individual deviations from 5 are -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 And so the average (magnitude of) deviation from the mean is $30/11 \approx 2.72$. However, this is not the standard deviation.  The standard deviation is $\sqrt{10} \approx 3.16$. The first mean-deviation is a simpler and by far more intuitive definition of the ""standard-deviation"" , so I'm sure it's the first definition statisticians worked with.  However, for some reason they decided to adopt the second definition instead.  What is the reasoning behind that decision?","['statistics', 'standard-deviation', 'intuition']"

My question is - what are the major uses of the theorem, and to which extent can they justify the claim that the theorem is fundamental for something ?

I guess one can immediately reduce the problem to a normed linear space of countably infinite dimensions.

I'm trying to prove $u\circ v$ is harmonic. [I've seen this stated as a fact in a few places without reference, namely here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map#Uses , but maybe my hypotheses are slightly different and this is not true at all] I've seen a proof that if $u$ is $C^2$ and $T$ is an orthogonal transformation then $\Delta (u \circ T) = \Delta(u) \circ T$. So I'm thinking that to show $u\circ v$ is harmonic, we can use the fact that $v$ acts locally as its Jacobian, which is an orthogonal transformation, and move the Laplacian onto $u$ and conclude $u\circ v$ is harmonic. However, I'm having trouble making this idea precise.  After glancing at my copy of baby Rudin, my hunch is to use the inverse function theorem or constant rank theorem, but I'm unsure how to apply those.  Any suggestions?",['real-analysis']

Hence we have a functor $R$ from the category of small pre-additive categories (with additive functors as morhisms) to the category of rings (with ring homomorphisms as morphisms). But the category of small pre-additive categories has a 2-categorical structure given by natural transformations.

4889,Proof that every polygon with an inscribed circle is convex?,"In many elementary (and not-so-elementary) Euclidean geometry texts, a (simple) polygon is said to be tangential if it is convex and has an inscribed circle (i.e., a circle that intersects and is tangent to each side of the polygon).  The assumption of convexity is not needed: I've come up with a rather laborious proof that every polygon with an inscribed circle is convex.  But I'd like to find either a simple elementary proof or a reference to a proof in the literature.  (By ""elementary,"" I mean using only standard facts of axiomatic Euclidean geometry.) Does anyone know of a reference for a proof of this fact (elementary or not)?  Or can anyone think of a straightforward elementary proof?  You can use any definition of ""convex polygon"" that you like, but the easiest one to work with is that for each edge, the vertices not on that edge lie on one side of the line through that edge. (Interestingly, the corresponding fact for circumscribed circles--i.e., that every polygon with a circumscribed circle is convex--is quite easy to prove: If P has a circumscribed circle, any two nonadjacent sides of P are non-intersecting chords of the circle; it is easy to show that both endpoints of each chord lie on the same side of the line through the other, and from there it is an easy matter to prove that P is convex.)","['geometry', 'euclidean-geometry']"

I have seen the definition of a Modular form in Wikipedia, but i can't correlate this with an elliptic curve. The definition of an elliptic curve is simply a cubic equation of the form $y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b$. How can it be a modular form? Next, there was a mention of this Mathematician named ""Gerhard Frey"" who seems to considered this question of what could happen if there was a solution to the equation, $x^{n}+y^{n}=z^{n}$, and by considering this he constructed a curve which is not modular, contradicting Taniyama-Shimura. If he had constructed such a curve then what was the need for Prof. Ribet to actually prove the Epsilon conjecture. Lastly, here i would like to know this answer: How many of you agree with Wiles, that possibly Fermat could have fooled himself by saying that he had a proof of this result?

4963,In which commutative algebras does any derivation possess a flow?,"Suppose $A$ is a commutative algebra over $\mathbb{R}$ with unity. $\mathbb{R}$-linear map $\xi\colon A\to A$ is a derivation of $A$ iff $\xi(ab)=a\xi(b)+\xi(a)b$ for any $a,b\in A$. If $\gamma\colon \mathbb{R}\to A$, $a\in A$, then we say, that $a=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}| _ {t=\tau} \gamma(t)$ iff $h(a) =\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|_{t=\tau} h(\gamma(t))$ for any $\mathbb{R}$-linear map $h\colon A\to\mathbb{R}$.

Algebra $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth functions on a closed manifold $M$ --- yes (if I haven't made a mistake), any derivation possesses a flow. This, I believe, can be checked using Picard-Lindelof theorem . 2. Algebra $C^\infty((0,1))$ of smooth functions on an interval --- no, $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ does not possess a flow. 3. Algebra $C^\infty([0,1])$ of smooth functions on a segment --- yes, any derivation possesses a flow, but it's not always unique (for example, for $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ it is not). In order to prove this, one can consider an embedding of $[0,1]$ to some closed manifold $N$ and prolong any function from $[0,1]$ to $N$. Then use example 1. 4. Algebra $C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ --- no, because it is isomorphic to the algebra from example 2. 5. Algebra $\mathbb{R}[x]$ --- no. In order to prove this one can consider derivation $\xi=x^2\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ and manually solve equation (1) for $a=x$. Any solution locally should be of the form $\frac{x}{1+xt}$. It is not in $\mathbb{R}[x]$. 6. Algebra $\mathbb{R}[x,y]/(x^2+y^2-1)$ --- no. In order to prove this take $\xi = y (x\frac{\partial}{\partial y} - y \frac{\partial}{\partial x})=\sin(\varphi)\frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi}$ and solve equation (1) manually (locally) in polar coordinates (take, for example, $a=y$).

I am at the very frustrating point of knowing what I need to do, and how it is theoretically done, but not really grasping how to actually do it.

So, I'd love some help on how to calculate the intersection and normal of some of these shapes, and any sort of general case rules for these calculations would be fantastic.

4989,Calulating length of cable running along exterior of an axle,"This question may seem simple, but I have no idea where to start. I'm in design phase of a hobby electronics project and need your help. Basically, I'm going to have two platforms with electronics on both of them.

I plan to use a microcontroller to precisely control the intensity of angular velocity of the motor and the angle by which it will rotate. I will also need to use wires to connect the bottom platform to the top platform. My idea is to have wires run on the outside of the axle and be long enough that the axle will be able to rotate by some angle of $±θ$. In normal operation the angle shouldn't be grater than 2π, so I want to avoid constructing some complex mechanism which will transfer current irrelevant of the axle's rotation. Image (I apologize for my bad drawing skills) shows the two states which are interesting (at least in my opinion) here. The top is when the axle is in neutral position and angle by which it is rotated is 0. While the image does not show it, the wire will be loose. The bottom image shows what I expect will happen after the axle has been rotated by a certain angle. 
The two black rectangles are soldering joints by which the cable will be connected to the bottom and the top platforms. The red line is wire. Here 's direct link to the image. It is more clear there. Here's my question: Is I have an axle with length L and radius R, how would I calculate length l of a cable running form the top of the axle to the bottom after axle has rotated by a certain angle θ?

4990,How could I calculate the rank of the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - 432$?,"The birational change of variables $(u,v) = (\frac{36+y}{6x},\frac{36-y}{6x})$ maps $u^3+v^3=1$ to $y^2 = x^3 - 432$ which has discriminant $-2^{12}\cdot 3^9$. Using pari/gp we can compute the torsion subgroup: ? elltors(ellinit([0,0,0,0,-432]))
%1 = [3, [3], [[12, 36]]] This says the torsion subgroup has order 3, is $\mathbf{Z}/3\mathbf{Z}$ and is generated by $(12,36)$ (which corresponds to $1^3+0^3=1^3$). The reason it has order 3 is because this also includes the projective solution $[0:0:1]$ of $X^3+Y^3=Z^3$. Edit : By Nagell-Lutz one only needs to solve $y^2 = x^3 - 432$ in integers for $y=0$ and $y^2|2^{12}\cdot 3^9$ (which is a simple generate and test) to compute the elements of the torsion subgroup 'on paper'. The group of rational points for this curve is then (by Mordell's Theorem) of the form $\mathbf{Z}^r \times \mathbf{Z}/3\mathbf{Z}$ where $r$ is the rank of the curve. If we can show the rank is 0 then this would prove fermats last theorem for $n = 3$.

Of course, the function with minimum $s$ that satisfies the above conditions is $f(x) = x$ with $s = \sqrt 2$. So for $s = \sqrt 2$, exactly one matching function can be found. But what happens to the number of these functions if $s$ increases? Surely, more functions can be found to match the given arc length - uncountably many more I suppose due to the nature of the real numbers.

So, despite continuum cardinality, are there any means of measuring the number of such functions against $s$ or is it all the same once that minimal way of $f(x) = x$ as been taken?

5185,What's the probability that a sum of dice is prime?,"Prompted by today's Minute Math question on the MAA site ( http://amc.maa.org/mathclub/5-0,problems/T-problems/T-web,ia/2005web/tb05-12-ia.shtml ), I started thinking about the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled on a set of $n$ dice is prime, particularly the asymptotics as $n\rightarrow\infty$.  Heuristics strongly suggest that this is proportional to $1/\mathrm{ln}\ n$, and in fact, that it's $1/\mathrm{ln}\ n - O(1/\mathrm{ln}^2n)$, but I'm wondering how I would go about getting better asymptotics on the second term. For the record, the heuristic argument goes something like this: assume for concreteness' sake that we're rolling 6-sided dice.  Then the sum of the dice is closely approximated by a normal variable with mean $\mu=7n/2$ and variance $\sigma^2=35n/12$, and since the PNT says that the 'probability' of an integer $n$ being prime is roughly $1/\mathrm{ln}\ n$, we should be able to integrate that probability with respect to the normal distribution:
$$p = {1\over \sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\int_n^{6n} e^{-\left({(t-\mu)^2\over 2\sigma^2}\right)} {1\over\mathrm{ln}\ t} dt$$
And since $1/\mathrm{ln}\ t$ is monotonic, the value of the integral is bounded by the values we get by replacing its term in the integral with its maximum and minimum values on the integration interval:
$${1\over\mathrm{ln}\ 6n} {1\over \sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\int_n^{6n} e^{-\left({(t-\mu)^2\over 2\sigma^2}\right)} dt < p < {1\over\mathrm{ln}\ n} {1\over \sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\int_n^{6n} e^{-\left({(t-\mu)^2\over 2\sigma^2}\right)} dt$$
Both of the integrals in the latter formula are essentially 1 (by definition), so we get ${1\over\mathrm{ln}\ 6n} < p < {1\over\mathrm{ln}\ n}$; replacing $\mathrm{ln}\ 6n$ by $(\mathrm{ln}\ 6 + \mathrm{ln}\ n)$ and using the binomial formula gives the heuristic approximation I alluded to above.  This leads me to a couple of questions: How safe is the heuristic argument above?  I know that the PNT gives good bounds on the number of primes in an interval (on the order of $n^{1/2}$ here, which in particular means that the error from the prime-counting would be $O(n^{-1/2})$ and so much smaller than the inverse-log terms above), but my analytic number theory isn't good enough to know whether 'weighting' by the normal distribution would throw off the classical proofs. How would I go about evaluating the integral above?  Obviously the bounds I use bring it in to a fairly small range, but it seems as though to get a second term in my asymptotics I'd need to be able to at least approximate the integral, and there aren't any obvious tricks that look like they'd handle it well...","['number-theory', 'dice', 'prime-numbers', 'recreational-mathematics', 'probability']"

Any help will be appreciated: Show that if $t$ is transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$, then $\mathbb{Q}(t,\sqrt{t^3-t})$ is not a purely transcendental extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. Here's what I've got so far: Abbreviate $\sqrt{t^3-t}$ as $u$. I've shown that the transcendence degree is 1, so the problem boils down to showing that $\mathbb{Q}(t,u) \supset \mathbb{Q}(f(t,u)/g(t,u))$ strictly, for all polynomials $f,g$ in two variables. Suppose for contradiction that $\mathbb{Q}(t,u) = \mathbb{Q}(f(t,u)/g(t,u))$. Look at this field as $\mathbb{Q}(t)[x]/(x^2-(t^3-t))$, with $\bar{x}=u$. Then since $t$ and $u$ are generated by $f/g$, we have that for some polynomials $a,b,c,d$ in 1 variable, $a(\frac{f(t,x)}{g(t,x)})/b(\frac{f(t,x)}{g(t,x)})-t \in (x^2-(t^3-t))$, and $c(\frac{f(t,x)}{g(t,x)})/d(\frac{f(t,x)}{g(t,x)}) - x \in (x^2-(t^3-t))$.

5291,How to find a suitable contour to integrate round?,"I am having trouble answering the following question: Problem By integrating the function: $$f(z) = \frac{R + z}{z(R - z)}$$ round a suitable contour, prove that, for $0 \leq r < R$, $$\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{R^2-r^2}{R^2 - 2Rr\cos(\theta) + r^2}\mathrm{d}\theta = 1   $$ My Attempt What I think they want me to do is to use the equation: $$\int_C f(z) \mathrm{d}z  =  \int_{z_1}^{z_2} f(z) \mathrm{d}z = \int_a^bf(z(t))\cdot z'(t)\mathrm{d}t  $$ where C is a contour from $z_1$ to $z_2$ and $z(a) = z_1$ and $z(b) = z_2$. Then I should find a contour $z(t)$ in terms of $r$ and $t$ such that: $$f(z(t))\cdot z'(t) = \frac{R^2-r^2}{R^2 - 2Rr\cos(t) + r^2}  $$ And then with this contour I could find values for $z_1$ and $z_2$ meaning I could evaluate: $$ \int_{z_1}^{z_2} f(z) \mathrm{d}z  $$ which should equal 2$\pi$ or something. However so far I have not been able to find a suitable z(t). The closest I have come is $z(t) = re^{i\theta}$ which yields: $$f(z(t))\cdot z'(t) = \frac{R^2\cdot i - 2Rr\sin(t) + r - r^2\cdot i}{R^2 - 2Rr\cos(t) + r^2}  $$ However this entire approach could be wrong. I've got to the stage when you start to question your whole approach and feel like resorting to violence...According to Einstein, only insane people do the same thing over and over again and expect different results......Oh wait that's me... Please help me. Edit 1 First of all a big thank you to everyone who has helped me here - your hints are like a life raft to a drowning man! To Mariano: I have not done anything on residues at this stage in the course - so the question should be answerable without using them.  That technique does look very powerful though and I hope I will get a good understanding of it in the future... To Hans Lundmark: Your link helped me to see the bigger picture put this equation in context (wow its more that a figment of my prof's imagination!)...Thanks. To J. M: Your note helped a lot to remove the log jam in my head but there are still some issues that remain with my answer. I would very much appreciate your comments on my 2nd attempt. 2nd Attempt (Step 1) The function $f(z)$ can be decomposed using partial fractions: $$f(z) = \frac{R + z}{z(R - z)}  = \frac{1}{z} + \frac{2}{R - z}$$ and then integrated with respect to $z$: $$\int f(z)dz = log(z) - 2log(R - z) $$ (Step 2) With this information we can evaluate: $$\int_C f(z)dz $$ where C is the positively oriented circle $z = re^{i\theta}$. Because log(z) is not defined at its branch cut we cannot integrate around the whole circle but must split the circle into halves $C_1$ and $C_2$. Let $C_1$ denote the right half of the circle where $ -\frac{\pi}{2} <= \theta <= \frac{\pi}{2}$ and consider the branch: $log(z) = ln(r) + i\theta$ where $-\pi <= \theta <= \pi$. Therefore: $$ \int_{C_1} f(z) = [log(z) - 2log(R - z)]_{-ri}^{ri} $$ which equals: $$ \int_{C_1} f(z)dz = \pi{i} - 2log(R - ri) + 2log(R + ri) $$ Let $C_2$ denote the left half of the circle where $\frac{\pi}{2} <= \theta <= \frac{3\pi}{2}$ and consider the branch: $log(z) = ln(r) + i\theta$ where $0 <= \theta <= 2\pi$. Therefore: $$ \int_{C_2} f(z) = [log(z) - 2log(R - z)]_{ri}^{-ri} $$ which equals: $$ \int_{C_2} f(z)dz = \pi{i} - 2log(R + ri) + 2log(R - ri) $$ and since: $$ \int_{C} f(z)dz = \int_{C_1} f(z)dz + \int_{C_2} f(z)dz  $$ it follows that: $$ \int_{C} f(z)dz = 2\pi{i}  $$ (Step 3) This is the part I am currently having difficulty with: Does the equation: $$\int_C f(z) \mathrm{d}z  =  \int_a^bf(z(t))\cdot f'(t) dt $$ imply that: $$\Im\int_C f(z) \mathrm{d}z  =  \int_a^b\Im[{f(z(t))}\cdot f'(t) dt] $$ Because if it did I could say that: $$ \Im(2\pi{i}) = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{R^2-r^2}{R^2 - 2Rr\cos(\theta) + r^2}\mathrm{d}\theta   $$ and the proof would be complete...But I dont know if I can do this? Can some one help please? Edit 2 Thanks to J.M step 3 should be: Since the integral operator is linear: $$ \int z(t) \mathrm{d}t=\int \Re z(t) \mathrm{d}t+i\int \Im z(t) \mathrm{d}t$$ therfore: $$ \int_C f(z) \mathrm{d}z  =  \int_a^b\Re{f(z(t))}\cdot f'(t) dt + i\int_a^b\Im{f(z(t))}\cdot f'(t) dt $$ also we know that: $$ \int_{0}^{2\pi}\Re[{f(z(t))}\cdot f'(t) dt] = 0 $$ and: $$ \int_C f(z) \mathrm{d}z = 2{\pi}i $$ and: $$ \Im[f(z(t))\cdot z'(t)] = \frac{R^2-r^2}{R^2 - 2Rr\cos(t) + r^2}  $$ Therefore: $$ \int_C f(z) \mathrm{d}z  =  i\int_0^{2\pi}\Im[{f(z(t))}\cdot f'(t)] dt $$ $$ 2{\pi}i  =  i\int_0^{2\pi}\Im[{f(z(t))}\cdot f'(t)] dt $$ $$ 2{\pi}  =  \int_0^{2\pi}\Im[{f(z(t))}\cdot f'(t)] dt $$ $$ 2{\pi}  =  \int_0^{2\pi}\frac{R^2-r^2}{R^2 - 2Rr\cos(t) + r^2}dt  $$ and the proof is complete.

5297,Colimit of topological groups (again),"In Direct limit , Martin rightly pointed out that my naive construction (now deleted) of the colimit (direct limit) of topological abelian groups was wrong. He shows how to do it properly (at least the coproduct) here . Since then, I've been lurking some of the literature about the subject and this problem of the colimit of topological groups (about which I had previously no idea) seems at the same time classical and topical. For instance, this 1998's paper points out that the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mathematics, second edition, MIT (1987), article 210, has made the same mistake that I did, stating that the direct limit of topological groups, with the inductive limit of topologies (my naive attempt) has always a continuous multiplication. The authors of this paper show a counter-example (example 1.2, page 553) and here is my question: I must be absolutely dumb, but don't understand it. Could anyone help me? For those who don't have access to the paper, here is the example. Let $G_n = \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{R}^n$ with the usual topology. Imbed $G_n \hookrightarrow G_{n+1}$ as $x \mapsto (x,0)$ . Then, as a plain abelian group, $G = \varinjlim_{n} G_n= \mathbb{Q} \times \prod'\mathbb{R}$ , where $\prod'\mathbb{R}$ denotes the weak or restricted product, which is the way guys in this area call the direct sum ; that is, elements of $\prod'\mathbb{R}$ are infinite tuples $( x_1, \dots , x_n, \dots )$ , in which all of its components $x_n \in \mathbb{R}$ are zero, except a finite number of them. The inductive limit topology is the finest one that makes all the inclusions $G_n \hookrightarrow G$ continuous. That is, $U \subset G$ is open if and only if $U\cap G_n$ is open for all $n$ . Let's see how they show that, with this inductive topology, the ""product"" (in fact, addition) $\mu : G \times G \longrightarrow G$ is not continuous ( $\mu$ is the operation induced as an honest colimit of groups -no topologies- by the operations $\mu_n : G_n \times G_n \longrightarrow G_n$ , which I assume are the usual additions of those linear spaces). In plain English: $$
(x_0, x_1, \dots , x_n , \dots ) + (y_0, y_1, \dots , y_n , \dots ) = (x_0+y_0, x_1 + y_1 , \dots , x_n + y_n , \dots ) \ .
$$ So, in this situation it's enough to produce an open neighbourhood $U \subset G$ of the neutral element $e \in G$ such that $V^2$ is not in $U$ , for any open neighbourhood $V$ of $e$ -where, I assume, $V^2$ means $V + V$ . Ok, here is the guy that is supposed to ruin (and sure it does) my naive attempt: $$
U = \left\{ 
x = (x_0, x_1, \dots , x_n , \dots ) \quad \vert \quad \vert x_j\vert < \vert \cos (jx_0) \vert \ , 1 \leq j
\right\}  \ .
$$ This guy is an open set of $G$ because $x_0$ being a rational number guarantees $\cos (jx_0) \neq 0$ for all $j$ . Assume there is an open neighbourhood $V$ of $e$ such that $V^2 \subset U$ . Then, $V \cap G_j$ contains an open interval $(-\varepsilon_j , \varepsilon_j)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ with $\epsilon_j > 0$ such that $$
(-\varepsilon_0 , \varepsilon_0) \times (-\varepsilon_j , \varepsilon_j) \subset 
\left\{
(x_0 , x_j) \in \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{R} \quad \vert \quad \vert x_j\vert < \vert \cos (jx_0) \vert
\right\}  \ .
$$ And here come the two final sentences of the example I don't understand: This is impossible if $2j\varepsilon_0 > \pi$ . A contradiction. Any hints or remarks (even humiliating ones) will be welcome.","['general-topology', 'topological-groups']"

5315,Notions of equivalent metrics,"Let $X$ be a set, and $d,d'$ two metrics on $X$.  Consider the identity map $i : (X,d) \to (X,d')$ as a map of metric spaces.  There are (at least) three reasonable notions of equivalence for $d$ and $d'$, in increasing order of strength: $i$ is a homeomorphism, i.e. $d$ and $d'$ induce the same topology on $X$. $i$ and $i^{-1}$ are uniformly continuous. $i$ is bilipschitz, i.e. $C_1 d' \le d \le C_2 d'$. I would like to know what terms are used for these notions. In particular, Mathworld says that the term ""equivalent"" refers to sense 1.  This seems counterintuitive since, for instance, sense 1 does not preserve completeness.  Munkres's General Topology uses ""metrically equivalent"" for sense 2.  Does this agree with people's experience of standard usage? Edit: I will point out that 3 implies 2 implies 1 (since Lipschitz implies uniformly continuous implies continuous) but converses are false.  Let $X = \mathbb{R}$, let $d_1(x,y) = |x-y|$, $d_2(x,y) = |x-y| \wedge 1$, $d_3(x,y) = |\phi(x)-\phi(y)|$, where $\phi : \mathbb{R}\to (0,1)$ is your favorite homeomorphism.  In sense 1 all three are equivalent, in sense 2 $d_1 \sim d_2 \not\sim d_3$, and in sense 3 all are inequivalent.  In particular note that $d_1, d_2$ are complete but $d_3$ is not. Edit: Further confusing the matter is the fact that if $X$ is a vector space and $d,d'$ are induced by norms $||\cdot||, ||\cdot||'$, then all three senses coincide, and sense 3 is usually taken as the definition of ""equivalent norms.""","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'terminology']"

    s_1 s_2 \dots s_m,
$$ where each $s_i$ is either an element of $G$ or an element of $H$ . So what is this ""word"" guy? Does it come out of the blue? Does it come from some sort of new operation that I can perform with the two sets $G$ and $H$ -in addition to the well-known ones of union, intersection, Cartesian product...? Fortunatelly, I think there is nothing new under the sun of set operations: it's easy to realise that words can be identified with elements of some Cartesian product (see below): $$
(s_1, s_2, \dots , s_m )  \ .
$$ And Cartesian product is a well-established set-theoretical operation. So I tried to translate the rest of Wikipedia's definition Such a word may be reduced using the following operations: Remove an instance of the identity element (of either $G$ or $H$ ).
  Replace a pair of the form $g_1g_2$ by its product in $G$ , or a pair $h_1h_2$ by its product in $H$ . Every reduced word is an alternating product of elements of $G$ and elements of $H$ , e.g. $$
 g_1 h_1 g_2 h_2 \dots g_r h_r.
 $$ The free product $G ∗ H$ is the group whose elements are the reduced words in $G$ and $H$ , under the operation of concatenation followed by reduction. in an elementary set setting. First, consider the set of ""unreduced"" tuples of elements of $G$ and $H$ $$
U =  G \sqcup H \sqcup (G\times G) \times (G\times H) \sqcup (H\times G) \sqcup (H\times H) \sqcup (G\times G \times G) \sqcup \dots 
$$ More concisely: EDIT: I think the following formula may be less messier than the one I wrote previously: $$
U = \bigsqcup_{r \geq 1} (S_1 \times \cdots \times S_r),
$$ where $S_i = G$ or $S_i = H$ . So, elements of $U$ are ordered tuples ( unreduced ones) $$
(s_1, s_2, \dots , s_m),
$$ where each $s_i$ is either an element of $G$ or an element of $H$ . The product of two unreduced tuples is defined by concatenation $$
(s_1, \dots , s_m) \cdot (t_1,  \dots , t_n) = (s_1, \dots , s_m, t_1 , \dots , t_n) \ .
$$ Now, consider the following equivalence relation in the set of unreduced tuples $U$ : $$
(s_1, s_2, \dots , s_{i-1}, 1, s_{i+1}, \dots , s_n) \sim (s_1, s_2, \dots, s_{i-1}, s_i, \dots , s_n) \ ,
$$ where $1$ is either the unit element of $G$ or the one of $H$ . And $$
(s_1, s_2, \dots , s_i,s_{i+1}, \dots , s_r) \sim (s_1, s_2, \dots , s_is_{i+1}, \dots , s_r )
$$ whenever two adjacent $s_i, s_{i+1} \in G$ or $s_i, s_{i+1} \in H$ at the same time. If you want, you may call the equivalence class of a tuple under this equivalence relation a reduced tuple. So every reduced tuple is an alternating one, $$
(g_1, h_1, \dots , g_r , h_r) \ ,
$$ with $g_i \in G$ and $h_i \in H$ for all $i = 1, \dots , r$ . Define the free product of $G$ and $H$ as the quotient: $$
G*H = U/\sim \ .
$$ Finally, one verifies that concatenation is well-defined on unreduced tuples and gives $G*H$ a group structure.

5408,Limit of the sequence $nx_{n}$ where $x_{n+1} = \log (1 +x_{n})$ [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : $a_{n+1}=\log(1+a_n),~a_1>0$. Then find $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} n \cdot a_n$ (1 answer) Closed 5 years ago . Suppose $x_{1}>0$, and consider the sequence, $\{x_{n}\}$ defined as follows: $$x_{n+1}=\log(1+x_{n}) \quad n\geq 1 $$ Find the value of $\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} nx_{n}$ I am having trouble solving it. One thing is clear, that since $x_{n}>0$ and $x_{n+1} < x_{n}$, we can have a sequence which converges an $f$ which satisfies $f=\log(1+f)$, so that $f=0$. Any way as to how we can proceed from here.","['asymptotics', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
5416,geometric meaning of differentiation with respect to the complex conjugate of $z$,"The derivative of a function $f: C \rightarrow C$ with respect to $\overline{z}$ is defined as
$$ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \right) $$
where $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ is defined as the operator which maps $u+iv$ to $u_x + iv_x$, and $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ is defined likewise. I am wondering whether there is a geometric way to think about this quantity.",['complex-analysis']
