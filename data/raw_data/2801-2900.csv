19681,When is a notion of convergence induced by a topology?,"I'm interested in sufficient conditions for a notion of sequential convergence to be induced by a topology. More precisely: Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{C}$ endowed with a notion $\tau$ of sequential convergence. When is there a topology $\mathcal{O}$ on $V$ that makes $V$ a topological vector space such that ""sequences suffice"" in $(V,\mathcal{O})$, e.g. $(V,\mathcal{O})$ is first countable, and convergence in $(V,\mathcal{O})$ coincides with $\tau$-convergence? Is the topology $\mathcal{O}$ uniquely determined? By a notion $\tau$ of sequential convergence on a vector space $V$ I mean a ""rule"" $\tau$ which assigns to certain sequences $(v_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subset V$ (which one would call convergent sequences) an element $v\in V$ (a limit of $(v_n)_n$). One could write $v_n\stackrel{\tau}{\to}v$ in this case. This process of ""assigning a limit"" should satisfy at least that any constant sequence $(v,v,v,...)$ is convergent and is assigned the limit $v$. Also, given a convergent sequence $(v_n)_n$ with limit $v$ any subsequence $(v_{n_k})_k$ should have $v$ as a limit. I would also like this concept of assigning a limit to be compatible with addition in $V$ and multiplication by a scalar. Maybe one should include further restrictions. In fact I would like to know which further assumptions on this ""limiting process"" one has to assume in order to ensure that this limiting procedure corresponds to an actual topology on $V$ which makes $V$ a topological vector space in which a sequence converges if and only if it $\tau$-converges. Let me give two examples. If we take for instance a topological vector space $(V,\mathcal{O})$ then we have a notion of convergence in $V$ based upon the set $\mathcal{O}$ of open sets of $V$. This notion of convergence clearly satisfies the above assumptions on $\tau$. If on the other hand we consider $L^\infty([0,1])$ equipped with the notion of pointwise convergence almost everywhere , then there is no topology on $L^\infty([0,1])$ which makes $L^\infty([0,1])$ a TVS in which a sequence converges if and only if it converges pointwise almost everywhere. Still, convergence almost everywhere also satisfies the above assumptions on $\tau$. So the above assumptions on this concept of convergence are necessary but not sufficient conditions for what I mean by a notion of convergence to correspond to an actual topology. The question is: Which further assumptions do I have to make? On a less general level I'm particularly interested in the following case: Let $G\subset\mathbb{C}^d$ be a domain, $X$ a (complex) Banach space and let $H^\infty(G;X)$ denote the space of bounded holomorphic functions $f\colon G\to X$. Now consider the following notion $\tau$ of sequential convergence on $H^\infty(G;X)$: We say that a sequence $(f_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subset H^\infty(G;X)$ $\tau$-converges to $f\in H^\infty(G;X)$ if $\sup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\sup_{z\in G} \|f_n(z)\|_X$ is finite and $f_n(z)$ converges in $X$ to $f(z)$ for every $z\in G$. Is there a topology $\mathcal{O}$ on $H^\infty(G;X)$ such that ""sequences suffice"" in $(H^\infty(G;X),\mathcal{O})$ and a sequence $(f_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subset H^\infty(G;X)$ converges w.r.t. the topology $\mathcal{O}$ if and only if it $\tau$-converges? Is this topology $\mathcal{O}$ unique if existent? What if we drop the ""sequences suffice""-restriction? Is $(H^\infty,\mathcal{O})$ locally convex? Metrizable? What if we replace $X$ by a more general space like a LCTVS or a Frechet space?

19698,Differentiable orthogonal 3D vector,"Does anybody know a simple and differentiable function that converts a 3D vector u = (x, y, z) to another vector that is orthogonal to u . To be more precise, I am looking for three differentiable functions {f, g, h} such that the vector u = (x, y, z) is orthogonal to v = (f(x,y,z), g(x,y,z), h(x,y,z)) and v is zero only if u is zero. The functions {f, g, h} should be as simple as possible. I prefer them linear, but I think no such linear functions exist. Low degree polynomials are also good. P.S. I found such functions, but they are not polynomials. For example: f(x, y, z) = y*(exp(x) + 3) - z*(exp(x) + 2)
g(x, y, z) = z*(exp(x) + 1) - x*(exp(x) + 3)
h(x, y, z) = x*(exp(x) + 2) - y*(exp(x) + 1) It's simply the cross product of (x,y,z) with (exp(x)+1, exp(x)+2, exp(x)+3). It satisfies all requirements except for being polynomials. But they are quite simple.","['multivariable-calculus', '3d']"
19712,The action of SU(2) on the Riemann sphere,"One way to get the famous double cover $\text{SU}(2) \to \text{SO}(3)$ is to note that $\text{SU}(2)$ is isomorphic to the group of unit quaternions and to let unit quaternions $q$ act on the subspace $V$ of $\mathbb{H}$ spanned by $i, j, k$ via conjugation $t \mapsto qtq^{-1}$; this preserves the norm.  (Alternately, this is the adjoint action on the Lie algebra, which preserves the Killing form.) Another way to do this is to let $\text{SU}(2)$ act on $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$, which is diffeomorphic to the sphere.  This gives an action of $\text{SU}(2)$ by conformal automorphisms.  However, I don't know how to prove that $\text{SU}(2)$ actually acts by rotations (at least, not without some explicit and unenlightening calculations). To be more precise, if we fix an inner product on $\mathbb{C}^2$, then the space of lines in $\mathbb{C}^2$ can be given the Fubini-Study metric , which $\text{SU}(2)$ preserves.  But how can I prove that the Fubini-Study metric agrees with the natural metric on the sphere (up to a constant)?","['lie-groups', 'complex-analysis']"

19764,"What is the smallest value of $n$ for which $\phi(n) \ne \phi(k)$ for any $k<n,$ where $n=4m$?","Let $\phi(n)$ be Euler's totient function. For $n=4m$ what is the smallest $n$ for which $$\phi(n) \ne \phi(k) \textrm{ for any } k<n \textrm{ ?} \quad (1)$$ When $n=4m+1$ and $n>1$ the smallest is $n=5$ and when $n=4m+3$ it's $n=3.$ However, when
$n=4m+2$ the above condition can never be satisfied since $$\phi(4m+2) = (4m+2) \prod_{p | 4m+2} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right)$$
$$ = (2m+1) \prod_{p | 2m+1} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right) = \phi(2m+1).$$ In the case $n=4m,$ $n=2^{33}$ is a candidate and $\phi(2^{33})=2^{32}.$ This value satisfies $(1)$ because $\phi(n)$ is a power of $2$ precisely when $n$ is the product of a power of $2$ and any number of distinct Fermat primes: $$2^1+1,2^2+1,2^4+1,2^8+1 \textrm{ and } 2^{16}+1.$$ Note the $n=2^{32}$ does not satisfy condition $(1)$ because the product of the above Fermat primes is $2^{32}-1$ and so $\phi(2^{32})=2^{31}=\phi(2^{32}-1)$ and
$2^{32}-1 < 2^{32}.$ The only solutions to $\phi(n)=2^{32}$ are given by numbers of the form
$n=2^a \prod (2^{x_i}+1)$ where $x_i \in \lbrace 1,2,4,8,16 \rbrace $ and
$a+ \sum x_i = 33$ (note that the product could be empty),
so all these numbers are necessarily $ \ge 2^{33}.$ Why don't many ""small"" multiples of $4$ satisfy condition $(1)$? Well, note that for $n=2^a(2m+1)$ we have $$\phi(2^a(2m+1))= 2^a(2m+1) \prod_{p | 2^a(2m+1)} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right)$$
$$ = 2^{a-1}(2m+1) \prod_{p | 2m+1} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right) = 2^{a-1}\phi(2m+1),$$ and so, for $a \ge 2,$ if $2^{a-1}\phi(2m+1)+1$ is prime we can take this as our value of $k<n$ and we have $\phi(n)=\phi(k).$ This, together with the existence of the Fermat primes, seems to be why it's difficult to satisfy when $n=4m.$ I have only made hand calculations so far, so I would not be too surprised if the answer is much smaller than my suggestion. The problem is well within the
reach of a computer, and possibly further analysis without the aid of a computer. But, anyway, I've decided to ask here as many of you have ready access to good mathematical
software and I'm very intrigued to know whether there is a smaller solution than $2^{33}.$ Some background information: This question arose in my search to bound the function $\Phi(n)$ defined as follows. Let $\Phi(n)$ be the number of distinct values taken on by $\phi(k)$ for $1 \le k \le n.$
For example, $\Phi(13)=6$ since $\phi(k)$ takes on the values $\lbrace 1,2,4,6,10,12 \rbrace$ for $1 \le k \le 13.$ It is clear that $\Phi(n)$ is increasing and increases by $1$ at each prime value of $n,$ except $n=2,$ but it also increases at other values as well. For example, $\Phi(14)=6$ and $\Phi(15)=7.$ Currently, for an upper bound, I'm hoping to do better than $\Phi(n) \le \lfloor (n+1)/2 \rfloor .$ But this this not the issue at the moment, although it may well become a separate question.

If its speed, $|\vec{v}(t)|=constant$, then prove that at any point which $\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$ is non-zero, $\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$ is perpendicular to $\vec{v}(t)$. In other words, if a velocity vector has constant speed, show that whenever its acceleration vector is non-zero, it is perpendicular to that velocity vector. Intuitively this seems clear, since whenever the speed is remains constant, the acceleration is 0.  Why though are the velocity and acceleration vectors perpendicular though?  Because they share no intersection when the acceleration is non-zero since the speed is constant? I'm assuming we should somehow show that $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{a} = 0$.

Each university can participate with 3 students, and approximately half of them get a recognition - which can be first (5%), second (15%) or third place (30%). To be more specific, let's say 5 universities participated in a competition and the first university won 2 first place recognitions and 1 second place recognitions, the second university won 2 third place recognitions, etc... Probably a good way of measuring universities is by the total number of recognitions won, or the number of first place recognitions won, followed by number of second place recognitions won etc. Now, my question is: How do we rank the quality of education in the universities if we know for each university how many students learn there? I'm asking this because it's probably a good idea to take into account the number of students? One possibility that I was thinking of is to divide the number of achievements with the number of students and use that to compare universities, but the problem here is that each school can participate with only 3 students (probably if the largest university participated with more than 3 students it would have won more recognitions).

The distribution function of a measurable function $f\colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ on a measure space $(X, M, \mu)$ is a function $\lambda_f\colon (0,\infty) \to [0,\infty]$ given by $\lambda_f(\alpha) = \mu(\{x\colon |f(x)| > \alpha\})$.

&\frac{|z-w|}{|1-\bar{w}z|} \leq |z| + |w| \\
&\Rightarrow \frac{|z|^2-2Re(\bar{w}z)-|w|^2}{1-2Re(\bar{w}z) + |w|^2|z|^2} \leq (|z|+|w|)^2 \\
&\Rightarrow -2Re(\bar{w}z) \leq 2|z||w| + (|w|^2|z|^2 - 2 Re(\bar{w}z))(|z| +|w|)^2\

I haven't been able to figure out what happens in the case that $2Re(\bar{w}z) >0$ though. On a separate note, whenever I come across these types of problems, I always try to multiply everything out and see if I can get enough terms to cancel so that the inequality becomes obvious.

19997,A proof of the Isoperimetric Inequality - how does it work?,"Here is a nice proof of the isoperimetric inequality (equality part ommited): Isoperimetric Inequality If $\gamma$ is any simple closed piecewise $C^1$ curve of length $l$, with it's interior having area $A$, then $4\pi A \le l^2$. Furthermore, if equality holds then $\gamma$ is a circle. Proof. Take two parallel straight lines $L$ and $L'$ such that $\gamma$ is between them and move them together until they first touch the curve. See my nice picture below. Let C be a circle as in the picture. Take $x$ and $y$ axes as shown. Let $\gamma = (x,y)$ be a parametrization of $\gamma$. Pick points $\gamma (s_0)$ and $\gamma (s_1)$ on both $L$ and $L'$ wherever the lines touch the curve, respectively. Let $C$ be parametrized by $(x, \overline{y})$ where $$
\overline{y}(s) =
\begin{cases}
 + \sqrt{r^2 - x^2 (s)}, & \text{if } s_0 \le s \le s_1 \\
 - \sqrt{r^2 - x^2 (s)}, & \text{if } s_1 \le s \le s_0 + l
\end{cases}
$$ Denote the derivative of $f$ with respect to $s$ as $f_s$. Using Green's Theorem, we write: $$A + \pi r^2 = \int_{\gamma} x\,dy + \int_C -y\,dx = \int^l_0 x(s)y_s(s)\,ds - \int^l_0 \overline{y}(s)x_s(s)\,ds = $$ $$ = \int^l_0 ( x(s)y_s(s) - \overline{y}(s)x_s(s)) \,ds \le \int^l_0 \sqrt{ (x(s)y_s(s) - \overline{y}(s)x_s(s))^2} \,ds \stackrel{*}{\le}$$ $$ \stackrel{*}{\le} \int^l_0 \sqrt{ (x^2(s) + \overline{y}^2(s))} \,ds = lr$$ Where the starred inequality follows from the fact that: $$(x y_s - \overline{y} x_s)^2 = [(x, - \overline{y}) \cdot (y_s, x_s)]^2 \le (x^2 + \overline{y}^2) \cdot (y^2_s + x^2_s) = x^2 + \overline{y}^2 $$ So we have that $A + \pi r^2 \le lr$. Next we employ the Geometric-Arithmetic Mean Inequality to find that: $$\sqrt{A \pi r^2} \le \dfrac{A + \pi r^2}{2} \le \dfrac{lr}{2}$$ From which it directly follows that $4 \pi A \le l^2$, as needed. $\square$ I have seen other proofs of this Theorem, for example the one using Wirtinger's Inequality. This proof was presented to me by my professor, who said this it was rather mysterious , and I agree. I think this proof is rather beautiful and much simpler than the other proofs. Here are my questions: How? How does it work? I do not mean to ask how to we get from one step to another. I mean to ask what makes this work intrinsically. In particular, I am bothered by this constructed circle, and its radius. The next picture is what I have in mind: For this curve $\gamma$, choosing two different pairs of lines $L$, $L'$ and $K$, $K'$ gives us two circles with different radii. Furthermore, note that it appears that the area of the smaller circle is less that the area traced out by $\gamma$, whereas it is not the case for the larger circle. I guess my question here can be rephrased as: why do the $r$'s magically fall out of the equation in the last step? I am not looking for an anwser of the type ""because the math works out that way,"" rather some geometric insight/explanation. One observation I have thought about is that in case of equality $4 \pi A = l^2$, i.e. when $\gamma$ is a circle, any circle given by our construction will always have equall radius, in fact the radius of the circle $\gamma$. From that I was led to this question: Suppose we take $n$ pairs of parallel lines (where two distinct pairs of pairs are not mutually parallel), and construct circles for each. Now, as $n \rightarrow \infty$, what will happen to the average radius of these circles? What will a circle with this radius represent? EDIT: I have found an example where this last question turns out to be rather uninteresting. However, what will happen if we assume the curve to be convex as well? I do not know how to explore this last question with my knowledge whatsoever. Finally, I want to ask if anyone knows how this proof came to be; what is the hidden motivation. Thank you.","['inequality', 'intuition', 'differential-geometry']"

Then < $r^3$ > contains the identity element e and powers of $r^3$, to $r^{27}$. Thus the generator of H is then $r^3$. Would this be okay? b) Since k divides n, we can write n as n = kp  for some p.

In other words, if $\textbf{A} \cdot \textbf{B} = d$, and I know $\textbf{A}$ and $d$, I want to find a $\textbf{B}$.  I know that I cannot do so uniquely, which is fine; I have a procedure for creating a set of vectors that will satisfy $\textbf{A} \cdot \textbf{B} = d$.  But, it relies on finding vectors that are orthogonal to $\textbf{A}$ and each other.  Normally this would not be a problem; just take $\textbf{A}$, zero all but two of its components, switch the last two, and negate one of them.  Make sure it's a different pair every time.  For more orthogonal vectors, you can take cross products. The difficulties arise when I consider vectors with complex components.  I want to normalize each of the orthogonal vectors, which means divide by their magnitudes.  I have read that you need to divide by $\sqrt{|v_x|^2 + |v_y|^2 + |v_z|^2 ...}$.  What is the justification for this?  Since I am just normalizing vectors, do I absolutely have to take the magnitudes of the components?

20251,Integrals as Probabilities,"Firstly, I'm not a mathematician as will become evident in a quick moment. I was pondering some maths the other day and had an interesting thought: If you encased an integrable function over some range in a primitive with an easily computable area, the probability that a random point within said primitive also exists below that function's curve, scaled by the area of the primitive, is the indefinite integral of the function over that domain. So let's say I want to ""solve"" for $\pi$. Exploiting a circle's symmetry, I can define $\pi$ as: $$4 \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{1-x^2} \,dx$$ Which I can ""encase"" in the unit square. Since the area of the unit square is 1, $\pi$ is just 4 * the probability that a point chosen at random within the unit square is below the quarter-circle's arc. I'm sure this is well known, and so my questions are: What is this called? Is there anything significant about
this--for instance, is the
relationship between the integral and
the encasing object of interest--or
is it just another way of phrasing
indefinite integrals? Sorry if this is painfully elementary!","['calculus', 'probability']"

I still need results on its second lowest eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ (note that the lowest eigenvalue of the Laplacian, both the normal and the generalized, is 0).

20321,How can I tell when two cubic Bézier curves intersect?,"I'm working a little program that converges on vector-based approximations of raster images, inspired by Roger Alsing's genetic Mona Lisa . (I started on this after his first blog post two years ago, played a bit, and it's been on the back burner. But I'd like to un-back-burner it because I have some interesting further ideas.) Roger Alsing's program uses randomly-generated sometimes-self-overlapping n-gons. Instead, I'm using Bézier splines linked into what, for lack of a math education, I am calling ""Bézier petal"" shapes. These are, simply, two cubic Bézier curves which share end points (but not control points). You can see this in action in this little youtube video . The shapes I'm currently using are constructed by generating six random points. These are then sorted radially around their center of gravity, and two opposite points become the end-points of the two cubic Bézier curves, with the other four points used as control points where the fit into the order. Because I, as I mentioned, have no math background, I can't prove it, but empirically this guarantees a non-degenerate petal, with no overlaps or twists. But, it's frustratingly limiting, since it will never produce crescents or S shapes — theoretically-valid ""petals"". (The results are not always convex, but concavities can only happen at the end points.) (Here's a video of what happens if I allow self-intersecting shapes — not graceful.) I'd love suggestions for a process which generates all possible non-intersecting shapes. It's clearly better for the application if the process can be done with minimal computation, although I'm willing to pay a bit of time in exchange for nicer results. A further constraint is that small changes in the ""source"" data — in the current case, the six random points — needs to produce relatively small changes in the output, or else my stochastic hill-climbing approach can't get anywhere. Also, it's fine if some input values produce no output — those will just get discarded. Another possible way of asking the same question: is there an optimization for finding whether two cubic Bézier curves that share endpoints intersect? If I can calculate that quickly, I can simply discard the invalid ones.","['geometry', 'bezier-curve']"
