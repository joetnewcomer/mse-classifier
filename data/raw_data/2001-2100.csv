13986,How to solve this rational equation for y,"Greetings! On a test recently I ended up having to solve this for y: $$ x = \frac{2y}{y + 1} $$ But I kept getting stuck in cirlces... $$ 
\begin{aligned}
x(y + 1 ) = 2y  \\
xy + x = 2y \\
\frac{xy + x}{2} = y \\
\end{aligned} 
$$ That didn't get me anywhere, so then I started over and tried multiplying both sides by the reciprocal: $$
\begin{aligned}
(\frac{y+1}{2y})(x) = 1 \\ 
\frac{xy+x}{2y} = 1 \\
\end{aligned}
$$ And still I can't see a way to isolate y. The worst part of this is that I remember being specifically taught a trick for this particular conundrum, but I can't remember the trick! Wolfram gives the answer as $$
y = - \frac{x}{x-2} 
$$ but it doesn't show the steps.","['fractions', 'algebra-precalculus']"
13991,Combinatorics and analysis,"A lot of ""big"" names in analysis (and other fields) seem to be doing some form of combinatorics (without any order, some examples are Tim Gowers, Terence Tao and Jean Bourgain). So, looking a bit around makes me conclude that combinatorics is a huge field. There must be one ""kind"" which is the most fruitful in analysis. What kind is this? What is a good introduction to this? Edit: I forgot, analysis is also a big field. I mean more in the direction of harmonic analysis and PDE. Thanks.","['reference-request', 'combinatorics']"
14004,Convergence of series involving iterated $ \sin $,"I've been trying to show the convergence or divergence of $$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sin^n 1}{n} = \frac{\sin 1}{1} + \frac{\sin \sin 1}{2} + \frac{\sin \sin \sin 1}{3} + \ \cdots $$ where the superscript means iteration ( not multiplication, so it's not simply less than a geometric series -- I couldn't find the standard notation for this). Problem is, $ \sin^n 1 \to 0 $ as $ n \to \infty $ (which I eventually proved by assuming a positive limit and having $ \sin^n 1 $ fall below it, after getting its existence ) helps the series to converge, but at the same time $ \sin^{n+1} 1 = \sin \sin^n 1 \approx \sin^n 1 $ for large $ n $ makes it resemble the divergent harmonic series. I would appreciate it if someone knows a helpful convergence test or a proof (or any kind of advice, for that matter). In case it's useful, here are some things I've tried: Show $ \sin^n 1 = O(n^{-\epsilon}) $ and use the p-series.  I'm not sure that's even true. Computer tests and looking at partial sums.  Unfortunately, $ \sum 1/n $ diverges very slowly, which is hard to distinguish from convergence. Somehow work in the related series $$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos^n 1}{n} = \frac{\cos 1}{1} + \frac{\cos \cos 1}{2} + \frac{\cos \cos \cos 1}{3} + \ \cdots $$ which I know diverges since the numerators approach a fixed point.","['sequences-and-series', 'analysis']"

14040,When does $\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^\alpha (\log n)^\beta$ converge?,"I need to find out for what $\alpha, \beta$ the following sum converges:
$$\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^\alpha (\log n)^\beta$$ I thought I'd do that with the help of the integral criterion, that is to say I considered (after I had substituted $x = e^u$):
$$\int_2^\infty e^{u(\alpha+1)} \cdot u^\beta \mathrm du$$ Then, I realised that for $\alpha + 1 > 0$, the exponential function will always dominate the monomial, so I only considered $\alpha + 1 \leq 0$. First, I let $\alpha + 1=0$, then I would be left with:
$$\int_2^\infty u^\beta \mathrm du$$ I solved the integral and substituted back and ended up with:
$$\lim_{b \to \infty} \frac{(\log b)^{\beta+1}}{\beta+1}$$ I figured this would only converge for $\beta+1 \leq 0$ and thought: ""Ok, now I have some cases, where the sum converges: $\alpha = -1 \land \beta \leq -1$"". To be sure, I checked the integral with the help of wolframalpha, and it told me the integral would not converge. What did I do wrong?

14041,Bijection = bijection + bijection on symmetric integer intervals,"Given a bijection $f:\mathbb Z \to \mathbb Z$ where $\mathbb Z$ is the set of all integers, does there always exist two bijections $g:\mathbb Z \to \mathbb Z$ and $h:\mathbb Z \to \mathbb Z$ which satisfy $f(n) = g(n) + h(n), ~ \forall n \in \mathbb Z$ ? Evidently it does while $\mathbb Z$ is replaced with the set of all rational numbers $\mathbb Q$, since $f(q) = 2f(q) - f(q), ~ \forall q \in \mathbb Q$. Nevertheless, $2f$ doesn't maps $\mathbb Z$ onto $\mathbb Z$, thus it's not a bijection on $\mathbb Z$; therefor we need a new construction
for the $\mathbb Z$ case. Firstly we note that   $0 = 0 + 0$   and
\begin{align*}
1 &= (-2) + 3, &\qquad -1 &= 2 + (-3),\\
2 &= 3 + (- 1), &-2 &= (-3) + 1,\\
3 &= 1 + 2, &-3 &= (-1) + (-2).
\end{align*} It's easy to show that any bijections on the symmetric integer interval $[-3,3]$ can be represented as a sum of two bijections; or equivalently, all integers $a \in [-3,3]$ can be represented as a sum of two others, i.e., $a = b + c$ where $b, c \in [-3, 3]$, while $a,b,c$ exhausted the integer interval $[-3,3]$ respectively, and keeps $0 = 0 + 0$. For convenience, let's denote this fact as $[-3,3] = [-3,3] + [-3,3]$. Suppose now we have $[-m, m] = [-m, m] + [-m, m]$, then we may obtain
$$[-m + aL, ~ m + aL] = [-m + bL, ~ m + bL] + [-m + cL, ~ m + cL],\qquad L = 2m+1,$$
where $a,b,c \in [-n,n]$ for some positive integers $n$, provided $a = b + c$. Well, if $a,b,c$ form a representation, say, $[-n,n] = [-n,n] + [-n,n]$, then we may get a ""larger"" representation
$$[-m - nL, ~ m + nL] = [-m - nL, ~ m + nL] + [-m - nL, ~ m + nL], \qquad L = 2m+1,$$
through the repeatedly use of ""small"" representations; and obviously, the larger representation ""contains"" the small representation as a ""subrepresentation"", since $0 = 0 + 0$. From now on, we may construct a representation $\mathbb Z = \mathbb Z + \mathbb Z$ by induction, start from $[-3,3] = [-3,3] + [-3,3]$. Thus we've proved that any bijections on $\mathbb Z$ can be represented as a sum of two bijections on $\mathbb Z$. Now a problem rises: for any integers $n > 2$, is there always a representation $[-n, n] = [-n, n] + [-n, n]$ ? Note that by our means of ""representation"", $0 = 0 + 0$ is required; otherwise it's trivial; note also the above approach we've used for resolving the ""$\mathbb{Z}$-representation problem"" can't reach all cases. Anyone can answer this question? Please help me.","['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'abstract-algebra', 'number-theory']"
14044,Trick to showing for which primes $p$ is $34$ a square?,"I'm going through an old final from 2003 on MIT's Opencourseware, and problem 6b is giving me a little trouble. It asks for which primes $p$ is $34$ a square modulo $p$. I approached it like this: $$\left(\frac{34}{p}\right)=\left(\frac{2}{p}\right)\left(\frac{17}{p}\right)=(-1)^{(p^2-1)/8}\left(\frac{p}{17}\right).$$ I figure I can break it down into cases where $p\equiv 1,3,5,7\pmod{8}$. So if $p\equiv 1\pmod{8}$, then $(2|p)=1$, and thus I want $(p|17)=1$ as well. I calculated all the squares modulo $17$, and found them to be $1,2,4,8,9,13,15,16$. I suppose I could then go through all cases where $p\equiv 1\pmod{8}$, and $p\equiv 1,2,4,8,\dots\pmod{17}$, and then use the Chinese remainder theorem to find what $p$ is congruent to modulo $8\cdot 17$, but this seems very tedious to do for each case.

(This amounts to the lattice of ideals being distributive .) One example is when $R$ is a polynomial ring or power series ring and $I,J,K$ are monomial ideals.

$ax^2 + by^2 + cz^2 + dxy + exz + fyz + gx + hy + iz + j = 0,$ 
what are the requirements on the coefficients so that this equation represents an ellipsoid? All coefficients are real. Some more context. To make the representation unique, we establish another constraint: $a + c = 1$. I'm not sure how important that might be. The question is in homework where we have to fit this equation to a set of points, using QR-decomposition. That isn't a problem, the small followup question ""how can you see the coefficients determine an ellipsoid"" is the problem. I tried working on the equation to get something usable, from basic term regrouping to putting stuff in matrices and decomposing these, which didn't really help. One theoretic way to do it, I think, is to find the center of mass of the surface, translate to the origin, then find the principal axes, transform again, and show the radii are all larger than 0. Sounds like a lot of work for a simple question, and I'm kind of stuck on the ""center of mass"" part, I don't feel the idea here is to integrate the formula over $\mathbb{R}^3$.

$T$ is temperature, $H$ is humidity, and $P$ is power. I have all the data, and when I draw them in the same graph during one year, meaning that $P$, $T$,  and $H$ vs. hours. I found that the behavior of $P$ is oscillating, making a sinusoidal shape over the entire, year as you can see from the following ($P$ and time only): So, if I make a zoom view to this figure, for example from
the $2000$th hour of the year to the $3000$th hour, it is clear that it almost has the same shape but it is oscillating. So, it keeps oscillating and increasing up to the peak point and then
it starts decreasing till the end of the year. But this is only for only one independent variable which is time in hours. Now, how if we include the effect of temperature and humidity and draw 
these vectors along with the power vs. time, to see how power is changing

$$ F_C(a) = P(C\le a)=P(A\le a, 1-B\le a, B-A\le a).$$  By rewriting this probability as area in the unit square, I get
$$F_C(a)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} (3a-1)^2 & \frac{1}{3}\le a\le \frac{1}{2}\\ 1-3(1-a)^2 & \frac{1}{2}\le a\le 1\end{array}\right.$$ from which it follows that

14229,Don't Understand Proof in Rudin Principles of Mathematical Analysis Book Thm 7.24?,"I was rather confused about this proof I came across in Rudin Chapter 7.  The premise is: If K is a compact metric space, if $f_n \in C(K)$ for $n =  1, 2, 3, ...,$ ($C(K)$ being a set of complex-valued, continuous and bounded functions), and if $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly on $K$, then $\{f_n\}$ is equicontinuous on $K$. Proof:
Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given.  Since $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly, there is an integer $N$ such that $$||f_n - f_N|| < \epsilon (n > N).$$ (See Definition 7.14).  Since continuous functions are uniformly continuous on compact sets, there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $$|f_i(x) - f_i(y)| < \epsilon$$ if $1 \leq i \leq N$ and $d(x,y) < \delta$.* If $n < N$ and $d(x,y) < \delta$, it follows that $$|f_n(x) - f_n(y)| \leq |f_n(x) - f_n(y)| + |f_n(x) - f_N(y)| + |f_N(x) - f_N(y)| < 3\epsilon.$$ $QED$. ** What I don't understand is the line ending with *.  I understand that when a family of functions are uniformly continuous, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that $n \geq N$ implies $|f_n(x) - f_n(y)| \leq \epsilon$, but it doesn't say anything about the case when $n \leq N$.  Perhaps it has something to do with the finiteness of the number of functions? It might be something really obvious I'm overlooking.","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"
14235,Mathematical functions that can't be computed,"I was reading over this in my notes, but it doesnt make any sense to me: However, suppose we ﬁx an alphabet for
  writing our programs (e.g. 8- bit
  ASCII). Since each individual program
  is ﬁnite in length, we can put all
  possible programs into a (very long)
  ordered list. For any ﬁxed character
  length k, there are only a ﬁnite set
  of possible programs. So, we can write
  down all programs by ﬁrst ﬁrst writing
  down all the 1-character programs,
  then all the 2-character programs, and
  so forth. In other words, there’s a
  bijection between the integers and the
  total set of programs. But this means
  that the number of functions is
  uncountable, whereas the number of
  programs is only countably inﬁnite. So
  there must be mathematical functions
  that we can’t compute with any
  (ﬁnite-length) program. What exactly is this saying? Why does it hold? It seems like it shouldn't. In some cases a program of only 30-40 characters can compute billions of numbers!

For each of the two remaining open sets, subtract a closed from the center of width $\alpha/8$, thus a total measure of $\alpha/4$.

Is there any norm characterizing the collection of $B$ and $C$ that is invariant under all block diagonal similarity transformations $M\to S M S^{-1}$ with $S=\begin{pmatrix}E & 0\\ 0 & F\end{pmatrix}$ of the whole block matrix? Were $B$ and $C$ square matrices I'd use e.g. the sum of squared eigenvalues, but is there something similar for non-square matrices? In brief, the requirements for the block norms I seek are: the norm of the square blocks $A$ and $D$ must be invariant (under these similarity transformations of $M$) respectively either there are individual norms for $B$ and $C$ which are invariant, or the is one combined norm depending on $B$ and $C$ which is invariant Is the latter requirement possible? Due to the block diagonal structure of $S$, all blocks transform independently, so there should be independent norms for $B$ and $C$. But since $B\to F B E^{-1}$ and $C\to E C F^{-1}$ are no similarity transformations, I couldn't even use eigenvalues if $B$ and $C$ were square matrices.

14320,Partitioning the integers $1$ through $n$ so that the product of the elements in one set is equal to the sum of the elements in the other,"It is known that, for $n \geq 5$, it is possible to partition the integers $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ into two disjoint subsets such that the product of the elements in one set equals the sum of the elements in the other.  One solution is the following: Let $N = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$. If $n$ is even, take $P = \{1, \frac{n-2}{2}, n\}$ and $N-P$ as the two sets. If $n$ is odd, take $P = \{1, \frac{n-1}{2}, n-1\}$ and $N-P$ as the two sets. My question is this: Is this partition unique for infinitely many $n$? One might be able to prove an even stronger result, as I don't know of any other solutions. Update on progress : Derek Jennings has found another family of solutions for the case where $n$ is a multiple of 4, except for $n=8$, $28$, or $36$; see his answer below.  And Matthew Conroy has verified that, for $n \leq 100$, the partition given above is unique only for $n = 5,6,7,8,9,13,18,$ and $34$. Background : The problem of proving that the partition is possible was posed several years ago as Problem 2826 in the journal Crux Mathematicorum , with solutions in the April 2004 issue .  Every one of the 20 or so solvers (including me, which is why I'm interested in the question) came up with the partition given here.  The person who originally posed the problem also asked if the partition is unique for infinitely many $n$.  I don't think anyone ever submitted an answer to that latter question to Crux (although I cannot verify that, as I no longer have a subscription).

14345,"Determine sign of a permutation, calculate number of elements in the subgroup of permutations with sign = 1","Question: (a) Determine sign$(\tau)$ for $$\left( \begin{array}{ccccccc} 1&2&3&4&5&6&7 \\ 2&3&5&7&1&6&4 \end{array} \right )$$. (b) Let $A_{n} = \{\tau \in S_{n} | \mbox{sign}(\tau) = 1\}$. Show that $A_{n}$ is a sub group of $S_{n}$ and calculate the number of elements (Tip: Show that for any transposition $\tau$, $S_{n}$ is the disjoint union of $A_{n}$ and $A_{n}\circ\tau$). My attempt so far:
(a) So I have this formula for sign$(\sigma) = \displaystyle \prod_{i < j} \frac{\sigma(j)-\sigma(i)}{j-i}$. This wouldn't be so difficult, however it's apparently ok to count the number of elements for which $i<j$ but $\sigma(i)>\sigma(j)$ (these are called inversions, I believe). If this number is even, sign$(\sigma)=1$ if odd, $-1$. In this case I named $(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(3,7),(4,5),(4,6),(4,7),(6,7) \Rightarrow \mbox{sign}(\tau) =1$ (b) To begin with, if I want to show that something is a subgroup, I have to show that: (i)$ a,b \in U \Rightarrow a \circ b \in U$ and that (ii)$a \in U \Rightarrow a^{-1} \in U$ correct? (I'm actually a little confused at why we can just assume that the identity element is still part of a subgroup, for instance if the exercise were a little different and I was checking if $A_{n} = \{\tau \in S_{n} | \mbox{sign}(\tau) = -1\}$ was a sub group, I would say that the identity element for permutations $123...n$ has no inversions $\Rightarrow$ sign$(\tau) = 1 \Rightarrow \tau \notin A_{n}$... I mean, subgroups are groups themselves, right? Well anyway, for (i) I tried to show it by writing: Let $\tau, \sigma \in A_{n}$ $\Rightarrow$ sign$(\tau) = 1$ and sign$(\sigma)=1$ For a polynomial (I honestly don't totally understand this or know if I need to put this stuff with 'g' in...) $g=g(x_{1},...,x_{n})$, sign$(\tau \circ \sigma)g= (\tau \circ \sigma)(g)=\tau(\sigma(g))=\tau((\mbox{sign}\sigma)g)=(\mbox{sign}\tau)(\mbox{sign}\sigma)g$ $\Rightarrow$ sign$(\tau \circ \sigma) = (1)(1) = 1 \Rightarrow (\tau \circ \sigma) \in A_{n}$ with (ii) my attempt was: Let $\sigma \in A_{n}$ If $\sigma \circ \sigma^{-1} = \epsilon$ (this should represent the identity element) $\Rightarrow$ sign$(\sigma \circ \sigma^{-1}) = \mbox{sign}\epsilon$ $(\mbox{sign}\sigma)(\mbox{sign}\sigma^{-1})=1$ (Because sign$(\epsilon)=1$) $(1)(\mbox{sign}(\sigma^{-1}))=1$ (Because $\sigma \in A_{n}\Rightarrow \mbox{sign}(\sigma) = 1$) sign$(\sigma^{-1})=1 \Rightarrow \sigma^{-1} \in A_{n}$ Out of (i) and (ii) follows the conclusion that $A_{n}$ is a subgroup of $S_{n}$... So hopefully that would all be on the right track so far... With the calculate the number of elements part, I don't know what to do or why. Following the tip I would try to show that $S_{n}$ is the disjoint union (not the same as showing that the intersection is empty, right?) of $A_{n}$ and $A_{n} \circ \tau$ (where $\tau$ is a transposition). I don't understand this, but directly out of the book is the statement ""We call $\tau$ a transposition. If $i<j$, then there are $2(j-i=1)+1$ inversions in $\tau$, and hence the transposition $\tau$ is odd."" Accordingly I think I could use sign$(\tau \circ \sigma)=(\mbox{sign}\tau)(\mbox{sign}\sigma)$ to show that the product of an odd and even permutation is odd and therefore $A_{n} \circ \tau$ is odd and $A_{n}$ has no elements in common with $A_n \circ \tau$.

14458,Showing properties of discontinuous points of a strictly increasing function [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : How to show that a set of discontinuous points of an increasing function is at most countable (4 answers) Closed 2 years ago . Let $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be strictly monotonically increasing. (i) Is $f$ not continuous at $p \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists a non-empty, open interval $(a_p, b_p) \subset \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)\leq a_p$ for all $x < p$ and $f(x) \geq b_p$ for all $x > p$. (ii) The set of discontinuity points $$ \{ p \in \mathbb{R} | f \; \mbox{is not continuous at} \; p \}$$ is countable. For (i) I could be way off, but I am picturing a graph with $p$ on the $x$-axis for which the value $f(p)$ on the $y$-axis is undefined. Am I correct to interpret the open interval $(a_p, b_p)$ as an interval on the $y$-axis which should be contained within the distance between two $f(x)$'s (one for $x<p$ and the other for $x>p$)? If that is so far correct, there could be 2 types of discontinuous points $p$, a jump or removable type. For the jump it would be easier to show that somehow the interval $(a_p, b_p)$ is smaller than the vertical jump... For a removable discontinuity $c$, I would think that the interval could contain just the $y$-axis value $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to c}f(x)$ but I don't really know how to express that the upper and lower bounds would be just above and below that... With (ii) I am currently trying to understand a proof, what exactly does the notation $f(p-)$ or $f(p+)$ mean in this context? Is it simply the value when approached from the left or the right(respectively)?",['analysis']

14489,Proof of clockwise towers of Hanoi variant recursive solution,"This is from one of the exercises in "" Concrete Mathematics "", and is something I'm doing privately, not homework. This is a variant on the classic towers of Hanoi, where all moves must be made clockwise only. The recursive solution is to consider $Q_n$ to be the number of moves to move a tower size $n$ one step across (e.g. from start $\rightarrow$ end post), and $R_n$ to be the number of moves to move it two (e.g start $\rightarrow$ end $\rightarrow$ spare). The recursive solution is (sorry about the formatting, just getting to grips with tex): $Q_n = 0 \quad \text{if n = 0}$ $Q_n = 2R_{n-1} + 1\quad \text{if n > 0}$ $R_n = 0 \quad \text{if n = 0}$ $R_n = Q_n + Q_{n-1} + 1 \quad \text{if n > 0}$ How can I prove these? I presume an inductive proof is required but everything I've tried to do just gets garbled into a mess of further decreasing $n$ values. Explaining why these work is simple enough: $Q_n$ can be explained by the fact that you need to move a stack of size $n-1$ two steps forward followed by the $n$ piece, followed by moving the $n-1$ stack two steps again onto the $n$ piece=> $Q_n = R_{n-1} + 1 + R_{n-1} = 2R_{n-1}+1$. The wordy proof for $R_n$ is similar: It consists of moving $R_{n-1}$ then 1 followed by $Q_n$, 1 and $R_{n-1}$ which will end us up with $R_n = 2R_{n-1}+1+Q_{n-1}+1 = Q_n+Q_{n-1}+1$ But these are all just words that don't form any real proof... I've gone over the leading chapter and looked up some resources on proof by induction, but doing it with a recursion with two components has put me for a spin (having forgotten a lot of the math studied in the past certainly isn't helping either). If someone could run me through a rigorous proof for $n > 0$ it would be much appreciated. As an aside, any recommended learning resources on proof by induction would be appreciated as I'm still barely ""getting it"".","['recursive-algorithms', 'recurrence-relations', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms']"
14494,Adding handles to a sphere,"I am trying to work through Boothby's An Introduction to Differentiable Manifolds on my own and, embarassingly, have got stuck at the very first chapter. At the end of section 4, chapter 1 (called: Further examples of manifolds: cutting and pasting), there's this question: Prove that adding a handle to a 2-manifolds in the fashion described above for $S^2$ and $T^2$ actually does give a 2 manifold Unfortunately, Boothby gives no formal definitions for cutting and pasting so I have no idea about how to show that a sphere with a handle will be locally euclidean. For example, what if the handle is attached to the surface such that at the joint (a circle) the two surfaces meet sharply, so that for points on the joint we cannot find a normal. So, my questions are: Where can I find the operations of cutting formalised (I realise that pasting is connected to quotient topology, so I am studying that now). And, how does one answer this question rigorously? Edit Upon further thought, 'cutting' could be this: since a manifold $M$ is metrizable, we can remove an open disk (open so that I get a boundary in the resulting manifold) around a point, i.e., we consider $M - B(p,\epsilon)$. So, given two dissimilar points, we remove two non-intersecting open disks (we can do this because a manifold is hausdorff).

This invites the use of Zorn's Lemma; but it seems impossible to prove that a maximal set closed under these operations must be $2^\mathbb{N}$ . However, this approach strongly suggests that $\mu$ exists for all $(a_i)$ , as the problem only depends on $2^\mathbb{N}$ . On the other hand, if $a_i$ converges absolutely, one can set $\mu(I) = \sum_{i\in I} a_i$ which fulfills the required properties, but this approach does not generalise at all.",['measure-theory']

14530,How to average cyclic quantities?,"Looking on Internet, I mostly found this definition: Given quantities on a cyclic domain D, first rescale the domain to [0;2$\pi$[, then, find $z_n$ the point on the unit circle corresponding to the $n$th value, and compute the average by: $$z_m = \sum_{n=1}^N z_n$$ The average angle is then $\theta_m = \arg z_m$ and to obtain the average value you scale back to your original domain D. I must say, I have problems with this definition. For simplicity, I will use oriented angles in degree for my examples (i.e. D = [0;360[). With this formula, having angles -90, 90 and 40 will give 40 as mean angle, when I would expect 13.33 as an answer (i.e. (90-90+40)/3). For my own problems, I usually use: $$v_m = \mathop{\rm arg\,min}_{v\in D} \sum_{n=1}^{N} d(v_n,v)^2$$ Where $d(x,y)$ is the distance in the cyclic domain, and $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}$ is the set of cyclic data I want to average of. It has the advantage to work the same way whatever the domain (replace D by a non-cyclic domain and $d$ with the usual euclidean distance, and you find the usual definition of an average). However, it is expensive to compute and I don't know any exact method to do it in general. So my question is: what is the appropriate way to deal with average of cyclic data?

Let $y$ and $x$ both be functions of $t$.
Let $z$ be a function of both $x$ and $y$. The derivative of z with respect to t is:

Source: http://www.math.hmc.edu/calculus/tutorials/multichainrule/ These tree diagrams can be constructed for arbitrarily complex functions with many variables.

Having only recently become aware of continued fractions, I'm trying to work my way through this problem, but I'm stuck at the very last stage. Here's what I've got so far:  Let $\{a_n\}$ be the sequence defined recursively as $$a_1 = 1, a_{n + 1} = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + a_n}$$  Consider the two subsequences $\{a_{2n}\}$ and $\{a_{2n - 1}\}$.  I've already shown that $\{a_{2n}\}$ is monotonic, strictly decreasing, and bounded below by $\sqrt{2}$, and similarly I've shown that $\{a_{2n - 1}\}$ is monotonic, strictly increasing, and bounded above by $\sqrt{2}$.  Obviously, both of these subsequences converge. Although of course in general, if two subsequences of a sequence happen to converge to the same value, that doesn't guarantee that the sequence itself converges at all (much less to that same value), in the case where the subsequences are $\{a_{2n}\}$ and $\{a_{2n - 1}\}$, it's easy to show that if they both converge to the same value, then so will $\{a_n\}$ (since every term of $\{a_n\}$ is a term of one of the two subsequences).  So no problem there. In other words, it remains only to show that not only do the subsequences converge, but they converge to $\sqrt{2}$ in particular.  Take, for starters, $\{a_{2n - 1}\}$ (if I can get $\{a_{2n - 1}\}$ to converge to $\sqrt{2}$, I'm sure getting $\{a_{2n}\}$ to converge to $\sqrt{2}$ won't be very different).  Because it's strictly increasing and bounded above by $\sqrt{2}$, it converges to some number $x \leq \sqrt{2}$.  Suppose that $x < \sqrt{2}$.  We want to show this doesn't happen. But this is where I'm getting stuck.  I feel like I want to take $\epsilon = \sqrt{2} - x$ and show that there exists some $N$ such that $a_{2N - 1} > x$, which would finish the problem due to the monotonicity of $\{a_{2n - 1}\}$.

Is there a formula for how many are acceptable given the case that no position holds its own number?","['faq', 'permutations', 'derangements', 'combinatorics']"

14672,"Computing a rational number between two others, minimizing numerator and denominator","Given two positive rational number $\frac{a_1}{b_1}$ and $\frac{a_3}{b_3}$ (written in lowest terms) such that $$\frac{a_1}{b_1} < \frac{a_3}{b_3},$$
I want to find a rational number
$\frac{a_2}{b_2}$ such that $$\frac{a_1}{b_1} < \frac{a_2}{b_2} < \frac{a_3}{b_3}$$
and $a_2$ and $b_2$ are the smallest possible numbers I've come with the solution $a_2 = a_1 + a_3$ and $b_2 = b_1 + b_3$ then dividing $a_2$ and $b_2$ by their greatest common divisor but there must be better solution. Thanks by advance for your suggestions.","['fractions', 'number-theory']"
14685,How do I find the area or the volume (or a formula) for a region that is rectangular but has a cone slope to a drain?,"This is a quick (not to scale) drawing of what I mean: the floor gradually slopes from the wall to the drain at about 7/16( 0.4375) inch per foot from the short sides of the wall (the 7 ft from wall to the drain) and exactly 3/16(.1875"") of a inch per foot on the long sides ( the 16ft from the wall to the drain). So the base is a rectangle 14'x32' but the shape is most related to a cone ,.... but all cone formulas assume the base is circular. I'm at a loss of how to pull out only the rectangular portion out from the middle of a cone shape. I hope this made it more visual it has 3"" of Drop in the Center, length is 32' and width is 14'. just looking for a formula to calculate it. Any help in the right direction would be appreciated.","['trigonometry', 'calculus']"
14687,Necessary condition for existence of anti-derivative,Suppose $f$ is analytic on the domain $D = \{z \big| |z|>1\}$ in $\mathbb{C}$.   I know that if the line integral of $f$ along any closed path is 0 then $f$ has an anti-derivative.  Is this also a necessary condition.,['complex-analysis']
14689,Thought experiment for dice game,"Two players in a dice game to see who can roll a total of 60 first, taking turns each rolling 2 dice. For one player, one die is 4 sided and one is 6 sided. Therefore the average roll for this player will be a 6. The other player has two 6 sided dice. So this players average roll will be a 7. If they take turns, each rolling both dice, what % of the time will the first player (a 4-6 dice combo) get to 60 first and what % of the time will the second player (6-6 dice combo) get to 60 first. If they get to 60 on the same roll, the player who goes the furthest wins.","['probability-theory', 'dice', 'probability']"
