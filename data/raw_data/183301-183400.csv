3353715,Does this system of infinite equations has an (almost) unique solution?,"Let $a_1,\dots ,a_n \in \Bbb C$ , consider the following system of equations $$\begin{cases} x_1+ \cdots+ x_n=a_1 \\ {x_1}^2+\cdots+{x_n}^2=a_2 \\ \qquad \qquad \vdots \\ {x_1}^n+\cdots+{x_n}^n=a_n \end{cases}$$ Its ""easy"" to prove this system has a unique solution up to permutations. The reason is due to Newton identities that allow us to create an equivalent system $$\begin{cases} e_1(x_1,\dots,x_n)=b_1 \\ e_2(x_1,\dots,x_n)=b_2 \\ \qquad \qquad \vdots \\ e_n(x_1,\dots,x_n)=b_n \end{cases}$$ Where $e_1, \dots ,e_n$ are the elementary symmetric polynomials and $b_1, \dots ,b_n \in \Bbb C$ are numbers which can be calculated in terms of $a_1, \dots ,a_n$ . If we consider the polynomial $$P(X)=X^n-b_1 \cdot X^{n-1}+b_2 \cdot X^{n-2} + \cdots+(-1)^n \cdot b_0$$ Then, due to Vieta's Formulas, the solution to our system are precisely the 
roots of $P$ (counted with multiplicity) which are unique up to permutations. My question is the following, let $(a_n)_{n\in \Bbb N}$ be complex numbers and consider the following system of infinite equations in $l^1(\Bbb C)$ $$\begin{cases} \sum_{n \in \Bbb N} x_n = a_1
 \\ \sum_{n \in \Bbb N} {x_n}^2 = a_2 \\ \qquad \quad \vdots \\ \sum_{n \in \Bbb N} {x_n}^k = a_k \\ \qquad \quad \vdots \end{cases}$$ Are there any necessary/sufficienct conditions over $(a_n)_{n\in \Bbb N}$ for a solution to exist? If $(x_n)_{n\in \Bbb N}$ is a solution to our system and $\sigma : \Bbb N \rightarrow \Bbb N$ is a bijection then $(x_{\sigma (n)})_{n\in \Bbb N}$ is a solution to our system so any permutation of a solution is again a solution. Also, if we take a solution $(x_n)_{n\in \Bbb N}$ and we ""add"" zeros to our sequence then we get another solution, for example, the sequence $(y_n)_{n\in \Bbb N}$ defined as $$y_{2n}=0 \qquad ; \qquad y_{2n-1}=x_n \qquad \forall n \in \Bbb N$$ Is another solution to our system of equations. My second question would be the following. If our system of infinite equations has two solutions, $(x_n)_{n\in \Bbb N}$ and $(y_n)_{n\in \Bbb N}$ , is it true that I can get $(y_n)_{n\in \Bbb N}$ by taking $(x_n)_{n\in \Bbb N}$ and adding zeros and making permutations? Inspired by the finite case, I did the following approach. Its easy to prove (again, using Newton Identities) that if $(x_n)_{n\in \Bbb N} \in l^1(\Bbb C)$ then the following limit exists for every $k \in \Bbb N_0$ $$e_k(x):=\lim_{n \to \infty} e_k(x_1,\dots ,x_n) < \infty$$ And it can be calculated in terms of $\sum_{n \in \Bbb N} x_n , \dots , \sum_{n \in \Bbb N} {x_n}^k$ so we get the following (equivalent) system of equations $$\begin{cases} e_1(x) = b_1
 \\ e_2(x) = b_2 \\ \qquad \vdots \\ e_k(x) = b_k \\ \qquad \vdots \end{cases}$$ Where $(b_n)_{n\in \Bbb N}$ are complex numbers which can be calculated in terms of $(a_n)_{n\in \Bbb N}$ . To reproduce the following step in the finite case, we will make some modifications in the approach. By Vieta's formulas, it's easy to check the following polynomial equality $$\prod_{k=1}^n (1-x_i \cdot X) = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \cdot e_k(x_1,\dots, x_n) \cdot X^k$$ With $x_1,\dots ,x_n \in \Bbb C$ . Note that the roots of this polynomial are ${x_i}^{-1}$ for every $x_i \not = 0$ . I would like to say (and have no idea how to prove) that if $(x_n)_{n \in \Bbb N} \in l^1(\Bbb C)$ then $$\prod_{k=1}^\infty (1-x_i \cdot z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \cdot e_k(x) \cdot z^k \qquad \forall \; z \in \Bbb C$$ If this is true, going back to our infinite system of equations, we could consider the series $$f(z)=1+ \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k \cdot b_k \cdot z^k$$ Wich is a function we can ""calculate"" since we know $(b_k)_{k \in \Bbb N}$ . We should ask some conditions over $(b_k)_{k \in \Bbb N}$ for this to be well defined over an open set around zero (or all over $\Bbb C$ ). Let $(r_n)_{n \in \Bbb N}$ be the roots of $f$ counted with multiplicity (Does this have a meaning???), let $x_n = {r_n}^{-1} \quad \forall n \in \Bbb N$ (Note $r_n \not = 0 \quad \forall n \in \Bbb N$ because $f(0)=1$ ), if $f$ has finite roots, we fill the sequence with zeros. I affirm that $(x_n)_{n \in \Bbb N}$ is a solution to our system. There are a LOT of gaps in my reasoning and Im not sure how to continue. My Complex analysis knowledge is really weak.","['systems-of-equations', 'complex-analysis', 'symmetric-polynomials', 'polynomials', 'sequences-and-series']"
3353767,Student claims $\lim_{x \to 0^+} \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$. Is it justified?,"I am a tutor of an introductory calculus course in our college of engineering. The students are first year engineering undergraduates. We had a quiz where the following question was asked : Let $f : [0,1] \to \Bbb R$ be continuous on $[0,1]$ and differentiable on $(0,1)$ . If $\lim_{x \to 0^+} f'(x)=L$ for some real number $L$ , then show that $f'(0)$ exists and $f'(0)=L$ The students had been taught Lagrange's mean value theorem prior to that. So it was expected that they will use it. However, some students have written the following answer: $L=\lim_{x \to 0^+} f'(x)= \lim_{x \to 0^+}  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac {f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac {f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac {f(h)-f(0)}{h}.$ This implies that $\lim_{h \to 0} \frac {f(h)-f(0)}{h}$ exists hence $f'(0)$ exists and equals $L$ . In this, they have not provided any justification for exchanging the limits. I am not able to find any justification for that step nor I am able to counter it. Can someone throw some light on this?

3353803,Intersection between a curve of degree six and a conic,"I've seen this exercise in the book ""Lectures on curves, surfaces and projective varieties"" by Beltrametti and others: Show that three polynomials $\phi_2(x_1,x_2,x_3), \phi_3(x_1,x_2,x_3), \phi_4(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ homogeneous of degree $deg(\phi_i)=i$ can be chosen in a way such that $\phi_2 \phi_4 - \phi_3^2$ is the product of 6 linear forms. Under the statement the outhors put also their solution, but there is a passage that I can't really get. 
They say: in the projective complex plane, take an irreducible conic of equation $\phi_2=0$ and a cubic of equation $\phi_3=0$ that instersects the conic in exactly six distinct points $P_1,..., P_6$ . Consider the lines $l_i$ tangent to the conic at $P_i$ . Then, from the linear system of curves of equation $\phi_3^2- \lambda l_1...l_6$ take the curve $C$ that intersect the conic in an other point $Q$ distinct from all the $P_i$ . Then, $C$ has the conic as irreducible component, so the thesis follows. My question is: why does $C$ split into the conic and an other curve of degree four? I thought I could use Bézout theorem, but it seems to me that the conic and $C$ have only 7 points in common, and I don't really see how one can compute the intersection multiplicity of these two curves in the points in which tey intersect.

3353810,"Regular surface at critical value; procedure for ""find real numbers $c$ satisfying $F(x,y,z) = c$ be a regular surface. ""","First Let me state what I know, If $r$ is a regular value of $F$ and $F^{-1}(r)$ is non-empty then $F^{-1}(r)$ is a regular surface Of course I know, its converse is not true. Typical example can be found in Do Carmo as $F(x,y,z) = z^2$ . The critical points of this surface is $(x,y,0)$ so it has a critical value $F(x,y,0) =0$ . But $F^{-1}(0) = \{(x,y,0)\}$ is a plane so it is a regular surface. Now I am trying to solve following problem For which real numbers $c$ is the set of $(x,y,z)$ satisfying $x^2+y^2 + \sin(z) =c$ a regular surface? Applying the above procedure. Let $F(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + \sin(z)$ , then $\nabla F = (2x,2y, \cos(z))$ so $(0,0, \frac{\pi}{2}+n\pi)$ is a critical point and thus critical value is $\pm 1$ . So $c\neq \pm 1$ . $F^{-1}(c)$ is a regular surface. Now I want to know what happen to $c=\pm 1$ . For this case $F^{-1}(\pm 1) =\{ (x,y,z) | x^2 + y^2 + \sin(z) =\pm 1 \}$ .  At this moment I am stuck with this stage.... For this do i have to compute $X(u,v) = ( \pm \sqrt{-u^2 - \sin(v)}, u, v)$ and compute $X_u \times X_v$ ? Is there any systematic way to find regularity of surface for critical value?  i.e., I want to find some general strategy to solve Find real numbers $c$ satisfying $F(x,y,z) = c$ be a regular surface.",['differential-geometry']

3353860,Geometric interpretation of torsion for a non-linear (Ehresmann) connection,"In [1, eq. $7.8.10$ ] the author gives the coordinate expression for the torsion of a non-linear connection. Here a non-linear connection, in my understanding, is essentially a splitting of the double tangent bundle $TTM$ in a horizontal and vertical part (although his precise definition [1, def. $7.2.1$ ] is quite a bit more involved, but I can imagine that in the end it is equivalent). The formula for torsion in natural coordinates $(x,y)$ in the tangent bundle reads $$ T^k_{ij}(x,y) = \bar\partial_j N^k_i(x,y) - \bar\partial_i N^k_j(x,y),\qquad \bar\partial_i \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}, $$ where $N^i_j$ are the connection coefficients. This indeed reduces to the usual expression for the torsion tensor $T^k_{ij} = \Gamma^k_{ij} - \Gamma^k_{ji}$ when the connection is linear. For linear connections my intuitive understanding of torsion has always been that it measures the degree to which an infinitesimal parallelogram does not close on itself. More precisely, given two vectors $v,w\in T_pM$ , if we infinitesimally parallel transport $u$ along $v$ and $v$ along $u$ then the difference $\delta$ between the two outcomes is given precisely by the torsion tensor $$ \delta^k = T^k_{ij}v^i w^j.$$ However, I noticed that this is not true anymore when the connection is non-linear. Indeed, for homogeneous non-linear connections, i.e. $ N(x,\lambda y) = \lambda N(x,y)$ , I find that $$\delta^k = (\bar\partial_j N^k_i(x,v) - \bar\partial_i N^k_j(x,u))u^iv^j.$$ Although the expression in between brackets looks a lot like the torsion of the non-linear connection, it is not the same, because of the additional dependence on $u$ and $v$ in $N^i_j$ . My standard geometrical interpretation of torsion is apparently not valid anymore in the non-linear realm, so my question comes down to the following: Is there an alternative geometric interpretation of the torsion of a non-linear connection?

3354203,"If the gambler's fallacy is false, how do notions of ""expected number"" of events work?","Imagine there is a fair spinner that could land on any number $1$ through $100$ . I understand that the chance of any number appearing on the next spin is $\frac{1}{100}$ , and if you spin the spinner $100$ times then the expected number of $5$ 's, for example, is $1$ . However, I have the following questions: If the spinner does not land on $5$ in the first spin then this does not make the chance of getting a $5$ on the second spin any more or less likely (to assume otherwise would imply the gambler's fallacy). This means that we now must spin the spinner a total of $101$ times in order to expect exactly one $5$ . Doesn't this cause some kind of infinite regress? If we never expect a $5$ on any given spin, and no $5$ 's have come up thus far in the first $n$ spins, then won't it take $n+100$ spins to expect a 5? I know that at some point if we examine a group of spins then we can expect something with low probability like spinning a $5$ to occur, but it seems strange and counter-intuitive to me that though we expect a $5$ to come up in a sufficiently large group of spins, on each individual spin we do not expect a $5$ . Furthermore, we do not expect any number to come up on the first spin (in that the probability of any particular number appearing is low), and yet we know for certain that some number will still come up. For there to be a greater than $50\%$ chance of spinning a $5$ , we must spin the spinner $69$ times according to the following calculation: $$P(\text{Not rolling a 5 in } n \text{ spins})=\left(\frac{99}{100}\right)^n \\ \left(\frac{99}{100}\right)^n < 0.5 \\ \log_{0.99}0.5=68.967... $$ Hence, it must be spun $69$ times for there to be a greater than $50\%$ chance of there being a $5$ . Why is this not $50$ spins, as we expect $0.5$ $5$ 's to come up in this period? Also, I have the same question that once a $5$ does not come up, don't we have to spin it $70$ times for there to a greater than $50\%$ probability, and can't this cause the same infinite regress as described above?","['definition', 'probability']"

3354376,Proving the well ordering principle with induction,"I am wondering if the following proof of the well ordering principle is correct by induction. Well-ordering principle: Every non-empty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least or smallest element. To prove this, we will prove the following lemma: Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and let S be a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ such that $n\in S$ . Then S has a least element. Proof by strong induction: Base: When $n=1$ , we have that $1\in S$ . Then 1 is the least element of S. Assume that when $1,2,3,...,k \in S$ then S contains a least element. Inductive step: Let $n+1\in S$ . This can be broken down into two cases. Case 1 : If any of the numbers $1,2,3,...,n\in S$ then S contains a least 
element by the induction hypothesis. Case 2 : If S doesn't contain any  of the numbers $1,2,3,...n$ but $n+1\in S$ then $n+1$ is the least element in S. We have concluded the lemma.

3354402,Geometric properties of variety/scheme vs. algebraic properties of the coordinate ring,"I am looking for a list comparing the geometric/topological properties of an  affine scheme $X \simeq \text{Spec}(R)$ with the algebraic properties of the corresponding ring $R$ and vice versa. Particular emphasis should be placed on affine $K$ -varieties to make the geometric picture clearer. An example of this would be: An affine $K$ -variety $X$ is irreducible iff $K[X]$ is an integral domain. eg. $\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x)$ is an ID and consists of only a single curve, whereas $\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(xy)$ is not an ID and consists of the union of two curves. the classical points of an affine scheme $X$ lie dense iff $R$ is Jacobson An affine $K$ -variety $X$ has no ""thick subschemes"" iff $K[X]$ is reduced. Where by a ""thick subscheme"" I mean something like the thick $y$ -axis $\mathbb{R}[x,y]/(x^2)$ as opposed to $\mathbb{R}[x,y]/(x)$ As suggested by the examples I am not looking for ultra precise statements on the geometric side of things, but rather one giving justification for either why certain algebraic properties of rings are worth studying or why certain geometric properties are worth studying. If possible (or you feel the need) please provide an illustrative example (as for instance in my first example) If possible (as for instance in my second example) a proof or link to a proof or resource is appreciated. In any case, please provide some explanation, or why you think of algebraic property Y giving geometric property Z. If, in order to describe the geometric properties, you use non-standard language (as for instance in my third example) please explain. Finally, maybe think of the question like this: You read about some new class of rings and ask yourself ""Why does that definition make sense? Why should those rings be interesting?""

3354505,How to find a point on a line that minimizes sum of distances from three given points?,"This is a cross-post of a question on MathOverflow where it didn't get much attention: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/337892/how-to-find-a-point-on-a-line-that-minimizes-sum-of-distances-from-three-given-p Let there be given three points $x_1$ , $x_2$ , $x_3$ and a line $l$ on a plane. Does there exist an explicit method of finding such a point $p$ on $l$ , that sum of distances of $p$ from $x_1$ , $x_2$ , $x_3$ is possibly minimal? Such result for two given points and a line is trivial and known as the Heron's theorem commonly used in optics to find a path of a ray of light. All I know about the solution is that if $p$ minimizes the sum of distances, then $$\cos{\alpha}+\cos{\beta}+\cos{\gamma}=0$$ The equation above comes directly from the derivative of the function of sum of distances if we assume that the line has equation $y = 0$ : $$\frac{d}{dx} \sum_{i=1}^3 \sqrt{(x-x_i)^2+(0 - y_i)^2} = 0$$ $$\sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{x-x_i}{\sqrt{(x-x_i)^2+(y_i)^2}} = 0$$ $$\cos{\alpha}+\cos{\beta}+\cos{\gamma}=0$$ However, that is not really helpful neither for construction nor finding the solution analytically. Some rare situations may be solved using Brianchon's theorem. That is, if we add symmetrical reflections of $x_1$ , $x_2$ , $x_3$ on the opposite sides of $l$ and the six points are vertices of a hexagon circumscribing a conic section, then the intersection of the main diagonals minimizes the sum of distances. However it is far from general solution.","['optimization', 'geometry', 'plane-geometry', 'euclidean-geometry']"

3354573,Eccentricity Vector of an Ellipse -- Geometric Derivation?,"I've been playing Kerbal Space Program again, and so I'm learning about orbital mechanics. There's a particular vector I can derive physically, but it's an intrinsically geometric object, and so I'd like to find out if there's a purely mathematical derivation of it (e g., no using conservation of energy). Consider an ellipse, with one focus at the origin, and the other on the negative x-axis. Let $\ell$ be its semi latus rectum, and $e$ be its eccentricity. Given a point P on the ellipse, let $\vec r$ be the vector from the origin to P. Draw the tangent ray T to the ellipse at P, and let $\theta$ be the angle it makes with $\vec r$ . Lastly, erect a perpendicular to T at P, with length $\ell/\sin \theta$ , and call it $\vec{q}$ . Claim: $\vec{q} - \vec{r} = re \hat{x}$ . I'm having a lot of trouble with this, primarily because I don't have a good understanding of how $\theta$ varies with P. It starts at 90° at the periapsis, increases up to some unknown value $M$ , goes back down to 90° at apoapsis, and then down to $180° - M$ , before finally returning to 90°. $M$ gets bigger as the ellipse gets more enlongated, but that's all I know about it. I can coordinate bash of course, but I'm hoping for something cleaner. There's gotta be some way to exploit the geometric properties of the ellipse. Here's the physics behind why I care about this, feel free to skip if you're not interested in motivation. From my position and velocity vectors, I'd like to determine my orbit. We know it's an ellipse, because Kepler, so there's only a few things we need to determine: size, shape, orientation. Size is easy to find from the vis-viva equation , which itself comes from conservation of energy. Most of orientation is also easy; the orbital plane is the plane containing our position and velocity vectors, and so it's just the plane normal to $\vec r \times \vec v$ . The remaining information we need to find is the eccentricity $e$ , and how our ellipse is oriented within the orbital plane. We'll encode the latter by an angle $\nu$ , the angle from  periapsis to our position (astronomers call this the ""true anomaly""). There's something in the literature called the ""eccentricity vector"", which is defined as $\vec e = \frac{\vec v \times \vec h}{\mu} - \frac{\vec r}{r}$ , where $\vec h$ is the specific angular momentum $\vec r \times \vec v$ . It allegedly has magnitude $e$ , and makes angle $-\nu$ with our position vector (i.e., this is a positive multiple of the periapsis vector). I don't really have much intuition around this vector. The first component points perpendicularly outward from the ellipse, and somehow the second term is exactly the ""correction"" you need to point along the focal axis. It's not even clear that $\vec e$ is a constant! One nice thing about it though is that it behaves cleanly when the orbit is circular; $\vec e$ will be zero, leaving $\nu$ indeterminate, which makes sense because there's no well-defined periapsis on a circle. To show that this vector is what it promises to be, first, you show it's a constant, by taking the time derivative, and using the conservation of angular momentum. Then, consider the value at periapsis. Velocity is perpendicular to position there, so $h = rv$ , and since both terms point in the right direction, the direction is correct, and the magnitude is $rv^2/\mu - 1$ , which if you plug in $r_{periapsis} = (1-e)a$ and $v_{periapsis}^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \frac{1+e}{1-e}$ , will yield the eccentricity $e$ . But I feel like you should be able to do this geometrically, via the following interpretation. The semi latus rectum of the ellipse is $\ell = h^2/\mu$ , so the magnitude of $\frac{\vec v \times \vec h}{\mu}$ is $vh/\mu = h/(r \sin \theta) \cdot h/\mu$ , where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec r$ and $\vec v$ . Now we've eliminated all non-geometric quantities like velocity. Scaling the vector by $r$ , to give it units of length, we arrive at the problem above. *""specific"" means ""divided by orbiter mass""","['physics', 'geometry', 'mathematical-physics', 'plane-geometry']"

3354598,Polygon and its diagonals.,"So there is a N sided polygon, and some given number of lines, K that we  can use as diagonals to connect its vertices. For simplicity, if we view the polygon as a cyclic graph with N vertices, the goal is to use all K lines to connect its diagonals and minimize the number of  incoming edges (or degree) of all vertices of the graph as much as possible by distributing every K over the vertices optimally, and finally get the maximum of degrees of all the vertices as the answer to the problem.
In short, you have to try minimizing the degree of individual vertices, then the result is the maximum of the set of degrees of all vertices at that configuration. for example , if , N = 6 and K = 2 , the maximum degree of the graph after using all K lines to connect vertices( 6 in this case, one diagonal connecting two each),  is 3 . Explanation , 
lets number the vertices of the hexagon here as 0, 1, 2, ...5. Now, we have to use all the K (=3) lines here as diagonals, so we can connect, vertex 0 to vertex 2, vertex 1 to vertex 4, vertex 3 to vertex 5. We have used up all the K lines as we were asked and the maximum of all the  degrees we get is 3 ( 2  + 1) , where 2 edges are of adjacent vertices of that vertex and remaining one is the diagonal to the opposite vertex. ( there can be another configurations too like 0 to 3, 1 to 5 and 2 to 4, the output is same). In this case, every vertex will have same degree, i.e. 3, hence the max is 3. Apparently, the output is same of same hexagon and with K = 2 , because the maximum of degrees of all the vertices is still 3 . A few more examples ,
for, N = 6 and K = 8, result is 5 , for N = 5 and K = 4, result is 4 . I have been trying to establish some algebraic relation between N and K by simulating different situations but i have not been able to observe any pattern till now. Any ideas ? P.S. : For clarification, the K cannot exceed $n*(n-3)/2$ , because that is the max. number of diagonals a polygon can have. also , you can't overwrite already existing diagonals.","['graph-theory', 'linear-algebra', 'geometry', 'combinatorics']"

The function $H(x) = \gamma_1 x_1^2 + \gamma_2 x_2^2 + \gamma_3 x_3^2$ is an integral (conserved quantity?) for the above system $\iff \gamma \perp \alpha$ . In particular, there are $3$ integrals of motion (conserved quantities) of the system where only two of them are independent: $$H_1 = \alpha_2 x_3^2 - \alpha_3 x_2^2, \; H_2 = \alpha_3 x_1^2 - \alpha_1 x_3^2 , \; H_3 = \alpha_1 x_2^2 - \alpha_2 x_1^2$$ So, here is what I know. The dimension of the Euler Top is $3$ because there are three independent variables $x_1, x_2, x_3$ . We have found $2$ independent conserved quantities.

If I define $A_i$ to be the set of all those numbers whose decimal expansion has a $7$ at the $i$ th place. It is clear that the set $A$ in the question is limit supremum of all $A_i$ . And, I can show that $A_i$ are independent event (Lebesgue measure restricted to the unit interval is a probability measure). We next observe that $$\sum |A_i| = \infty.$$ An application of second Borel-Cantelli’s lemma therefore gives that the measure of $A$ is 1. My problem is that the notion of independence is a probabilistic notion (and not introduced in most real analysis classes). So, I am interested in a more direct (say, analytical?) approach to this problem. While writing this question this thought came to mind that I want something along the following line: Try showing that the set of all numbers whose decimal expansion has only finitely many $7$ appearing has a measure 0. In order to do so, we first obeserve that there are only countably many finite subsets of natural number. So if for a fixed finite subset $F$ of natural numbers, I can show that the set of numbers which has 7 only at those locations specified by the set $F$ has measure 0, then I will be done.

3355426,Vector space structure on orbit spaces of Group action on $\mathbb{C}$ by $S^{1}$,"Let $G=S^{1}$ be a group with multiplication and $V=\mathbb{C}$ be a vector space of complex  numbers. Let $G$ acts on $V$ as $(g,z)=gz$ usual multiplication of complex numbers. Then the orbit $Gz$ will be a circle centered at $0$ and having radius $|z|$ . The orbit space $V/G= \{ Gz : z \in V \}$ is the set of concentric circles centered at origin.  How can we  define a vector space structure on $ V/G $ ? First we will try to define addition : $ Gz_{1}+Gz_{2} $ We cannot define it as $ G z_{1}+Gz_{2}= G(z_{1}+z_{2}) $ . Consider the case $ Gz_{1}=Gz_{2}=S^{1} $ . Let us take $ 1 $ and $ -1 $ on $ G1=G(-1)= S^{1} $ . Their sum will be $ G0 =0  $ but if we take other two points $ 1 $ and $ i $ on same orbit their sum will go to the orbit $ G(1+i) $ . Hence this type of vector addition is not well defined. Suppose we define it as $Gz_{1}+Gz_{2}= G(z_{1}.z_{2})$ . Then multiplication of two points on two concentric circles with radius $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ will give a point on a concentric circle with radius $r_{1}.r_{2}$ rotated by an angle $\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}$ . This operation is well defined. It is closed, commutative, and associative. $S^{1}=G{1}$ is the additive identity. But all the orbits except $G0=0$ has inverse. We cannot find multiplicative inverse to $0$ . Is their any other way to define vector space structure on orbit space in this case ?

While I could have done something really boring like for(i < 10000000) { j = 2 * i } , I ended up having the program start with $1$ , and then for a million steps choose a random real number $r$ in the interval $[0,R]$ (uniformly distributed) and multiply the result by $r$ at each step. When $R = 2$ , it converged to $0$ . When $R = 3$ , it exploded to infinity. So of course, the question anyone with a modicum of curiosity would ask: for what $R$ do we have the transition.

E^x = \{y \in [0,1]:\: (x,y) \in E \},
\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}
E^y = \{x \in [0,1]:\: (x,y) \in E \}.
\end{equation*} Since for any $\phi \in \Phi([0,1] \times [0,1])$ \begin{equation*}
\alpha_{1} (\phi)
=
\operatorname*{ess sup}_{y \in [0,1]}
\sum_{i=1}^{N}

\sum_{i=1}^{N}
\lambda_i \,  \mu(E_i^x),

then $\Phi([0,1] \times [0,1]) \subset \mathcal{A}([0,1] \times [0,1])$ . Suppose $f^+ \in \mathcal{A}([0,1] \times [0,1])$ , $f^+(x,y) \geqslant 0$ for any $x,y \in [0,1]$ and define $$
\phi_m(x,y) =

$$ $$\forall x,y \in [0,1]: \quad \phi_1(x,y) \leqslant \phi_2(x,y) \leqslant \ldots \leqslant f^+(x,y),
$$ and \begin{equation*}
\forall x,y \in [0,1]: \quad f^+(x,y) = \lim\limits_{m \to \infty} \phi_m(x,y).
\end{equation*} From conditions $\alpha_1(f^+) < \infty$ and $\alpha_2(f^+) < \infty$ it follows that
for any fixed $y \in [0,1]$ the function $f^+(\cdot, y)$ is integrable
and for any fixed $x \in [0,1]$ the function $f^+(x, \cdot)$ is integrable too.
Hence, the dominated convergence theorem shows that the sequences of functions \begin{equation*}
g^{1}_m(y) =
\int\limits_{0}^{1}
\left(
f^+(x, y) - \phi_m(x,y)
\right)
dx,

y \in [0,1],

g^{2}_m(x) =
\int\limits_{0}^{1}
\left(
f^+(x, y) - \phi_m(x,y)
\right)
dy,
\quad x \in [0,1],
\end{equation*} converges to $0$ pointwise.
Now using Egorov's theorem we can conclude that the sequences $g^{1}_m$ and $g^{2}_m$ converges to $0$ almost uniform but not uniform. Any help would be greatly appreciated!","['measure-theory', 'lp-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

3355848,"Dummy variables in integration: Is $\int x^2\,dx=\int y^2\,dy$?","My understanding was that when writing out indefinite integrals, the variable we use (customarily $x$ ) is merely a dummy variable that can be replaced by any other letter. So for example, we may write $$\int x^2 \,dx=\int y^2 \,dy=\int z^2 \,dz=\int u^2 \,du.$$ However, I posted this other question and was told that I am mistaken. Am I? And if I am mistaken, then what precisely does the expression $\int x^2\,dx$ mean? How are we supposed to know when $\int x^2\,dx$ is not the same as $\int y^2\,dy$ ? My understanding was that Given the mapping $x\mapsto x^2$ , the expression $\int x^2\,dx$ refers to that mapping's antiderivative (or antiderivatives or set of antiderivatives). $x$ is merely a dummy variable. The choice of the letter $x$ is merely customary and we can replace $x$ with any other letter. What (if anything) is wrong with my understanding?","['integration', 'calculus', 'notation']"

Luckily, I found $\frac{x^3+1}{2}$ and $(2x-1)^{\frac{1}{3}}$ are inverses of each other, by using the general method of expressing $x$ in terms of $y$ for either L.H.S. or R.H.S. We know a function and its inverse are mirror images about the line $y=x$ . So I thought, the function and it's inverse if at all they meet or intersect, they must do so on the line $y=x$ . So, I solved $\frac{x^3+1}{2}=x$ and obtained the values of $x$ as follows: $$x=1, \frac{-1+\sqrt5}{2},\frac{-1-\sqrt5}{2}$$ So there are three values of $x$ that satisfy the obtained equation and so the answer for the above question, i.e., number of real solutions is three. And the answer is also correct according to the book. Then, I thought of functions like $y=\frac{1}{x}$ which intersect with their inverses at points other than on the line $y=x$ . So the above method I used is not rigorous even though it gave the correct answer here. Kindly give me an alternate solution for this problem and tell me whether I am allowed to use the method described above.","['alternative-proof', 'functions', 'inverse', 'inverse-function']"

3356042,Is this a correct application of Stokes' theorem?,"The problem: Compute the line integral $$\int_{\gamma} F \,\mathrm d r$$ where $F$ is a vector field $$F(x, y, z) = \left( y^2+z^4+x, 2xy-z^2+x, x^{18}y^6+z^{2016} \right)$$ and $\gamma$ is the bound of the intersection $T_1 \cap T_2$ where $$T_1 = \big\{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid x^2+y^2\leq16 \big\}$$ and $$T_2 = \big\{(x, y, z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid z=4, 0\leq y \leq 3 \big\}$$ The orientation of the curve is clockwise if looked at from the point $(0, 0, 100)$ . Since the given vector field seems highly complicated I immediately assumed that Stokes' theorem should be used. So the curve that we're integrating over is the circle $x^2+y^2\leq16$ on the height of $z=4$ where $0\leq y \leq 3$ . If looked at from the top it looks something like this: Now the surface that this encloses can be parametrized as: $$S: r(x, y)=(x, y, 4), \text{where } (x, y)\in D=\big\{(x, y)\in \mathbb{R^2}|x^2+y^2\leq16, 0 \leq y \leq 3 \big\}$$ The normal vector of this surface is $r'_x \times r'_y=(0, 0, 1)$ . Since, after applying Stokes' theorem, I'm going to be doing a scalar product of $(\nabla \times F)(r(x, y)) \cdot (r'_x \times r'_y) = (\nabla \times F)(r(x, y)) \cdot (0, 0, 1)$ , I've concluded that I don't care about the first two components of $\nabla \times F$ , therefore I've computed it as: $$\nabla \times F=(P, Q, \frac{d}{dx}(2xy-z^2+x) - \frac{d}{dy}(y^2+z^4+x)) = (P, Q, 2y+1-2y) = (P, Q, 1) = G$$ By the way, the $P$ and $Q$ are not meant to represent the original components of the vector field $F$ but rather just placeholders. And since Stokes' theorem says that the curve that encloses the surface should be oriented such that, when traversing the curve, the surface remains ""on the left side"", we'll add a minus sign, getting: $$\int_{\gamma}Fdr = - \iint_S{(\nabla \times F)dS} = -\iint_S{GdS} = -\iint_D{G(r(x, y)) \cdot (0, 0, 1)dxdy} = -\iint_D{(P(r(x, y), Q(r(x, y), 1) \cdot (0, 0, 1)}dxdy = -\iint_Ddxdy = - A(D)$$ Computing the area of the region $D$ gives some really uncomfortable results. I've done it by subtracting the area of the little 'cap' on the top (the part that gets cut off by the line $y=3$ ) from the area of the half-circle. Furthermore I've gotten the area of the cap by subtracting the area of the triangle formed by points $(0, 0), (\sqrt{7}, 3), (-\sqrt{7}, 3)$ from the area of the ""pizza-slice"" (don't know the English word for it) enclosed by the circle and lines $y=\frac{\pm \sqrt{7}}{3}$ . All that process got me to a really ugly solution: $$= 8\pi\bigg(1-\pi+2\arctan\bigg(\frac{3}{\sqrt7}\bigg)\bigg) + 3\sqrt7$$ So the final solution should be $-1$ times that. This is the first problem in which I've actually applied Stokes' theorem and you can see why I'm being skeptical about whether I've done it correctly. So, does my process seem correct?

My Attempt Write $$\underbrace{1\ldots1}_{81\text{ times}}=\underbrace{111,111,111}_{9\text{ times}}$$ and note that $111,111,111=9 \times 12,345,679$ . This also shows that $9 \mid 111,111,111$ . Now, the sum of digits of $$\underbrace{12,345,679}_{9\text{ times}}$$ is $37 \times 9$ which is clearly divisible by $9$ , thereby showing that $9 \mid 12,345,679$ . This in turn shows that $$81 \mid \underbrace{111,111,111}_{9\text{ times}}$$ Next, note that $$111,111,111=243 \times 457247.37\overline{037}=243 \times \left(457247+\frac{370}{999}\right)$$ As a result, we have $$\underbrace{111,111,111}_{9\text{ times}}=243 \times \left(457247+\frac{370}{999}\right) \times \left(1+10^{9}+\cdots+10^{72}\right)$$ To show that $$243 \nmid \underbrace{111,111,111}_{9\text{ times}}$$ we need only show that $999 \nmid (1+10^9+\cdots+10^{72})$ . Indeed, as $10^3 \equiv 1 \pmod {999}$ , so $10^9=(10^3)^3 \equiv 1^3 \equiv 1 \pmod {999}$ and in general $10^{9a} \equiv 1 \pmod {999}$ for $a \in \mathbb{N}$ . Since $$(1+10^9+\cdots+10^{72}) \equiv \underbrace{1+\cdots+1}_{9\text{ times}} =9 \pmod {999}$$ so $999 \nmid (1+10^9+\cdots+10^{72})$ and we get the desired result.

Let $y \in [m\cdot n]$ then there exists a $k \in [n]$ such that $(k-1)m < y \leq km$ . Also, $y-(k-1)m \in [m]$ .

As user Brian M. Scott outlined in an answer to a similar question ( Why is an infinite series not considered an infinite sum of terms? ), it is easier to define infinite series by the limit of their partial sums than by considering every single term. However, one geometric proof of the convergence of $1/2 + 1/4 +1/8+1/16+ \cdots$ has made me question why we circumvent the problem of adding infinitely many terms with the concept of the limit: Image credit: https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/infinite-series.html When you look at the diagram above, it seems like every single term has been included (not literally, but it is clear what the diagram represents). Furthermore, if you plotted the above shape on the Cartesian plane, the area of the shape would be $1$ . Even the point $(0.99999,0.99999)$ would be covered by a square/rectangle. When all of the terms have been plotted, it seems like the infinite series not only tends to 1, it equals $1$ . To me, this is not just because we define an infinite series to equal its limit. The limit only concerns the partial sums, whereas the diagram shows that even if we allow ourselves to add infinitely many terms, there is no immediate contradiction. Obviously, defining infinite series like this formally can create problems: infinite series do not have always have the commutative property, for example.

I started with defining a functor $\mathscr F:[\mathscr A,\mathscr B]^{op}\to[\mathscr A^{op},\mathscr B^{op}]$ as follows. On objects: $(F^{op}:\mathscr B\to \mathscr A)\mapsto (\mathscr F(F^{op}):\mathscr A^{op}\to\mathscr B^{op})$ where the functor $F(F^{op}):\mathscr A^{op}\to\mathscr B^{op}$ sends an object $A$ to $F(A)$ and a morphism $(f^{op}:A'\to A)$ to $(F^{op}(f^{op})=F(f)^{op}:F(A')\to F(A))$ . On morphisms: not sure. Given a natural transformation $\alpha=(\alpha_B:F^{op}(B)\to G^{op}(B))_{B\in\mathscr B}$ between $F$ and $G$ , we need to define a natural transformation $\mathscr F(\alpha)=(\mathscr F(\alpha)_A:\mathscr F(F^{op})(A)\to \mathscr F(G^{op})(A))_{A\in\mathscr A^{op}}=(\mathscr F(\alpha)_A:F(A)\to G(A))_{A\in\mathscr A}$ . I don't quite see how to define this in terms of $\alpha_B$ . Each $\alpha_B$ is an arrow in $\mathscr A$ , but we need $\mathscr F(\alpha)_A$ to be an arrow in $\mathscr B$ . I thought about taking $\mathscr F(\alpha)_A$ to be $F(\alpha_A)$ , but $\alpha_A$ (for $A\in \mathscr A$ ) doesn't make sense. Another attempt: Define $\mathscr F:[\mathscr A,\mathscr B]^{op}\to[\mathscr A^{op},\mathscr B^{op}]$ as follows. On objects: given a functor $F:\mathscr A\to \mathscr B$ , assign to it the functor $F^{op}:\mathscr A^{op}\to\mathscr B^{op}$ . (This $F^{op}$ is defined on objects by $F^{op}(A)=F(A)$ and on morphisms by $F^{op}(f^{op}:A'\to A)=F(f)^{op}$ .) Now take a morphism in $[\mathscr A,\mathscr B]^{op}$ . It is a natural transformation $\alpha^{op}: G\to F$ (where $F,G:\mathscr A\to\mathscr B$ are functors). The naturality of $\alpha^{op}$ says this: for any arrow $g:A\to A'$ in $\mathscr A$ , we have $$\alpha_{A'}^{op}\circ G(g)=F(g)\circ \alpha_A^{op}.$$ We need to assign to $\alpha^{op}$ a natural transformation $\mathscr F(\alpha^{op}): G^{op}\to F^{op}$ . So for each $A\in\mathscr A$ we need to define $F(\alpha^{op})_A=:\beta_A$ . The following naturality condition must hold: for any arrow $f^{op}:A'\to A$ in $\mathscr A^{op}$ , $$F(f)\circ_{op} \beta_{A'}=\beta_A\circ_{op} G(f)^{op}.$$ I was thinking about $\beta=(\alpha^{op})^{op}=\alpha$ . But $\alpha_A$ is an arrow $F(A)\to G(A)$ , whereas $\beta_A$ has to be an arrow $G(A)\to F(A)$ . And $\beta_A=\alpha_A^{op}$ doesn't work either because if you substitute $\alpha$ for $\beta$ in the naturality condition (second display), it doesn't check out.","['functions', 'category-theory']"

3356645,Counting the number of subsets with a given property,"Let $S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 12\}$ be a set. How many subsets $S' \subseteq S$ satisfy the property that for any $x, y\in S'$ , $|x - y| > 2$ ? This is a problem from a math contest, but I'm not so sure how to figure it out. I tried splitting it into casework on the sizes. For example, I think $|S'| = 4$ is the maximal sized subset but there are even a lot of possible subsets for that size. For $|S'| = 1$ , there are $12$ possible subsets (the condition is vacuously true). I'm sure there's probably some really clever way to count these subsets, and I am seeking help to find it. Thanks Following lulu's approach (in comments): $a_1 = 2$ (empty set and the singleton) $a_2 = 3$ (two possible singletons and the empty set) $a_3 = 4$ (three possible singletons and the empty set) Now using the recurrence $a_n = a_{n - 1} + a_{n - 3}$ , we get $a_4 = 6$ , $a_5 = 9$ , $a_6 = 13$ , $a_7 = 19$ , $a_8 = 28$ , $a_9 = 41, a_{10} = 60, a_{11} = 88, a_{12} = 129$ . So the answer is $129$ . Is this right?","['combinations', 'combinatorics']"

3356703,Finding an upper bound to the order of finite subgroup of the automorphism group of rational map,"Let $\phi: \Bbb P^1 \to \Bbb P^1$ be a rational map then we define $Aut(\phi)=\{f \in PGL_2(\Bbb C): f^{-1}\phi f(z)=\phi(z)\}$ Here, in general, the definition of a rational map is: Let $\mathbb{P}^n$ and $\mathbb{P}^m$ be projective spaces. If $m$ homogeneous polynomials in $n+1$ variables of the same degree ""d"" give a partially defined map from $\mathbb{P}^n$ to $\mathbb{P}^m$ then this map is called a rational map. We can exactly define this on a projective variety as well. Now for $\mathbb{P}^1$ we can prove that: Let $\phi: \Bbb P^1 \to \Bbb P^1$ be a rational map of degree $d \geq 2$ . Then $Aut(\phi)$ is a finite subgroup of $ PGL_2(\Bbb C)$ and its order is bounded by a function of $d$ . This proof can be done by using the fact that $f\in PGL_2(\Bbb C)$ is basically a Mobius transformation and once it fixes three points it is constant and once we know this result we can manipulate the periodic points of $\phi$ to have an upper bound.
If you ask for details I can fill in the gaps. The problem arises if we go to higher dimension say $\mathbb{P}^2$ or $\mathbb{P}^n, n\geq 2$ . Then we will have at least 3 homogeneous polynomials in at least $3$ variables of the same degree. Can we extend this result and have some bounds? Any hint or result would be much appreciated. Even if you give some sequential hints I can try to fill the gaps and reach out for help in the comments.","['automorphism-group', 'complex-dynamics', 'arithmetic-dynamics', 'algebraic-geometry', 'dynamical-systems']"
3356735,Divergence of $\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} a\sin(n)$ for $a>1$ to $0$ or $\infty$,"Consider the product $$\displaystyle\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} a\sin(n).$$ When $a=1$ , clearly this product diverges to $0$ , as $|{\sin{(n)}}|\le1$ , so the value of the partial products can only decrease or stay the same (and they will only decrease if $n\in \mathbb{N}$ ). However, the divergence to 0 or infinity of this product becomes much more complex if $a>1$ . The question of divergence to $0$ is certainly not intuitive, as when $\sin(n)\approx0,$ the partial product will drop significantly, but when $|\sin(n)|>{1\over{a}}$ the partial product will grow (and this happens frequently for large enough $a$ ). What seems to happen is that, for $a\le2$ the partial sums chaotically grow, before eventually divergine to $0$ . For example, $\displaystyle\prod_{n=1}^{307} 2\sin(n)\approx1402$ , but $\displaystyle\prod_{n=1}^{5000} 2\sin(n)\approx 4.8\times10^{-13}$ . When I ask Mathematica about the infinite product when, it rather quickly claims that the product does not converge for any $a$ (I do not know whether this also means it does not diverge to 0). Numerical evidence seems to suggest divergence to $0$ otherwise for $a\le2$ . For $a>2$ , it seems to fairly quickly diverge to infinity. $a=2$ is probably the most interesting case, as approximately $50$ % of the time it should grow, since $0<|\sin(n)|<1$ and the partial product grows iff $|\sin(n)|>1/2$ . Is it known whether this product diverges to $0$ for even one example of $a$ where $1<a\le2$ ? And if $a=2$ ? If it doesn't necessarily diverge to $0$ , does it remain bounded? 
And can divergence to infinity be proven for any $a>2$ ?","['infinite-product', 'trigonometry', 'convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series']"
3356746,Proof using derivative information to find limit,"This is the last exercise of a quite challenging exercises paper a friend who is taking calculus has which I'm trying to help. I already helped her doing the other bunch. But this got me. I will appreciate anyone help to see my work and to tell me if is right or If I need to correct something. The exercise is: If $f'(a)=1$ for $a>0$ , find $\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{a}}$ . What came to my mind was to rationalize the denominator. $$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{a}}$$ $$=\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{a}}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{a}}$$ $$=\lim_{x \to a} \frac{(f(x)-f(a))(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{a})}{x-a}$$ $$=\lim_{x \to a} \left(\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\cdot (\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{a})\right)$$ $$=\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\cdot \lim_{x \to a}(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{a})$$ $$=f'(a)\cdot \lim_{x \to a}(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{a})$$ $$=1\cdot \lim_{x \to a}(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{a})$$ $$=\lim_{x \to a}(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{a})$$ $$=\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{a}$$ $$=2\sqrt{a}$$","['limits', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"
3356750,Vector in 9 dimensions always has a solution?,"I was watching Professor Gilbert Strang's lecture on Linear Algebra, and in the video, he talks about when we can or cannot say that linear combinations of vectors span the entire region in that dimension. He said that if we had nine vectors, each of dimension 9,  and if the vectors were all random, then the answer is probably yes. But if it is the case that two of the nine vectors are the same, then they don't add anything new to the equation, and what we will get is probably an 8-dimensional plane. I don't understand how this is the case. Also, could someone explain what this means in terms of the number of solutions we will get?",['linear-algebra']

Suppose the particles move according to Brownian motion, and that they may wander into $\Omega$ through a small opening $\ell$ in the boundary of $\Omega$ . See my diagram: How does the density of $\Omega$ change over time? I know that as $t\to\infty$ , the density of $\Omega$ approaches $\delta_0$ . I suspect that the rate of convergence to $\delta_0$ is determined by the length of $\ell$ , and also by the parameters of the random motion. My question is: what is an expression for the density of $\Omega$ at a given time $t\in\Bbb R$ ?","['stochastic-processes', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
