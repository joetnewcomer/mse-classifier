1706695,Geometric interpretation of algebraic property,"Let $X \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ be an irreducible affine algebraic curve with coordinate ring $$\mathbb{C}[X] = \mathbb{C}[z_1, \ldots, z_n] / (f_1, \ldots, f_m ) $$ with each $f_i \in \mathbb{Z}[z_1, \ldots, z_n]$.  Define $\mathbb{Z}[X] = \mathbb{Z}[z_1, \ldots, z_n] / (f_1, \ldots, f_m )$. Now, if $f\in \mathbb{C}[X]$ can be represented by a polynomial in with integer coefficients, then $\mathbb{C}[X]$ (resp. $\mathbb{Z}[X]$) can be regarded as a module over $\mathbb{C}[f]$ (resp. $\mathbb{Z}[f]$), where $\mathbb{C}[f]$ is the $\mathbb{C}$-algebra generated by $f$ in $\mathbb{C}[X]$.  Note that $\mathbb{C}[f]$ is the image of the induced homomorphims $f^\ast \colon \mathbb{C}[\mathbb{A}^1] \to \mathbb{C}[X]$. Suppose $\mathbb{C}[X]$ and $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ are finitely generated over $\mathbb{C}[f]$ and $\mathbb{Z}[f]$ (i.e. $f$ is a finite regular map).  For $\mathbb{S} \in \{ \mathbb{C, Z}\}$, let $\mu_\mathbb{S} (f)$ denote the minimal number of generators for $\mathbb{S}[X]$ over $\mathbb{S}[f]$.  Then $\mu_\mathbb{Z}(f) \geq \mu_\mathbb{C} ( f)$ and this inequality can be strict. My question:  Is there a geometric interpretation of the case when $\mu_\mathbb{Z} ( f) > \mu_\mathbb{C} (f)$?  What does this say about $f$ when thinking of it as a regular function on $X$?  Does this inequality tell us anything geometric about $X$? Edit: From this Overflow post and Corollary A3.3 in Eisenbud's Commutative Algebra , it appears that this has to do with algebraic vector bundles on $\mathbb{A}^1$, but I can't figure out how the regular function $f$ fits into the picture or what intersecting down to $\mathbb{Z}$ does.","['algebraic-curves', 'modules', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

  To find the extended form of the group generated by $A$, we must solve the following equations 
  $$\frac{\partial z(a')}{\partial a'}=z(a')$$ and $$\frac{\partial v(a')}{\partial a'}=v(a')$$ where $z(0)=z$ and $v(0)=1$ Now from the first equation we get $$\int \frac{\partial z(a')}{\partial a'} \frac {1}{z(a')}da'= \int d a' $$
$$ \log z(a') =  a' +k $$ 
we put $a'=0$ to find the constant $k$ 
$$ \log z =  k $$ 
Then $$ \log z(a') =  a' + \log z $$ 
$$ z(a') = z e^{a'}$$ On the other hand from the second equation we get $$\int \frac{\partial v(a')}{\partial a'} \frac {1}{v(a')}da'= \int d a' $$
$$ \log v(a') =  a' +k $$ 
we put $a'=0$ to find the constant $k$ 
$$  k=0 $$ 
Then $$ \log v(a') =  a'  $$ 
$$ v(a') = e^{a'}$$ Thus $$ e^{a' A} f(x,y,z)=e^{a'}f(x,y,ze^{a'}) $$ (II): The second operator $$B=\frac{(x^2 - ay)}{yz}\frac{\partial }{\partial x}-\frac{x}{y}\frac{\partial }{\partial z}$$ To find the extended form of the group generated by $B$, we must solve the following equations $$\frac{\partial x(b')}{\partial b'}=\frac{(x^2(b')-ay)}{yz(b')}$$ and $$\frac{\partial z(b')}{\partial b'}=- \frac{x(b')}{y}$$ where $z(0)=z$ and $x(0)=x$ This equations need to be solved, but I can't do anything after this step.

1707309,Show that the integral of a bounded measurable function of finite support is properly defined.,"Edit: My post might be lacking context. The question was posed because the book has only defined the Lebesgue integral of functions on a measurable set $E$ where $m(E)<\infty.$ The definition below asks, if given a measurable $E$ whose measure can be finite or infinite, is it really properly defined? This is a problem from Royden and Fitzpatrick's Real Analysis. Can anybody check if my proof is correct? Suppose $f$ is a bounded and measurable function on E with a finite support, we can define its integral over $E$ by $$\int_E f = \int_{E{_0}} f$$ where $E_0$ has finite measure and $f\equiv 0$ on $E \sim E_0$. My attempt at proof . We wish to show that the definition above is independent of the choice of finite measure set $E_0$ where $f$ vanishes outside it. By hypothesis, $f$ has finite support, denote the support of $f$ by $E'=\{x\in E: f(x) \neq 0\}$. Let $E_0$ and $E_1$ be subsets of $E$ of finite measure where $f$ vanishes outside it. By the additivity over domains property of integration, since $E' \subseteq E_0$, and $E' \subseteq E_1$ (so $E'$ has finite measure as well), then we can write: $$\int_{E_0}f=\int_{E_0 \sim E'}f +\int_{E'}f, $$ and $$\int_{E_1}f=\int_{E_1 \sim E'}f +\int_{E'}f.$$ Therefore: $$\int_{E_0}f-\int_{E_1}f =\int_{E_0 \sim E'}f - \int_{E_1 \sim E'}f.$$ But, $E_0 \sim E'=\{x\in E_0 :f(x)=0 \}$ and $E_1 \sim E'=\{x\in E_1 :f(x)=0 \}$, so $f\equiv 0$ in both of these sets, hence, the integral of $f$ over these sets is $0$. Therefore: $$\int_{E_0}f=\int_{E_1}f.$$ Hence, the definition above is well defined since $E_0$ and $E_1$ are arbitrary.","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-integral', 'proof-verification']"
1707316,Isaacs TFG 5C11 - Burnside's transfer lemma for an abelian Hall subgroup,"I am trying to solve the following exercise: 
Let $G$ be a finite group and $A$ a Hall abelian subgroup of $G$. Assume that 
$$
A\le Z(N_G(A))
$$
Then  $G$ has a normal $p-$complement for every prime divisor $p$ of $|A|$ I am following the indications given.
Argue by induction on $|G|$. If $G=1$, there is nothing to prove. 
Let $P\in Syl_p(A)$. Assume that $N_G(P)<G$. As $A$ is abelian, $P\triangleleft A$ and so $A\le N_G(P)<G$. Hence $A$ is an abelian Hall subgroup of $N_G(P)$. By hypothesis, $A\le Z(N_G(A))$ and since $N_{N_G(P)}(A)\le N_G(A)$, it follows that 
$$
A\le Z(N_{N_G(P)}(A))
$$ 
By the induction hypothesis, it follows that $P$ has a normal complement in $N_G(P)$ i.e. there is $K\triangleleft N_G(P)$ such that $N_G(P)=PK$ and $P\cap K=1$. Since $P$ is abelian, $P=Z(P)$. Moreover, since $P,K\triangleleft N_G(P)$, $[P,K]\le P\cap K=1$ and so $P\le Z(K)$. Hence $P\le Z(N_G(P))$ and, by by Burnside's transfer lemma, $P$ has a normal complement in $G$. Assume that $P\triangleleft G$. If every Sylow subgroup of $A$ is normal in $G$, we are done. Indeed, since $A$ is an Hall subgroup of $G$, every such subgroup is a Sylow subgroup of $G$ and therefore $G$ is nilpotent (and thus $p-$nilpotent for every prime $p$). Therefore assume that there is $Q\le Syl_q(G)$ for $q\neq p$ such that $N_G(Q)<G$.
I now show that $P\le Z(N_G(Q))$. By the same reasoning as above, $A\le Z(N_{N_G(Q)}(A))$. Hence $N_G(Q)$ has a normal $p-$complement for every prime divisor $p$ of $|A|$. By the lemma below, $A$ has a normal complement in $N_G(Q)$  i.e. there is $L\le N_G(Q)$ such that $N_G(Q)=AL$ and $A\cap L=1$. Since $A$ is abelian, $P\le Z(A)$ and $P\le C_G(Q)\le N_G(Q)$. Since $P\triangleleft G$, it follows that $P\triangleleft N_G(Q)$. Therefore $[P,L]\le P\cap L\le A\cap L=1$. Hence $P\le Z(L)$ and so $P\le Z(N_G(Q))$. From there I am stuck. Above, I have used the following lemma. Lemma: 
Let G be a finite group and $A$ an abelian subgroup of $G$. Write $A=P_1...P_n$ where the $P_i$ are the Sylow $p_i-$subgroups of $A$ for $1\leq i\leq n$. Assume each $P_i$ has a normal $(p_i-)$complement $K_i$ in $G$. Then $A$ has a normal complement in $G$ and it is $K_1 \cap...\cap K_n$. Proof: We first show that $P_1...P_n \cap \bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i=1$. Since $A$ is abelian, each $P_i$ is a a normal subgroup of $A$ and so any product of the $P_i$ is a subgroup of $A$ and obviously of $G$. Since $[G:K_1]\wedge |P_2|=1$, it follows that $P_2\le K_1$. Now, by the modular law, 
$$
P_1P_2\cap K_1=P_2(P_1\cap K_1)=P_2
$$
and thus
$$
P_1P_2\cap K_1\cap K_2=P_2\cap K_2=1
$$
The result then follows by induction. We have $[G:\bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i] \leq \prod\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} [G:K_i]$. Hence $$
|\bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i| \geq \dfrac{|G|}{\prod\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} [G:K_i]}=\dfrac{|G|}{\prod\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} |P_i|}
$$
Now $|P_1...P_n|=\prod\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} |P_i|$ since the $P_i$ are all coprime. Hence $|P_1...P_n \bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} K_i| \geq |G|$. And so $G=P_1...P_n \bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} K_i$. Last, since $K_i \triangleleft G$ for all i, we have $\bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i \triangleleft G$ and so $K=\bigcap\limits_{1\leq i\leq n}K_i$ is the normal complement of $P_1...P_n$. I found the solution. By the same reasoning as above, $Q\le N_G(Z(Q))$ and so by Burnside's transfer theorem, $Q$ has a normal complement $L$ in $G$. Now as $P\triangleleft G$, $P$ is the unique Sylow $p-$subgroup of $G$ and so $P\le L$. Then $P$ is an abelian normal Hall subgroup of $L$ and so, by Schur E, $P$ has a normal complement $K$ in $L$. Since $P\triangleleft L$, it follows that $L=P\times K$. We have $$G=QL=QKP$$ and we show that $QK$ is a normal complement to $P$ in $G$. Actually we show that $G=P\times QK$. It suffices to show that $[P,QK]=P\cap QK=1$. $Q$ is clearly a $p'-$group. Since $P$ is a Sylow sybgroup of $L$, it follows that $K$ is also a $p'-$group. Since $Q\cap K=1$, $|QK|=|Q||K|$ is a $p'$number. Hence, by Lagrange's theorem, $P\cap QK=1$. Trivially, $[P,Q]=1$. And $[P,K]=1$ since $L=P\times K$. Hence $[P,QK]=1$. I believe the following proof works. We show by induction on $|G|$ that $G$ has a normal $p-$complement for every prime divisor $p$ of $|A|$, which gives immediately the result by the lemma. If $G=1$, there is nothing to prove. 
Let $P\in Syl_p(A)$. Assume that $N_G(P)<G$. As $A$ is abelian, $P\triangleleft A$ and so $A\le N_G(P)<G$. Hence $A$ is an abelian Hall subgroup of $N_G(P)$. By hypothesis, $A\le Z(N_G(A))$ and since $N_{N_G(P)}(A)\le N_G(A)$, it follows that 
$$
A\le Z(N_{N_G(P)}(A))
$$ 
By the induction hypothesis, it follows that $P$ has a normal complement in $N_G(P)$ i.e. there is $K\triangleleft N_G(P)$ such that $N_G(P)=PK$ and $P\cap K=1$. Since $P$ is abelian, $[P,P]=1$. Moreover, since $P,K\triangleleft N_G(P)$, $[P,K]\le P\cap K=1$ and so $[P,K]=1$. Hence $P\le Z(N_G(P))$ and, by Burnside's transfer theorem, $P$ has a normal complement in $G$. Assume that $P\triangleleft G$. If every Sylow subgroup of $A$ is normal in $G$, we are done. Indeed, it implies that $A\triangleleft G$ and so by hypothesis, $A\le Z(G)$. By Schur-Zassenhaus, $A$ has a complement $K$ in $G$. This complement is normal in $G$ as trivially $K\le N_G(K)$ and $A \le N_G(K)$ since $A\le Z(G)$ and therefore $G=AK\le N_G(K)$. 
Therefore assume that there is $Q\le Syl_q(G)$ for $q\neq p$ such that $N_G(Q)<G$. We show that $P\le Z(N_G(Q))$. By induction, $A$ has a normal complement in $N_G(Q)$  i.e. there is $L\triangleleft N_G(Q)$ such that $N_G(Q)=AL$ and $A\cap L=1$. Since $A$ is abelian, $[P,A]=1$ and $P\le C_G(Q)\le N_G(Q)$. Since $P\triangleleft G$, it follows that $P\triangleleft N_G(Q)$. Therefore $[P,L]\le P\cap L\le A\cap L=1$. Hence $[P,N_G(Q)]=[P,AL]=1$ and so $P\le Z(N_G(Q))$. We will prove that $P$ is contained in the center of $G$ and since $P$ is normal in $G$, we have that $P\le Z(N_G(P))$, so $P$ has a normal $p$-complement by Burnside's Theorem. If $g \in G$ then $[P,Q^g]=[P^g,Q^g]=[P,G]^g=1$ where the first equality follows from the fact that $P$ is normal in $G$ and the last from the fact that $[P,Q]=1$ since $P<Z(N_G(Q))$. This means that $P$ commutes with all the conjugates of $Q$ in $G$ and then commutes with the normal closure $Q^G$. If $Q^G=G$ then $P$ commutes with the whole $G$ and it is in the center, so we are done. If $Q^G<G$ then $Q^G$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ containing $Q$ that is a $q$-Sylow of $G$ and by Frattini Argument $G=N_G(Q)Q^G$. But $P$ commutes with both $N_G(Q)$ and $Q^G$ and then commutes with their product $G$, in other words $P<Z(G)$.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

The total space is a rank $n$ vector bundle, which is easy to see, just take any open subset $U$ such that $\mathcal{F}|_U$ is trivial, then we have 
\begin{equation}
Spec(\text{Sym}^\bullet \mathcal{F}^\vee|_U) \cong \mathbb{A}_U^n
\end{equation} In Ex. 17.1.G, it claims that $\mathcal{F}$ is isomorphic to the sheaf of sections of the total space $Spec(\text{Sym}^\bullet \mathcal{F}^\vee)$. It is easy to see that the sections of $Spec(\text{Sym}^\bullet \mathcal{F}^\vee)$ on $U$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_U^n$, i.e. when $U$ is affine, say $U=\text{Spec}(A)$, then we have $\text{Sym}^\bullet \mathcal{F}^\vee|_U \cong A[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ and the sections is in one to  one bijection with the $A$-map $A[x_1,\cdots,x_n] \rightarrow A$, which is determined by the values of $x_i$, thus it is isomorphic to $A^n$. However, I could not show the transition functions are actually the same. If the transition functions for $\mathcal{F}$ is $T_{ij}$ with respect to the affine open cover $U_i$, then the transition function for $\mathcal{F}^\vee$ is $(T_{ij}^t)^{-1}$, the inverse of transpose. It seems to me that the transition function for the vector bundle $Spec(\text{Sym}^\bullet \mathcal{F}^\vee)$ is actually $(T_{ij}^t)^{-1}$. How could the transition function for the sheaf of its sections be the same as that of $\mathcal{F}$, i.e. $T_{ij}$?","['vector-bundles', 'schemes', 'sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

1707574,Is it smarter to defend with one army or with two in the game Risk?,"I've recently played Risk with the following rules: One player can attack another player with at most 3 armies. The defender can defend with at most 2 armies. This is independent of the number of attacking armies. Each player (attacker and defender) gets to throw a die for each army they have. So the attacker throws at most 3 dice and the defender throws at most two dice. When an attack is launched and the dice are thrown, the question is which armies get defeated. To do so, the result of the attacker's dice $a_1, a_2, a_3$ and the defender's dice $d_1, d_2$ are ordered descending. They are compared pairwise ($a_1$ vs $d_1$; $a_2$ vs $d_2$; $a_3$ is ignored). The attacker wins if $a_i > d_i$, otherwise the defender wins. There will be a loss of exactly $k$ armies, where $k = \max(\text{number of attacking armies}, \text{number of defending armies})$. So $k \in \{1, 2\}$. Any combination is possible (the attacker loses 2 armies, the defender loses 2 armies, both lose 1 army for the case with $k=2$). For the attacker, I think it always makes sense to attack with 3 armies if he can. However, suppose the attacker has $n$ armies and will keep attacking until the defender has lost or he has no armies to attack with any more.

1707592,Proving that the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian form a basis of $L^2(\Omega)$ (and of $H_0^1(\Omega)$),"I am studying the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplacian on an open, bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. I have read about the the weak and variational formulation of the problem. I understand the result that the first eigenvalue is given by: $$ \lambda_1 = \inf_{H_0^1(\Omega)} R = \inf_{v \in H_0^1(\Omega)} \frac{\int_\Omega \| \nabla v\|^2 \, \mathrm{d}x}{\int_\Omega v^2 \, \mathrm{d}x}$$
and the associated eigenfunction is $u_1$ such that $R(u_1) = \lambda_1$, as well as the characterization of the nth eigenvalue/eigenfunction. I have proved some of the basic results, such as the fact that the sequence of eigenvalues is unbounded and eigenfunctions associated to different eigenvalues are orthogonal (both in $L^2(\Omega)$ and $H_0^1(\Omega)$). Now I am trying to prove that the eigenfunctions $u_1,u_2,\ldots$ form a basis of $L^2(\Omega)$. I have seen some proofs of this fact (e.g. Jost's book on PDEs and Mihai Nica's article), but I am trying to use a different approach. I have a sketch of this proof but I need to fill in some details. The proof argues by contradiction. We define $V$ to be the closure in $H_0^1(\Omega)$ of the set:
$$\left\{ u \in H_0^1(\Omega) : \exists \, N \in \mathbb{N}: u = \sum_{n=1}^N\alpha_nu_n\right\},$$
where $\alpha_n \in \mathbb{R}$ and the $u_n$'s are the eigenfunctions. Then $V$ is a closed subspace of $H_0^1(\Omega)$. We assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $V \neq H_0^1(\Omega)$. 1) This should then imply that $V^\perp \neq \{0\}$, but I am not sure why. I know that it is not necessary for a subset of a Hilbert space $H$ to be equal to the whole space $H$ for its orthogonal complement to be trivial. However here the space is closed so it is possible that this may force the orthogonal complement to be trivial, but I am not sure if that is enough. Then $V^\perp$ is a non-trivial closed subspace of $H_0^1(\Omega)$ and hence we can apply the same methods used to determine the existence of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to deduce the existence of an eigenfunction $u$ in $V^\perp$. It can then be shown that the eigenvalue associated to this eigenfunction must equal one of the previously determined eigenvalues (I understand how to do this). 2) Then I am not sure why this leads us to a contradiction. My guess is that then this $u\in V^\perp$ should equal some $u_n \in V$ (it is obvious that $V$ contains all the $u_n$'s) and this would imply that $V\cap V^\perp \neq \varnothing$, which is impossible. 3) This would then prove that $V = H_0^1(\Omega)$ but I have some doubts/confusion as to why this shows that the $u_n$'s form a basis of $H_0^1(\Omega)$, if they do. 4) Then I am not sure how to extend this to $L^2(\Omega)$. I suspect that the fact that $H_0^1(\Omega)$ is dense in $L^2(\Omega)$ should play a role.

Let $$R_Y = \{(x, y)\ |\ y \in Y, x \in Y, (p, q) \in R_Y \Rightarrow p = x\}$$ Then there is a function $f_Y : dom(R_Y) \rightarrow X$ . But $dom(R_Y)$ is singleton from the definition of $R_Y$ . Then $im(f_Y)$ is also singleton. We define our choice function as $f = \{(Y, y)\ |\ y \in im(f_Y)\}$ Are my arguments correct?

Then if $f$ is my choice function I define $f(Y) = f_Y(y)$ . May be I should define $R_Y$ as $$R_Y = \{(x, y)\ |\ y \in Y; x \in Y; (p, q), (p', q) \in R_Y \Rightarrow p = p'\}$$ I understand there may be multiple $R_y$ 's. But can't I define a singleton set as $\{s\in S\ |\ a, b \in S \Rightarrow a = b\}$ ? This can be $\{s\}$ $\forall s \in S$ . But isn't it a valid specification? Edit.2 : This is the final solution with the help from @Asaf. If we assume axiom of choice then for any $X$ there is a choice function $f : \mathcal{P}(X) \setminus \left\{\emptyset\right\} \rightarrow X$ such that $f(A) \in A$ .
Suppose $R$ is a relation between $P$ and $Q$ . Then we have a choice function $f_Q$ for $Q$ .
Let $f_R(p) = f_Q(\{q\ |\ pRq\})$ . The function $f_R : P \rightarrow Q$ and $dom(f_R) = dom(R)$ . So this is our required function. Conversely, if every relation includes a function with same domain. Let $R$ be a relation between $\mathcal{P}(X) \setminus \left\{\emptyset\right\}$ and $X$ such that $aRb \Rightarrow b \in a$ . Now $R$ includes a function $f : \mathcal{P}(X) \setminus \left\{\emptyset\right\} \rightarrow X$ . Then $xRf(x) \Rightarrow f(x) \in x$ . So $f$ is the choice function for $X$ .","['elementary-set-theory', 'axiom-of-choice']"

My first attempt: $$\binom{5}{3} \cdot \binom{3}{3} = \frac{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 10 \cdot \frac{3!}{3!}$$ Since there are only two ways for committees with no same gender, I did $10-2 = 8$ as my final answer.

For every neighbourhood $N_1(L)$ we have a neighbourhood $N_2(x)$ such that the whenever $y \in N_2(x)$ and $x\neq y$, $f(y) \in N_1(L)$. Now, consider $t$ only such that $t \in N_2(x)$. Note $t\neq x$. $\lim_{y \to t} f(y) = L'$ exists, and so for any neighbourhood $N_4(L')$ we have a corresponding $N_3(t)$; we simply make this $N_3(t)$ small enough so that $N_3(t) \subset N_2(x)$.

1708266,Why square a constant when determining variance of a random variable?,"If I want to calculate the sample variance such as below: Which becomes: $\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2 \cdot n(\sigma^2)= \frac{\sigma^2}{n} $... My question is WHY does it become $$\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2?$$
In other words, why does the $(1/n)$ inside the variance become $(1/n)^2$? I've read that this is because: When a random variable is multiplied by a constant, it's variance gets multiplied by the square of the constant. Again, though, I want to know why ? I've looked in multiple sources but they all seem to gloss over this point. I want to visually see why this is done. Could someone please demonstrate why the $1/n$ is squared using my example? Update : As @symplectomorphic points out in a comment under their answer , my confusion was the result of not realizing there was a difference between the variance of a set of data and the variance of a random variable . See @symplectomorphic's other comment for an explanation of the difference. @symplectomorphic's answer provides a good conceptual walkthrough, while user @Tryss's answer provides the correct mathematical explanation.

1708371,Uniqueness of Solution for Boundary Valued Problems,"Is it true that all boundary problems (ODE's n-order, PDE's, etc.) in any dimension always have an unique solution (if a solution exists)? If not, what are some counterexamples to this? Furthermore, is there a general set of restrictions that will allow the uniqueness of solution (ODE, PDE, etc.). For example, forcing both the derivative and the position function to have certain values at the boundary, or required the solution to be infinitely smooth and the space compact. Maybe it has to do with weak derivative, etc. My intuition is that the answer should be no. Suppose two non-identical solutions for the BVP exist. Then I can ""follow"" both equations ""out"" (away) from the Boundary to a point where they differ. This means the vector field points in two directions at this point, which is not allowed to happen as learned in elementary differential equation.

I have been perusing ""Dimension Theory"" by Witold Hurewicz & Henry Wallman and while doing so noticed I couldn't quite see the reason for 'studying/researching' dimension theory. As an undergraduate when I was taught the concept of dimension in terms of 'linear independence' and 'spanning' of vectors I never paid much heed to alternate/analytical formulations of dimension. Now having come across, say, the Hausdorff, Fractal, Assouad dimensions I am quite curious as to why mathematicians have focussed so much on this avenue. I would be very, very grateful for any pointers or links which can give me a little bit of 'general' motivation for studying dimensions i.e why study dimension theory. Specific examples from dynamical systems, metric geometry, number theory, set theory et cetera are very welcome too. Thank you, thanks a lot!

1708528,Linear fractional transformation of quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere,"Suppose I have the following quadratic differential on the Riemann sphere with four punctures: \begin{equation}
q = -\frac{9 t \left(216+t^3\right)}{\left(-27+t^3\right)^2} dt^2
\end{equation} This has four zeroes, and four second-order poles (one for each of the punctures). Now, since $q$ is on the sphere, we should be allowed to do an $SL\left(2, \mathbb{C}\right)$ reparameterisation, of the form $t \rightarrow \frac{az+b}{cz+d}$. So, to test, choose $a=c=b=1$, and $d=2$. Then, using the quadratic differential transformation rule that if $q = f\left(z\right)dz^2 = g\left(w\right)dw^2$, then \begin{equation}
f\left(z\right) = g\left(w\left(z\right)\right)\left(\frac{d w\left(z\right)}{dz}\right)^2 ,
\end{equation} I find \begin{equation}
q = -\frac{9 \left(1729+4324 z+3894 z^2+1516 z^3+217 z^4\right)}{(2+z)^2 \left(215+321 z+159 z^2+26 z^3\right)^2} dz^2 .
\end{equation} This now has five second-order poles. But it should still be living on a sphere with four punctures, so it looks like it has picked up another pole. This confuses me; I had really hoped the number of poles would be invariant under such reparameterisations. So, my question is: Is such an $SL\left(2,\mathbb{C}\right)$ transformation on a quadratic differential on a Riemann sphere with punctures actually legitimate? If not, why not? If the transformation is legitimate, what is the explanation for the extra pole in the quadratic differential after the transformation?

1708543,Infinitely nested radical expansion of functions,"Is where a 'best' way to make a nested radical expansion for an analytic function? This way seems convenient: $$f(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+\dots=\sqrt{a_0^2+2a_0a_1x+(a_1^2+2a_0a_2)x^2+\cdots}=$$ $$=\sqrt{a_0^2+2a_0a_1x+(a_1^2+2a_0a_2)x^2 \sqrt{1+\cdots}}$$ I conjecture that this infinitely nested radical expansion has the same interval of convergence as the original Taylor series. Is this correct? Also, the number of 'roots' we take into account gives us twice the number plus one of the correct terms in the Taylor series. For example: $$e^x=\sqrt{1+2x+2x^2\sqrt{1+\frac{4}{3}x+\frac{10}{9}x^2\sqrt{1+\frac{32}{25}x+\frac{681}{625}x^2\sqrt{1+\dots}}}}=$$ $$=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{6}+\frac{x^4}{24}+\frac{x^5}{120}+\frac{x^6}{720}+\dots$$ This expression converges for any $x$. $$\frac{1}{1-x}=\sqrt{1+2x+3x^2\sqrt{1+\frac{8}{3}x+\frac{46}{9}x^2\sqrt{1+\frac{76}{23}x+\frac{4089}{529}x^2\sqrt{1+\dots}}}}=$$ $$=1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5+x^6+\dots$$ This expression converges for $|x|<1$. This idea may seem pointless, since the coefficients in the radical expansion are very hard to calculate even for functions with 'simple' Taylor series. But is it possible, that some function with 'complicated' Taylor series will have simple nested radical expansion of this kind? For example, consider the easiest nested radical of this kind: $$f(x)=\sqrt{1+x+x^2\sqrt{1+x+x^2\sqrt{1+x+x^2\sqrt{1+\dots}}}}=$$ $$=1+\frac{x}{2}+\frac{3x^2}{8}+\frac{x^3}{16}+\frac{11x^4}{128}-\frac{9x^5}{256}+\frac{27x^6}{1024}+\dots+$$ Though this kind of functions we can always find in closed form, if we assume the infinite nested radical converges. $$f(x)=\sqrt{1+a_1x+a_2x^2\sqrt{1+a_1x+a_2x^2\sqrt{1+a_1x+a_2x^2\sqrt{1+\dots}}}}=$$ $$=\frac{a_2}{2}x^2+\sqrt{1+a_1x+\frac{a_2^2}{4}x^4}$$ I've never seen this topic discussed anywhere, so a reference would be nice. The only thing I've seen is Ramanujan nested radical, and it's usually presented as a funny trick, nothing more.","['reference-request', 'nested-radicals', 'calculus', 'functions']"
