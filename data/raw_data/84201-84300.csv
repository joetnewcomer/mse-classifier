1103190,Each subset of the natural numbers is finite or countable.,"Proposition : Each subset of the natural numbers is finite or countable. Proof : Let $X \subset \omega$. First case: $X$ is bounded. That means that $(\exists k \in \omega)(\forall y \in X) y \leq k$. Then $X \subset k+1$ and $X$, as a subset of a finite subset, is  finite . Second case: $X$ is not bounded, i.e. $(\forall k \in \omega) (\exists y \in X) k<y$.
Then for all $k \in \omega$, $\min(X-(k+1))$ is defined. We define the recursively the function $f: \omega \to X$ 
$$ f(0)= \text{ the smallest element of }X=\min X\\f(n+1)=\text{the smallest element of X that is greater than } f(n)=\min \{ X-(f(n)+1)\}$$ From the definition of $f$ we have that $f(n+1)>f(n)$
, i.e. $f$ is strictly increasing and so $1-1$.
It suffices to show that $f$ is injective. Could you explain me how we conclude that for all $k \in \omega$, $\min (X-(k+1))$ is defined? Also at the definition of $f(n+1)$ why do we add $1$ to $f(n)$ ?",['elementary-set-theory']

1103406,Math Contest Question with Polynomials,"Prove that there does not exist a polynomial f(x) with integer coeﬃcients for which f(2008) = 0 and f(2010) = 1867. This is a question from CMOQR (Qualifier for Canadian Math Olympiad , not the national Olympiad itself). This contest is from 2009 but they do not have solutions posted to it. I had an idea to solve this problem but wasn't sure if it was logically correct. I said to start with f(x) in the form: $f(x) = (a_0 + a_1x^1 + a_2x^2 + ... + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_nx^n)$ then convert it to $f(x) = a(x-2008)(b_0 + b_1x^1 + b_2x^2 + ... + b_{n-1}x^{n-1})$ since x = 2008 was a root of f(x). If I plug in x = 2010 into f(x), f(2010) would contain the linear term (x - 2008) = (2010 - 2008) = 2, which would in the product form of f(x) would lead to f(x) being even. Thus, f(2010) $\not=$ 1867 since 1867 is odd, not even. Can anyone confirm if this is right? Thank you very much.","['contest-math', 'functions', 'polynomials']"

1103452,Fourier Transform of $\ln(f(t))$,"I want to compute Fourier transform of $\ln(f(t))$ maybe in a sense of distributions?
Where we can assume that: $f(t) > 0$ $f(t) \in L^1$ $f(t)$ is continuous $\lim_{t \to \infty} f(t)=0$ and  $\lim_{t \to -\infty} f(t)=0$ Denote Fourier transform of $f(t)$ by $\mathcal{F}(f(t))=F(\omega)$ I am also fine with some other restrictions. For example: $f(t)$ is analytical (i.e. all derivatives exist)
My main question are: 1) is the above set of condition enough to guarantee existence of Fourier transform? If not, what are the requirements? 2)  what is the Fourier transform? Edit Based on the suggestion of Mattos \begin{align*}
&\int_{-\infty}^\infty  \ln(f(t)) e^{-i \omega t} dt=  \ln(f(t))\frac{e^{-j\omega t}}{-j\omega} \Big|_{t=-\infty}^{t=\infty}-\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-j\omega t}}{-j\omega} \frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} dt\\
& =\ln(f(t))\frac{e^{-jwt}}{-jw} \Big|_{t=-\infty}^{t=\infty} +\frac{1}{j \omega}\mathcal{F} \left(\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} \right)
\end{align*} But, now how to compute $\ln(f(t))\frac{e^{-jwt}}{-jw} \Big|_{t=-\infty}^{t=\infty}$. Possible Solution to 2): I might have solution but not sure. It relays on using the following property. \begin{align*}
\mathcal{F} \left( \frac{d}{dt} g(t) \right)=(j\omega) \mathcal{F}(g(t))
\end{align*} Now take $g(t)=\ln(f(t))$ so we have
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F} \left( \frac{d}{dt} \ln(f(t)) \right)=(j\omega) \mathcal{F}(\ln(f(t)))\\
\mathcal{F} \left(  \frac{f'(t)}{f(t)}\right)=(j\omega) \mathcal{F}(\ln(f(t)))\\
\frac{\mathcal{F} \left(  \frac{f'(t)}{f(t)}\right)}{(j\omega)}= \mathcal{F}(\ln(f(t)))
\end{align*} So, of course this solution requires that $f'(t)$ exists. 
Is this reasoning correct? Is there any technicality that I missed? Here is the example I tried Let $f(t)=e^{-t^2}$ then $\ln(f(t))=-t^2$, 
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F}(\ln(f(t)))=\mathcal{F}(-t^2)=2\pi\delta^{(2)}(\omega)
\end{align*} On the other hand,
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{j \omega} \mathcal{F} \left( \frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} \right)&=\frac{1}{j \omega} \mathcal{F} \left( \frac{-2te^{-t^2}}{e^{-t^2}} \right)=\frac{1}{j \omega} \mathcal{F} \left( -2t \right)=-2 \frac{1}{j \omega} (2 \pi j) \delta^{(1)}(\omega)\\
&=  -(4 \pi ) \frac{1}{ \omega}\delta^{(1)}(\omega)=(2 \pi ) \delta^{(2)}(\omega)
\end{align*} the last equality uses $\omega \delta^{(2)}(\omega)=-2\delta^{(1)}(\omega)$ So, this is an example when my approach works. Thank you for any help, I really appreciate it.","['fourier-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

I looked through the chapter section and the closest symbol I saw to this is the subset, which is DEFINITION 3. The set $A$ is a subset of $B$ if and only if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$ . We use the notation $A \subseteq B$ to indicate that $A$ is a subset of the set $B$ . We see that $A \subseteq B$ if and only if the quantification $$\forall x(x \in A \to x \in B)$$ is true. Note that to show that $A$ is not a subset of $B$ we need only find one element $x \in A$ with $x \not\in B$ . Such an $x$ is a counterexample to the claim that $x \in A$ implies $x \in B$ . Is it just a typo for subset? Thats what I originally thought. However via my use of an implication(trying to apply what I learn :) ), I came up with if the symbol is a typo, it will be used in a single place or the supposed actual symbol, the subset, will not be used in the surrounding proximity(page). If I assumed the hypothesis to be true, then my conclusion and my implication is false because the subset does appear in the near proximity(9g) and this symbol is used in multiple locations(all the ones I described). Therefore the hypothesis is false(reached a contradiction), and the symbol is not a typo. Is that correct logic?","['notation', 'discrete-mathematics', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Suppose $0\longrightarrow E\longrightarrow F\longrightarrow G\longrightarrow 0$ is a short exact sequence, then I am required to prove that $\mathrm{dh}(E)=\max\{0,\mathrm{dh}(G)-1\}$.
I am not getting this. I have tried the following. We use the Auslander Buchsbaum formula which says that if $A$ is a regular ring : $\mathrm{dh}(M) + \mathrm{depth}(M) = \dim(A)$. Since $F$ is locally free, each $F_x$ is free, therefore, $\mathrm{dh}(F_x)=0$, hence $\mathrm{depth}(F_x)=\dim(\mathcal{O}_x)$ for all $x$. Further, since $E_x\longrightarrow F_x$ is injective for all x, any $F_x$ regular element is also an $E_x$ regular element, and hence the $\mathrm{depth}(F_x)\leq\mathrm{depth}(E_x)$ . But  $\mathrm{depth}(F_x)=\dim(\mathcal{O}_x)$, implies that $\mathrm{depth}(E_x)=\mathrm{dim}(\mathcal{O}_x)$ for all $X$, which in turn implies that $\mathrm{dh}(E_x)=0$ for all $x$.

1103868,Does the Tangent Space Vary Continuously with The Points On a Manifold?,"I recently read about Grassmannian manifolds. The following question naturally comes to mind. Let  $GR_k(\mathbf R^n)$ is the grassmannian manifold of $k$ dimensional linear subspaces of $\mathbf R^n$.
  Let $M$ be a smooth $k$-manifold in $\mathbf R^n$.
  Define a function $f:M\to M\times GR_k(\mathbf R^n)$ as 
  $$f(\mathbf p)=(\mathbf p,T_{\mathbf p}M)$$
  for all $\mathbf p\in M$. Then is $f$ continuous? Is it also smooth? (All our tangent spaces pass through the origin. Usually the point at which we talk about the tangent space is also important. But since we are working in a Euclidean space, we can translate all of them to the origin). I have no idea how to go about proving or disproving the above. Does anybody know if the above is true? If not, then are there some extra conditions under which the above is true? Note: Think of a particle moving in $3$-space.
We can ask if the particle is moving ``continuously"" in space.
If $f:\mathbf R\to\mathbf R^3$ is a function such that at time $t$ the particle is at $f(t)$, then we say that the particle is moving continuously with time if the function $f$ is continuous. Similary, we ave an intuitive notion of an infinite rigid rod (basically a line) moving continuously in $2$ or $3$-space.
To make this notion precise we can use the concept of the real projective space.
Suppose at time $t$, the line be written as $L(t)$.
We say that the line is moving continuously with time if the function $f:\mathbf R\to \mathbf RP^3$ defined as $f(t)=L(t)$ is continuous. The Grassmann manifolds generalize this notions to ``planes moving continuously (or smoothly)"" in Euclidean spaces.","['manifolds', 'grassmannian', 'differential-geometry']"

First, prove that S is a subgroup of R. Pick an arbitrary element $x$ from S. Since S is closed under subtraction, $x - x = 0 \in S$ and $0 - x = -x \in S$. Therefore, for all $x, y \in S, -x, -y \in S$ and hence $x-(-y) = x+y$ also belongs to $S$. Hence S is a subgroup. Since R is a ring, distributive laws hold in R and hence also in S. Abelian property is also inherited from R. S is closed under multiplication. Hence, S is a subring. Is my proof OK?","['proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra']"

Both these examples were discovered and studied by Beauville (Varietes kahleriennes dont la premiere classe de Chern est nulle). Some years later, Mukai (Symplectic structure on the moduli space of sheaves on an abelian or K3 surface) discovered others Hyperkahler manifolds, namely the moduli space of (stable) sheaves on a K3 with fixed Mukai vector, which turned out to be deformation equivalents to the Hilbert scheme of points (and coincide with it for particular choices of the Mukai vector). In literature, all the authors (I have consulted) give these examples, but it seems strange to me that we have two (different) descriptions for the first deformation class and only one for the latter. There is a strange non-simmetry. So I wonder if there is a class of examples, such as the moduli space of sheaves on a K3, for the generalized Kummer varieties that are deformation equivalent to them. By the same article of Mukai, the moduli space of stable sheaves on an abelian surface has still a symplectic structure, so I thought that such an example can be found looking at the fibre of a morphism that generilezes the Hilbert-Chow one. At this point I am stuck. My questions are: 1) is this argument valid or I am losing my time? And in case, how to find such a morphism? 2) are there any other class of examples and where can I find it? (I mean, of course there are explicit examples of Hyperkahelr manifolds that are deformation equivalent to a generalized Kummer variety, but I'm looking for a set of examples of the same form.)

Then if I can maximize and minimize $f(x,y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y) = 1$, I should be done. By both methods (the method of Lagrange multipliers, and the method of evaluating $f(x,y)$ on the unit circle, finding critical points, etc.) I am having difficulties. For the Lagrange multiplier method, we know that we will maximize/minimize $f(x,y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y) = 1$ if the system $\nabla g = \lambda \nabla f$, $g(x,y) = 1$ is satisfied.

Where: $$1 \cdot 1 = 1$$ $$-1 \cdot -1 = -1$$ I understand that in order to do this, multiplication could no longer be commutative and we'd have to decide what the result of $1 \cdot -1$ should be. I think we could choose that resulting sign of a multiplication could be the sign of the second term, so: $$1 \cdot -1 = -1$$ $$-1 \cdot 1 = 1$$ or more generally, the sign of any multiplication is determined by the sign of the second term. But where they otherwise behave roughly as expected, i.e. $1 - 2 = -1$. Some other consequences I'm aware of: $$\sqrt{-1} = -1$$ $$\sqrt{1} = 1$$ $f(x) = x^2$ would behave in a way that can only be described piecewise in the normal reals as $x^2$ when $x \geq 0$, and $-(x^2)$ when $x < 0$.

For all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ the function $F_n(x) = \frac{n x}{n x+1}$ is continuous on $[0,\infty)$ and monotonically increasing. So on the measurable space $\bigl((0,\infty),\mathcal{B}\bigl((0,\infty)\bigr)\bigr)$ there are measures with $$\mu_n\bigl((a, b]\bigl) = F_n(b) - F_n(a)\, .$$ These are finite measures, because $F_n(x) < 1$.

I can't find a reference that answers this. UPDATE #1: Genus $g=1$ is not in the range of my question, but I was trying to use it for intuition nevertheless.  One of way of computing the moduli space of smooth elliptic curves gives me $\mathbb A^1_{\mathbb C}$ as the moduli space (i.e. using the $j$-invariant) and another way gives me $\mathbb{CP}^1\backslash\{0,1,\infty\}$ (by studying $2:1$ covers of $\mathbb{CP}^1$ branched over $4$ pairwise-distinct points).  Both are one-dimensional and noncompact, but which is the better candidate for the moduli space?  I know that the issue of moduli of elliptic curves is quite a subtle one, and the real answer lies in the world of stacks, but if your only two options were $\mathbb A^1_{\mathbb C}$ and $\mathbb{CP}^1\backslash\{0,1,\infty\}$, which would you choose?  (""Neither"" is not allowed!)  Does the $j$-invariant simply give deformations around some particular elliptic curve of one's choice, and hence makes the former space into the tangent space to the moduli space, while the latter space is the ""actual"" moduli space (in some sense)? UPDATE #2: It occurred to me that the $0$ and $1$ that are being omitted from the projective line in the second candidate space could be the two ""special"" isomorphism classes of elliptic curves (with automorphism groups $\mathbb Z_6$ and $\mathbb Z_4$, respectively).  If we were to restore these two points, this would correct the ""discrepancy"" between the two candidate moduli spaces. The isomorphism of affine varieties from $\mathbb A^1_{\mathbb C}$ to $\mathbb{CP}^1\backslash\{\infty\}$, i.e. from the space of $j$-invariants to double covers of $\mathbb{CP}^1$ branched over $4$ points, would be $a\mapsto1728^{-1}a$. For this to be correct, it would require that the $j=0$ and $j=1728$ curves are branched over $4$ non-distinct points (perhaps a double branch point for one and a triple for the other)...could any of this hold water?

1104782,Integral of Thomae's function,"Define the following function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ as follows: $f(x) = 0$ if $x$ is irrational $f(x) = 1/n$ if $x$ is rational and $x = \frac{m}{n}$ in lowest terms. Some googling comes up that this is known as ""Thomae's function."" I need to prove the integrability of this function AND find its integral over $[0,1]$. The integrability is shown by proving that the function is continuous at irrationals and discontinuous at rationals and then using the Lebesgue criterion for integrability. However, I'm having trouble finding the value of the integral. I'm not sure if it is zero or not, which is making it hard for me to come up with a proof method. While the similarly defined Dirichlet function has a integral of 1, the reason I suspect this function might be zero is that the value of many points are, in this case, negligible due to large denominators.","['integration', 'real-analysis']"
1104790,"""This property is local on"" : properties of morphisms of $S$-schemes","I am learning schemes theory at school and I have for now only lectures notes that I am taking during the course. The professor is quite often using following expressions, without having defined them : if $S$ is a scheme and if $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is a morphism of $S$-schemes he often says that some property P of $f$ is (1) local on $X$ (2) local on $Y$ (3) local on $X$ and $Y$ (4) local on $X, Y$ and $S$ and I have several question on this, and related to this. I went to the library to look at all Grothendieck's EGA's and found the same frequent use of the expression la question est locale sur in the same four cases - at least, maybe there are other than these four ? But I found in them no definition of the meaning of la question est locale sur , which means the question is local on in english. I guess that (1) means that $f$ has the property P if and only if for every open cover $(U_i)_{i\in I}$ of $X$, all restrictions $f_{|U_i} : U_i \rightarrow Y$ have the property P, and that (2) means that $f$ has the property P if and only if for every open cover $(V_i)_{i\in I}$ of $Y$, all corestrictions $f^{-1} (V_i) \rightarrow V_i$ have the property P. For (3) obviously it is equivalent to check (1) and (2), but I cannot state a more synthetic formulation. Does (3) means that $f$ has property P if and only if for every open cover $(U_i)_{i\in I}$ of $X$ and for every open cover $(V_j)_{j\in J}$ of $Y$ all morphisms $U_i \cap f^{-1} (V_j) \rightarrow V_j$ have the property P ? For (4) it is sufficient to define what means P is local on S . Does this means that $f$ has the property P if and only if for every open cover $(W_i)_{i\in I}$ of $S$, every morphism $p^{-1}(W_i) \cap f^{-1}(q^{-1} (W_i)) \rightarrow q^{-1} (W_i)$ has the property P ? Or is there something more clever than this. Combining this with (3) is equivalent to (4), but here again, is there a more synthetic formulation for this ? In (1), (2), (3), (4) I used ""local morphisms"" (restrictions in (1), corestrictions in (2) etc ). Is it possible to express these morphisms thanks to fiber products, and if so, how ? In (1), (2), (3), (4) I used the word every cover but sometimes in the course it suffice to have the fact for only one cover to have it for all. How does this work ? (I call Q this question.) Sometimes its not only open covers that are used, but open affine covers. For $i\in\{1,2,3,4\}$, is (i) equivalent to the assertion (i) with ""open"" replaced by ""open affine"", or even by ""affine"" ? Is answering to question Q easier with ""open"" replaced by ""open affine"", or only ""affine"" ? Of this note, what does the following sentence mean : the property P of the morphism of $A$-algebras $\varphi : B' \rightarrow B$ is local on $\textrm{Spec}(A)$ (resp. on $\textrm{Spec}(B')$, resp. on $\textrm{Spec}(B)$, resp. on ""combinations of the previous"") ? I have a last question : all the previous questions are local for the topology of the schemes involved, which is a topology in the ""classic"" sense. Is all of this translatable to Grothendieck topologies ? If so, how ? And then, intuitively, in the case of the Zariski site, is the same ? I know that this was a lot of question, but all are intimately related to this ""local on"" stuff, so I preferred to ask all of them in one shot.","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"
1104832,On a proof of Riesz-Fischer Theorem,"Questions : [See below for context.] $\rm\color{#c00}{a)}$ First, is the proof presented below $100$ % correct ? $\rm\color{#c00}{b)}$ How would one justify the LHS of $(2)$ ? Are my thoughts correct ? Thoughts : One way I see it is in three times : first we note that $(\cdot)^{1/p}$ is continuous, then we apply the Monotone Convergence Theorem (MON) and finally we note that $|\cdot|^p$ is continuous, so that all in all we can bring the limit all the way in (even if $\displaystyle\sum_{k\geq1} |f_k|$ is infinite in this case). Another way I see it is by noting that every norm is (Lipschitz) continuous, so that we can effectively bring the limit inside (even if it is infinite in this case). $\rm\color{#c00}{c)}$ Why must we take the absolute value of $f_k$ when investigating $\displaystyle\sum|f_k|$ ? Are my thoughts correct ? Thoughts : I think that MON would not apply for $\rm\color{#c00}{b)}$ and I think that if we did not take the absolute value, then we could not speak, a priori , of the limit, that is, $\displaystyle\sum_{k\geq1} f_k$, in $(2)$. Taking the absolute value gives a series with positive terms and such a series either converges or diverges to $\infty$. A series with negative terms could diverge by oscillating. $\rm\color{#c00}{d)}$ In $(4)$, defining $F$ by $0$ is purely arbitrary, right ? We could define $F$ to be anything on the null set, right ? Also, $\displaystyle\sum_{k\geq1} f_k$ does exist on the given set since absolute convergence implies convergence for series of numbers, right ? $\rm\color{#c00}{e)}$ The equality $(5)$ is true since
  $$
F-\sum_{k=1}^{n}f_k=\sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty}f_k
$$
  almost everywhere, right ? $\rm\color{#c00}{f)}$ Would it be fair to say that what was sufficient to prove was $\displaystyle\sum_{k\geq1}|f_k|<\infty$ a.e., [ added ] and that the reason the proof is not trivial is that $L^p(\mu)$ contains, by definition, finite-valued functions ? I mean, in measure theory we work with functions with range in the extended real line, $[-\infty,\infty]$, and if we allowed the functions in $L^p(\mu)$ to take infinite values, then in fact every series would be convergent (trivially) in $L^p(\mu)$. Is this correct ? Def. : Let $(X,\cal{A},\mu)$ be a measured space. Then for $1\leq p<\infty$ we define
$$
L^p(\mu):=\{f:X\to\mathbb{R}\text{ measurable and s.t. }\|f\|_p<\infty\},
$$
where $\|f\|_p:=\left(\int|f|^pd\mu\right)^{1/p}$. As usual we really take equivalence classes of functions differing only on a null set. Thm (Riesz-Fischer) : $(L^p(\mu),\|\cdot\|_p)$ is complete for $1\leq p<\infty$. Dem. : We know it suffices to show that every absolutely convergent series converges. Let $(f_k)_{k\geq1}\subset L^p(\mu)$ be a sequence such that
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\|f_k\|_p<\infty.\tag{0}
$$
Since, by Minkowski's inequality, one has
$$
\left\|\sum_{k=1}^n|f_k|\right\|_p\leq\sum_{k=1}^n\|f_k\|_p,\tag{1}
$$
letting $n\to\infty$ gives
$$
\left\|\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|f_k|\right\|_p\leq\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\|f_k\|_p<\infty,\tag{2}
$$
thus
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|f_k|<\infty\quad\text{a.e.}\tag{3}
$$
Now define
$$
F:=\begin{cases}\displaystyle\sum_{k\geq1}f_k&\text{on }\left\{\displaystyle\sum_{k\geq1}|f_k|<\infty\right\},\\0&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\tag{4}
$$
Then $F$ is in $L^p(\mu)$ since $|F|\leq\displaystyle\sum_{k\geq1}|f_k|$ and by $(2)$. Also, $F$ is such that
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f_k=F,
$$
because
\begin{align}
\left\|F-\sum_{k=1}^{n}f_k\right\|_p&=\left\|\sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty}f_k\right\|_p\tag{5}\\
&\leq\left\|\sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty}|f_k|\right\|_p\\
&\stackrel{(2)}{\leq}\sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty}\|f_k\|_p\xrightarrow[(n\to\infty)]{(0)}0.\quad\text{Q.E.D.}

Ok, earlier while I was on break from work (I have low level math, and want to be more fond of mathematics) I work retail, and 20% of taxes are taken out, and I am wanting to find out how much I made before 20% is taken out. So I did some scribbling, and this is without googling so please be gentle. but lets say I make 2000 dollars per paycheck, so to see how much money I get after taxes I do 2000 * .8 which gives me 1600. I can also do 2000 * .2 which gives me 400 and then do 2000 - 400 (imo I don't like this way since I have a extra unnecessary step) Anyways, I was pondering how to reverse that to have the answer be 2000, and what I did was 1600 * 1.20 (120%) which gave me 1920, and I thought that is odd so I did 1600 * 1.25 and answer was 2000 exact. My question is why did I have to add extra 5% (25%) to get my answer?

And the second book seems to be too colorful and fancy so that I suspect it's also for engineering majors. I major in pure maths.

  major? I am looking for an undergraduate low-level text with lots of exercises and  solutions. I want to practice the material as well as study proofs. Edit Why I am worried that these books might be no good to me: One thing is that since they seem to be written for engineers I am worried that there are no or only few proofs. The other thing that I'm worried about is that they don't cover the same scope of material like a book targeted at maths majors. Edit 2 After some more searching I found Edwards: Advanced Calculus of several variables It looks good topic-wise but its title suggests that it's advanced and I only know first year real analysis in one variable.

1104877,"Identity involving ""the distance to the nearest integer"" function","It's a problem of an exercise list: I want to prove that, if $||x||$ = the distance to the nearest integer to $x$, then: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}4^{-n}||2^nx||=||x||(1-2||x||)$$ is true for every $x \in \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$. What I've tried so far: We know that the set $D=\{\sum_{k=1}^T\frac{a_k}{2^k}$, where $a_i = 0, 1 \forall i \in \{1,2,\ldots,T\}; T \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is dense in $(0,1)$. So, it's enought to prove the identity for these numbers. Because then, we can use the Weierstrass M Test to guarantee that the identity is valid to any other number in $(0,1)$. Why these specific numbers? Because then, the infinity sum $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}4^{-n}||2^nx||$ will become finity and it will be easier to work with. So, considering numbers of the form above, we obtain that $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}4^{-n}||2^nx||=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}4^{-n}\left|\left|2^n\sum_{k=1}^T\frac{a_k}{2^k}\right|\right| = \sum_{k=1}^{T-1}4^{-n}\left|\left|2^n\sum_{k=1}^{T}\frac{a_k}{2^k}\right|\right|. $$ Firt of all, the way I constructed that specific numbers, we can't obtain 1, but that's OK, because in $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ is 0. Now, note that: $||x||=x$, if $0 \leq x \leq 1/2$ and $||x|| = 1- x$, if $1/2 < x <1$ (Remember we are working in $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$). So, if we define $S_n=2^n\sum_{k=1}^{T-1}\frac{a_k}{2^k}$, we get that $||S_n||=||2^n\sum_{k=1}^{T-1}\frac{a_k}{2^k}||=a_{n+1}-2a_{n+1}S_n+S_n$, because if $a_{n+1}=0$, $S_n \leq 1/2$ and if $a_{n+1}=1$, $S_n > 1/2$. So, $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}4^{-n}\left|\left|2^n\sum_{k=1}^T\frac{a_k}{2^k}\right|\right|=\sum_{n=1}^{T-1}4^{-n}(a_{n+1}-2a_{n+1}S_n + S_n)$$
$$= \sum_{n=1}^{T-1}\frac{a_{n+1}}{4^n}-\sum_{n=1}^{T-1}\frac{1}{4^n}(2a_{n+1}S_n - S_n)$$
$$=\sum_{n=1}^{T-1}\frac{a_{n+1}}{4^n} + \sum_{n=1}^{T-1}\frac{S_n}{4^n}(1-2a_{n+1})$$
$$=\sum_{n=1}^{T-1}\frac{a_{n+1}}{4^n}+\sum_{n=1}^{T-1}\sum_{i=1}^{T}\frac{a_i}{2^i}\left(\frac{1-2a_{n+1}}{2^n}\right)$$. On the other hand, we have that
$$||x||(1-2||x||)=\sum_{k=2}^{T}\frac{a_k}{2^k}-2\left(\sum_{k=2}^{T}\frac{a_k}{2^k}\right)^2$$. I'm having trouble finding a way to prove that the two expressions are, indeed, equal.
