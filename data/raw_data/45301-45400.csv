453187,"How prove this Mathematical Analysis by Zorich, from the chapter on continuous functions.","Let $P_n$ be a polynomial of degree $n$. For a function $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$, Let $\Delta(P_n) = \sup_{x\in[a,b]} |f(x)-P_n(x)|$. and $E_n(f) = \inf_{P_n} \Delta(P_n)$. A polynomial $P_n$ is the best approximation of degree $n$ of $f$ is $\Delta(P_n) = E_n(f)$.

453195,How to prove this version of Urysohn's Lemma using the usual version,"I'm trying to prove the Urysohn's lemma that is presented in Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis using the usual version of the Urysohn's Lemma (with normal space ...). Here is the Rudin's Version: ""Suppose $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space, $V$ is open in $X$, $K \subset V$ and compact. Then there is a function $f:X \rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $f(K)=1$, $ suppf \subset V$ , $suppf$ is compact and $f$ is continuous."" The first thing that i've done was to consider $Y$ the one point compactification of $X$ . $Y$ is compact and Hausdorff , so $Y$ is normal. $K$ and $Y-V$ are closed and disjoint sets in $Y$, then we can use the usual Urysohn's lemma and we have a function $F:Y \rightarrow [0,1]$ with $F(Y-V)=0$ and $F(K)=1$.
The problem is that don't know if $suppF \subset V$ . I'm probably missing something, because for me $suppF \subset \overline{V}$ and i can't see how to shrink it to $V$. Is there any hope for my demonstration? Sorry for my bad english.","['general-topology', 'measure-theory']"
453197,Derivative of the inverse of $y=(a+bx)e^{cx}$,"I need to solve for the 1st derivative of the inverse of $y=(a+bx)e^{cx}$ but my calculus is a bit rusty. I know that to get the inverse function, I would have to use the Lambert W method but I think that the 1st derivative is different.
Anyway, if I understand correctly, the 1st derivative of the inverse is just 1/y'(yinv).
In this case that would make my answer:
$$\frac 1{be^{cy}+ce^{cy}(a+by)}$$

453253,Non-Integrability of a Pfaffian - Geometric Interpretation?,"The question of Solving a Pfaffian ODE can be interpreted as the question of finding the family of surfaces $U = c$ perpendicular to a surface $f$ generated by the vector field $$F(x,y,z) = (P(x,y,z),Q(x,y,z),R(x,y,z))$$ At each point, the gradient of the family of surfaces $U = c$ will either be parallel or equal to $F$. Thus 
$$\vec{\nabla}u = (∂u/∂x,∂u/∂y,∂u/∂z) = λ(P(x,y,z),Q(x,y,z),R(x,y,z))$$ should hold at each point.
This is just kind of basic & general from the geometry of the situation, & motivates the idea of a potential. In standard terminology, if the field F is potential we have that 
$$\vec{\nabla}u = (∂u/∂x,∂u/∂y,∂u/∂z) = (P(x,y,z),Q(x,y,z),R(x,y,z))$$
If the field is not potential we may be able to find an integrating factor such that $$\vec{\nabla}u = (∂u/∂x,∂u/∂y,∂u/∂z) = μ(x,y,z)(P(x,y,z),Q(x,y,z),R(x,y,z))$$
In other words, the integrating factor is a function that, when evaluated at each point, 
merely acts as a scale factor so that $F$ living on a surface becomes equal to the gradient of 
the family of surfaces orthogonal to it.
In this case we can indeed claim that a family of surfaces lies orthogonal to our vector field,
& we can solve for it (using, by my last count, 8 different methods). One can show that an integrability condition $<F, \vec{\nabla} \times F> = 0$ must hold in order for a pfaffian to be integrable. In other words, it seems as though the integrability condition must hold in order for there to exist a family of surfaces orthogonal to the surface in which the vector field lives, however according to my book even in the case when the integrability condition fails one can find families of surfaces orthogonal to the vector field, by eliminating some variable & reducing the pfaffian to an ode (the orthogonal surfaces in this case are cylinders). What's going on here? How can the integrability condition fail yet there still exist families of surfaces (cylinders) orthogonal to the vector field when the whole point of the method is that they can only be found when the integrability condition holds?

453266,Determinant game - winning strategy [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Alice and Bob play the determinant game (6 answers) Closed 5 years ago . I came across this problem while looking at Putnam problems a while ago: Alan and Barbara play a game in which they take turns filling entries of an initially empty $2008 \times 2008$ array. Alan plays first. At each turn, a player chooses a real number and places it in a vacant entry. The game ends when all the entries are filled. Alan wins if the determinant of the resulting matrix is nonzero; Barbara wins if it is zero. Which player has a winning strategy? I figured out the answer to the question they asked, but it made me wonder about a different question, which might not have an easy answer. For the original question, Barbara has a winning strategy. She can force the first two columns of the matrix to be the same, by copying whatever Alan plays in one column into the other column. My question is: can Barbara still win if she goes first instead of Alan? She can't use the same strategy as before, because now Alan can force her to play in the first two columns by filling up the rest of the grid. It might seem likely that Alan would have a winning strategy if Barbara went first, since he gets to control the last entry of the matrix. On the other hand, from sketching out a few games on paper, I concluded that Barbara could win whether she went first or second on both a $2 \times 2$ or a $3 \times 3$ matrix, so maybe that pattern continues to hold for larger matrices. I also sketched out a few games with a $4 \times 4$ matrix, but I wasn't able to come to a conclusion for that one. Edit: Maybe the $2008 \times 2008$ array is too large of a problem. I would be equally happy knowing the answer to the $4 \times 4$ problem: is there a winning strategy if Barbara goes first in a $4 \times 4$ array? Edit 2: It looks like my question was asked before: Alice and Bob matrix problem.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'combinatorial-game-theory', 'determinant']"

The following general questions arise, and I am wondering if anyone already knows the answers or can link to a source that would have them: (1) If $x = a + b i$ is a root of an irreducible polynomial over the rationals of degree $n$, what is the maximum possible degree of the irreducible polynomials over the rationals for the real numbers $a$ and $b$? (2) If $\operatorname{Alg}_n$ is the field generated by all roots of polynomials over the rationals of degree $\leq n$, and $\operatorname{RAlg}_n$ is the field generated by all REAL roots of polynomials over the rationals of degree $\leq n$, for which $n$ does $\operatorname{Alg}_n=\operatorname{RAlg}_n[i]$? (3)  The inverse function of f(x)=x^5+x is uniquely defined for all real numbers; the inverse function of f(x)=x^5-x is uniquely defined for |x|>sqrt(sqrt(0.08192)) and has two or three real values otherwise.

453297,Leibniz integral rule confusion,"Consider a vector field $\mathbf B:\mathbb R\times \mathbb R^3\to\mathbb R^3$. Let there exists  some $\mathbf A:\mathbb R\times \mathbb R^3\to\mathbb R^3$ for which $\mathbf B = \nabla \times\mathbf A$ where the curl is taken over the ""$\mathbb R^3$"" argument. Now for each $t\in\mathbb R$, let a surface element $\Sigma_t$ with the topology of a disk be given.  Let $\gamma:\mathbb R\times[0,1]\to\mathbb R^3$ parameterize $\partial \Sigma_t$.  In particular, for each $t\in\mathbb R$, let $\gamma(t, \cdot)$ traverse $\partial\Sigma_t$ exactly once.  Then, using the convention that repeated indices are summed from $1$ to $3$ we have
\begin{align}
  \frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Sigma_t}\mathbf B\cdot d\mathbf a
&= \frac{d}{dt}\int_{\partial\Sigma_t} \mathbf A\cdot d\boldsymbol \ell \\
&= \frac{d}{dt}\int_0^1 A_i \frac{\partial\gamma^i}{\partial \lambda}d\lambda \\
&= \int_0^1 \frac{\partial A_i}{\partial t}\frac{\partial\gamma^i}{\partial \lambda} d\lambda +\int_0^1\left(\frac{\partial\gamma^j}{\partial t}\frac{\partial A_i}{\partial x^j}\frac{\partial\gamma^i}{\partial\lambda} +A_i\frac{\partial^2\gamma^i}{\partial t\partial\lambda}\right)d\lambda\\

\end{align}
On the other hand, for a divergence-free vector field $\mathbf B$ (which we have here since $\mathbf B$ is the curl of $\mathbf A$), the Leibniz integral rule gives
\begin{align}
  \frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Sigma_t}\mathbf B\cdot d\mathbf a
&= \int_{\Sigma_t} \frac{\partial\mathbf B}{\partial t}\cdot d\mathbf a - \int_{\partial\Sigma_t} \mathbf v\times \mathbf B\cdot d\boldsymbol \ell
\end{align} Question. Presumably, the formula I derived above should agree with this expression, but I can't see how it does. As far as I can tell, the second term on the right of the Leibniz integral formula can be written as follows.  Firstly, as far as I can tell the notation can be translated as
$$
  \mathbf v = \frac{\partial\gamma}{\partial t}, \qquad d\boldsymbol \ell = \frac{\partial\gamma}{\partial\lambda}d\lambda
$$
Secondly, we note the following identity
$$
  \mathbf v\times\mathbf B = (v^j\partial_i A_j - v^j\partial_jA_i)\mathbf e^i
$$
Putting these facts together gives
$$
  -\int_{\partial\Sigma_t} \mathbf v\times\mathbf B\cdot d\boldsymbol\ell
= \int_0^1\left(\frac{\partial\gamma^j}{\partial t}\frac{\partial A_i}{\partial x^j}\frac{\partial\gamma^i}{\partial\lambda} -\frac{\partial\gamma^j}{\partial t}\frac{\partial A_j}{\partial x^i}\frac{\partial\gamma^i}{\partial\lambda}\right)d\lambda

453331,What does it mean for a coalgebra to be cogenerated by a subspace?,"The usual definition of an algebra being generated by a subspace is as follows: Let $A$ be an algebra, $X \subset A$ a subspace, $\mathrm{Alg}(X)$ the free algebra generated by $X$. Then $A$ is generated by $X$ iff the morphism $\mathrm{Alg}(X) \to A$ induced by the inclusion $X \hookrightarrow A$ is a surjection. The interpretation here is clear: every element of $A$ can be written as a finite linear combination of ""words"" of elements of $X$. Now the dual statement is (see eg. Operads in algebra, topology and physics by Markl et al.): Let $C$ be a coalgebra, $Y$ a quotient of $C$, $\mathrm{Alg^c}(Y)$ the cofree coalgebra cogenerated by $Y$. Then $C$ is cogenerated by $Y$ if the morphism $C \to \mathrm{Alg^c}(Y)$, coinduced by $C \twoheadrightarrow Y$, is injective. I don't know how to interpret that. If we restrict ourselves to conilpotent coalgebras, we can take the cofree conilpotent coalgebra generated by $Y$ to be $T^c(Y)$ the usual tensor coalgebra; $T^c(Y) \to Y$ is the projection on the $Y$ factor, and we have an explicit description of the morphism $\tilde p : C \to T^c(Y)$, with the projection of the $Y^{\otimes n}$ factor is $\sum p(x_{(1)}) \otimes \dots \otimes p(x_{(n)})$. Somehow if $Y$ cogenerates $C$, then this is injective. Which would roughly mean that for any $x \in C$, if you iterate the coproduct enough time, the factors are nonzero through the projection on $Y$. What does that mean? Is there a way to interpret that?","['coalgebras', 'intuition', 'abstract-algebra']"

453352,Extending Herstein's Challenging Exercise to Modules,"Anybody who has worked through Herstein's Topics in Algebra might remember Exercise 26 of Section 2.5 (in second edition): If $G$ is an abelian group containing subgroups of order $m$ and $n$, then $G$ contains a subgroup whose order is the least common multiple of $m$ and $n$. Robert Beals has given a very nice solution in [1]. My question is whether or not we can extend the result of this exercise to modules (and if we can, to which extent). More concretely, Suppose $R$ is a commutative ring. If $M$ is an $R$-module that contains submodules of cardinality $m$ and
  $n$, then must $M$ necessarily contain a submodule whose cardinality is the least
  common multiple of $m$ and $n$? Since abelian groups can be viewed as $\mathbb{Z}$-modules, this generalizes the above situation. Now, I am guessing this fails for arbitrary rings. I would be especially interested to know the conclusion if $R$ is Noetherian. (I think if $R$ is a PID, the conclusion follows, but I have no proof for this. Beals' proof uses purely group-theoretic concepts some of which I cannot generalize to modules). Thanks for your time :) [1] Beals, Robert.

453365,Averages of a Function,"Let $(X,M,\mu)$ a measure space and $f:X \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ a function in $L^{\infty}(\mu)$. Define $A_f$ as the set of all averages \begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\mu(E)} \int_{E} f d \mu
\end{equation} where $E \in M$ with $ 0 < \mu(E) < \infty$. An exercise in Rudin, Real and Complex Analysis, asks whether there exists a
measure space such that the set $A_f$ is convex for all $f \in L^{\infty}(\mu)$. Obviously, a space $X$ containing only one point gives an affirmative answer.
But does there exists a non trivial example? That is, a measure space $X$ in which
$A_f$ contains more than one point for some $f$? Even in the special case in which $X=\mathbb{R}$ and $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure,
I don't know whether $A_f$ is convex for all $f \in L^{\infty}(\mu)$ or not.
Do you have some idea? Thank you very very much for your help. My Best Regards, Maurizio Barbato PS If we define the essential range of $f \in L^{\infty}(\mu)$ as the set of all complex numbers $w$
such that \begin{equation}
\mu({x: |f(x) - w| < \epsilon}) > 0
\end{equation} for all $\epsilon > 0$, then it is easy to prove that $R_f$ is compact. Moreover,
the closure of $A_f$ is contained in the convex hull of $R_f$, and in the special
case in which $X=\mathbb{R}$ and $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure, we have 
$cl(A_f)=conv(R_f)$. This was proved by prof. David Ullrich.

$$\sin2\alpha\cos\alpha=2\sin\alpha\cos^2\alpha$$
and $\cos2\alpha\sin\alpha$ can be expressed in three ways: 
$$(\cos^2\alpha-\sin^2\alpha)\sin\alpha =\sin\alpha\cos^2\alpha-\sin^3\alpha$$
$$(2\cos^2\alpha -1)\sin\alpha = 2\cos^2\alpha\sin\alpha - \sin\alpha$$
$$(1-2\sin^2\alpha)\sin\alpha = \sin\alpha - 2\sin^3\alpha$$

$$\sin4\alpha=2\sin(2\alpha)\cdot\cos(2\alpha)$$
$$\sin4\alpha=2\cdot2\sin\alpha\cos\alpha(\cos^2\alpha-\sin^2\alpha)$$
$$\sin4\alpha=4\sin\alpha\cos\alpha(\cos^2\alpha-\sin^2\alpha)$$

$$
T^b_a(F) = \int^b_a |f(t)|dt.
$$ Now, here is what I have so far. Show $F$ is of BV is simple:
let $a=x_0 < x_1 < \dots < x_k=b$ be any partition/subdivision of $[a,b]$. Then 
$$
\sum^k_{i=1} |F(x_i)-F(x_{i-1})| = \sum^k_{i=1} \left|\int^{x_i}_{x_{i-1}} f(t) dt\right| \leq \sum^k_{i=1} \int^{x_i}_{x_{i-1}} |f(t)| dt = \int^b_a |f(t)| dt.

Thus $T^b_a(F) \leq \int^b_a|f(t)| dt < \infty$. Therefore $F$ is of bounded variation. On the other hand, I also know that $F$ is an indefinite integral iff $F$ is absolutely continuous. This would have also implied $F$ is BV since AC $\Rightarrow$ BV. I also know that if $F$ is BV, then $F'$ exists a.e.(almost everywhere). I also have an old homework question I did which showed $F'=f$ a.e. with the assumptions from the start. Thus all I need is that $\int|F'| \leq T^b_a(F)$. I think this works: for every $x \in [a,b]$, we know that $F(x) = P^x_a(F) - N^x_a(F) + F(a)$; P and N are the positive and negative variations respectively. Then $\dfrac{d}{dx} [F(x)] = \dfrac{d}{dx}[P^x_a(F)] - \dfrac{d}{dx}[N^x_a(F)]$ a.e. Thus $|F'| \leq \dfrac{d}{dx}[P^x_a(F)] + \dfrac{d}{dx}[N^x_a(F)] = \dfrac{d}{dx}[T^x_a(F)]$ a.e. Finally 
$$
\int^b_a |F'| \leq \int^b_a \dfrac{d}{dx} T^x_a(F) \leq T^b_a(F).

Let $S^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ be the unit sphere, and let $N = (0,0,1)$. I want to show that the map $f : S^2 \setminus \{N\} \to \mathbb{R}^2$ given by: $$f(x,y,z)=\left(\frac{2x}{1-z},\frac{2y}{1-z}\right)$$ is a bijection. Well, I've tried going direct from the definition. First injectivity: I have to show that $f(x_1,y_1,z_1)=f(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ implies $x_1=x_2$, $y_1=y_2$ and $z_1=z_2$.

To show that $f$ is surjective, I have to show that given $(a,b) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ there's some $(x,y,z)\in S^2\setminus \{N\}$ such that $(a,b)=f(x,y,z)$, in other words, such that: I've tried proving surjectivity looking at the expression of $f$ and thinking ""what $(x,y,z)$ I must put in there in terms of $(a,b)$ to get $f(x,y,z)=(a,b)$""? I've found then that $(a/2,b/2,0)$ does the job, but this point is not necessarily in $S^2\setminus\{N\}$. I should find $(x,y,z)$ such that $f(x,y,z)=(a,b)$ and $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$.

453821,Decomposition of finitely-generated abelian group,"To formulate the question I need to remind two theorems in algebra: Any finitely generated abelian group $G$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups: $$
G\simeq\mathbb Z_{u_{1}} \oplus \dots \oplus \mathbb Z_{u_{m}}\oplus \mathbb Z\oplus \dots \oplus \mathbb Z\qquad (1)
$$ where $u_{i}|u_{i+1}$ . Every finite term of this decomposition can be also decomposed to a direct sum of primary cyclic groups. So we can say that every finitely generated abelian group $G$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of primary cyclic groups and infinite cyclic groups. All the Sylow subgroups of a finite group are normal if and only if the group is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups. So, if $|G|=p_{1}^{n_{1}}\cdots p_{k}^{n_{k}}$ and all Sylow $p_{i}$ -subgroups $P_{1}$ , ..., $P_{k}$ are normal, then $$G\simeq P_{1}\times\cdots \times P_{k}\qquad (2)$$ So here is the question: Let the group $G$ satisfy the conditions of both theorems at the same time.

$$\begin{eqnarray} 
L_{\frac{p+1}4}\equiv \begin{cases}

 \\ -(-2)^\frac{p+1}4\pmod p  & y\not \equiv\pm\frac{p-1}2\pmod 8.
\end{cases} \end{eqnarray}$$ Example:If $p=23$, then $2p=1^2+5\cdot3^2$, hence $y=\pm3\equiv \pm \frac{p-1}2\pmod 8,L_{\frac{p+1}4}=L_6=18\equiv(-2)^{\frac{p+1}4}=2^6\pmod p.$ This is true for $p<4000$. Add: A proof to $p\equiv3,7\pmod {20}\implies\exists x,y\in \mathbb Z:2p=x^2+5y^2.$ $p\equiv3,7\pmod {20}\implies \left(\dfrac{-5}p\right)=1\implies\exists t\in \mathbb Z:t^2\equiv-5\pmod p.$ Lemma1: If $p$ is a prime, $t\in \mathbb Z$, then $\exists x,y\in \mathbb Z: 0 <y<\sqrt p,-\sqrt p<x<\sqrt p,yt\equiv x\pmod p.$
You can prove this by Pigeonhole principle . Hence $x^2\equiv -5y^2\pmod p\implies x^2+5y^2=np.(0<n<6.)$ Lemma2: $x^2+5y^2\equiv 0,1,4\pmod 5.$ If $n=2$ then we are done.

If $n=5$ then $x^2+5y^2=5p,5\mid x,$ let $x=5x_1$ then $y^2+5x_1^2=p,$ a contradiction. If $n=3$ then $x^2+5y^2=3p\implies 3\mid (x+y)(x-y),$ if $3\mid x-y,$ let $y_1=-y$ then $3\mid x+y_1$ and $x^2+5y_1^2=3p,$ hence WLOG we can assume $3\mid x+y,$ hence $3\mid x-5y,$ then $$(\dfrac{x-5y}{3})^2+5(\dfrac{x+y}{3})^2=2p,$$ we are done.","['fibonacci-numbers', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

454078,Non-zero Conditional Differential Entropy between a random variable and a function of it,"Let two continuous random variables, where the one is a function of the other: $X\,  $ and $\,  Y=g\left(X\right)$. Their mutual information is defined as
$$I\left(X,Y\right)\,=\,h\left(X\right)\,-\,h\left(X|Y\right)=\,h\left(Y\right)\,-\,h\left(Y|X\right)$$
where lowercase h denotes differential entropy, the entropy concept for continuous rv's. It is a proven fact that the mutual information between two variables , for discrete as well as for continuous rv's, is non-negative, and becomes zero only when the two rv's are independent (clearly not our case).
Using the fact that Y is a function of X we have
$$I\left(X,g\left(X\right)\right)\,=\,h\left(g\left(X\right)\right)\,-\,h\left(g\left(X\right)|X\right) \gt\,0\,\Rightarrow \,h\left(g\left(X\right)\right)\,\gt \,h\left(g\left(X\right)|X\right)$$
Now, differential entropy (unlike entropy for discrete rv's) can take negative values.
Assume that it so happens that $h\left(g\left(X\right)\right)\lt\,0$. Then from the positivity of mutual information we obtain
$$0\,\gt \,h\left(g\left(X\right)\right)\,\gt \,h\left(g\left(X\right)|X\right) \Rightarrow\; h\left(g\left(X\right)|X\right)\neq\,0$$ And this is the counter-intuitive puzzle : for any discrete random variable Z we always have $h\left(g\left(Z\right)|Z\right)\,=\,0$. This is intuitive: if Z is known, then any function of Z is completely determined -no entropy, no uncertainty remains, and so the conditional entropy measure is zero. But we just saw that, when dealing with continuous rv's where the one is a function of the other, their conditional differential entropy may be non-zero (it doesn't matter whether it is positive or negative), which is not intuitive at all. Because, even in this strange world of continuous rv's, knowing X , completely determines Y=g(X) . I have searched high and low to find any discussion, comment or exposition of the matter, but I found nothing. Cover & Thomas book does not mention it, other books do not mention it, a myriad of scientific papers or web sites do not mention it. My motives: a) Scientific curiosity. b) I want to use the concept of mutual information for continuous rv's in an econometrics paper I am writing, and I feel very uncomfortable to just mention the ""non-zero conditional differential entropy"" case without being able to discuss it a bit.

454099,"Find the volume of $K=\{(x,y,z):|x-z^2|+|y-z^2|+z^2\le1\}$","How can I find the volume of $K=\{(x,y,z):|x-z^2|+|y-z^2|+z^2\le1\}$? First, $z^2\le1$ since $|x-z^2|+|y-z^2|\ge0$ This would give me $$\int \limits_{-1}^1 \left(\iint\limits_K \,dx\,dy\right)\,dz$$ where $K=\{(x,y):|x-z^2|+|y-z^2|\le1-z^2\}$ Now I don't recognize this form of $K$, though $i$ does look look like a square if you let the absolute values represent intervals with respect to the $x$- and $y$ axis. How can I calculate the double integral? Thanks! Alexander","['multivariable-calculus', 'volume', 'integration']"
454100,Theorem 1 chapter 8 of Fulton's Young Tableaux,"I am reading Theorem 1 on page 110 of Fulton's Young Tableaux and have several questions on it. Let $E$ be a free module on $e_1,\ldots,e_m$ (for our purposes $E$ being a finite dimensional complex vector space will do) and consider the module $E^\lambda$ as constructed earlier in the chapter. If $e_T$ is the vector as defined in the paragraph before Lemma 1 of page 107, the Theorem states: Theorem 1 (pg 110): The module $E^\lambda$ is free on $e_T$ as $T$ varies over the tableaux on $\lambda$ with entries in $\{1,\ldots,m\}$. Now Fulton begins by arguing that all such $e_T$ have to generate $E^\lambda$ as follows. He uses the presentation $E^\lambda = F/Q$ of Lemma 1 and orders the tableau as follows: $T' > T$ if in the right most column where they differ, the entry in $T'$ is larger than $T$. Now to show that the $e_{T'}$ with $T'$ a tableau generate $E^\lambda$, we need to show that if $T$ is not a tableau then we can write $e_T$ as a linear combination of $e_S$ where $e_S$ are tableau. Using the relations of Lemma 1, we can assume that the columns of $T$ are strictly increasing. Now suppose the $k$ -th entry of the $j$ -th column of $T$ is strictly larger than the $k$ - th entry of the $j+1$ - th column. What I don't understand: He says in this case we can write $e_T = \sum e_S$ the sum over all $S$ obtained from $T$ by exchanging the top $k$ entries of the $j+1$ - th column of $T$ with $k$ entries of the $j$ -th column. How is this possible? If I consider the specific case of 
    $\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}  \hline 1 &2 & 3  \\ \hline 5 & 4 & 6 \\\hline \end{array}$
    then by selecting the two middle boxes, he is saying that 
    $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}  \hline 1 &2 & 3  \\ \hline 5 & 4 & 6 \\\hline \end{array} = \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}  \hline 2 &1 & 3  \\ \hline 4 & 5 & 6 \\\hline \end{array} ?$$
    How does this make sense? Also I tried to use the available relation to write by filling of $(3,3)$ in terms of a sum of tableaux, but nothing has worked out. What am I not understanding here?","['young-tableaux', 'representation-theory', 'combinatorics']"
454102,Divergence transforms as scalar under rotation in 2D + intuition,"Problem is as follows: In two dimensions, show that the divergence transforms as a scalar under rotations. Aim is to determine $\bar{v}_{y}$ and $\bar{v}_{z}$, and show that $\frac{\partial\bar{v}_{y}}{\partial\bar{y}}$ + $\frac{\partial\bar{v}_{z}}{\partial\bar{z}} = \frac{\partial v_{y}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v_{y}}{\partial z}$ I'm not sure at all why the above shows that divergence transforms as a scalar under rotations. It was a part of the question (given as a hint) so I was just trying to solve it without really understanding what I was doing. Any help on clarifying why I do need to show that would be appreciated. Since this is a rotation in two dimensions (in the $y$ and $z$ axis), $
\left( {\begin{array}{cc}
\bar{v}_{y}  \\
\bar{v}_{z}
\end{array} } \right)
$ =  $
\left( {\begin{array}{cc}
\cos\phi & \sin\phi  \\
-\sin\phi & \cos\phi
\end{array} } \right)
$ $
\left( {\begin{array}{cc}
{v}_{y}  \\
v_{z}
\end{array} } \right)
$. Expanding this out, I found that $\bar{v}_{y} = v_{y}.\cos\phi + v_{z}.\sin\phi$ and $\bar{v}_{z} = -v_{y}.\sin\phi + v_{z}.\cos\phi$. Solving for $v_{y}$ and $v_{z}$, by multiplying $\bar{v}_{y}$ and $\bar{v}_{z}$ by $\sin\phi$ and $\cos\phi$, I was able to use the $\sin^{2}\phi + \cos^{2}\phi = 1$ identity to get $v_{z} = \bar{v}_{y}.\sin\phi + \bar{v}_{z}.\cos\phi$ and $v_{y} = \bar{v}_{y}.\cos\phi - \bar{v}_{z}.\sin\phi$. Next, I found the components of the original equation: The first partial derivative in the equation was determined as $\frac{\partial \bar{v}_{y}}{\partial \bar{y}} = (\frac{\partial \bar{v}_{y}}{\partial y})(\frac{\partial y}{\partial \bar{y}}) + (\frac{\partial \bar{v}_{y}}{\partial z})(\frac{\partial z}{\partial \bar{y}})$ and the second as $\frac{\partial \bar{v}_{z}}{\partial \bar{z}} = (\frac{\partial \bar{v}_{z}}{\partial y})(\frac{\partial y}{\partial \bar{z}}) + (\frac{\partial \bar{v}_{z}}{\partial z})(\frac{\partial z}{\partial \bar{z}})$. At this point, I become stuck because I cannot seem to be able to find $\partial \bar{v}_{y}$ and $\partial \bar{v}_{z}$ with respect to $\partial y$ and $\partial z$. How to I continue? Thanks in advance.","['multivariable-calculus', 'vector-analysis']"
454113,Are these two equivalence relations the same ? (Equivalence relation defined using subgroups of a group),"I was solving the book Abstract Algebra by Charles Pinter. In one of the questions I was stuck. The question is as follows :- $H$ is a subgroup of group $G$.Two equivalence relations on $G$ are defined as follows :- 1) $a \sim b$ iff $ab^{-1}\in H$ 2) $a \sim b$ iff $a^{-1}b\in H$ Are the two equivalence relations the same. If so prove , if not find a counterexample. I tried to first prove that it is not the case and tried a few counter examples but they didn't work. I tried $H = \{e\}$ or $H = \{G\}$ which are the trivial subgroups. I also tried to use some common examples of sub groups such as the set of even integers under addition which is a subgroup of set of integers. The set of positive rationals under multiplication which is a subgroup of positive reals. It didn't work.
And I also tried to prove they are the same. But couldn't do so. My approach was to somehow derive $a^{-1}b\in H$ from $ab^{-1}\in H$ . I also tried to use a third element $c$ and use the transitivity law but that also didn't work. Can you point out a direction in which I can proceed to try to solve it? Thanks.","['equivalence-relations', 'group-theory']"
454115,Construct a finite field of 16 elements and find a generator for its multiplicative group.,"Construct a finite field of 16 elements and find a generator for its multiplicative group. Find all generators of multiplicative group. Very obvious Construction of a field with 16 elements according to me would be ${\mathbb{F_2}[x]}/{f(x)}$ where $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of order 4 in $\mathbb{F_2}[x]$. I took $f(x)=x^4+x+1$.Elements of the resulting field are
$\{0,1,x,x^2,x^3,1+x,1+x^2,1+x^3,x+x^2,x+x^3,x^2+x^3,x+x^2+x^3,1+x+x^2,1+x+x^3,1+x+x^3,1+x^2+x^3,1+x+x^2+x^3\}$. Now, Question is to find a generator of its multiplicative group. I have calculated by hand that $<x>$ is the whole multiplicative group. That was very obvious by intuition that $x$ generates. Now the question is what other elements generate that group.
I have tried for $x^2$, though i did not calculate whole group,with in few steps i found $x\in<x^2>$ so i concluded $x^2$ generates multiplicative group. In case of $1+x$ , with in 4/5 steps i got multiplicative identity 1. So $1+x$ does not generate this group. It would become a mess if i write by hand what subgroup would each element generate? Is there any better way to find out what all elements generate the multiplicative group?","['galois-theory', 'finite-fields', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"
454118,When is a group ring an integral domain,"If $R$ is an integral domain (I am having $\mathbb{Z}$ or a field in mind) and $G$ a (not necessarily finite) group then 
we can form the group ring $R(G)$. Note that if $g^{n+1} = e$ then $(e-g)(e+g\ldots + g^n) = e - g^{n+1} = 0$. This means
if $G$ has torsion then $R(G)$ always has zero-divisors. What about the inverse? So if $G$ is torsion-free does that imply $R(G)$ having no zero-divisors.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-rings']"

Then it claims that $\int \chi_E d\mu = \mu(E)$ is a special case, but I'm having trouble to see why $\int_E h d|\mu|$ is equal to $\mu(E)$.
