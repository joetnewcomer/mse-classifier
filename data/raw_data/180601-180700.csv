3288015,Does this identity with binomial coefficients have a combinatorial interpretation? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Intuitive proof of $\sum_{k=1}^{n} \binom{n}{k} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k} = n^n$ (5 answers) Closed 4 years ago . I found the identity for $n\ge 1$ : $$
(n-1)n^{n-1} = \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \binom{n}{j} j^j (n-j)^{n-j-1}
$$ or equivalently, if we say $0^0 = 1$ , we have $$
n^n = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n}{j} j^j (n-j)^{n-j-1}
$$ This identity is easy to show using generating functions (as I couldn't find this identity anywhere online, I include this proof below). However, it looks suspiciously like something that would have a combinatorial interpretation, since $n^n$ is the number of functions from a set of $n$ elements to itself, and the binomial coefficients could be taken to represent numbers of subsets of the same set. My question is, does this identity have a combinatorial proof or some meaningful combinatorial interpretation at least? Proof using generating functions: The power series for the principal branch $W(x)$ , the Lambert W function, is $$
W(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac1{n!} (-n)^{n-1} x^n
$$ and $W'(x) = \frac{W(x)}{x(1+W(x))}$ . Thus we have: \begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac1{n!} n^{n-1} x^n &=& -W(-x) \\
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac1{n!} n^n x^n &=& x{\frac{d}{dx}}(-W(-x)) = \frac{-W(-x)}{1+W(-x)}\\
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac1{n!} n^n x^n &=& 1 + \frac{-W(-x)}{1+W(-x)} = \frac{1}{1+W(-x)}
\end{eqnarray} We therefore have the product $$
-W(-x) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1+W(-x)}\right) = \frac{-W(-x)}{1+W(-x)}
$$ which in series form looks like $$
\left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac1{n!} n^{n-1} x^n\right)\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac1{n!} n^n x^n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}\left(\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n}{j} j^j (n-j)^{n-j-1}\right) x^n = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac1{n!} n^n x^n

3288074,A conjecture about primorials,"A primorial, denoted $p_n\#$ , is the product of the first $n$ prime numbers ( $p_1=2,\ p_2=3$ etc.). The magnitude of primorials grows rapidly beyond the range of convenient arithmetic manipulation.  The number $(p_n\#+1)$ is not divisible by any of the first $n$ primes, and so is frequently a prime number itself. For $n=1,2,3,4,5,11$ , $(p_n\#+1) \in \mathbb P$ . I noticed (for primorials accessible to calculation) that when $(p_n\#+1) \not \in \mathbb P$ , that a 'near primorial' number plus $1$ could be identified that was a prime. By near primorial number, I mean the product of all but one of the first $n$ primes, or $\frac{p_n\#}{p_i};\ 1<i<n$ . For example, $\frac{p_8\#}{3}+1,\ \frac{p_{10}\#}{3}+1,\ \frac{p_6\#}{5}+1,\ \frac{p_7\#}{5}+1,\ \frac{p_{12}\#}{7}+1,\ \frac{p_{13}\#}{11}+1,\ \frac{p_{9}\#}{13}+1$ are all primes. Examples of this kind can be rewritten in the form $p_n\#=p_i(p_k-1);\ 1<i<n,\ k>n$ . Based on this admittedly extremely small set, I conjecture that it might be the case $$p_n\#=C(p_k-1);\ C\in \{1,p_i\},\ 1<i<n,\ k>n$$ The signal feature of $C$ is that it is not composite. A single counterexample arrived at by computation would disprove the conjecture, but for $p_{14}\#$ and greater, the numbers are beyond my ability to conveniently calculate. My questions are : Has this conjecture been previously considered and settled? If not, is there an analytic approach to prove or disprove the conjecture?","['number-theory', 'primorial', 'prime-numbers']"

However I'm given this simple exercise: Find the flux of $\xi=3x\mathbf i+2y\mathbf j\in\mathfrak X(\Bbb R^3)$ through the surface of $S=\{(x \ y\ z)^t:x^2+y^2+z^2=9\}$ , oriented with a normal unitary vector field pointing outward $S$ . Now, if I apply the divergence theorem, since div $(\xi)=5$ , I have $\iiint_V5dV=5\cdot\frac 4 3\pi\cdot 9=$ $=\frac {20} 3\pi$ . However if I try to find the flux with Stokes, I obtain a different result: since $\mathbf n=\frac1 3(x\mathbf i+y\mathbf j+z\mathbf k)$ , $\mathbf F\cdot\mathbf n=x^2+\frac 2 3 y^2$ , and so $\iint_S(\mathbf F\cdot\mathbf n)dS =\int_S(x^2+\frac 2 3 y^2)(\frac 1 3xdy\wedge dz-\frac 1 3ydx\wedge dz+\frac 1 3zdx\wedge dy)$ .

3288156,Prove $\oint_\Gamma\vec\nabla f\cdot d\vec{r}=0$ when $\Gamma$ is the unit circle,"I have encountered a statement in my book which didn't seem quite right to me. It was written exactly like this: Let $f(x,y):\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function such that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ are continuous functions for all $(x,y)\neq(0,0)$ , and let $\Gamma$ be the unit circle, centered at $(0,0)$ . Then: $$\oint_\Gamma\vec\nabla f\cdot d\vec{r}=0$$ I tried to sit down and think why is this statement true. You all must have encountered before the infamous vector field: $$\vec{F}=\left(-\frac{y}{x^2+y^2},\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\right)$$ This vector field is the gradient of the function $f(x,y)=\arctan(\frac yx)$ if I remember correctly. This function is of course problematic on the $y$ axis. However, I assume you can define $f$ on the $y$ axis, apart from the point $(0,0)$ , such that the partial derivatives of $f$ would exist and also be continuous there (I'm not sure about that, but the fact that the parital derivatives are clearly continuous for every point but $(0,0)$ has led me to that assumption). So $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ are indeed continuous for all $(x,y)\neq(0,0)$ , but $\displaystyle \oint_\Gamma\vec\nabla f\cdot d\vec{r} $ would be equal to $\pm2 \pi$ (depends on the orientation of $\Gamma$ ). To conclude, I would like to know whether my example disproves the above statement, or maybe it is wrong. If it's not correct, I would be glad to hear why, and in addition, have a proof of the statement. I thought of many ways to prove it - using Green's Theorem and the fact that $\vec\nabla\times\vec\nabla f\equiv0$ , stating $\vec\nabla f$ is a conservative vector field (since it is derived from a gradient of a scalar potential function) and more; But of course I wouldn't go there before I know why my example is incorrect.

3288213,"If three nonzero real matrices mutually anticommute, then at least one of them has a negative off-diagonal element","The following is a statement which I believe to be correct but unable to prove (I have been trying to find a counterexample for a long time but never succeeded in doing so): Let $X_1,X_2,X_3$ be $n\times n$ nonzero real matrices satisfying $X_{i}X_j=-X_jX_i\neq 0$ for $1\leq i<j\leq 3$ [as an example, $\{X_1,X_2,X_3\}=\{\sigma^x,i\sigma^y,\sigma^z\}$ , the Pauli-matrices] . Prove that at least one of $X_1,X_2,X_3$ has a negative off-diagonal element. The case $n=2$ is easy and straightforward: just expand $X_1,X_2,X_3$ in the basis of Pauli matrices and solve the equation $\{X_i,X_j\}=0$ . But when $n$ becomes large, the coupled quadratic equations quickly becomes formidable, which I have no way to handle. Notice also that the $\neq 0$ condition is important, otherwise we got a simple counter-example: $X_1=X_2=X_3=\sigma^+$ , which mutually anti-commute but are all non-negative.","['matrices', 'clifford-algebras']"

    \mathcal{D}'\Rightarrow T=constant$ , in the simplest cases In less trivial cases, such as, say $u'+a(x)u=0$ with $a(x)\in C^\infty$ , she exploits some kind of 'suggestions' from the
classical solution and, given some $\phi\in\mathcal{D}$ she lets the
derivative acts on a term $e^{-A(x)}\phi$ ,   instead of on $\phi$ alone, where $A(x)$ is a primitive of $a(x)$ : hence $\phi$ multiplied by the classical solution of the equation. This leads to a
convenient rewriting of the equation which allows to exploit the
lemma of point 1. I can smell the idea of the tecnique, but since this is done without justification, I would like to know if this is just an euristic or a general approach.

(One has generators $a,b$ satisying $|a| = p^2; |b|=p;b^{-1}ab = a^{1+p}$ and the other has generators $a,b,c$ satisfying $|a|=|b| = |c|= p;c = a^{-1}b^{-1}ab;ca=ac;cb=bc$ ) I realize that there are many links online classifying groups of order $p^3$ . However, most of the solutions I have seen have required several pages of work.  Since this is just an exercise, I suspect there is a shorter solution. I have come up with the following: We know that $Z(G) = p$ because $G$ is a $p$ -group and if $|Z(G)| = p^2$ or $p^3$ , then $G/Z(G)$ would be cyclic. Thus, $G$ would be abelian, contrary to hypothesis. So, let $c$ be a generator for $Z(G)$ . Consider the quotient group $G/Z(G)$ which has order $p^2$ . Hence, $G/Z(G) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ . Let $\overline{a},\overline{b}$ be generators for $G/Z(G)$ (the overlines denote passage to the quotient). Now, this means that every element in $G$ can be written as $a^ib^jc^k$ for $i,j,k \in \mathbb{Z}$ . Since $c \in Z(G)$ we cannot have that $a,b$ commute (this is important later). Notice that $\overline{a},\overline{b}$ both have order $p$ in $G/Z(G)$ . Thus, $a^p,b^p \in Z(G)$ . We consider cases of $a^p$ and $b^p$ . Case 1: both $a^p = b^p = 1$ Then, since $G/Z(G)$ is abelian, the commutator subgroup, $G'$ , is contained in $Z(G)$ so that $|G'| = 1 $ or $p$ . But, $|G'| = 1$ implies $G$ is abelian, contrary to hypothesis. So, $|G'| = p$ and consequently $G' = Z(G)$ . Thus, since $a,b$ do not commute, $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$ is nontrivial and $Z(G) = \langle a^{-1}b^{-1}ab\rangle$ (this is by the previous exercise where we showed that the commutator subgroup is generated by elements of this form). Thus, by possibly switching generators for $Z(G)$ this group satisfies the second pair of generators and relations in the question. Case 2: $a^p \neq 1$ and $b^p = 1$ (or vice versa) In this case $a^p$ is a nontrivial element in $Z(G)$ and since $Z(G)$ is cyclic of order $p$ , $c = a^p$ and so $|a| = p^2$ . This gives rise to the first pair of generators and relations. It is here where I am stuck. These should be the only two, but I have not found a reason why we cannot have $a^p \neq 1$ and $b^p \neq 1$ . How can I guarantee that this case does not occur (or gives one of the two cases above)? I assume this has something to do with the oddness of $p$ , as I have not used this anywhere in the argument.

&= X(q)\langle\partial_i,\partial_j\rangle\\
&= \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\langle\partial_i,\partial_j\rangle

Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ open and bounded and let $\mathcal{A}=\{ v \in C^{2}(\overline{\Omega}) \, | \,v=0\, on \, \partial\Omega\}$ with the following scalar product \begin{equation}
(u,v)_{\mathcal{A}}=\int_{\Omega} (\nabla u, \nabla v)_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}dx
\end{equation} where $(\cdot, \cdot)_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}$ is the canonical scalar product on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ . I have to prove that $(\mathcal{A}, \| \cdot \|_{\mathcal{A}})$ is a normed space but not a Banach space, where $\| u \|_{\mathcal{A}}=\sqrt{(u,u)_{\mathcal{A}}}$ . Proving that $(\mathcal{A}, \| \cdot \|_{\mathcal{A}})$ is a normed space is quite straightforward, the only point that make me think was the triangular inequality that I solved using the Chauchy-Schwarz inequality, namely \begin{equation}
|(u,v)_{\mathcal{A}}|\leq \|u\|_{\mathcal{A}}\|v\|_{\mathcal{A}},
\end{equation} infact if I consider $\| u+v\|_{\mathcal{A}}^2$ I can proced in this way \begin{split}
\| u+v\|_{\mathcal{A}}^2= & \| u\|_{\mathcal{A}}^2+2(u,v)_{\mathcal{A}} +\|v\|_{\mathcal{A}}^2 \\
\leq &\| u\|_{\mathcal{A}}^2+2\|u\|_{\mathcal{A}}\|v\|_{\mathcal{A}} +\|v\|_{\mathcal{A}}^2 \\
= & (\| u\|_{\mathcal{A}}+\|v\|_{\mathcal{A}})^2
\end{split} Hence we have proved $\| u+v\|_{\mathcal{A}}\leq \| u\|_{\mathcal{A}}+\|v\|_{\mathcal{A}} $ . But I was stucked on the noncompleteness, I tried to argue as following but I am not sure if it is right. Let $n=1$ and $\Omega=(-1,1)$ and suppose to take the sequence $(u_n)_n\subset \mathcal{A}$ , given by \begin{equation}
u_n=\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n^2}}-\sqrt{x^2+\frac{1}{n^2}},
\end{equation} I can notice that $u_n \rightarrow u$ when $n\rightarrow \infty$ using for instance the uniform norm, where $u=1-|x|$ that does not belong to $\mathcal{A}$ . Hence I found a sequence that converges to an element that is not in the space and consequentely $\mathcal{A}$ is not complete.","['normed-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"
3289673,Martingales: why bother conditioning on the filtration when we can condition on random variables instead?,"In some discussion regarding martingales, suppose we have a random process $\{X_k\}_{k \geq 0}$ , authors use $$\mathbb{E}[X_{k+1}|\mathcal{F}_k]$$ to denote the expectation with respect to a filtration, i.e., a increasing $\sigma$ -algebra of the past random variables, $\mathcal{F}_k = \sigma(X_0, X_1, \ldots, X_k\}$ . A rough interpretation is that we are conditioning on increasing amount of information. But why bother conditioning on a $\sigma$ -algebra? (which is not unique, and can be very large, i.e., $\mathcal{F}_k = \text{power set}$ , and contains things like $\varnothing$ which makes no sense in terms of information necessary) Why not simply condition on the past random variables themselves? That is, $$\mathbb{E}[X_{k+1}|X_k, X_{k-1}, \ldots, X_0]$$ Isn't the latter expression more interpretable and direct? In what situation is conditioning on the filtration better than conditioning on the random variables themselves?

As the value of diameter is rational then the irrationality must come from the circumference. Then I used calculus to calculate the arc length of various functions with curved graphs (between two rational points) and found the arc length two be irrational again. Do all curved paths have irrational lengths? My logic is that while calculating the arc length (calculus) we assume that the arc is composed of infinitely small line segments and we are never close the real value and unlike the area under a curve, there do not exist an upper and lower limit which converges to the same value. If yes, are these the reasons irrational values exist in the first place?","['arc-length', 'calculus', 'pi', 'irrational-numbers']"

However, I'm not understanding the argument used: Here if I assumed that $p \equiv 0 \mod S$ is equivalent to $p = 0$ it would be easy to deduce $(a_0,b_0) = \pm (b_1,a_1)$ since the first equality is saying $a_0 = \pm b_1, a_1 = \pm b_0$ and the last equality is saying that this two equalities have the same sign.

My first question is about understanding that this definition is well-defined. $d L_g X$ is not a vector field, since $h \mapsto d(L_g)_h X_h$ is not in $T_h G$ . Therefore $\nabla_{d L_g X}\hspace{0.5mm} d L_g Y$ is not well-defined... or am I reading the expression in a wrong way?

Specifically, (a suitable scaling of) $T_n(x)$ is the monic polynomial $p$ of degree $n$ that minimizes $$\sup_{x \in [-1,1]} |p(x)|
\; .$$ I am interested in finding a polynomial of degree $n$ that varies the least over an interval, subject to the constraint that the polynomial must have a root at some fixed point. I.e., I would like to find a polynomial $p$ of degree $n$ such that $$p(0) = 0$$ and satisfying $$1 \leq p(x) \leq \alpha_p$$ for all $x \in [1,N]$ with $\alpha_p$ as small as possible. (I'm not sure how important the parameter $N$ is.) So, that's the question. For those who are interesting, I'll write down my motivation below. Motivation My motivation comes from another very natural question. Suppose that I have some random variable $X$ over, say, the integers $0,\ldots, N$ , and suppose I know the first $n$ moments of $X$ , $M_1,\ldots, M_n$ with $N \gg n$ . Given this information, how accurately can we estimate $\Pr[X \neq 0]$ (in the worst case)? The first observation to make here is that knowing $M_1,\ldots, M_n$ is equivalent to knowing the expectation $\mathbb{E}[p(X)]$ for any polynomial $p$ whose degree is at most $n$ . Suppose for simplicity that we just want to use one such expectation to answer this question. What polynomial $p$ do we pick, and how well can we do? It's clear that $p$ is useless for this purpose if there exist non-zero $k_1,k_2$ with $p(k_1) \leq p(0) \leq p(k_2)$ , since then there exist values of $\mathbb{E}[p(X)]$ that do not constrain $p(0)$ at all. So, after shifting and rescaling, we may assume that $p(0) = 0$ and $1 \leq p(k) \leq \alpha_p$ for $k \in \{1,\ldots, N\}$ . Such a polynomial yields a multiplicative approximation factor of $\alpha_p$ , so our goal is to find the polynomial minimizing $\alpha_p$ . The above question is identical, except that I removed the restriction that $k$ must be an integer (which seems reasonable for large $N$ ).","['chebyshev-polynomials', 'polynomials', 'probability']"

3290265,Find $d$ for which $f$ gets its minimal value,"Let $\beta>\alpha>0$ and let $A,B,C,D$ be the vertices of the rectangle $[\alpha,\beta]\times[\alpha,\beta]$ , such that $A$ is the closest one to the origin, and the path $A\to B\to C\to D\to A$ is oriented clockwise. Let $\vec{F}(x,y)=(y,x)$ . A particle is located at the vertex $B$ and is moving along a curve $\gamma$ which is given by the following parametrization: $$\left\{\begin{aligned}\gamma(t)=\bigg(\beta-(\beta-\alpha)\cos(t)+e^{-t^2}\sin^3 (2t)& ,\beta-(\beta-\alpha)\sin(t)+(dt^2-\pi t)^3\bigg)\\ t\in[0,\frac \pi 2]\end{aligned}\right.$$ When $d\in\mathbb{R}$ . Let $f(d)$ be the function: $$f(d)=\left|\int_\gamma \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r}\right|$$ Find $d$ for which $f$ gets its minimal value. Where does the particle stop, given the value of $d$ you found? Hint : What does the given rectangle has to do with the problem? Note : I usually expand on what I tried to do and how I approached the problem. However, for this particular problem, I really could not think of a way to approach it. Calculating the integral and getting an expression that is dependent on $d$ seemed the straightforward solution, but it seems impossible given the above parametrization.

3290369,"Terminology: Analytic, Angle-preserving, Conformal and Holomorphic","I am trying to contrast the relations between Terminology: Analytic, Angle-preserving, Conformal Holomorphic My question for you is that how ""Analytic, Angle-preserving, Conformal and Holomorphic"" are related to each other? Say in complex analysis or other discplines? For example, in this video ""Visualizing the Riemann hypothesis and analytic continuation
"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD0NjbwqlYw , it says at 13:57 that complex function with derivative everywhere is called analytic.
  Analytic is almost about Angle-preserving Analytic $\Leftrightarrow$ Angle-preserving   (kind of) However, analytic of complex function is not entirely about angle-preserving (kind of).","['complex-analysis', 'conformal-geometry', 'derivatives', 'analysis']"
3290380,Analytic continuation of Riemann zeta $\zeta(s)$ from the complex $\mathbb{C}$ to quaternion $\mathbb{H}$?,"One way to define  Riemann zeta function is by the analytic continuation of $$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = \frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \cdots$$ for the domain $Re(s)>1$ to the full complex plane in $\mathbb{C}$ . Thus, Riemann zeta function is defined for $s \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\zeta(s)  \in  \mathbb{C}$ My question is that do we gain anything new to do analytic continuation of Riemann zeta function such that a ""modified Riemann zeta function"" so $s  \in  \mathbb{H}$ is in quaternion? and $\zeta(s)  \in  \mathbb{H}?$ Does this lead to any interesting result in the math literature? Edit: more precisely, according to the comment, we seek for an analytic continuation of $\zeta(s)$ from the complex $\mathbb{C}/\{1\}$ to quaternion $\mathbb{H}/\{1\}$ ?","['complex-analysis', 'riemann-zeta', 'quaternions']"
3290472,"Constructing a Function $f(n,x)$ with Specific Properties","Let there be a smooth, continuous function $f(n,x)$ where $n$ is an odd semiprime, which is the product of two odd primes $p$ and $q$ , where $p$ is the smaller factor and is strictly less than $\sqrt{n}$ . The only zero of $f(n,x)$ for $1<x<\sqrt{n}$ is $x=p$ . There can be other zeros outside of that range. What is an example of such $f(n,x)$ , in which the explicit definition (using mathematical operators, math symbols, etc.) of the function does not require you to know $p$ or $q$ ? Anything not including $\sum$ or $\prod$ over $n$ terms is accepted, ie. it must be closed form. For example, I already know $$f_1(n,x)=(\cos(\frac{n}{x} \pi)\cos(x\pi))-1$$ and $$f_2(n,x)=\sin^2(\frac{n}{x}\pi)+\sin^2(x \pi)$$ but I want other functions. On that note, while sine and cosine are allowed, functions that don't use them are preferred.","['number-theory', 'calculus', 'functions']"
3290482,Evaluate $\int_0^{\pi/4}{(4\cot x\ln\sec x-x)\ln^2\tan xdx}$,"Question: How can we prove $$I=\int_0^{\pi/4}{(4\cot x\ln\sec x-x)\ln^2\tan xdx}=\frac5{2304}\pi^4?$$ I confirmed, numerically, that it holds for 1000 decimal places. This integral came up when I was calculating $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{H_{4n}}{n^3}$ . Attempt Note that $\tan x=i\frac{1-e^{2ix}}{1+e^{2ix}}$ , substituing $t=e^{ix}$ gives $$I=\int_1^{e^{i\pi/4}}\frac it\left(\frac{1+t^2}{1-t^2}\ln\frac{2t}{1+t^2}-\frac1i\ln t\right)\left(\frac{\pi i}2+\ln\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}\right)^2dt,$$ then I tried $t^2\mapsto t$ , $$I=\frac12\int_1^{i}\frac it\left(\frac{1+t}{1-t}(\ln2+(\ln t)/2-\ln(1+t))-\frac1{2i}\ln t\right)\left(\frac{\pi i}2+\ln\frac{1-t}{1+t}\right)^2dt,$$ For the next step I substituted $u=\frac{1-t}{1+t}$ , but it makes the integral more complex. Moreover, the substitution seem to turn the integral into the original form. I got stuck here.","['integration', 'calculus', 'definite-integrals']"

3290512,Geometric or Trigonometric way to fit a circle to series of points,"I'm working on a computer vision project where I'm trying to detect a moving colored circle (doughnut actually). After some work I'm able to get it working pretty well except for these two edge cases. My results are always a small set of approximately 5-10 points that describe a circle. Then I can calculate the ""center of mass"" of the object.  When this comes out right like a circle I get the center coordinates correctly. But when it comes out like the sketches below the center point is off. The first image is the result of a little extra object being detected, and the second case is usually the camera occluding part of the image or sometimes an aggressive light source. A lot of my error cases have part of a circle in them. So I've been trying to think if there is a neat mathematical way to identify each edge case, and then solve it, by figuring out where the real center would be of a circle that fit to it.  I can see how to approach this from a trial and error convergence sort of approach.  But I thought there might be something smarter I hadn't thought of. I do know I could solve the problem on the right with an existing function if I had to, but I don't have a solution for the left. I don't want the circle that surrounds all the points on the left, I'm after what the circle would be if that little nub didn't exits. And I'd love to have a good understanding of solving both edge cases. Any advice is always appreciated it.","['trigonometry', 'circles', 'geometry']"
