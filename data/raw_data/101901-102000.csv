1418032,Capable groups of order $32$ with GAP,"A group that can be written as $\frac{G}{Z(G)}$ for some group $G$ is called capable. How can I find all capable groups $G$ of order 32 with $|Cent(G)|=10$, where $Cent(G)$ is the set of all centralizers of elements in the group $G$?

1418036,Why is it necessary for a ring to have multiplicative identity?,"I have read earlier that in a ring $(R,+,.)$ the following needs to hold: $(R,+)$ is an abelian group multiplication is associative and closed left and right distribution laws hold. However, I recently came across the fact that every ring has to have a multiplicative identity. Can anyone please clarify this? Is it needed for the ring to have a multiplicative identity? (In fact it was mentioned that it is one of the reasons why $ker(f)$ is not a subring where $f$ is a ring homomorphism as the additive identity and the multiplicative identity are not usually in the same subset.) Further in 2 different places I have noticed that there is a difference on whether the mapping $f(1) \to 1$ is a necessary condition for $f$ to be a ring homomorphism. I think this is also related to my doubt as to whether the multiplicative identity is in fact a necessary condition for defining a ring.","['ring-theory', 'definition', 'rngs', 'terminology', 'abstract-algebra']"
1418077,Evaluating $~\int_0^1\sqrt{\frac{1+x^n}{1-x^n}}~dx~$ and $~\int_0^1\sqrt[n]{\frac{1+x^2}{1-x^2}}~dx$,"How could we prove that $$\int_0^1\sqrt{\frac{1+x^n}{1-x^n}}~dx~=~a\cdot2^{a-1}~\bigg[\frac12~B\bigg(\frac a2,~\frac a2\bigg)~+~B\bigg(\dfrac{a+1}2,~\dfrac{a+1}2\bigg)\bigg],$$ where $a=+~\dfrac1n$ , and $$\int_0^1\sqrt[n]{\frac{1+x^2}{1-x^2}}~dx~=~a\cdot2^{a-1}~\bigg[\frac12~B\bigg(\frac a2,~\frac a2\bigg)~-~B\bigg(\dfrac{a+1}2,~\dfrac{a+1}2\bigg)\bigg],$$ where $a=-~\dfrac1n$ ? This question arose as a generalization of the fact that the arc length of the $($co$)$sine function over an interval of the form $\bigg(k~\dfrac\pi2,~m~\dfrac\pi2\bigg)$, with $k,~m\in\mathbb Z$, can be expressed in terms of $\Gamma$ functions , which was somewhat surprising, since the evaluation of such arc lengths usually involves elliptic integrals ; indeed, it was one of the main historical reasons for defining them in the first place. I tried substituting $x^n=\cos2t$, and then employing the well-known trigonometric formulas for $1\pm\cos2t$, in the hopes of reducing the original problem to a beta function by means of Wallis' integrals , since $\sqrt{\dfrac{1+x^n}{1-x^n}}~=~\cot(t)$, but this approach ultimately lead me nowhere $($which is not to imply that the same method might not prove fruitful in someone else's skilled hands$)$.","['calculus', 'closed-form', 'definite-integrals', 'beta-function', 'integration']"
1418097,Max and sum of random variables,"I have a set of independent random variables $\{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2\}$. All of them have the same distribution function $F(x)$. I want to find distribution function of a variable $C$, where $C=max(A_1 + B_1, max(A_1, A_2) + B_2)$. To find CDF of $max(A_1, A_2)$ I can multiply CDF's of $A_1$ and $A_2$. To find $max(A_1, A_2) + B_2$ I can find convolution of CDF's of both terms. But now I'm struggling to find a CDF of the terms of the outer max, because the terms of the outer max are not independent. Could you help me, please, solving this problem? Or give a good reference for that? If it is required, we can make an assumption of a particular distribution function for the variables $A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2$. UPDATE I made some transformations: Consider all possible outcomes: \begin{equation}
C=\begin{cases}
A_1 + B_1, &\text{if } &A_1+B_1>A_1+B_2 \wedge A_1+B_1>A_2 + B_2 & (1)\\

$$ $P((B_1-B_2)>(A_1-A_2)) = 0.5$, because convolution of the same distributions leads to the same convoluted distribution function. Putting everything in $E[C]$: $$

1418150,Paradox or error in design?,"Currently I'm writing a homework for my school. I've made an experiment built this way: There is a laser pointed at a half reflecting mirror which reflects 50% at a wall. The other half cross the half mirror to a full mirror this is reflecting 100% back to the middle. There the laser is reflected by a half to a second mirror and by a other half back into the laser. The question I ask myself was how much energy is reaching the wall and how much is reflected back into the laser. 
Based on the idea that one half of the laser beam is circling through the mirror-halfmirror-mirror system which outputs every roundtrip a part of the energy to the wall or back into the laser, I designed two formulas (output of the Laser is 100%). The first to describe the total amount of energy reaching the wall:
$$
E_{wall}= \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^k}=\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}{\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{2^k}} =1 (100\%)
$$ And the second to describe the amount of energy which is mirrored back into the laser:
$$
E_{Laser}=\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{2^k}=\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}{\sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{2^k}} =0.5(50\%)
$$ My problem is now that there are 150% of total energy output. Is there any problem with my understanding of the mathematical problem behind it or is it a problem related to the set-up of the experiment or the formulas?","['sequences-and-series', 'physics', 'convergence-divergence']"
1418151,Explicit examples of (co)limit arguments in other fields,"Over the past weeks, I have noticed that high level lecture notes in subjects like algebraic geometry, algebra, and algebraic topology often sketch proofs in the following form: Proof sketch for a ""simple"" case e.g Noetherian ring/scheme, CW complex, finitely generated subobject ""Magically"" get the general case by ' the usual (co)limit arguments ' Unless I am mistaken ""(co)limit arguments"" just mean exactness properties of all kinds of functors. The thing is, though, I can hardly think of any specific examples of proofs of relatively basic facts from these exactness properties. So... I'd like to compile a big list of specific examples of proofs in which the general case can be obtained from a simple case along with explicit mention of the (co)limits involved. I know any mathematician will be tempted to say that this method of proof pervades all of mathematics - and I'm sure it does - but I want to explicitly see the functors and (co)limits involved; too often I hear ""this is really the continuity of the functor $F$"" in disguise"" without understanding the details. Update: Let me broaden what I mean by ' the usual (co)limit arguments ' in hopes this will inspire some answers. Apart from exactness, some categories have the property that arrows into certain (co)limits factor through one of the components. For instance, in Grothendieck abelian category, I'm pretty sure a map into a filtered colimit of monos factors through one of them. This can be used to construct functorial injective resolutions. So what are some more interesting cases and applications of ""an arrow
  $A\rightarrow \varinjlim _\alpha B_\alpha$ factors through some
  $A\rightarrow B_\alpha$"" type results?","['big-list', 'abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'category-theory']"
1418154,Show the first Chern class of a $U(1)$ bundle is integral.,"I am working from John Baez's book: ""Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity"". So I will stick to the notation used in that book. I am stuck at exercise 122 of part II (page 283), it reads: Show that if $E$ is a $U(1)$-bundle over $M$ with standard fiber given by the fundamental representation $U(1)$, the first Chern class of $E$ is integral. So I need to show that $i/(2\pi) \int_{M} \text{tr}F$, where $F$ is the ($\text{End}(E)$-valued) curvature two-form, is an integer. Now just before the exercise he says that one can turn the argument for charge quantization in Chapter 6 of part I (at the very end) into a proof of the integrality of the first Chern class for a $U(1)$-connection. This is the argument (paraphrased): The space we consider is $\mathbb{R}^{3}\setminus \{0 \}$. If we drag a particle with electric charge $q$ around a loop $\gamma$ that bounds a $2$-disk $D$ embedded in space, its wavefunction is multiplied by a phase
\begin{equation}
e^{-iq/\hbar\int_{D} B},
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the magnetic field two-form, given by
\begin{equation}
B = (m/4\pi) \sin \phi \text{d}\theta \wedge \text{d}\phi.
\end{equation} Suppose that the loop $\gamma$ is the equator of a sphere centered on the origin. Let $D_{1}$ be the northern half of this sphere and $D_{2}$ the southern half. We compute
\begin{equation}
\int_{D_{1}} B = \frac{m}{4\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \sin \phi \text{d}\theta \wedge \text{d}\phi = \frac{m}{2},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\int_{D_{2}} B = -\frac{m}{4\pi} \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \sin \phi \text{d}\theta \wedge \text{d}\phi = -\frac{m}{2}.
\end{equation} We should be able to compute the phase using either of these results, thus we are led to conclude
\begin{equation}
e^{-\frac{iqm}{2\hbar}} = e^{\frac{iqm}{2\hbar}},
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
e^{\frac{iqm}{\pi}} = 1,
\end{equation}
thus $q$ must be an integer multiple of $2\pi \hbar/m$, that is, charge is quantized. Furthermore, right before the exercise, there is an argument that shows that the fact that the first Chern class is integral implies that the magnetic charge is quantized. It goes as follows (also paraphrased): Let $E$ be a (the?) $U(1)$-bundle over $\mathbb{R}^{3} \setminus \{0 \}$. Let $D$ be a $U(1)$-connection on $E$ and let $A$ be the corresponding vector potential, (that is, $D = D^{0} + A$, where $D^{0}$ is a flat connection). Let $F$ be the curvature of $D$ (equivalently of $A$). Define $\text{tr}(F)=:i B$, such that $B$ is a real-valued $2$-form on $\mathbb{R}^{3} \setminus \{0 \}$. By the integrality of the first Chern class we have
\begin{equation}
\int_{S^{2}} B = 2 \pi N,
\end{equation}
thus the magnetic charge is quantized. So here is my attempt at a solution to the problem. Let $E$ be a $U(1)$-bundle over $M$ as in the problem. Let $D$ be a connection on $E$ with corresponding vector potential $A$ and let $F$ be the curvature of $D$. We define the real valued two-form $B$ by $B:= -i \text{tr}(F)$. Now I suppose one would like to mimic the earlier proof and say that if one carries a particle with charge $q$ around a loop $\gamma$ in $M$ its wave function would be multiplied by a factor
\begin{equation}
e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{D} B},
\end{equation}
where $D$ is a disk enclosed by the loop $\gamma$, but here I have some doubts, since it might not be possible to make such a disk if $M$ is not simply connected, and even worse I am not sure this needs to be true. And even if there is a way around these objections, I would not know how to continue since in the argument I am trying to mimic one explicitly computes $\int_{D} B$, but I am not sure how to do this without explicit knowledge of the manifold $M$. Any help would be greatly appreciated!","['differential-geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'quantum-mechanics']"

1418224,Properties of a specific antichain of a lattice formed by the cartesian product of finite ordered sets,"Introduction Let $X$ be a poset of all $n$-tuples, $x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, where $0 \leq x_i \leq m_i - 1$ for $i = 1, ..., n$ together with the relation $x \prec y$ defined so that for $y=(y_1,y_2, ..., y_n)$, $x \prec y$ if and only if $x_i \leq y_i$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. This poset is a bounded lattice in which $(m_1 - 1, m_2 - 1, ..., m_n - 1)$ is the greatest element and $(0, 0, ..., 0)$ is the least element. I am trying to derive an upper bound on the sum of the size of the common prefixes of an (arbitrary) element with all incomparable elements with lower rank from an (arbitrary) antichain. Definitions For two elements $x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ and $y=(y_1,y_2, ..., y_n)$ the size of the common prefix $s(x,y)$ is the maximal $k$, such that $x_i \leq y_i$ for $0 \leq i \leq k$. For example, $s((0, 0, 2, 0),(2, 2, 1, 0))= 2$, i.e., they have a common prefix of length $2$. The rank of an element $x$ is the sum of its components: $rank(x) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i$ Two elements $x$ and $y$ are comparable if $x \prec y$ or $y \prec x$. We denote comparability of two elements $x$ and $y$ with $x \bot y$ and incomparability with $x||y$. An antichain is a subset of the elements of $X$ which are pairwise incomparable. Problem statment For a given poset $X$, I want to find an upper bound $b$ such that for any element $x \in X$ and any antichain $A \subset X$ the following holds: $\sum\limits_{a \in A:~rank(a)<rank(x)~\wedge~a||x} s(a,x) \leq b$. What have I done so far? The closest structure that I could find is the chain product poset studied in Carroll et al. ""Counting Antichains and Linear Extensions in Generalizations of the Boolean Lattice"" 1 . It is a special case of the structure considered here, with $m_1 = m_2 = ... = m_n = m$. Let $c$ be the cardinality of a maximum antichain of the chain product poset constructed from $X$ by choosing $m = max(m_1, m_2, ... m_n)$. It follows that $c * n$ is an upper bound for the number investigated here. Presumably, the bound is significantly overestimated, as this approach simply assumes the largest possible common prefix with all elements from the largest possible antichain. It does not consider the fact that we are only interested in incomparable elements with lower rank. In addition, most $m_i$s from $X$ will actually be smaller than $m$, meaning that the constructed chain product poset is a superset of $X$. Regarding the number $c$, in the article by Carroll et al. it is stated that any chain product poset is a Sperner poset and that, as a consequence, the largest antichain is a level set. If I understand the paper correctly, the level of an element equals its rank and the structure forms a ranked poset. I concluded that the size of the middle level, which contains all elements with rank $\lfloor \frac{(m-1)*n}{2} \rfloor$, equals the size of the largest antichain. The paper cites an article by Mattner et al. 2 , which shows that the size of the middle level is $m^n \sqrt{\frac{6}{\pi(m^2-1)n}}(1+\mathcal{o}(1))$. 
In addition to the formula provided by Mattner et al., I have found a webpage discussing Balls in Bins With Limited Capacity , which provides formulas that can be used to calculate the size of any level in the structure originally discussed here as well as in chain product posets. Questions Does anyone know a better upper bound? Are my assumptions and the current upper bound correct? Is there any common name for the type of poset considered that I can use to find information about it?Has this structure been studied somewhere? Are there any different ways of looking at the problem?

Each ant randomly moves toward on end of the string (equal probability to the left or the right) at constant speed of 1 foot/minute until it falls of a t one end of the string. Also assume that the size of the ant is infinitely small. When two ants collide head-on, they both immediately change directions and keep on moving at 1 foot/min. What is the expected time for all ants to fall off the string? I realize this question has been asked here . However, I am trying to understand the answer that is given for this question in my book: It says the ants labels are randomly assigned and hence the labels of the ants can be changed with no difference to the result. So when the ants collide, they effectively continue in the same direction. This makes sense. However, I am unclear about this part: If an ant is put on the x-th foot, the expected value for it to fall off is just x min. If it goes in the other direction, simply set it to 1-x. So, the original problem just becomes what is the expected value of the maximum of 500 IID random variables with a Uniform Distribution between 0 and 1. I don't understand how the difference in direction that it goes in is being accounted for.",['probability']

An example of such a representation is $ 1\cdot10^3 + 3\cdot10^2 + 67\cdot10^1 + 40\cdot10^0$. Find $ N$. I picked the biggest $a_1$ so: $a_1 = 2$, there are only two ways to form $2010$. Take $a_1 = 1$ now. This opens up to a lot of possibilities. Specific Casework should work: Cases 1-1: $a_2 = 10$, then possibilities are: $a_1 = 1, a_0 = 0$ or $a_1  = 0, a_0 = 10$ Actually, I think a number-theoretic way is easier. But still. Case 1: $a_1 = 1$ then we must solve: $100x + 10y + z = 1010$. Since $0 \le x \le 10$, we can casework $x$ so that: Case 1-1:$x = 0$. So that: $10y + z = 1010 \implies z \equiv 0 \pmod{10}, z = 10k$ and $y = 101 - k$. Hence, $(0, 101 - k, 10k)$. $\min{k} = 0 $ and we need to find the max of $k$. We must have, $101 - k \le 99$ and $10k \le 99$. This suggests, $k \le 9$. Cases 1-2: $x=1$. So that: $10y + z = 910 \implies z \equiv 0 \pmod{10}$ Again, $z = 10k$ and $y = 91 - k$. Giving a set of $(1, 91 - k, 10k)$.Here again, $\min{k} = 0$ and $10k \le 99$ so $k \le 9$. I am conjecturing that since we are always increasing $x$ values, the value on the RHS will always be divisible by $10$. $x = 9$ so that: $10y + z = 110 \implies z = 10k$ and $y = 11 - k$, which again there are $9$ values. Except if $x=10$ then there is: $10y + z = 10$ then $z = 10k$ and $y = 1 - k$. Then $k$ must be $1$. So there are: $10(9) + 1 + 2 = 93$ solutions total. This is just an attempt!

1418472,Determinant structure of symplectic matrix,"I want to show that if $\lambda$ is a real eigenvalue of a symplectic matrix $A$ then its char poly is of the form $\det(A-\mu id) = (\lambda-\mu)(\frac{1}{\lambda}-\mu) \det(\hat{A}- \mu id) $ where $\hat{A}$ is again a symplectic matrix. My proof goes like this: First, we take the eigenvector $e_1$ to the eigenvalue $\lambda$. We can extend this vector to a symplectic basis $e_1,f_1,e_2,f_2,\ldots,f_n$ satisfying the canonical conditions on such a basis with symplectic form $\omega.$ With respect to this basis, the first column of $A$ is $(\lambda,0,\ldots,0)^T$ by the eigenvector property. The entry $(2,2)$ of the matrix is given by $\omega(e_1,f_1) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \omega(e_1,Af_1) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \omega(e_1,f_1) = \frac{1}{\lambda}.$ Moreover, all other entries in the second row are zero( besides the entry $(2,2)$) as for any $k \in \operatorname{span}\{{f_1}\}^{\perp}.$ $$\omega(e_1,Ak) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \omega(Ae_1,Ak) =  \frac{1}{\lambda} \omega(e_1,k) = 0.$$ Thus, we can calculate the determinant of $A-\mu id$ in this basis by first expanding with respect to the first column. Since the only non zero entry is $(\lambda-\mu)$ we only get one term. Then we calculate the determinant of the submatrix with entries $(2,\ldots,n)\times(2,\ldots,n).$ We expand this determinant with respect to the second row. Here, the only non-zero entry is $(2,2).$ This one is $\frac{1}{\lambda-\mu}.$ So we indeed end up with something of the form
$\det(A-\mu id) = (\lambda-\mu)(\frac{1}{\lambda}-\mu) \det(\hat{A}- \mu id) .$ But now the big question is: Why is the submatrix $\hat{A}$ corresponding to the entries $(3,\ldots,n)\times(3,\ldots,n)$ of $A$ again symplectic?","['symplectic-linear-algebra', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'symplectic-geometry']"

(16 answers) Closed 8 years ago . I've been trying to wrap my head around the concept of compactness and get an intuitive understand of what it is. The definition used in my text book is the finite subcover definition. A subset $K$ of a metric space $X$ is said to be compact if every open cover of $K$ contains a finite subcover. More explicitly, the requirement is that if {$G_{\alpha}$} is an open cover of $K$, then there are finitely many indices $\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n$ such that $$K\subset G_{\alpha_{1}}\cup\, ...\cup \, G_{\alpha_{n}}.$$ This definition is not very accessible to me so I've been looking around trying to find something to help me understand it. So far, I haven't really wrapped my head around the idea yet, but I have learned the following: Compactness is a kind of limited-ness. Compactness is one of the two properties of finiteness, the other being discreteness. (I saw this in the explanation about foos, the creatures that are red and short, and the word foo has come to mean something both red and short.) In $R^k$, compactness is equivalent to being closed and bound. So I guess my question is, what is it about compactness that led mathematicians to call it ""compact""? What exactly is compact about it? What does this have to do with the definition (that is, where does the definition come from)? Furthermore, what does it mean to be discrete? I think it would help if you could give me an example of metric spaces that are: Compact and discrete Compact but not discrete Discrete but not compact Neither discrete or compact I've already read this question: What should be the intuition when working with compactness?

$$\text{Li}_k(x)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{x^n}{n^k}$$
Without prior knowledge of polylogarithms, I started working the sum where $k=1$. It's easy enough to evaluate by considering the derivative:
$$F(x)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{x^n}{n}~~\implies~~F'(x)=\frac{1}{x}\sum_{n\ge1}x^n$$
and so on, which tells me the sum is $\ln2$. I noticed that I could keep taking the derivative in this fashion for larger values of $k$ and came up with the recursive derivative relation for the polylog (equation (18) in the MathWorld link). If I denote $f_k\equiv\text{Li}_k(x)$, then
$$\frac{df_k}{dx}=\frac{f_{k-1}}{x}$$
I considered successive orders of the derivative:
$$\frac{d^2f_k}{dx^2}=\frac{-f_{k-1}+f_{k-2}}{x^2}\\
\frac{d^3f_k}{dx^3}=\frac{2f_{k-1}-3f_{k-2}+f_{k-3}}{x^3}\\

Show that $R \setminus S$ is a union of prime ideals. Here's my attempt so far.  If $a \in R \setminus S$, then the ideal $Ra$ does not intersect $S$, because if $ra$ were in $S$ for some $r \in R$, then $a$ would have to be in $S$.  Thus, it follows by Zorn's lemma that there exist ideals $I$ of $R$ which are maximal with respect to the property that $I \cap S = \emptyset$ . Let $I$ be any such ideal.  If I can show that $I$ is prime, the conclusion will follow.  Let $xy \in I$.  I want to show that $x$ or $y$ is in $I$.  Suppose $x \not\in I$.  Then $I + Rx$ intersects $S$, so there exists $s \in S, a \in I, r \in R$ such that $s = a + rx$.  Then $sy = ay + rxy \in I$, so $sy$, and hence $y$, cannot be in $S$.

1419023,Borel sets: alternative characterization for metric space,"For any topological space $(X,\tau)$, the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the open sets. In other words, it is the intersection of all $\sigma$-algebras on $X$ which contain $\tau$. For a metric space $(X,d)$, I want to prove the following alternative characterization. The family of Borel sets of a metric space $(X,d)$ is the smallest class $\mathcal{S}$ of subsets of $X$ with the properties If $E_1,E_2,E_3,\ldots$ belong to $\mathcal{S}$, then so too does $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}E_n$ If $E_1,E_2,E_3,\ldots$ belong to $\mathcal{S}$, then so too does $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}E_n$ $\mathcal{S}$ contains all the closed sets in $X$. (Bruckner, Bruckner, and Thomson, Real Analysis , Theorem 3.3; proof is an exercise) My questions: I have completed most of the proof, but I have not succeeded at proving that $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under taking complements. A hint would be great. My proof relies heavily on $X$ being a metric space. Can the result be generalized to, say, a Hausdorff space, or is there a counterexample? Proof attempt: $\mathcal{B}$ is a class of subsets of $X$ satisfying the three indicated properties. Since $\mathcal{S}$ is the smallest class of subsets of $X$ with these properties, we have the containment $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$. To show that $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{S}$, it suffices to show that $\mathcal{S}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing the open subsets of $X$, because $\mathcal{B}$ is the smallest such $\sigma$-algebra. Let $U \subseteq X$ be any open set. Then $U^c$ is closed. Consider the function $\rho : X \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $\rho(x) = d(x,U^c)$. Then $\rho$ is continuous. Indeed, if $x,y \in X$ and $z \in U^c$, then $d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)$; taking the infimum over $z \in U^c$, we have $\rho(x) \leq d(x,y) + \rho(y)$. Similarly, $\rho(y) \leq d(x,y) + \rho(x)$. Combining these inequalities, we have
$$|\rho(x) - \rho(y)| \leq d(x,y)$$
so in fact, the continuity is uniform. Note also that $\rho(x) = 0$ if and only if $x \in U^c$, because $U^c$ is closed. Therefore,
$$\begin{aligned}
U &= \{x \in X : \rho(x) > 0\} \\
&= \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \{x \in X : \rho(x) \geq 1/n\} \\
&= \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \rho^{-1}([1/n, \infty)) \\
\end{aligned}$$
This exhibits $U$ as a countable union of closed sets, so $U \in \mathcal{S}$. To complete the proof, we need to verify that $\mathcal{S}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. Since $\mathcal{S}$ contains $X$ and is closed under countable unions, we just need to show that it is closed under taking complements. Note that so far, we have only used properties 1 and 3 of $\mathcal{S}$, so presumably we will need property 2 here. Let $A \in \mathcal{S}$. I want to show that $A^c \in \mathcal{S}$. Unfortunately, I can't use the same method as above because $\rho(x) = 0$ is true for any limit point of $A$, whether or not it is in $A$.","['metric-spaces', 'measure-theory']"

To get the Fourier transform, I transform each term, $\alpha \psi''(x)$, $E \psi(x)$, $\delta(x) \psi(x)$, and $0$. I get these transforms: \begin{align}

Lemma: If $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of continuous functions on $[0, 2\pi]$. Then functon $\phi(x)$ defined as $\phi(x)=\inf_{f\in \mathcal{F}} f(x)$
is measurable on $[0, 2\pi]$. Hence, according to Lusin's theorem we can prove that this function is continuous a.e. on $[0,2\pi]$. Given all of these, can we get the exact value of the integration if it exists? Some of my own ideas: 1) I think one of the hard point is to determine the structure of sets $\mathbb{E}_{t}=f^{-1}(t)$ for any given $t$ in the range of $f$. 2) another interpretation on $f$: notice that if we denote $b_{k}= \sin^2 (2^{k} x)$ for fixed $x$ then it's not too hard to check that  $b_{k+1}=4b_{k}(1-b_{k})$. Hence sequence $\{b_{k}(x)\}$ could be regarded as obtained by starting at any point $b_{0}(x)=sin^2(x), x\in [0,2\pi]$ and conduct iteration with respect of $g(x)=4x(1-x)$. $f(x)$ actually measures the infimum of sequence $\{b_{k}(x)\}$ regarding different values of $b_{0}(x), x\in [0,2\pi]$.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'supremum-and-infimum', 'integration', 'lebesgue-integral']"
