1937094,Radius of convergence of product of two absolutely convergent power series,"I need help with finding the radius of the Cauchy product of two aboslutely convergent series.

1937142,Group structure of the unit circle in $\mathbb{F}_q[\sqrt{-1}]$,"Consider $\mathbb{F}_q[\sqrt{-1}]$, where $q = p^n$ where $p$ is a prime, $p \equiv 3 \pmod 4$. Then consider the unit circle $\{a \vert a \overline{a} = 1\}$, where $\overline{a}$ denotes conjugation, i.e. $a + b\sqrt{-1} \to a - b\sqrt{-1}$. Then there is a group structure, as if $a \overline{a} = b \overline{b} =1$, then $ab \overline{ab} =1$ and there are inverses and an identity. I would like to understand the structure of this group. Based on numerical evidence, I believe it always has $q+1$ elements and is cyclic. We can recast the problem as looking for solutions to $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, but I don't think that this is helpful. However, it is easy to show using Jacobi sums that there are $p+1$ solutions over $\mathbb{F}_p = \mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$, but this doesn't give much insight and I don't see how to generalize it to prime powers. EDIT: So it is cyclic because it is a subgroup of $F_{q^2}$.","['finite-fields', 'abstract-algebra']"
1937170,Find the conditional variance of multivariate normal distribution variables,"Random variables $x,y,z$ have a multivariate normal distribution with mean $\mu_x$ $\mu_y$ and $\mu_z$; and variance and covariance: $\sigma_x^2$,$\sigma_y^2$,$\sigma_z^2$,$\sigma_{xy}$,$\sigma_{xz}$,$\sigma_{yz}$.

1937183,The divergence theorem (Gauss) in 1 dimension: For me it is not clear how to compute the boundary integral!,"Gauss tells us that
    $$
\int_V \text{div}\vec{F}\, d^{(n)}V=\int_{S}\vec{F}\cdot\vec{\nu}\, d^{(n-1)}S,

    where $S=\partial V$ and $\vec{\nu}$ is the outer normal. For $n=1$, $V=[a,b]$ and $f\colon V\to\mathbb{R}$, this gives
$$
\int_a^b\frac{df}{dx}dx = \int_{S}f\cdot \nu d^{(0)}S,

$S=\partial V=\left\{a,b\right\}$ and $\nu(a)=-1, \nu(b)=1$. In nearly all literature it is said without any reasoning that
$$
\int_{S}f\cdot \nu d^{(0)}S=f(b)-f(a),
$$

$$
\int_A (f\cdot\nu)(\gamma(x))\sqrt{\text{det}(D\gamma(x)^T D\gamma(x))}\lambda^0 x

1937195,Irreducible cubic curve with either a node or a cusp,"I'm working on the following question from Shafarevich's Basic Algebraic Geometry I : Prove that an irreducible cubic curve $C$ has at most one singular point, and that the multiplicity of a singular point is 2. Prove also
  that if the singularity is a node then $C$ is projectively equivalent
  to $y^2=x^3+x^2$; if a cusp then to the curve $y^2=x^3$. I've managed to do the first part, but can't figure out the projective change of coordinates for the last part. I know that (assuming the singular point is $[1:0:0]$) the curve is given by $$f(x,y,z)=Ay^3+By^2z+Cyz^2+Dz^3+x\Lambda(y,z)$$ where $\Lambda(y,z)=Ey^2+Fyz+Gz^2$, and this gives us two options: $\Lambda$ is a perfect square, i.e. $[1:0:0]$ is a cusp; $\Lambda$ factors as two distinct linear factors, i.e. $[1:0:0]$ is a node.

1937216,"Necessity of compactness of manifolds $M,N$ for smooth approximation of $W^{1,p}(M,N)$.","I'm currently studying the Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(M,N)$ between manifolds $M,N$. One result by Schoen & Uhlenbeck is existence of approximation through $C^\infty(M,N)$-functions, if $M$ and $N$ are smooth and compact and $p \geq \dim M$. A raw sketch of the result goes as follows. We use the embedding (by Whitney/Nash) of the target manifold $N$ into a Euclidean space. (Here we use smoothness.) Now we consider the smooth convolution approximation which is in $C^\infty(M, \mathbb{R}^k)$. A PoincarÃ© inequality will show that the approximating sequence lies in some tubular neighbourhood of $N$ (here we use $p \geq \dim M$) and thus can be smoothly projected for the projected approximation to be in $C^\infty(M,N)$. Where is compactness of the manifolds needed? Is it something in the proof? Or is something without compactness not welldefined at all? I'd appreciate any help.

1937346,Shouldn't sample standard deviation DECREASE with increased sample size?,"I'm doing an experiment comparing 10,000 rolls of 5 dice (those 5 rolls were then summed, so the population mean is 17.5) and dividing them into sets of ten with sample size N = 10. The same experiment is repeated except with 3000 rolls, but the sample size decreases to N = 3. Both experiments have 1000 samples, just with different sample sizes. Now, I took the AVERAGE sample standard deviation for each experiment and to my great confusion, the experiment with the SMALLER sample size had a SMALLER average sample standard deviation than the experiment with the LARGER sample size. I thought this was a fluke and re-generated the random numbers only to find the same result. In other words, this means that the sample standard deviation for each sample of N =3 is on average smaller than each sample of N = 10. 
How is this possible? Intuitively, one would think that with a larger sample size the ""spread"" between values would be decreased because any individual improbable value would have less effect on the spread. Sort of like for the mean.
While for a smaller sample size, the variables would be less ""controlled"" and thus on average more spread out. Is my intuition just wrong? And is this plain to see mathematically? FOLLOW UP: I talked to my professor and he said that a weird phenomenon happens in statistics where sample standard deviations tend to be underestimations rather than overestimations of the population standard deviation. And that as sample size goes up, the sample standard deviation goes up because it becomes ""more accurate."" Is this true? And why does that happen? Is there both an intuitive explanation as well as a mathematical proof?","['statistics', 'probability']"
1937348,A transpose B equals B transpose A?,I am trying to learn about decision surfaces in Bayesian decision theory but my linear algebra is a little rusty. There is a derivation for a discriminant function that assumes normal densities for the classes. Each with their own mean and the same covariance (the covariance matrix is symmetric). At one point there is this expression: $g_i(\mathbf{x}) = -\dfrac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{\mu}_i^T\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{\mu}_i - \mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{\mu}_i - \mathbf{\mu}_i^T\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{x}) + \ln{P(w_i)}$ The $\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{x}$ is discarded because it has no impact. Then the expression is simplified as: $g_i(\mathbf{x}) = -\dfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{\mu}_i^T\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{\mu}_i + (\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{\mu}_i)^T\mathbf{x} + \ln{P(w_i)}$ But how is $\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{\mu}_i = \mathbf{\mu}_i^T\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{x}$?

And another example of a non holomorphic, $$h(z)=z((z^{*})^2-z^2)$$ $$=(zz^{*})z^{*}-z^2=|z|^{2}z^*-z^2$$ so would the $z^{*}$ derivative just be $|z|^2$ which is zero only at the origin?

My approach: Assume that $\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5}$ is rational. Then there exist coprime integers $p$ and $q$ so that $\frac{p}{q}$ is rational and $\frac{p}{q}=\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5}$. Thus $(\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5})^2=2(4+\sqrt{15})=\frac{p^2}{q^2}$, which implies that $p^2$ is even, so $p$ is also even. Let $p:=2m$ for some integer $m$, then $p^2=4m^2$. Thus $q^2(4+\sqrt{15})=2m^2$, which implies that $q^2$ is even, and so $q$ is even. But this contradicts that $p$ and $q$ are coprime, and we arrive at a contradiction.

Both have inverse-length as units, so their reciprocals $\frac{1}{\kappa}$ and $\frac{1}{\tau}$ have units of length, and are called ""radius of curvature"" and ""radius of torsion"". I understand that radius of curvature is the radius of a curve's osculating circle at a point. That's is a pretty clear notion geometrically, but I struggle to obtain a corresponding notion for radius of torsion. Can anyone share a geometric intuition behind this length, and what it tells us about a non-planar curve? According to http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OsculatingSphere.html , the osculating sphere does not have radius $\frac{1}{\tau}$, so it's not that. Calling it a ""radius"" seems to imply that it's a radius of something. Thanks in advance for any insight. Edit: If a helix is given by $\left<a\cos t,a\sin t,bt\right>$, ($a$ and $b$ positive), then the curvature is $\frac{a}{a^2+b^2}$ and the torsion is $\frac{b}{a^2+b^2}$. There's a lovely duality there, and if you define a dual helix by swapping $a$ and $b$, then the curvature of one is the torsion of the other, and vice versa. Thus, we could say that the radius of torsion is the radius of curvature for a ""dual"" helix, but I hesitate to define a whole new kind of duality just to awkwardly impart meaning to a phrase I saw in a book.

Define a category as follows: Objects: members of $R$. Morphisms: if $a$ divides $b$ in $R$, let $k_a^b$ denote a morphism, o.w.  no morphism between $a$ and $b$. Thus, the set of morphisms between $a$ and $b$ is either singleton (when $a$ divides $b$) or empty. Then the co-product of two objects in this category is l.c.m. and product is g.c.d. Of course, the product or co-product of two objects may not exists in this category, for certain rings $R$. Now the fact mentioned in the beginning says that if co-product of two objects in the above category exists, then the product of the same  two objects also exists. My natural question is, whether such phenomena occurs in every category, i.e. Question: If $\mathcal{C}$ is any category, and if co-product of two objects $A,B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ exists, then is it necessary that the product of $A$ and $B$ also exists?

Using cohomology and base change theorem (""for $p=2$""), one can reduce to the fact that $R^{1}f_{\ast}\Omega_{X/Y}$ is locally free. In fact as $H^{2}(X_{q},\Omega_{X_{q}/q})=0$ by dimensional vanishing, $R^{2}f_{\ast}\Omega_{X/Y}=0$ is forced (it is hence locally free), and hence by cohomology and base change theorem, $R^{1}f_{\ast}\Omega_{X/Y}|_{q}\to H^{1}(X_{q},\Omega_{X_{q}/q})$ is surjective (in fact bijective) for all $q$.

1938423,General theorem to cover arguments by simple function approximation,"A standard technique for proving facts about integrals is to argue through each stage of the integral's definition. For example: Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ be a measure space. Suppose one wants to prove that the integral is linear. That is, for measurable $f$ and $g$, and $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$ we have $$\int (\alpha f + \beta g) d\mu = \alpha \int f d \mu + \beta \int g d\mu.$$ One first considers the case in which $f$ and $g$ are indicator functions. One then considers simple $f$ and $g$ and uses the integral's linearity. One then considers $f,g \geq 0$, approximates by simple functions and uses the monotone convergence theorem. And, finally, one proves the general case by decomposing $f$ and $g$ into positive and negative parts. This sort of argument is so ubiquitous that David Williams, in his book Probability with Martingales , refers to it as the ""standard machine"". (It is used in the proofs of many other classical results. Two that come to mind now are the change of variable theorem and Fubini's theorem.) Question : Is there a general theorem that one can appeal to instead of making the standard machine argument again and again? (If so, and this is not a mathematical question so much as a sociological one, why do textbooks prefer to repeat the standard machine argument instead of appealing to the general theorem?) I believe I can partially explain why the argument works. For example, the collection of measurable functions is exactly the set of simple functions, closed under pointwise limits; the simple functions are dense in $L^{p}$ space; etc. But, still, it would be nice to have a theorem that covers all (or most) cases in which one is tempted to argue with the standard machine, and I don't know of one.","['real-analysis', 'probability-theory', 'integration', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory']"

On the RHS we are selecting $r+s+1$ elements from the set $[m+n+1]$. Another way of doing this is to partition the set $[m+n+1]$ into two sets in several ways by shifting $k$ elements from one set to the other. For example, we can partition $[m+n+1]$ into a set with $m+k$ elements and a set with $n+1-k$ elements. From the set with $m+k$ elements we can select $r$ elements and from the set with $n+1-k$ elements we can select $s+1$. However, this is not matching the LHS.

$$\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty}\sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{2^k}\right)$$ If there is no known closed form expression for this, what interesting properties does this sum have? I know this is not a concrete question, so I am just asking for opinions. Are there general series expansions for functions in terms of sinusoids with decreasing frequencies (like my example above)? What I have done so far: I tried plotting this in wolfram for a few terms(as much as the text box would allow me). I also wrote a program to numerically compute the sum up to a thousand terms. I could not find any recognizable patterns, but one interesting thing I observed (in answering my Q2 above) is that the curve is always positive on the right of y-axis and always negative on the left of y-axis. If I use positive integers for $k$ (i.e. $\frac{\pi x}{k}$) instead of using decreasing powers of two (i.e $\frac{\pi x}{2^k}$) for frequencies, I see that the curve crosses the x-axis (zero-crossing) at multiple places in both left and right planes. My thoughts on Q3. Since the highest frequency sinusoid has a frequency of $\frac{1}{2}$ in my expression, I don't expect that any function can be arbitrarily expressed using decreasing frequency sinusoids. I am merely wondering if there  is a small subset of functions that may be expressed this way (with a scaling factor for each sinusoid of course).","['summation', 'sequences-and-series', 'trigonometric-series']"

I have to determine how many subsets of $[n]:=\{1,\dots,n\}$ of size $k$ contain exactly one couple $(i,i+1)$ of subsequent integers.
I have used the following approach: let $T=(t_1,\dots,t_n)\subset\{0,1\}^n$ be a binary string of length $n$, identifying a subset of size $k$ drawn from $[n]$, i.e. $\sum_i t_i=k$. For $T$ to meet the conditions stated above, it must be the case that $T$ contains $k-2$ non consecutive ones and a couple of consecutive ones. To build such sequence, I used the method of stars and bars: first find a sequence of length $k-1$ with no consecutive numbers and then obtain a sequence of length $k$ with one consecutive couple. Place $n-k$ consecutive zeros in a string. There are $n-k+1$ places where $k-1$ ones can be placed so that they are non consecutive, hence there are $\binom{n-k+1}{k-1}$ sequences of length $n-1$ with $k-1$ ones that are non consecutive. Add an extra one close to the previous one. For any sequence in $(2.)$ there are $(k-1)$ possibilities. Overall, that would give $(k-1)\times\binom{n-k+1}{k-1}$ possibilities. Does this make sense?

So while this sequence is not tight and does not have a subsequence converging to a probability measure, it is contained in the compact unit ball of the weak-* topology by the Banach-Alaoglu theorem.

The reason for why I should do that, in my head, is because we just want to check what a tiny change in $z$ is going to change our $y$, so it's just like taking a derivative of a curve in a plane that intersects my surface, and that plane is described by a fixed $x$ value. Because we're fixing $x$ to get that intersection, we treat it as a constant?! Am I right? Since:
$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = -4y
$$
Can assume that $-4y$ is going to be the slope of the tangent line for any point of that intersection?!

Now, if want to get the tangent line on that point, I just need to get another point that is going to follow the slope of $-4$ because $-4y : y = 1 \Rightarrow -4$, and is on the plane. That point can be, for example $\gamma = (0,2,0)$. Now I can get a director vetor $\vec{t}$, and get a parametric equation for that tangent line:
$$
\vec{t} = \alpha - \gamma = (0,-1,4)
$$ $$
x = 0 + \beta \cdot 0\\
y = 1 + \beta \cdot -1\\
z = 4 + \beta \cdot 4\\
$$ Is everything correct? If it isn't, please try to explain what have I done wrong. Thanks!","['multivariable-calculus', 'tangent-line', 'implicit-differentiation']"

Now let $p$ be a point in $\mathbb P^3$ and $H$ be a hyperplane in $\mathbb P^3$ such that $p\in H.$ Consider the set $\Sigma_{p,H}$ of $l\in \mathbb G(1,3)$ such that $p\in l\subset H$. Show that $\Sigma_{p,H}$ is a line contained in $\mathbb G(1,3)$. Conversely, show that any line in $\mathbb P^5 $ lying on $\mathbb G(1,3)$ appears in this way. Now, using the action of $\mathrm{PGL}(4)$, I can prove the first part (one simply checks the case when $p=[1:0:0:0]$ and $H: x_3=0$), however I have no ideas for the converse.

Any element $x \in \mathbf{Z}[\xi]$ can be multiplied with a power $\xi^r$ such that it is congruent to an integer mod $(1-\xi)^2$. I've tried to prove it, but I need help.

1938974,Normalization of cone over twisted quartic curve,"For smooth projective varieties $Y \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ we know that the coordinate ring $S(Y)$ may or may not be integrally closed. If $S(Y)$ is normal, we say $Y$ is projectievly normal. This notion measures normality of the affine cone $C(Y) \subset \mathbb{A}^{n+1}$ over $Y$. A standard example of non-projectively normal variety is the twisted quartic in $\mathbb{P}^1 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^3$, given by the embedding
$$ [u:v]\mapsto [u^4:u^3v:uv^3:v^4] $$
This embedding is obtained via projecting the rational normal curve in $\mathbb{P}^1 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^4$ given by
$$ [u:v]\mapsto [u^4:u^3v:u^2v^2:uv^3:v^4] $$
on a suitable hyperplane in $\mathbb{P}^4$. Call $Y_1$ the twisted quartic in $\mathbb{P}^3$ and $Y_2$ the rational normal curve in $\mathbb{P}^4$. We have that $S(Y_2)$ is the integral closure of $S(Y_1)$. Therefore, $C(Y_2)$ is the normalization of $C(Y_1)$. Question My question is the following. How do I visualize the map $C(Y_2) \rightarrow C(Y_1)$? Edit Using the equations in this question , taking the jacobian matrix and checking for where the rank drops below 2, it looks like the cone $C(Y_1)$ is smooth away from the vertex. Thus, $C(Y_1)$ is already $R_1$. Is then the normalization happening just at level of structure sheaves, to ensure the $S_2$ property?","['algebraic-geometry', 'projective-geometry', 'ring-theory', 'commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-curves']"
