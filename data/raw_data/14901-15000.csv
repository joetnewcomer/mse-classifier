x + dx = 12 S dt + x e^{R dt}
$$ Perhaps that is the wrong way to go about it. I don't even know what equations with bare dx's and dt's (instead of dx/dt's) are called, so I had trouble trying to figure this out. Moving things around, I got this equation, which I didn't know what to do with the dt in the denominator of the integral (Cancel out with the dt of the integral?). $$
\frac{dx}{dt} = 12 S - x \frac{1-e^{R dt}}{dt}

118711,Is computing distance a lesser capability than computing square roots?,"Let $F$ be a field.  Consider the following three abilities: (SQRT) Given $a\in F$, find $x\in F$ such that $a = x^2$ (when such $x$ exists). (NORM) Given $a,b\in F$, find $x\in F$ such that $a^2+b^2 = x^2$ (when such $x$ exists). (BISQ) Given $a\in F$, find $x,y\in F$ such that $a = x^2+y^2$ (when such $x,y$ exist). Abilities NORM and BISQ together yield ability SQRT.  Ability SQRT (plus the ability to perform field operations) yields ability NORM.  If $F=\mathbb{R}$, then ability SQRT also yields ability BISQ (since in $\mathbb{R}$ the numbers expressible as a sum of squares are exactly the numbers expressible as squares, namely the nonnegative numbers, so we can compute $x$ using SQRT and take $y=0$), and so for $\mathbb{R}$ ability SQRT is equivalent to the combination of abilities NORM and BISQ.  [This paragraph was revised after an error was pointed out by joriki.] My question: Is NORM a strictly lesser capability than SQRT (in $\mathbb{R}$ or in any other field)? I don't state the question formally because I don't know the right formalization.  Any reasonable interpretation of the question is legit. My observations so far: In a field of characteristic 2, ability NORM is trivial (take $x=a+b$).  It seems like SQRT should be a nontrivial ability, but I don't see how to prove that, for example, in the field of power series over $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, the square root operation cannot be performed using the field operations alone. I had hoped to construct a field $F$ containing $\mathbb{Q}$ and closed under the operation of NORM, but not closed under SQRT (maybe using some trick related to the characterization of the integers which are representable as the sum of two squares).  This would show that, in that field, NORM is a strictly lesser capability than SQRT in a very strong sense.  But because every positive integer is the sum of four squares, any such field contains the square roots of all positive integers (if $n = a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$ then $\sqrt n = \sqrt{(\sqrt{a^2+b^2})^2 + (\sqrt{c^2+d^2})^2}$), hence the square roots of all positive rationals ($\sqrt{p/q} = \sqrt{pq}/q$), so it doesn't seem very hopeful. (The origin of the question is that a computer programmer I know was wondering whether there was a way to perform NORM without having to invoke the computationally expensive SQRT operation.  I doubt that this question has a positive practical answer, but the theoretical aspect struck my curiosity.)","['elementary-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Let $S/\mathbb{C}$ be a smooth projective surface, let $C$ be a non-singular irreducible curve on $S$. Then for all $L \in \text{Pic}\,S$, the intersection number $\langle \mathcal{O}_S(C), L \rangle$ is equal to $\text{deg}(L|_C)$. Proof: we have an exact sequence $0 \to \mathcal{O}_S(-C) \to \mathcal{O}_S \to \mathcal{O}_C \to 0$ which remains exact upon tensoring with $L^{-1}$, hence giving an exact sequence $0 \to L^{-1}(-C) \to L^{-1} \to L^{-1} \otimes \mathcal{O}_C \to 0$. By additivity of the Euler-Poincaré characteristic, we get $\chi(\mathcal{O}_S) - \chi(\mathcal{O}_S(-C)) = \chi(\mathcal{O}_C)$ and $\chi(L^{-1}) - \chi(L^{-1}(-C)) = \chi(L|_C^{-1})$. This allows us to write the intersection number as $\langle \mathcal{O}_S(C) , L \rangle = \chi(\mathcal{O}_C) - \chi(L|_C^{-1}) = -\text{deg}(L|_C^{-1}) = \text{deg}(L|_C)$, by Riemann-Roch.

118771,Implicit use of the Implicit Function Theorem when finding tangent lines to polar curves.,"Recently I found myself having to teach students how to find the slope of a tangent line to a curve in $\mathbb R^2$ given in polar coordinates by the equation $r = f(\theta)$. The students' calculus book instructs them that surely the slope of the tangent line must be given by $\frac{dy}{dx}$ and uses the chain rule to calculate $$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/d\theta}{dx/d\theta}$$ Then, using the fact that $x = r\cos\theta$ and $y = r\sin\theta$ they are therefore able to find a formula for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of $r$ and $\theta$. There is however a problem with this line of reasoning, namely that there is no compelling reason for $y$ to be defined even locally as a function of $x$. Knowledge of the implicit function theorem allows one to formulate the hypothesis necessary to make the above use of the chain rule correct. However it would be nice to justify the use of the chain rule here using only methods available to a first year calculus student.

But this is causing me mental dissonance because I don't understand how you can say that all codomain values are mapped given the following:  In programming, $y=f(x)$ doesn't take on a value until $f$ is called . Even then the largest values in the codomain won't be mapped until some call to $f(x)$ yields their value. There are other places in studying math where the lack of instantiation of values doesn't seem to invalidate the definition of concepts, and I think it will help me to move forward as a student if someone can explain to me what is going on here, and why I shouldn't worry about the fact that the definition seems to assume that all functions are always simultaneously instantiated, allowing mathematicians to make claims about their values.","['discrete-mathematics', 'functions']"

118831,Ways to prove that an extension of Noetherian modules is Noetherian,"Let $M$ be a module and $N$ a submodule of $M$. If $N$ is Noetherian and $M/N$ is Noetherian, so is $M$. This is usually proven like this: Let $(A_n)$ be an ascending series of submodules of $M$. Then $(A_n\cap N)$ and $((A_n+N)/N)$ are ascending series of submodules of $N$ and $M/N$ respectively, so that they are eventually constant. A little elementary argument shows that, for $A\subset B$ submodules of $M$, $A\cap N=B\cap N$ and $(A+N)/N=(B+N)/N$ together imply $A=B$. So the series $(A_n)$ is eventually constant. Now suppose we have defined Noetherian as ""all submodules are finitely generated"" and don't know about the equivalence to the ascending chain condition. There should be a proof of the above statement without the detour via the ascending chain condition, i.e. something like ""Let $A$ be a submodule of $M$, $S$ a finite generating set of $A\cap N$ and $T$ a finite generating set of $(A+N)/N$.

A quick version of my question is: doesn't 2.41 (together with 2.40, on which it depends) moot 2.42? 2.41. (Heine-Borel+) If a set E in $R^k$ has one of these three properties, it has the other two: (a) E is closed and bounded; (b) E is compact; (c) Every infinite subset of E has a limit point in E. 2.42. (Weierstrass) Every bounded infinite subset of $R^k$ has a limit point in $R^k$. The text explains that 2.41(a) implies (b) implies (c) implies (a). So the only step to be supplied for 2.42 is that a bounded subset of $R^k$ is compact (and therefore closed, to bring it into the ambit of 2.41). But in both theorems Rudin resorts to an extrinsic proof (his 2.40) to show that  that ""k-cells"" are compact. I think (am not sure) there is a theorem stating that Heine-Borel implies Weierstrass (and conversely) but H-B consists of 2.41(a) and (b), according to Rudin's note preceding 2.41.  I wonder if, with the addition of 2.41(c), he needs to prove Weierstrass separately? This is a sort of fussy question but an answer might help me understand the relationship between these ideas better. Thanks.

My idea : Case $p=2$ is easy, follows from $x^2 \equiv 2 \;\;\; (\text{mod} \;\; 4)$ has no integer solution. Assume the contrary and $p$ is an odd prime number. Since, $A+A^t$ is symmetric, then is has only real eigenvalues, so if $\det(xI-(A+A^t)) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ is the characteristic polynomial, it factors $(x-\lambda_1) \cdots (x-\lambda_p)$ where $\lambda_i$'s are real numbers. By rational root test, if any of $\lambda_i$ is rational, then it will be an integer. Therefore, if we show that non of them is irrational (hence, all $\lambda_i$ are integers), we may then conclude as follows; $\sum_i \lambda_i=-tr(A+A^t)=2k$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z},$ and $\lambda_1 \cdots \lambda_p=-p.$ Now, $p$ is odd , then wlog, $\lambda_p=-p$ and $\lambda_1=\cdots=\lambda_{2t}=-1$ and $\lambda_{2t}=\cdots=\lambda_{p-1}=1,$ but $\sum_i \lambda_i=-2t+p-1-2t-p$ which is odd, $\lambda_p=p$ and $\lambda_1= \cdots=\lambda_{2t+1}=-1$ and $\lambda_{2t+1}=\cdots=\lambda_{p-1}=1,$ but again $\sum_i \lambda_i=-2t-1+p-1-2t-1+p$ which is odd, hence contradiction. Now, we're left to show that (in my words) Lemma : Given $p$ integers and irrational numbers, where $p$ is an odd prime number. We have that $$\sum_i\lambda_i=2k \in \mathbb{Z}, $$ $$\sum_{i<j}\lambda_i\lambda_j \in \mathbb{Z},$$ $$.$$ $$.$$ $$.$$ $$\lambda_1\cdots \lambda_p=-p \in \mathbb{Z}.$$ Then, non of the $\lambda_i$ is irrational. An idea to prove the lamma : Since any symmetric polynomial in $p$ variables $\lambda_i$ with integer coefficient can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials above, then any symmetric (polynomial with integer coefficient) expression of $\lambda_i$'s will be an integer.

Does anyone have an example? Added. See the comments for some discussion about Bernstein sets, which may provide a solution. I don't know anything about these sets, so a detailed answer or reference in that connection would certainly be welcome. Here are some thoughts of mine and of one of my classmates regarding the problem. My original idea was as follows: Let $\mathcal V$ be a Vitali set (i.e., $\mathcal V$ contains exactly one element from each additive coset of $\mathbb Q$), choose dense subset $S$ of $\mathbb Q$ whose complement $\mathbb Q \setminus S$ in $\mathbb Q$ is also dense, and let $E = \mathcal{V} + S$. Then $E^c = \mathcal{V} + \mathbb{Q}\setminus S$, and it seems like $E$ should have the required property, but I have been unable to prove that this is so. My classmate had another idea. He worked in $[-1,1]\setminus\{0\}$, seeking a set $E$ with the following properties. The complement of $E$ is obtained from $E$ via reflection through the origin, that is, $E^c = -E$. If $E \cap I$ is the intersection of $E$ with some dyadic subinterval $I \subset [-1,1]$ of the $k$th generation, then $E$ is similar to this intersection, in the sense that $E = 2^k(E\cap I) + a$ for some real number $a$; that is, the intersection of $E$ with any dyadic subinterval is a scaled translate of $E$. If I'm not mistaken, it is (relatively) straightforward to verify that any set $E$ satisfying 1. and 2. provides an example. As far as the existence of such a set is concerned, my classmate made an argument, but it was fairly complicated, and I cannot recall it well enough off the top of my head to verify its correctness.","['general-topology', 'descriptive-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"

We observe a random vector $X \sim P_{\theta_0}$ where $\theta_0$ intuitively represents the ""true, unknown"" value of $\theta$. The maximum likelihood estimator of $\theta_0$ is then defined to be $\hat \theta = \arg \max_\theta f(X|\theta)$. How do we resolve the fact that $f_\theta$ is only unique almost surely? Normally we write these things off, but it actually matters here. A typical example is $X_1, X_2 \sim \mbox{Uniform}(0, \theta), \theta > 0$. Depending on whether we take $f(x|\theta) \propto I[0 \le x \le \theta]$ or $I[0 < x < \theta]$ affects what the estimator is. If it is the former we have $\hat \theta = \max\{X_1, X_2\}$ whereas with the latter the MLE doesn't exist. They are both valid densities for a Uniform$(0, \theta)$ but provide different answers. It seems natural in this case to prefer $I[0 \le x \le \theta]$ since, in this case, the density is positive and continuous when restricted to the support but I find it distaseful to define things in terms of densities instead of distributions. My two thoughts for solutions are (1) maybe once we have specified $\{f_\theta: \theta \in \Theta\}$, provided that the MLE exists, it may be the case that it is unique a.s. and (2) maybe we just bite the bullet and take the most natural family of densities for the problem at hand; when we want to make use of theoretical results, we make sure to choose $f_\theta$ so that it satisfies the required regularity conditions.

A strategy of A (or B) is called a candidate (for equilibrium), if it prevents the opponent from achieving a winning probability strictly greater than 1/2 no matter what strategy he (or she) adopts. By this definition, the following strategy of A is a candidate (check it yourself): "" ${f}_{A}(\{x,y\})=x$ iff $|x-1/2|<|y-1/2|$"" My question: Are there any other candidates for player A, except those that differ only by a measure zero set from the above? (P.S., One can show that the candidate for player B is unique, except by a difference of measure zero set. Hence if candidate for A is unique, too, there's a unique (pure) equilibrium.) Edit: Here's how I prove that candidate for B is unique. I don't know if a simpler argument can be made, or similar reasoning can be used to prove or disprove the case of A. By definition, B's strategy is to choose measurable $B_L\subseteq[0,1]$ such that he reports larger for $x\in B_L$ and smaller for $x\in [0,1]/B_L$. Now if $m(B_L)=a>1/2$, A can adopt the following strategy: ""Show the smaller number if both $x,y\in B_L$, otherwise show the larger number"". which guarantees her winning probability $\geq a^2+(1-a)^2>1/2$. Hence $m(B_L)>1/2$ can't be a candidate for B. Reversing the strategy shows that $m(B_L)<1/2$ can't be candidate, either. Hence $m(B_L)=1/2$. Now let $m(B_L)=1/2$. Define $B_S=[0,1]/B_L$. Consider the following incomplete specification of a strategy for A: ""Show the smaller number if both $x,y\in B_L$; show the larger if both $x,y\in B_S$"" which guarantees her winning probability $=1$ in those situations. What about the remaining situations, i.e., $x\in B_L$ and $y\in B_S$? For any measurable $B\subseteq B_L$ with $m(B)>0$, we can define $C=\{x\in B_S|x>y, \forall y\in B\} $. Suppose there exists such a $B$ such that $m(C)>0$, then A can adopt the following strategy: ""Show the smaller number if both $x,y\in B_L$, otherwise show the larger number"" which will guarantee her winning probability: P(win)$=$ P(both $x,y\in B_L$ or both $x,y\in B_S$ and win)$+$ P($x\in B_L$ and $y\in B_S$ and win) $\ge$ P(both $x,y\in B_L$ or both $x,y\in B_S$ and win)$+$ P($x\in B$ and $y\in C$ and win) $=1/2+2m(B)m(C)>1/2$ Hence if a strategy of B is to be a candidate, we must have $m(C)=0$. Because $B\subseteq B_L$ was arbitrary, it is true that the set $\{x\in B_S|x>y, \forall y\in B_L\} $ has measure zero. Hence, to conclude, necessary conditions for a strategy of B to be candidate: $m(B_L)=m(B_S)=1/2$. $\{x\in B_S|x>y, \forall y\in B_L\} $ has measure zero. There is only one strategy of B satisfying these conditions (up to measure zero difference), i.e., $B_L=[1/2,1]$. For sufficiency it is easy to check this is indeed a candidate. Hence it is the only candidate for B.","['game-theory', 'measure-theory', 'probability']"

119214,Card Shuffling [SPOJ],"The original question is posted on SPOJ , and included below: Here is an algorithm for shuffling N cards: 1) The cards are divided into K equal piles, where K is a factor of N. 2) The bottom N / K cards belong to pile 1 in the same order (so the bottom card of the .initial pile is the bottom card of pile 1). 3) The next N / K cards from the bottom belong to pile 2, and so on. 4) Now the top card of the shuffled pile is the top card of pile 1.
  The next card is the top card of pile 2,..., the Kth card of the
  shuffled pile is the top card of pile K. Then (K + 1)th card is the
  card which is now at the top of pile 1, the (K + 2)nd is the card
  which is now at the top of pile 2 and so on. For example, if N = 6 and K = 3, the order of a deck of cards ""ABCDEF""

Further we suppose that $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under multiplication and define $\mathcal{C}:=\sigma(\mathcal{M})$. Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a real vector space of bounded real-valued functions on $N$ and assume: $\mathcal{H}$ contains $\mathcal{M}$ $\mathcal{H}$ contains the constant function $1$.

119450,learning maths for statistics,"Apologies if I have posted this in the wrong place first off. My work has taken me into a unexpectantly large amount of statistics. In order to really understand what I am doing I need to understand these statistical approaches. However it seems almost impossible to do that unless you speak math (I don't as I'm sure you can tell). So my question is are there any free online resources for learning/ getting familiar with terminology, symbols, concepts commonly used in maths/statistics that are aimed at people with basic math skills (basic algebra is okay, can barely remember how to differentiate). Thanks in advance,
Cheers,
Davy Edit to say: I should mention that I am somewhat (not very) familiar with basic concepts like variance, hypothesis testing, and regression, but only on a practical level. I want understand these on the mathematical level on which they were built. Method development is something I am interested in, but I'll never be able to do, If I don't start learning more mathematics. MY problem thus far seem that every book on statistics assume you don't want to see any maths at all, or your totally familiar with giant equations, which are therefore, not explained well to someone who has no idea what (probably) commonplace symbols mean. I guess what I am really looking for is an induction to the domain specific language of maths, with a view towards stats.","['statistics', 'education', 'learning']"

119471,An example of a Grothendieck topology,"A Grothendieck topology on a category $\mathcal{C}$ with finite limits consists of, for each object $U$ in $\mathcal{C}$ a collection $\text{Cov}(U)$ of sets $\{ U_i \to U \}$ such that Isomorphisms are covers, e.g if $V \to U$ is an isomorphism then $\{ V \to U \} \in \text{Cov}(U)$ Transitivity: If $\{V_i \to U \}$ and $\{V_{ij} \to V_i \}$ are coverings then $\{V_{ij} \to U \}$ is also a covering If $\{U_i \to U \} \in \text{Cov}(U)$ and $V \to U$ a morphism then $\{V \times_U U_i \to V \} \in \text{Cov(V)}$ The claim is that the following is a covering: $\mathcal{C} = \text{Rings}^{\text{op}}$, and coverings are the opposite of collections $\{R \to R_i \}$ where Each $R \to R_i$ is flat If $M$ is an $R$-module such that $M \otimes_R R_i=0$ for all $i$ then $M=0$ (I have interpreted $R \to R_i$ as flat as meaning $R_i$ is flat as an $R$-module) I (think) I have verified the first two conditions (isomorphism and transitivity). For example the second part of transitivity will follow since:
$$
\begin{align}
0 &\simeq M\otimes_{U} V_{ij}\\
 &\simeq M \otimes_{U}\left(U_i \otimes_{U_i}V_{ij}\right) \\
 &\simeq \left(M \otimes_{U} U_i \right) \otimes_{U_i} V_{ij} 
\end{align}$$
which gives that $M \otimes_U U_i=0$ which in turn gives $M=0$ I'm not sure how to interpret the fiber product in item 3. For example I want to show that $M \otimes_V (V \times_U U_i)=0$ gives $M=0$, but I have no idea what the fiber product is in this category, and how it interacts with the tensor product.","['sheaf-theory', 'topos-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'grothendieck-topologies']"

119488,How to show that the entire function $f(z) = z^2 + \cos{z}$ has range all of $\mathbb{C}$?,"I have been thinking about the following exercise from an old complex analysis qualifier exam for some days but I still don't know how to solve it. The problem is as follows: Show that the entire function $f(z) := z^2 + \cos{z}$  has range all of $\mathbb{C}$. At first I thought that maybe I could use Picard's Little Theorem to get a contradiction. I thought that maybe by considering the function $e^{f(z)}$ I could get the contradiction by asssuming that $f(z)$ misses one point so that the exponential would miss two points and that would contradict Picard's Little Theorem, but since the exponential is periodic this argument doesn't work.

119490,How can one find the largest disk about $0$ such that $z^2+z$ is injective?,"I'm trying to find the radius of the largest disk about the origin so that the map $f(z)=z^2+z$ is injective. I know $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1\neq 0$, so there is at least some disk of positive radius where $f(z)$ is injective. Also, $f(0)=f(-1)=0$, so the disk can have radius strictly smaller than $1$. I say if $f(z)=a$ is injective iff $f(z)-a=0$ has at most one root. The roots are 
$$
-\frac{1}{2}\pm\frac{\sqrt{1+4a}}{2}
$$
and thus are point on the opposite side of a circle in the complex plane centered at $-1/2$ with radius $|\sqrt{1+4a}/2|$. I'm stuck here. How can I explicitly find the largest radius of the disk around $0$ so that $f$ is injective on that disk? Thank you.",['complex-analysis']
