1341946,Function that is continuous and its differential is continuous,"Let $ f: \mathbb{R}  \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ . Show that $f$ is continuously differentiable if and only if,  for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ there exists a $l \in \mathbb{R}$ with the property that for all $\epsilon >0$ there exists a $\delta>0$ , such that for all $h,t, \in B(0,\delta)$ the following holds: $$ |f(x+h) -f(x+t) - l(h-t)| \leq \epsilon |h-t| $$ I've been staring at this exercise for way too long and still have no clue on how to proof this. The statement looks very much like the definition of the differential but I don't see how to get both a $h$ and a $t$ in my expression. Furthermore I don't see how the continuously differentiable should be used to proof this property. I tried to use the mean value theorem but this makes it all to confusing for me as I suppose I would need the limit definition but then I don't see how to get rid of it.","['real-analysis', 'derivatives']"
1341958,Proof of the derivative of $\ln(x)$,"I'm trying to prove that $\frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} x}\ln x = \frac{1}{x}$ . Here's what I've got so far: $$
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x}\ln x &= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{\ln(x + h) - \ln(x)}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{\ln(\frac{x + h}{x})}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{\ln(1 + \frac{h}{x})}{h} \\
\end{align}
$$ To simplify the logarithm: $$
\lim_{h\to0}\left (1 + \frac{h}{x}\right )^{\frac{1}{h}} = e^{\frac{1}{x}}
$$ This is the line I have trouble with. I can see that it is true by putting numbers in, but I can't prove it. I know that $e^{\frac{1}{x}} = \lim_{h\to0}\left (1 + h \right )^{\frac{h}{x}}$ , but I can't work out how to get from the above line to that. $$
\lim_{h\to0}\left ( \left (1 + \frac{h}{x}\right )^{\frac{1}{h}}\right )^{h} = e^{\frac{h}{x}}
$$ Going back to the derivative: $$
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x}\ln x &= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{\ln(e^{\frac{h}{x}})}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{\frac{h}{x}\ln(e)}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{h}{x} \div h\\
&= \frac{1}{x} \\
\end{align}
$$ This proof seems fine, apart from the middle step to get $e^{\frac{1}{x}}$ . How could I prove that part?","['calculus', 'solution-verification', 'exponential-function', 'logarithms', 'derivatives']"
1341999,A Taylor series expansion of $e^{ix}$,"In Probability Theory by Athreya and Lahiri, they give a very elegant proof of Central Limit Theorem (The Lindeberg one) wherein they use a lemma: For $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $r \geq 1$, ($i=\sqrt{-1}$ here) $$\left|e^{ix} - \sum_{k=0}^{r-1} \frac{(ix)^k}{k!}\right| \leq \min\left\{\frac{|x|^r}{r!},\frac{2|x|^{r-1}}{(r-1)!}\right\}\quad (1)$$ In the proof of the lemma, they give the following expansion of $e^{ix}$ arguing that it follows from Taylor series. $$e^{ix} = \sum_{k=0}^{r-1} \left[\frac{(ix)^k}{k!}\right] + \frac{(ix)^r}{(r-1)!}\int_0^1(1-u)^re^{iux}du \quad (2)$$ By taking absolute values, they would get $(1)$. What I don't get is how did they arrive at $(2)$ in the first place. I have seen Taylor series (and Taylor's theorem) for real valued functions but not for complex valued functions. Moreover I don't recall an integral being used to approximate the remainder. Hence my question is twofold: 1) Does anyone know the equivalent of a Taylor Theorem for complex functions as above? 2) Is there an alternative way to prove $(1)$ without resorting to Taylor Series? I tried to dominate the remainder terms by a geometric series but that failed. Good references and proofs/hints for this are welcome. Let me know if you need more details. Update1: In my second question, what I meant is ""Is there an alternate way to prove (1)"". You can use Taylor series and find a clever way to bound the higher order terms. As I mentioned, I used a geometric series bound but that didn't work.","['probability-theory', 'taylor-expansion', 'real-analysis']"
1342022,Definition of reducible matrix and relation with not strongly connected digraph,"I connot quite understand the definition of reducible matrix here . We know $A_{n\times n}$ is reducible, when there exists a permutation matrix $\textbf{P}$ such that: $$P^TAP=\begin{bmatrix}X  & Y\\0  & Z\end{bmatrix},$$
where $X$ and $Z$ are both square. I cannot understand: $a_{i_{\alpha}j_{\beta}}=0, \ \ \forall \alpha = 1, \ldots ,\mu,\ \ \text{and} \ \  \beta = 1,\ldots, \nu$.  Could anyone provide a specific example? How can we say if it is the case, then the corresponding digraph is not strongly connected. Here is one answer about this. If strongly connected digraph holds, there exists a path $i_1i_2,\ldots,i_n$. How to say this condition will violate $a_{i_{\alpha}j_{\beta}}=0$? Ex: Consider the strongly connected digraph: $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 1$. $A$ could be chosen as $$A=\begin{bmatrix}0  & 2 & 0\\0  & 0 & 3\\ 4 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$$ I cannot grasp the structure of matrix corresponding to the digraph.","['graph-theory', 'matrices']"

1342056,"Is it possible, that the fist two weak eigenvalues of $-\Delta$ in a bounded domain are equal?","Let $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded domain $\lambda_1$ be the first weak eigenvalue of $-\Delta$ in $\Omega$ $\varphi_1$ be the weak eigenfunction associated with $\lambda_1$ $H:=W_0^{1,2}(\Omega)$ be the Sobolev space $|\;\cdot\;|_p$ be the seminorm $$|u|_p^p:=\int_\Omega|\nabla u|^p\;d\lambda^n\;\;\;\text{for }u:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}\;\text{weakly differentiable}$$ $\left\|\;\cdot\;\right\|_p$ be the $L^p(\Omega)$-norm and $\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle_2$ be the scalar product in $L^2(\Omega)$ From the basic theory of the eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian, one knows that $$\lambda_1=\inf_{H\setminus\left\{0\right\}}R\;\;\;\;\;\text{with }R(u):=\frac{|u|_2^2}{\left\|u\right\|_2^2}\;\;\;\text{for }u\in H\setminus\left\{0\right\}$$ and $\varphi_1$ can be constructed such that $\left\|\varphi_1\right\|_2=1$ $R(\varphi_1)=\lambda_1$ Since different eigenvalues correspond to $L^2$-orthogonal eigenfunctions (with $L^2$-orthogonal gradients), it's plausible to seek for the next eigenfunction $\varphi_2$ in $$U_1:=\left\{u\in H:\langle u,\varphi_1\rangle_2=0 \right\}\;.$$ We may observe, that $U_1$ is the null space of the continuous operator $\left.\langle\;\cdot\;,\varphi\rangle_2\right|_H$. Thus, $H$ is a closed subspace of $H$ and thereby a Hilbert space itself. So, we can apply the same process used to find $(\lambda_1,\varphi_2)$ in order to find $$\lambda_2:=\inf_{U_1\setminus\left\{0\right\}}R$$ and $\varphi_2$. Now, using the same arguments as discussed in a similar question , it's easy to see, that $\lambda_2\ge \lambda_1$ (Please don't get confused with the naming of the $\lambda_i$ in the other question). However, is it possible that we have $\lambda_1=\lambda_2$?","['sobolev-spaces', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'real-analysis', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"
1342062,"What is the probability of winning a best of $1, 3, 5, \cdots$ to infinity?","A shady casino organizes a simple game with rules that follow: 1 die is rolled. If it lands on an even, the house wins. If it lands on an odd, the player wins. However, if the player loses he may take the game to a best of 3. If he wins the best of three, he wins overall. If he loses the best of three, he may take the game to a best of 5 to try and win then. If he loses the best of five, he may take the game to a best of 7, then best of 9, 11, 13 and so on. (In other words, its the kind of gambling trap that is depicted in movies, with some unfortunate person begging for another chance as he gets dragged away by some thugs.) Let $n$ be the total number of games played. If you keep taking the game to a best of the next odd number until you win, all the way to a best of (an odd) infinity, what is the total chance of you winning overall? And for the sake of calculations, let the chance of the player winning be $\dfrac{1}{4}$, and losing be $\dfrac{3}{4}$ due to the house using a weighted die. Is there an actual answer to the question? If so, how? I've started off by looking at infinite series's and permutations (listing the outcomes out as binary numbers, 1=win 0=loss), but I only got so far before getting completely stuck. I thought of splitting it up into the chances of winning the B o $N$ (best of $n$), such that the number of wins is always larger than losses by exactly $1$. This would make it so that I can ignore results with excess wins, and ones with excess losses (as they would eventually be looked at as n increases). (For the sake of clarity, $W$=win $L$=loss) For example: $LWWWW$ (best of 5), can be ignored because it is already accounted for in $LWW$ (best of 3) which results in an overall win and an end to the sequence of games. This would yield: $\displaystyle \binom{n}{\frac{n+1}{2}} \cdot P(W)^\frac{n+1}{2} \cdot P(L)^\frac{n-1}{2}%$ However this only deals with redundant combinations of results, and leaves many redundant permutations of the game results still in, such as any sequence that starts with a win (eg. $WLW$ is also counted even though $W$ (best of $1$) should end the sequence, $LWWLW$ is counted even though $LWW$ (best of 3) should end the sequence). This leads to some tricky permutation maths (I think) that I have scarce ideas on how to do, all of which are beyond me. UPDATE I put together some code to figure out the different ways of winning and a bunch of other related stuff. Unfortunately it starts to take a while after reaching best of 13. Regardless, the total cumulative probability of winning up to a best of 13 (using the weighted die) goes (rounded to 3 d.p.): 0.250 0.297 0.314 0.323 0.327 0.329 0.331 It definitely looks like its tending to a number, but I cant be sure looking at this from a statistical standpoint. I also made the program output the number of useful permutations (ie. not starting with a win nor a sequence that leads to an overall win of a smaller 'best of' round) for each 'best of' up to 13. They go: 1 1 2 5 14 42 132 These numbers are consistent with the permutations I wrote down and checked by hand (well, okay I gave up after best of 9, 42 11-letter-long sequences is a bit crazy). All of these statistics aside, i'm still looking for some logical way to do this. Maybe these numbers would help?","['probability', 'catalan-numbers']"

1342269,Picking edges from a connected graph so that any vertex is incident with an odd number of those edges,"Suppose you are given a connected graph G having an even number of vertices.   Show that you can select a set $E$ of edges from this graph so that any vertex in G is incident with exactly an odd number of these edges. First observation is that once you have selected a set $E$, the unselected edges don't really matter much. They only matter because we need the graph to be connected. So, we can remove a number of edges of this graph until we get a tree. If we can create a set $E$ using the edges of this tree satisfying the required conditions, then this $E$ will also satisfy the conditions for the original graph. So, to simplify things, assume we have a tree with an even number of vertices. This tree must have leaves. It is necessary that $E$ must contain the edges incident with these leaves. Now I am stuck.

If $B=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i$, prove that $\overline{B}\supset \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty \overline{A_i}.$ Show, by an example, that this inclusion can be proper. Proof: We'll prove that $\left(\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i}\right)^c\subset \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty \overline{A_i}\right)^c.$ Let $x\in\left(\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i}\right)^c$ then $x\notin\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i}=\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)\cup\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)'$. Hence $x\not\in \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i$ and $x\not\in \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)'$ then $x\notin A_i$ for any  $i\geqslant 1$ and $x$ is no limit point of $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i$. Then exists deleted neighborhood of point $x$ such that $U'(x)\cap\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)=\varnothing$ then $U'(x)\cap A_i=\varnothing$ for all $i\geqslant 1$. Hence $x\notin A_i$ and $x\notin A_i'$ for all $i$. Then $x\notin \overline{A_i}$ for all $i\geqslant 1$ and $x\notin \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty \overline{A_i}$. Then $x\in \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty \overline{A_i}\right)^c$. Therefore, $\left(\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i}\right)^c\subset \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty \overline{A_i}\right)^c.$ QED My example is such: Let $A_i=(-\infty; -1/i)\cup(1/i; +\infty)$ then $\overline{A_i}=(-\infty; -1/i]\cup[1/i; +\infty)$. Then $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty \overline{A_i}=\mathbb{R^1}\setminus\{0\}$ but $\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i}=\overline{\mathbb{R^1}\setminus \{0\}}=\mathbb{R^1}$.

1342427,"If a function is left- and right-differentiable everywhere, how much can the one-sided derivatives disagree?","Just for fun, I was proving some results about convex functions the other day. I was able to show that for a convex set $E\subseteq\Bbb R,$ if $f:E\to\Bbb R$ is convex, then $f$ is left- and right-differentiable (and so continuous) on the interior of $E$ (though it needn't even be continuous at any boundary points contained in $E$).

Given an open convex subset $E\subseteq\Bbb R$ and a (not necessarily convex) function $f:E\to\Bbb R$ such that $f$ is left- and right- differentiable at every point of $E,$ can we conclude that $f$ fails to be differentiable at no more than countably-many points of $E,$ or do we need more information about $f$ to get there?

Base case: The statement is true when n=2, since:
$$I=\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 \end{array} \right), XY^T=\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
x_1y_1 & x_1y_2 \\
x_2y_1 & x_2y_2 \end{array} \right)$$ and $|I+XY^T|=\begin{vmatrix}
x_1y_1+1 & x_1y_2\\ x_2y_1 & x_2y_2+1
\end{vmatrix}$ When we expand the determinant, we get: $(x_1y_1+1)(x_2y_2+1)-x_1y_2x_2y_1= 1+(x_1y_1x_2y_2+x_1y_1+x_2y_2-x_1y_2x_2y_1)=1+(x_1y_1+x_2y_2)=1+Y^TX$ 2. induction hypothesis: Suppose it's true for the value $n-1$ and now I want to prove it's true for n. 3. The inductive step: $det(I+XY^T)=x_1y_1+x_2y_2+...+x_{n-1}y_{n-1}+x_ny_n + 1$ And here is where i pretty much get stuck. I don't know where to go from here. It's kinda hard for me to grasp the idea behind mathematical induction. I don't really know what to do when I come to this step. What can I do to finish the proof? (well, if what I have done so far is correct, that is).","['determinant', 'linear-algebra', 'proof-writing']"

$$\frac{1}{{x^2-x+1}}=\frac{1}{i \sqrt{3}}\left(\frac{1}{ \left(x-\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\right)}-\frac{1}{ \left(x-\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\right)}\right)$$ then it seems Mathematica can handle the resulting integrals. It's also easy to note that $$\frac{1}{i \sqrt{3}}\int_0^1 \frac{(1-2x)\log \left(x-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i \sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \log \left(x-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)}{ x(1-x)} \, dx=0$$

$$ \int_0^1 \frac{\text{Li}_2\left(x-x^2\right)}{x^2-x+1} \, dx$$
$$=\frac{i}{\sqrt{3}}\int_0^1 \frac{ (1-2 x) \log ^2\left(x-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)}{ x-x^2} \, dx-\frac{i}{\sqrt{3}}\int_0^1 \frac{ (1-2 x) \log ^2\left(x-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)}{ x-x^2} \, dx$$
$$=\frac{2i}{\sqrt{3}}\int_0^1 \frac{ (1-2 x) \log ^2\left(x-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)}{ x-x^2} \, dx$$
where the last equality is simply got by using the variable change $x\mapsto 1-x$. EDIT : Using the idea of dilogarithm reflection formula, we get that $$\int_0^1 \frac{\text{Li}_2\left(x^2-x+1\right)}{x^2-x+1} \, dx=\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \int_{-\pi/6}^{\pi/6} \text{Li}_2\left(\frac{3 \sec ^2(x)}{4}\right) \, dx$$

Now defining actions of $u_i$ on $Q_j$ $(i,j\in \{1,2\})$ as following- $$x_j^{u_i}=x_j,\\y_j^{u_i}=y_j^{24}\\ z_j^{u_i}=z_j^{24}$$ Now w.r.t this action, we can define semidirect products $Q_i \rtimes \langle u_j\rangle$ and hence it makes sense to make groups $$G_1=Q_1 \rtimes \langle u_1\rangle\times Q_2 \rtimes \langle u_2\rangle\\G_2=Q_1 \rtimes \langle u_2\rangle\times Q_2 \rtimes \langle u_1\rangle$$ Now I have to prove that $G_1\ncong G_2$, but their rational algebras are isomorphic. Now both $G_1$ and $G_2$ has same order i.e. $125\times 125\times 8=125000$. How should I go about proving $G_1 \ncong G_2$? What I know, is that by defining $y_i^{x_i}=y_iz_i^{-1}$ and $z_i^{x_i}=y^{-1}z^{-1}y$ we can see that $Q_i= \langle y_i,z_i \rangle \rtimes \langle x_i \rangle$. Now, To Realize- $G_i'=\langle y_1,z_1\rangle \times \langle y_2,z_2\rangle$ and $(G_i)^{(5)}=\langle z_2\rangle$. Now,  calculating by explicitly writing $[a,b]$ for any two arbitrary elements of $G_i$ is a very tedious process, and while trying that I still could not see how $x_i's$ got eliminated and $[a,b]\in \langle y_1,z_1\rangle \times \langle y_2,z_2\rangle$. Is there a shorter method? If suppose we prove the "" To Realize "" part , then If $G_1 \cong G_2$, it must imply $C_{G_1}(z_2) \cong C_{G_2}(z_2)$. Now it is not tough to check that $C_{G_1}(z_2)=Q_1\langle u_1\rangle \times Q_2$ and $C_{G_2}(z_2)=Q_1\langle u_2\rangle \times Q_2 \langle u_1^{2}\rangle$. Now Sylow $2$-subgroup of $C_{G_1}(z_2)=Q_1\langle u_1\rangle \times Q_2$ and $C_{G_2}(z_2)=Q_1\langle u_2\rangle \times Q_2 \langle u_1^{2}\rangle$ are both of order $4$ but  former is cyclic i.e. $\langle u_1 \rangle \times  \langle 1 \rangle$ and latter is non-cyclic i.e. $\langle u_2 \rangle \times \langle u_1^2 \rangle$. Thus contradicts $C_{G_1}(z_2) \cong C_{G_2}(z_2)$, hence we prove that $G_1 \ncong G_2$ Now, all my trouble lies in To Realize part. Is there a better way to calculate $G_i'$ and $(G_i)^{(5)}$. Now, Passman has proved that for any field $K$, group algebras $KG_1 \cong KG_2$. The proof is very tedious and hard, I will be drowning in that soon, but before that I was wondering if there is some field, preferably of characteristic $0$, may be $\Bbb{Q}$ or $\Bbb{C}$, for which two group algebras ($KG_1$ and $KG_2$, for above mentioned groups) are  isomorphic, is realized quickly or proved with more ease then picking up the case of arbitrary field.

1342853,Aronszajn lines,"Exercise 32 of chapter 2 of Kunen (1980) tells me to show that there exists a total ordering with no $\omega_1$ strictly increasing/decreasing sequencies such that every separable subspace is nowhere dense (that is, the interior of it's closure is empty).

If $f(x) \in P$ is any polynomial then in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ there is $q(x),r(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $f(x)=q(x)m(x)+r(x) \implies r(x)=f(x)-q(x)m(x)$ with $r=0$ or the degree of r less than the degree of $m$ . Letting $L$ be the LCM of the denominators of the coefficients we have $Lr(x)=Lf(x)-Lq(x)m(x) \implies Lr(x) \in P$ . This is where the problem is. I want to claim that $Lr(x) \in P \implies L\in P$ or $r(x) \in P$ . Obviously this then forces $r(x) \in P$ by the intersection assumption which then forces $r=0$ . The problem is that $r(x)$ is not necessarily in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ so the prime condition on $P$ does not necessarily apply here.

Now my confusion arises from the fact that in the texts that I've read, the author introduces a curve $\gamma :(a,b)\subset\mathbb{R}\rightarrow M$ that is parametrized in terms of some real parameter $t\in (a,b)$, with $a<0<b$ and $\gamma (0)=p\in M$. From this a tangent vector at a point $p\in M$ can be defined in a coordinate independent manner, in terms of the directional derivative of function $f:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, as $$\frac{df}{dt}\bigg\vert_{p}$$ 
I know that if one introduces a coordinate chart $(U,\phi)$ (where $p\in U$) then the curve can be represented in terms of the local coordinates, $$(\phi\circ\gamma)(t)=\gamma (x^{1}(t),\ldots ,x^{n}(t))$$ So what distinguishes a parameter $t$ (parametrizing the curve $\gamma$) from a coordinate?

Part C is solved with the theorem: In a triangle, sides opposite to larger angles are longer. Suppose A $\rightarrow$ C and B$\rightarrow$D and their trajectories intersect, this implies four inequalities with the sides and diagonals of $ABCD$. And with the above theorem we prove that the sum of the angles is $<360$. Contradiction. EDIT 2: The best solutions seem to be from Maciek for Part B and Micah for part A.

1343589,Definition of regular functions on a projective variety,"I'm trying to read Algebraic Geometry : a First Course by Joe Harris. In Lecture 2, p. 20, he defines a regular function on an open set $U$ of quasi-projective variety $X$ as a function such that if $U_i$ is the standard open cover of $\mathbb{P}^n$ by open sets isomorphic to affine $n$-space (although I don't think isomorphism has been defined at this moment of the book), the restrictions of $f$ to $U \cap U_i$ is regular. Then he says that it should be noted that this definition is independent of the choice of cover by a lemma which states that the ring of regular functions on a distinguished open subset $U_f$ is the $A(X)[1/f]$, where $A(X)$ denotes the ring of regular functions on $X$. I have two questions: Why does he define things on an open subset of a quasi-projective variety? Isn't an open subset of a quasi-projective variety a quasi-projective variety itself? How is the fact he mentions about independence of cover proved? I can't see the link with the lemma (and have the impression I can prove it without using it, which is probably false).

Unfortunately several key pieces of machinery, such as Hamilton's least action principle and Noether's theorem, unsurprisingly require differential structure on the manifold of possible physical configurations. Hence my question: how much differential geometry (or even Riemannian geometry) can one do by putting additional structure on manifolds $M$ locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}^n$? Even for $n=1$, I foresee complications, since smooth functions $\gamma:\mathbb{Q}\to \mathbb{Q}$ can be poorly behaved, such as 
$$\gamma(x) = \begin{cases}0, & x<\sqrt{2}\\ 1, & x >\sqrt{2}\end{cases}$$

If this definition is indeed correct, then what would be the definition of a  locally bounded stochastic process $X\colon [0, T] \times \mathbb{\Omega} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$?

EDIT:
After going through O. Kallenberg's Foundations of Modern Probability (Chapted 6, page 97), I have discovered that the range for a stopping time is defined to be the closure of the time domain. In this case it will simply be the set $[0, T]$. This then begs the question of how we can prove that a stochastic process is locally bounded. The usual technique involves considering a sequence of so-called first exit-times i.e. times at which the stochastic process first exceeds the value $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Unfortunately, this doesn't quite work in this case because these stopping times will converge $P$-a.s. to $\infty$.

If $f_n: \Omega \to X$ is a sequence of $(\cal F , B$$_X)$-measurable functions and if $f_n \to f$ pointwise, then is it true that $f$ is $(\cal F , B$$_X)$-measurable? Of course, we know it is true if $X = \Bbb R$ with the usual topology. This is just a standard result in real analysis which can be proved easily using the order structure of $\Bbb R$. I am more interested in what happens when $X$ is not some Euclidean Space. I claim it is still true for metrizable $X$. Indeed, supposes $d$ induces the topology of $X$, and $C \subset X$ is closed. For $\varepsilon >0$, let $C_{\varepsilon} = \{x \in X: d(x,C) < \varepsilon \}$, which is open. Then $$f^{-1}(C) = \bigcap_{n \in \Bbb N} \bigcup_{N \in \Bbb N} \bigcap_{ k \geq N} f_k^{-1}\big(C_{2^{-n}}\big)$$ which is in $\cal F$. Since preimages of closed sets are in $\cal F$, it easily follows $f$ is $(\cal F, B$$_X)$-measurable. I guess the crucial thing here was that any closed set in a metrizable space is $G_{\delta}$. Does the result still hold for any first countable Hausdorff space? What about uniformizable spaces? I guess the answer would probably be no if $X$ is not Hausdorff since the limit function wouldn't necessarily be unique.
