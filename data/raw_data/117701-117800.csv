1742287,Congruent matrices - why do we require invertiblility?,"If $A$, $B$ $\in K^{n \times n}$ are $n \times n$ matrices over a field $K$, then we say that $A$ and $B$ are congruent if there exists an invertible $P \in GL(n, K)$ such that $B = P^TAP$, where $P^T$ denotes the transpose of $P$. Why do we require $P$ to be invertible? Congruence of matrices is usually compared to similarity of matrices, where we say that $A$ and $B$ are similar if there exists an invertible $P \in GL(n, K)$ such that $B = P^{-1}AP$. Here it is obvious why we need $P$ to be invertible. However, in the case of congruent matrices, the invertibility requirement doesn't seem to be obvious.","['matrices', 'matrix-congruences', 'linear-algebra', 'inverse']"
1742363,"Infinite tetration, convergence radius","I got this problem from my teacher as a optional challenge. I am open about this being a given problem, however it is not homework. The problem is stated as follows. Assume we have an infinite tetration as follows $$x^{x^{x^{.^{.^.}}}} \, = \, a$$ With a given $a$ find $x$ . The next part of the problem was to discuss the convergence radius of a. If a is too big or too small the tetration does not converge. Below is my humble stab at the problem. My friend said you would have to treat the tetration as a infinite series, and therefore could not perform algebraic manipulations on it before it is know whether it converges or diverges. However my attempt is to first do some algebraic steps, then discuss the convergence radius. I) Initial discussion At the start it is obvious that the tetration converges when $a=1$ (just set $x=1$ )
Now after some computer hardwork it seems that the tetration fails to converge when a is roughly larger than 3. II) Algebraic manipulation $$ x^{x^{x^{.^{.^.}}}} \, = \, a$$ This is the same as $$ x^a \, = \, a$$ $$ \log_a(x^a) \, = \, \log_a(a)$$ $$ \log_a(x) \, = \, \frac{1}{a}$$ $$ x \, = \, a^{\frac{1}{a}}$$ Now, if we let $a=2$ then $x = \sqrt{2}$ . After some more computational work, this seems to be correct, which makes me believe this formula is correct. III) Discsussion about convergence By looking at the derivative of $ \displaystyle \large a^{\frac{1}{a}} $ we see that the maxima occurs when $a=e$ , which also seems to correspond to the inital computational work.
Now I think, that the minima of $\displaystyle \large a^{1/a}$ is zero by looking at its graph, studying its derivative and the endpoints. So that my ""guess"" or work shows that it converges when $$ a \in [0 \, , \,  1/e] $$ VI) My questions Can my algebraic manipulations be justified? They seem rather sketchy
taking the a`th logarithm and so on . (Although they seem to ""magically""
give out the right answer) By looking at Wikipedia it seems that the tetration converge when $$ a \in \left[ 1/e \, , \, e \right] $$ This is almost what I have, why is my lower bound wrong? How can  I find the correct lower bound?","['tetration', 'real-analysis', 'convergence-divergence', 'exponentiation']"

1742467,Non-orientable manifolds and mod 2 homology,"I was reading the wonderful book ""The wild world of 4-manifolds"" by Alexandru Scorpan and I found the following sentence: ""We are able to orient $\mathfrak{M}$ (else we only get modulo 2 invariants)."" Here $\mathfrak{M}$ is the moduli space of instantons on a four-manifold. The thing is that I have seen similar statements before in the literature. These statements seem to associate singular homology $H^{\ast}(M,\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ with $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ coefficients to non-orientable manifolds and singular homology $H^{\ast}(M,\mathbb{Z})$ with $\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients to orientable manifolds. However I don't understand this. Certainly one can define $H^{\ast}(M,\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ for any manifold $M$, oriented or not, and one can define $H^{\ast}(M,\mathbb{Z})$ again for any manifold, oriented or not. So why are the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ coefficients related to non-orientable manifolds? Thanks.","['algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"

1742524,Numerical force due to Lennard Jones potential,"I am stuck with a problem related to simulating a Lennard-Jones system. The Lennard Jones potential is  $U(r) = 4\epsilon [ \frac{\sigma^{12}}{r^{12}} - \frac{\sigma^6}{r^6} ]$. Hence the force will be $F(r)=-\frac{\partial{U(r)}}{\partial{r}}= 48 \epsilon [ \frac{\sigma^{12}}{r^{13}} - \frac{\sigma^6}{r^7}]$. But to do computer simulation I need to know the force componentwise i.e. all the three components $F_x$, $F_y$, $F_z$ are to be known. Is the $x$ component simply $F_x = 48 \epsilon [ \frac{\sigma^{12}}{\Delta x^{13}} - \frac{\sigma^6}{\Delta x^7}]$, where $\Delta x$ is the distance between the pair of particles concerned?

We move on to substituting n for k (assuming k is true) like so: $$\sum_{i=0}^k \binom{k}{i} = 2^k$$
If k is true, k + 1 should be true as well. So we must prove k + 1 now:
$$\sum_{i=0}^{k+1} \binom{k+1}{i} = 2^{k+1}$$ This is the part I am having trouble on. Are all my steps correct so far? If so, how do I finish proving this problem?","['combinatorics', 'probability-theory', 'induction', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1742562,"How to formalize a variable-binding operator, such like $\frac{d}{dx}$?","How to formalize a variable-binding operator, such like $\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$?
For instance, I think we should treat $\frac{d}{dx}$ as a higher-order function of $x$, returning a function that takes it argument(usually an expression of its letter be mentioned, say $x$, e.g. $x^2+1$) to its corresponding expression(e.g. $2x$). Few examples are: $(\frac{d}{dx})(3x^2+4x)=6x+4$ $(\frac{d}{dz})(3z^2+4z)=6z+4$ $(D_y)\cos y=-\sin y$     ($D_y$ is equivalent to $\frac{d}{dy}$) Mathematicians, or logicians, often say that $\frac{d}{dx}$ is a so-called variable-binding operator, which means the letter(i.e. variable) specified in the $d(\cdot)$ is just a independent, place-holder variable, being bound by the symbol, and does not be affected by the stand-in variables outside. So one is allowable to write an expression like defining $f(x)=\frac{d}{dx}(x^2)$, and get $f(10)=(2x)|_{x=10}=20$, not $f(10)=\frac{d}{d10}(10^2)$. The latter is non-sense. In a normal way undergraduate students learn about a function definition , there is no such way to make a variable-binding mechanism in the plain function definition(via n-ary relation ). There is no place for us to say(specify) in the definition of a function that the function should hold its arguments being unevaluated and independent! The another related operator is $\sum$, such like $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{10}i^2$, is also have the function(no pun intended) of binding variable. So, my question is, how to formalize such things? Is it possible? Is it been discussed by logicians yet? It there a standard way that is accepted by people?","['formal-languages', 'predicate-logic', 'logic', 'functions']"

$$\int_0^1x\;dx\qquad\text{and}\qquad\int_0^1x^2\;dx$$
Knowing full well that the fundamental theorem of calculus was on the itinerary, I decided to give them an appreciation for the result by proving a much more general result (still using rectangles). Namely I showed:
$$\int_a^b x^n\;dx=\frac{b^{n+1}}{n+1}-\frac{a^{n+1}}{n+1}$$
This can be calculated in a way that parallels the calculation of the above examples. As long as one knows that
$$\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1^n+2^n+\cdots+m^n}{\frac{m^{n+1}}{n+1}}=1$$
one is able to proceed. Granted, I had to give a loose argument for why this is true, but knowing that
$$1+2+\cdots+n=\frac{1}{2}n^2+\cdots \qquad\text{ and } 1^2+2^2+ \cdots +n^2 = \frac{1}{3}n^3 + \cdots$$
The pattern seems plausible. I thought this was cute, so I also gave them the proof that
$$\int_0^x\cos t\;dt=\sin x$$
which can be derived with rectangles using Dirichlet's identity:
$$1+2\sum_{k=1}^n\cos(kx)=\frac{\sin\left([n+1/2]x\right)}{\sin(x/2)}$$
To be sure, many students found this un-amusing, but they all greatly affirmed that they were glad to have the fundamental theorem after it was delivered to them. So goal achieved. But I was intrigued by how many other integrals could I evaluate using the naive method?
$$\int_0^x e^t\;dt$$
isn't too bad as it's a geometric sum. The next thing in line was, of course,
$$\int_1^x\ln t\; dt$$
This is where I ran into trouble. I had been using the fact that
$$\int_a^b f(x)\;dx=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{k=1}^n f\left(a+k\frac{b-a}{n}\right)\frac{b-a}{n}$$
for integrable $f$ to do the fore-going facts. But this approach seems intractable for $$\int_1^x\ln t\; dt$$
At least, I don't have the requisite limit knowledge or 'algebraic trick' needed to proceed. I was able to calculate this with the fact that
$$\int_0^{\ln x}e^t\;dt+\int_1^x\ln t\;dt=x\ln x$$
which is a relationship that can be proven naively. But I was hoping someone here knew the 'trick' needed to calculate
$$\int_1^x \ln t\;dt$$
without the fundamental theorem or relying on the insight to reflect the area in question. Any help is appreciated.","['alternative-proof', 'calculus', 'limits']"

Recall that the subword complexity function $\sigma_{v} = \sigma : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ of an infinite word $v$ is the function on $\mathbb{N}$ that maps $n \in \mathbb{N}$ to the number of distinct factors of $v$ of length $n$. Given the simple definition of the binary word $w$, it is natural to ask: what is $\sigma_{w}$? It is not obvious to me how to find a closed-form evaluation of the sequence $$(\sigma_{w}(n) )_{n \in \mathbb{N}} = (2, 3, 5, 8, 12, \ldots),$$ since proving a statement of the form $\sigma_{w}(n) = m$ for fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (where $m \in \mathbb{N}$) appears to be nontrivial in general. However, for certain 'small' values of $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the evaluation of $\sigma_{w}(n)$ is relatively trivial. For example, using induction, it is easily seen that $\sigma_{w}(2)=3$.

1743298,How to find the largest possible value when moving values between N nodes,"I stumbled upon an interesting combinatorial question while playing Magic: the Gathering. Take N nodes on a complete graph, each node with an assigned value. Each node's value begins at 1, and may increase as the game progresses. Each move of the game consists of a node adding its value to the value of one other node that it's connected to. (The source node does not reduce its value after this operation; values can never decrease.) After one move in each direction along a graph edge (two moves in total), that edge is deleted and no more moves can be made along that edge.  The goal is to end up with the greatest possible total value among all nodes after all moves have been made. The total number of moves in the game will be (N choose 2) * 2. (The number of edges times 2, since each edge allows one move in each direction.) For example, consider N=2. The starting configuration is A=1, B=1. To begin the game, Node A adds its value to node B, resulting in A=1, B=2. Then node B adds its value to node A, resulting in A=3, B=2. The game is now over, and the final score is 5. The only other possibility is to have node B move first, which simply results in A=2, B=3 and the same final score. However the problem becomes greatly more complex when more nodes are added. The complexity of the game increases extremely quickly, making brute-force approaches infeasible. So far, the maxima I have achieved for various N through experimentation are: N=1: 1
N=2: 5
N=3: 29
N=4: 249
N=5: 3866 But I am by no means convinced these are the best answers (at least for N>2). There are a number of simple instruction sets that can do well, such as ""always move away from the node with the highest value to the node with the highest value among its legal choices"". This isn't necessarily optimal though, and I'm curious if there is a simple algorithm to maximize the final value that works on all N.","['combinatorics', 'graph-theory']"

The proof that my TA posted online was this: If the differential $DF|_{(u,v)}: T_{(u,v)} \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow T_{F(u,v)} \mathbb{R}^4$ is non degenerate then $F$ defines a smooth immersion of $\mathbb{R}^2$ into $\mathbb{R}^4$ and hence $F$ defines local diffeomorphisms for the image $M$. To verify that $F$ is a smooth immersion, note that $\mathrm{rank}(F) = 2 = \dim(\mathbb{R}^2)$. Because $F$ is globally injective, then it is actually a global diffeomorphism onto its image $M$. Hence $M$ is a smooth $2$-manifold. I am struggling to understand this proof. I get why $F$ is a smooth immersion, but I don't get why it defines local diffeomorphisms. It seems as if he is applying the inverse function theorem to $F: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^4$, but he can't do this because the domain and co-domain do not have the same dimension.

1743631,How to calculate intersection and union of probabilities?,"lets say I have a switch A with 3 legs, each leg has 0.8 chance to be connected (and then electricity will flow), we need only 1 leg connected for A to transfer the electricity (so sorry I didn't explain it that well I'm having hard time to translate this problem) So I calculated the chance of A to transfer electricity by doing $1-(0.2)^3$  which is $124\over125$ which I think is true. The problem is I wanted to say that A will transfer elecricity only if 1 of his legs will be connected so its like saying $0.8 + 0.8 + 0.8$ which is obviously wrong(over $1$) so I used the weird formula that says to do like this: $0.8 + 0.8 + 0.8 - (0.8)^2 -(0.8)^2 - (0.8)^2 + (0.8)^3 = {124\over125}$ too. My only problem is that I didnt understand why I had to use that formula and why I could multiple probabilities for the intersection but couldn't just sum them for the union.

1743649,Why is a differential equation a submanifold of a jet bundle?,"I'm reading The geometry of jet bundles by D.J Saunders and struggle with the definition of a differential equation 6.2.23. on page 203. First of all, Saunders introduces a differential operator determined by a bundle map : Let $(E, \pi, M)$ and $(H, \rho, M)$ be bundles and let $(f, id_M)$ a bundle morphism between the jet-bundle $J^k(\pi)$ and $H$. This means, that $f: J^k(\pi) \to H$ is a smooth map that respects the projections. The differential operator determined f is the map $D_f: \Gamma_{loc} (\pi) \to \Gamma_{loc}(\rho)$ taking a local section $\phi$ of $\pi$ to the local section $D_f(\phi)$ of $\rho$ with $D_f(\phi) (p) = f(j^k_p \phi)$. For a differential operator $D_f$ determined by $f$ and a local section $\chi$ of $\rho$ he than defines the differential equation determindes by $D_f$ and $\chi$ to be the submanifold
$$S_{f; \chi} = \lbrace j^k_p \phi: f(j^k_p \phi) = \chi (p) \rbrace \subset J^k \pi $$ I can see, why the definition of the set $S_{f; \chi}$ defines a differential equation in a rather intuitive way. Now my question is: Why is this set in deed a submanifold? I guess there is a nice widly known theorem on the core of the theory on fibre bundles which I unfortunatly do not know.

1743844,Characterizations of $e^x$,"I've been thinking about the following problem for a while: (AFAIK) the 'exponential function', $e^x$ can be characterized as the unique solution to the following differential equation with initial conditions specified: $f'(x) = f(x)$ , $f(0) = 1$. Prior to learning this, I thought of $e^x$ in the following way: I first thought of $e$ to be the supremum of the sequence $u_n =(1+ \frac{1}{n})^n$, and since $u_n$ can be shown to be monotone increasing and bounded above, this is the same as defining it to be $e = \lim_{n \to \infty} (1+\frac{1}{n})^n$ I then showed that via this characterization, we can also show that $e= lim_{h \to 0} (1+h)^{\frac{1}{h}}$, which allows us to show that the function $e^x$ has a nice property, namely, that its own derivative is itself, which immediately makes it $C^{\infty}$. Using this, as well as the Lagrange form of the remainder for the Taylor polynomial, I was then able to show that $\displaystyle e^x = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^i}{i!}$ I then wanted to try and show that the characterization of $e^x$ as the unique function that satisfies: $f'(x) = f(x)$ , $f(0) = 1$. and the characterization I previously thought about were equivalent. So I started with showing that $f'(x) = f(x)$ , $f(0) = 1$ implied my previous characterization, as my previous characterization is a solution to $f'(x) = f(x)$ , $f(0) = 1$ I noted that as $f$ was defined at $0$, and that $f$ had a first derivative at $0$, it can be inferred that $f$ is continuous at $0$, and exists in some neighborhood, lets say $(-k,k)$ of $0$. Now I also realized if $f$ is a solution to this differential equation, it is $C^{\infty}$, and all of its derivatives must exist in the neighborhood $(-k,k)$ of $0$. Then I applied the Lagrange form of the remainder to this function to show that the error as this function is approximated with $\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{x^i}{i!}$ tends to $0$ as $n \to \infty$. So, in $(-k,k)$, the function must be $e^x$, as $e^x$ can also be made arbitrarily close to $\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{x^i}{i!}$ given $n$ large enough. Okay, so I understand that $f(x) = e^x$ in $(-k,k)$, and I realize that $\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^i}{i!}$ has an interval of convergence of $\mathbb{R}$, where it is uniformly convergent, and so $f$ even has a smooth uniformly convergent continuation outside $(-k,k)$, which is also just $e^x$. But this is what I am struggling to understand, why does $f$ need to be defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, as in, why does $f$ need to actually be the same function as $e^x$, same domain and all? Surely $f$ could be defined on any arbitrarily small interval $(-k,k)$ around zero, and still fulfill its defining differential equation, but not be defined outside of $(-k,k)$, so while within $(-k,k)$ it is $e^x$, it may not exist outside $(-k,k)$ as itself, but only as a smooth unique continuation of itself (namely, $e^x$). Another problem I have related to this is when talking about solutions to the following differential equation (again with specified initial conditions): $f''(x) = -kf(x)$, $f(0) = A$, $f'(0) = 0$, I realize that $f(x)$ is essentially the cosine function, and that this is in fact the characterizing equation of simple harmonic motion, which a pendulum approximates when it swings back and forth with small incline angle. I could show this in a similar way, by talking about how $f$ is again $C^{\infty}$ and then showing that within whatever interval its defined in its equal to a function that is basically cosine, but now my question is, what makes us believe that $f(x)$, which can be thought of as the displacement of a particle doing simple harmonic motion, is defined outside a small open interval containing $t=0$? How can we model these particles with cosine in real life if you can't directly conclude all solutions to $f''(x) = -kf(x)$, $f(0) = A$ have to be defined themselves on all of $\mathbb{R}$ (and not as themselves on $(-k,k)$ and then as a unique smooth continuation (cosine) on $\mathbb{R} \setminus (-k,k)$).

$$S(n) = \sum_{m=1}^{\pi(n)} \prod_{k=1}^m \left(1-\frac{1}{p_k}\right)$$ Specifically, what are the asymptotics of $S(n)$ as a function of $n$? Background: this comes up in the analysis of a naive algorithm for generating all primes up to $n$, which is to sequentially try dividing each number by all known smaller primes: The most naive algorithm is for each $m \le n$, divide it (i.e. just find remainder) by each number $d \le m$, and declare $m$ prime if all those remainders are nonzero. This performs $\sim m$ arithmetic operations (finding remainders) for each $m$, so overall it would perform a number of remainder-operations proportional to $1 + 2 + \dots + m + \dots + n = \Theta(n^2)$. Somewhat better is this algorithm, which for each $m \le n$, divides it by each prime $p \le m$ until a zero remainder is found: so all numbers $m$ are tried dividing by $2$, the numbers divided by $3$ would be those that survive (the odd numbers), the numbers divided by $5$ would be the numbers divisible neither by $2$ nor $3$ (thus $\left(1 - \frac12\right)\left(1 - \frac13\right)$ of the numbers), etc. I'm fairly sure this would be worse than the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which does about $\left(\frac{n}{2} + \frac{n}{3} + \frac{n}{5} + \dots + \frac{n}{p_{\pi(n)}}\right) = \Theta(n \log \log n)$ arithmetic operations (none of them division operations actually).

1744144,Integrating over a sequence of sets $A_n$ with $\mu(A_n)\to0$,"I am going through the proof of the following. Let $(X,\mu)$ be a measure space and $f\colon X\to\overline{\mathbb R}$ be a measurable function with finite integral. If $A_1,A_2,\dots$ are $\mu$-measurable and $\lim_{n\to\infty}\mu(A_n)=0$, then $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{A_n}f\,d\mu=0.$$ Proof. Let $E_N=\{x\mid f(x)\leq N\}$ and define $f_N=\chi_{E_N}f$. Clearly
  $f_N\leq f$ and since $f$ has finite integral it is finite a.e., and
  it follows that $\lim_{N\to\infty} f_N=f$ a.e.; then,
  $\lim_{N\to\infty}(f-f_N)=0$ a.e.. Now $f-f_N$ is dominated by
  $|f|+|f_N|$ which has finite integral by additivity and hence by the
  DCT we get $\int (f-f_N)\,d\mu\to0$ as $N\to\infty$. Now by additivity and the fact that $f_N\leq N$ for all $N$ we have 
  $$\int_{A_n}f\,d\mu=\int_{A_n}(f-f_N)\,d\mu+\int_{A_n} f_N\,d\mu\leq

\int(f-f_N)\, d\mu$ gives $$\int_{A_n}f\,d\mu\leq 0+\infty\cdot\mu(A_n).$$ Taking $n\to\infty$ gives the result because $\infty\cdot 0=0$. Now I don't really see how the last line proves anything. How do we know that $f$ is not negative? As I see, we have only shown that the limit is not positive. It also makes me a little uncomfortable that we write $\infty\cdot\mu(A_n)$, I mean I know that in the extended reals $0\cdot \infty=0$ but is this really rigorous?

1744160,Evaluate $\lim _{x\to \pi }\left(\frac{\sin x}{\pi ^2-x^2}\right)$ without L'Hopital or Taylor series,"I want to evaluate $$\lim _{x\to \pi }\left(\frac{\sin x}{\pi ^2-x^2}\right)$$ without using L'Hopital's rule or Taylor series. My thinking process was something like this: in order to get rid of the undefined state, I need to go from $\sin x$ to $\cos x$. I tried this substitution: $t = \frac{\pi}{2}-x$ which gets me to $\cos t$, but I get: $$\lim _{x\to -\frac{\pi}{2} }\left(\frac{\cos t}{\pi ^2-(\pi^2-t)}\right)$$ which also evaluates to $0/0$. Then I tried this: $\lim _{x\to \pi }\left(\frac{\sin x}{(\pi-x)(\pi+x)}\right) = \lim _{x\to \pi }\left(\frac{\sin x}{(\pi-x)2\pi}\right)$ which also gets me nowhere. The fact that $\sin(\pi-x) = \sin x$ also doesn't help because the substitution would lead to $\sin 0 = 0$. The correct solution is $\frac{1}{2\pi}$ Can somebody help me?","['trigonometry', 'limits-without-lhopital', 'limits']"

$T(b_1,b_2,b_3,...,b_n,...) = (b_1,

deﬁnes a bounded linear operator $T : (ℓ^∞,∥·∥_∞)→(ℓ^∞,∥·∥_∞)$. Proving that it is linear is easy. Need help with the bounded part. But it seems obviously true: If it is bounded then $\exists C \ge 0$ such that $\|Tx\|_{\infty} \le C \|x\|_{\infty}$ for all $x \in X$. We can see that $\|Tx\|=\|b_n/n\|=\sup_{n \in \mathbb N}|b_n/n| \leq \|b_n\|=\sup_{n \in \mathbb N} |b_n|$ for all $n \ge 1$ so we can let $C=1$.

1744228,Is there a statistical measure of bitwise entropy?,"(Somewhat inspired by this website , particularly Section III. Also, I might be using a different definition of entropy than usual; what I am using is closest to the physics definition (the one I encountered first) of the amount of disorder in a system.) Consider the following two ""random"" 256-bit strings: 1110001011010010101000001111001100001100011111000111011011101000000000000001111110010110010100011101010010111110000010010101001001101100111110011000000110111111000111101111000011010100001001100010010010011000000011101110000000110001101100000110111001100011 ...created via RNG, and: 1001001001010010001001010010110100101100100101110001001010110100101001001010010010000110001000011010000010101010001001100110100010001010101010101100010010010011100100010010111010001011010101001011101000101010001101010100100101010010101010010010010101100101 ...created by ""randomly"" hammering away on the 1 and 0 keys on the keyboard. To the layperson, the second string ""looks"" more random than the first, partly because the first has longer runs, including one of length 14. However, the string 1010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010 ...would be considered relatively non-random (even more so than the first string), as although it has only runs of length 1, when elements are grouped into pairs, the pairs effectively become a run of length 128 if each pair is considered to be one unit. My question is, is there a formal measure of bitwise entropy that takes into account these factors? My first thought towards a potential answer to this question would be something along these lines: $$N-\sum_{\ell=1}^{20 \text{ (or so)}} {{\sum_{k=1}^{\text{(# of runs)}} (\text{length of $k$th run})^2}\over \ell}$$ where $N$ is the maximum value of the rest of the expression (so that the minimum value of the whole thing is zero). This takes into account the fact that longer runs are worse, as well as the reducing importance of shorter runs as the group length gets longer.","['reference-request', 'statistics', 'entropy', 'random']"
1744250,Convergence of Riemann sums for improper integrals,"I was considering whether or not the limit of Riemann sums converges to the value of an improper integral on a bounded interval.  This appears to be true in some cases when the sum avoids points where the function is not defined. For example, the right-hand Riemann sum for $1/\sqrt{x}$ converges
$$\lim \frac1{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n  \sqrt{n/i} = \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x}}.$$
This does not work, however, for the function $\sin(1/x)/x$ even though the improper integral is finite.
I’m sure this has something to do with the function being monotone, but I am not able to find a proof.","['improper-integrals', 'integration', 'riemann-integration']"

1744295,When are differentials actually useful?,"I think of differentials as a way to approximate $\Delta y$ in a function $y = f(x)$ for a certain $\Delta x$. The way I understood it, the derivative itself is not a ratio because you can't get $\frac{dy}{dx}$ by taking the ratio of the limits of the numerator and denominator separately. However, once you do have $\frac{dy}{dx}$, you can then think of $dx$ as $\Delta x$ and of $dy$ as the change in $y$ for a slope $\frac{dy}{dx}$ over a certain $\Delta x$. My problem is that I don't know why differentials are useful. The examples I saw are along the lines of approximating the max error in a sphere's volume if we know that the radius we're given (let's say 20) has a possible error of let's say 0.01. In this kind of example, it seems to me we're better off computing $V(20.01) - V(20)$, instead of $\Delta V \approx dV = V' \cdot \Delta x$. In the first case at least we get an exact maximum error instead of an approximation. So my question is : When are differentials actually useful? Are they ever anything more than at best a time saver over hand computations? Are they useful at all in today's world with Wolfram Alpha and other strong computational engines around?",['calculus']
