1206919,Functions and Sets,"Robert, Susan, and Thomas are the sole contestants in a lottery in which two prizes will be awarded. Three tickets with their names on them are placed in a hat. The person whose name is on the first ticket drawn wins prize #1. That ticket is placed back in. Then the second ticket is drawn. You can win both prizes. Let $A = \{1, 2\}$, $B = \{r, s, t\}$ where $R = \text {robert}$, etc
a.) Explain how each possible assignment of prizes to contestants may be thought of as a function from $A$ to $B$ and why $B^A$ may be thought of as representing the set of all such possible assignments.
d.) In terms of assignments of prizes in the lottery, what does it mean to say that an element of $B^A$ is an injection? My attempt: a.) So it's essentially 
f(1) = r, s, t
f(2) = r, s, t Because either prize can map to any contestant. But then these aren't functions, are they? Because the same value maps to multiple people (potentially). And the function A --> B is the set of all possible assignments because it explains how awards can be matched to contestants? d.) So an injective function is 1 to 1. If an element of A --> B is an injection, that means each value in A (domain) only maps to one value in the codomain (B), and no two values in A map to the same value in B. That is to say, an element of B^A that is an injection means that a player did not win both of the prizes. Am I vaguely close?","['proof-writing', 'functions']"

The first one is continuous as the product of the continuous functions $y$ and $e^x$. The second one is continuous. The third one is the composition of the function $(x, y, z) \mapsto z^4$ with the product $x \cdot y$, so it is continuous. So, we conclude that $g$ is continuous. Is this correct??

\int \frac{dx}{(\sqrt{\cos x}+ \sqrt{\sin x})^4}

I saw this problem online and it looked like an interesting/difficult problem to try and tackle.  My attempt so far is to use tangent half-angle substitution. Let $t= \tan^2 (\frac{x}{2})$, then $dt= \frac{1}{2} \sec^2 (\frac{x}{2})\;dx.$  With algebra we get that $dx= \frac{2}{1+t^2}dt,$ $\sin x = \frac{2t}{1+t^2},$ and $\cos x = \frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}.$ Therefore we get the following: $$
\int \frac{dx}{(\sqrt{\cos x}+ \sqrt{\sin x})^4} = \int \frac{\frac{2}{1+t^2}}{(\sqrt{\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}}+\sqrt{\frac{2t}{1+t^2}})^4}dt = 2\int \frac{1}{1+t^2}\cdot \frac{(1+t^2)^2}{(\sqrt{1-t^2}+ \sqrt{2t})^4}dt 
$$ $$
= 2\int \frac{1+t^2}{(\sqrt{1-t^2}+ \sqrt{2t})^4}dt

Now the proof proceeds by considering another series $s''_n=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\sum_{j=(k-1)m+1}^{mk}\frac{1}{mk}$. It is clear that $s'_n > s''_n$ $\forall n$, so the author concludes that $\lim_{n \to \infty}s'_n=s>\lim_{n \to \infty}s''_n$ which he presents in the following form as something fully obvious: $$\sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{1}{j}>m\left(\frac{1}{m}\right)+m\left(\frac{1}{2m}\right)+m\left(\frac{1}{3m}\right)+\cdots$$ The author finishes the proof by noting that because $s''_n$ is itself a harmonic series we get that $s>s$ (contradiction). What seems to me wrong is the conclusion $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{1}{j}>m(\frac{1}{m})+m(\frac{1}{2m})+m(\frac{1}{3m})+\cdots$, i.e. $\lim_{n \to \infty}s'_n>\lim_{n \to \infty}s''_n$ because $s'_n > s''_n$ $\forall n$.

 Let be $(x_i) \in l^q$ and  $\epsilon$ be orbitrary. We know $\sum_{i=1}^\infty |x_i|^q <\infty$

Since the rationals are dense in $\Bbb{R}$ , for each $x_i$ there is rational $y_i$ close to it. Hence we can find a $y \in \ell^p$ satisfying $\sum_{i=1}^\infty |x_i-y_i|^q< {\epsilon^p\over 2^p}$.

Prove that $$\bar{B_t}:=B_{t_0+t}-B_{t_0};\quad t\ge 0$$ is a Brownian motion. I try to prove it by definition. In the book, Brownian motion is defined as $$P^x(B_{t_1}\in F_1, \cdots, B_{t_k}\in F_k) = \\ \int\limits_{F_1 \times \cdots \times F_k}p(t_1, x, x_1)\cdots p(t_k-t_{k-1}, x_{k-1}, x_k)dx_1 \ldots dx_k, $$
 where
$$p(t,x,y) = (2\pi t)^{-n/2}\cdot \exp(-\frac{|x-y|^2}{2t})$$ Hence for simplicity, we only need to show $$P^0(\bar{B}_{t_1}\in F_1, \bar{B}_{t_2}\in F_2) =  \int\limits_{F_1 \times F_2}p(t_1, 0, x_2) p(t_2-t_1, x_3, x_2)dx_2 dx_3$$
Suppse $B_t$ starts at $x_0$.

I know I should use  $B_t$'s finite dimensional distribution. So if I can write $(1)$ as $$P^{x_0}[\bigcup_{x_1\in\mathbb{R}^n} \left(B_{t_0}=x_1,B_{t_0+t_1}\in F_1+x_1, B_{t_0+t_2}\in F_2+x_1\right)]\tag{2}\\=\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^n\times (F_1+x_1)  \times (F_2+x_1)}p(t_0, x_0, x_1)p(t_1, x_1, x_2) p(t_2-t_1, x_2, x_3)dx_1 dx_2 dx_3 $$ Then apply change of variable formula and Fubini's theorem, I can get the result. But I don't know how to justify $(2)$ and the last equality. I think it should be true because it's the conditional probability.

Whenever we have a submanifold we can pull back the metric along the inclusion map to get an inner product on the submanifold. We then get a volume form on the submanifold. I'm wondering if there are any converse results to this. I'm looking for some result of the form: Suppose $\mathcal{M}$ is a manifold with a volume form assigned to every submanifold, such that these volume forms satisfy (some consistency condition). Then $\mathcal{M}$ is Riemannian, and the volume forms arise as above. My only progress so far is to notice that you can define some kind of ""norm"" on such an $\mathcal{M}$ by, for any vector $v$, picking a curve $\gamma:(-1,1)\rightarrow\mathcal{M}$ with $\gamma'(0)=v$, letting $\mu$ be the measure on the submanifold which is the image of this curve and then defining
$$\lVert v \rVert=\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0}\frac{\mu(\gamma((0,\varepsilon))}{\varepsilon}.$$

The problem I have is that this problem is very vague (doesn't tell us what result we should get, and doesn't tell us what ""suitable hypotheses"" are), and I don't see a natural generalization of the result. However, this is what I have so far: The first hypothesis I introduce is that $\frac{d}{dy} \varphi = \frac{d}{dx} \varphi$, so that I can switch integrals. So, I begin by integrating the inner integrals: $$\int_a^b \varphi(dx) - \varphi(cx) dx = \int_c^d \varphi(ay) - \varphi(by) dy.$$ Let $a \to 0$ and $b \to \infty$. So I suppose that $\lim \limits_{a \to 0} \varphi(ay) = A$ and $\lim \limits_{b \to \infty} \varphi(by) = B$ for fixed, finite $y$. Now this becomes $$\int_0^\infty \varphi(dx) - \varphi(cx) dx = \int_c^d (A - B) dy$$ but now I feel like I've gone off track because the result is different from the result that we're supposed to be generalizing.",['multivariable-calculus']

1208202,Equivalence of definitions for completion,"For the settings on my question, take Atiyah's chapter on completions. Basically we have two definitions of completness (Atiyah's sense, the canonical map $\phi:M\rightarrow \widehat{M}$ is an $A$-isomoprhism) and complete in the usual sense , this is, every Cauchy sequence converges. I guess the first step is to give a topology on $\widehat{M}$. If we endow $\widehat{M}$ with the topology induced by the filtration $\{\widehat{M_i}\}$ (these are submodules of $\widehat{M}$), the map $\phi$ becomes continuous, hence Cauchy sequences in $M$ produce Cauchy sequences in $\widehat{M}$, so I would say that this is a natural candidate for the topology on $\widehat{M}$.

The typical HS questions asks students to find the solution in Q1 by solving $2x + 3x = 90$. He was thinking about how to get the other solutions and we were curious to see what other people do for a problem like this.

Namely, $\frac{\pi}{10} \pm \frac{4k\pi}{10}$, AND $-\frac{\pi}{2} \pm 2k\pi$  {$k$ natural} for the above equation. We've been able to generalize this to any such co-function equation of the form $\sin(ax)=\cos(bx)$ {$a,b$ Integers} , and are curious about whether other people have stumbled upon this as well.

The first part of the question asks to show that the map $c:Pic(X) \rightarrow H^1(X,\Omega_X)$ induced by $\mathcal{O}_X^* \rightarrow \Omega_X$, $f\rightarrow f^{-1}df$ is compatible with the pairings on $Pic(X)$ (intersection product) and $H^1(X,\Omega_X)$ (Serre duality). I'm not convinced that this is as trivial as certain online solutions make it out to be, but fine, I'm willing to accept that this is true by naturalness of Serre duality. What I'm interested in is the second part of the question, which says to conclude that Num$X$ is finitely generated and free. I can use the above to show that Num$X$ is an abelian subgroup of the finite dimensional vector space $H^1(X,\Omega_X)$, although this does not suffice. The two online solution references I've seen both cite the exponential sequence in Appendix B of Hartshorne, but this seems bogus to me and not at all what the author intended.

So is $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} P(T > t) = P(T = \infty)$ and $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} P(T \leq t) = P(T < \infty)$? Is that true? Are these also the same events? Thank you very much and please excuse the stupid questions.","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'limits', 'probability-distributions']"

1208768,Homeomorphisms in $\mathbb{R}^2$.,"I'm getting confused about homeomorphisms.  I believe that $[0,1]\times [0,1)$ and $[0,1)\times [0,1)$ are homeomorphic but $[0,1]\times (0,1)$ and $[0,1)\times (0,1)$ are not.  Please can you try and explain why this is the case?",['general-topology']
