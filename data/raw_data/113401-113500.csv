$$e^{2iz}+4k\pi e^{iz}-1=0.$$

1649890,"Is there a series to show $22\pi^4>2143\,$?","This extends this post . I. For $\pi^3$: $$\pi^6-31^2 =\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left(-\frac{63}{(2k+2)^6}+\frac{31^2}{(2k+3)^6}\right) =\sum_{k=0}^\infty P_1(k)\tag1$$ As pointed out by J. Lafont, when $P_1(k)$ is expanded out, its coefficients are all positive. Thus so is the $\text{LHS}$, implying $\pi^3>31$. II. For $\pi^4$: The convergents of $\pi^4$ are, $$97,\, \frac{195}{2},\, \frac{487}{5},\, \frac{1656}{17},\, \frac{2143}{22},\dots$$ The last one, being the particularly close approximation $22\pi^4 \approx 2143.0000027$, was mentioned by Ramanujan. (See also this post .) Using, $$\frac{\pi^8}{9450}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(k+1)^8}$$ $$\frac{17\pi^8}{161280}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k+1)^8}$$ and the same method to find $(1)$, we get, $$\pi^8-\Big(\frac{487}{5}\Big)^2 =\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left(\frac{381}{5(2k+2)^8}+\frac{r_1^2}{(2k+3)^8}\right)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty P_2(k)\tag2$$ $$\pi^8-\Big(\frac{2143}{22}\Big)^2 =\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left(-\frac{181695}{11^2(2k+2)^8}+\frac{r_2^2}{(2k+3)^8}\right)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty Q_1(k)\tag3$$ $$\pi^8-\Big(\frac{2143}{22}\Big)^2 =\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left(\frac{r_2^2}{(k+2)^8}-\frac{70208}{1815(2k+1)^8} \right)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty Q_2(k)\tag4$$ where $r_1 =\frac{487}{5},\,$ $r_2 =\frac{2143}{22}$. The coefficients of $P_2(k)$ are all positive, so $5\pi^4>487$. However, when the $Q_i(k)$ are expanded out, the constant term for both is negative , so we cannot make an analogous conclusion. (In fact, it takes several terms before the sum turns positive.) Q: Can one find a similar series for $\pi^8-\Big(\frac{2143}{22}\Big)^2 = \sum_{k=0}^\infty R(k)$ such that all coefficients are positive and immediately implying $22\pi^4>2143$?","['inequality', 'pi', 'sequences-and-series', 'approximation']"

1650039,Subadditivity of the $n$th root of the volume of $r$-neighborhoods of a set,"Let $A$ be a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. For $r>0$, let $A_r$ be the $r$-neighborhood of $A$, namely the set $\{x:\operatorname{dist}(x,A)\le r\}$. Let $f(r) = \mu(A_r)^{1/n}$ where $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure. Is the function $f(r)/r$ decreasing? Motivation I previously asked about Concavity of the $n$th root of the volume of $r$-neighborhoods of a set where the answer turned out to be negative. But the counterexample by George Lowther still has $f(r)/r$ decreasing. Geometrically, this property means that the graph of $f$ lies above the line through $(0,0)$ and $(r,f(r))$. Although weaker than concavity, this is already a useful property to have: it implies the differential inequality $f'(r)\le f(r)/r$, as well as subadditivity $f(x+y)\le f(x)+f(y)$. The latter follows by comparing $f$ to the secant line through $(0,0)$ and $(x+y,f(x+y))$. Among other things, the result stated above would simplify the proof here . As for ideas for its own proof, I hope that this time the Brunn-Minkowski inequality can be put to use.","['volume', 'measure-theory', 'convex-analysis']"

For example, the internal direct sum of subspaces of a vector space is isomorphic to the external direct sum of these subspaces. One can prove that the internal direct sum is associative and commutative and then call on isomorphism to say the same applies to the external direct sum. I would imagine somewhere in category theory there is some result along the lines that if $\phi$ is an isomorphism between two objects $O_1, O_2$ in a category, and $P$ is some logic statement about $O_1$ then $\phi(P) = P$, i.e. the logic statement about the corresponding entities in $O_2$ is true or false in accordance with the statement in $O_1$.

1650472,How to calculate the area of the visible parts of a 3D PieChart?,"I have created a 3D Pie Chart whose major feat (among the others) is to be rotated: I did it to demonstrate how the visual perception of data in a Pie Chart can be distorted depending on the position, so that with a 3D pie chart, the closer the slices are, the more important they 'seem' perceptively, since they occupy a bigger area (area of ellipse + visible area of cylinder's side), while the more distant they are the less important they look, since they occupy a smaller area (only the ellipse's area, without the cylinder's), despite all numerical weighs being equal. A method of evaluation of how much a slice's weigh is perceived compared to its basic weigh (the percentage), is the area of the slices of the 3D Pie Chart (inner pie area + outer pie area). In order to demonstrate my point, I need to calculate the total visual area of the slices. What approach is best to be used ? EDIT 1 I was able to calculate the total visible area of the PieChart by using the formulas to calculate the area of a cylinder, as shown below. Area of Pie Chart = Area of Ellipse + Area of Cylinder's side AE -> (Area of Ellipse): PE -> (Perimeter of Ellipse) (It is an approximation): ACS -> (Area of Cylinder's side): ACS = PE * H (height of cylinder) VACS -> Visible part of Cylinder's Area's side:
VACS = ACS / 2 Total Visible Area of Pie Chart -> AE + VACS EDIT 2 I was also able to calculate the slice closest to the viewer (the one having 29.5%): For each slice: 
- AE * percentage
e.g. if AE is 74.28, then the light blue slice within the Ellipse (29.5%) must be: then the light blue slice's outer side, with VACS = 25.36: the result for the light blue slice would be -> 21.9126 + 7.4812 = 29,3938 but what about the other 2 (26% and 10.1%)?","['calculus', 'integration', 'geometry', 'area', 'surfaces']"

1650521,Limit theorems in measure theory,"From probability theory/measure theory we know set of theorems such as Monotone convergence, dominated convergence or conditions like uniform integrability which deals with the general question of interchanging limits and integration. In these cases we have either measurable functions $f_n$ converging to $f$ or  measures $\pi_k$ converging to $\pi$ and we see under what condition for instance $\int f_n\rm d \pi \to \int f\rm d \pi$ or $\int f\rm d \pi_k\to \int f\rm d \pi$. My question is what happens if those two are mixed. Namely if we have measurable functions $f_n$ converging to $f$ and  measures $\pi_k$ converging to $\pi$ then what we can say about limits of $\int f_n\rm d \pi_n$. A particularly interesting case is when $f_n$ is implicitly a functional of $\pi_n$, which means that by changing the measure $f_n$ will change too.

1650548,Coupon Collectors Problem with Packets: Clarifying Wikipedia,"The Coupon Collector's Problem (CCP) is very useful in many applications. However, the ""default"" CCP is relatively simple: suppose you have an urn containing $n$ pairwise different balls. Now you want to draw a ball from the urn with replacements until you have seen each of the $n$ balls at least one.
Now you can compute the average waiting time to get the number of draws overall needed by the formula
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_i] = nH_n
\end{align}
where $H_n$ is defined as the harmonic series and $\mathbb{E}$ is the expected value. Also, the random variable $X$ is defined as the random number of draws you have to make in order to get all $n$ balls at least once. $X_i$ denotes the additional number of draws one has to make in order to get from $i-1$ different balls to $i$ different balls drawn. Additionally, each ball has an equal probability of $1/n$. Now consider an advanced CCP question: how does the formula change in case you want to draw $p\geq 1$ pairwise different balls (instead of only one as in the default CCP) per draw, called packets ?
In other words: Given an urn containing $n$ balls, how many balls do I need to draw in order to get all $n$ balls when drawing always $p\geq 1$ (pairwise different) balls out of the urn? The set of balls is drawn with replacement.
(Therefore all balls of one package are different, but different packages can contain same balls.) An answer gives this paper on top of page 20 , and also this german lecture gives an answer on slide 229, 14.7b) . A third -- at the same time very intuitive to get -- answer is given on the german Wikipedia, subsection ""Päckchen"" . Now two questions arise. Why do the answers in the paper and the lecture differ? If you plug in some numbers, you get different results for numbers above 1000. How do I get from these solutions to the one given on Wikipedia? For me it seems like an approximation of the real value, since it is very fast to compute compared to the ""scientific"" answers, and the results is always ""in the near of"" the results of the other computations. Since I am interested in understanding the formula on Wikipedia, can anyone help understanding the equation how the formula is derived or give some insight?","['combinatorics', 'statistics', 'coupon-collector']"

Now $\sqrt{k^2-101k}$ has to be either integer or rational,if it's an integer it has to be $k=101$ cause $gcd(k,k-101)=1\lor101$ and both $k,k-101$ can't be both squares of an integer,so $k=101t$ and $t(t-1)$ is never an square except for $t=1,0$ and $t=0$ is not possible hence $k=101$ is only possible integer solution EDIT: So if $\gcd(k,k-101)=1$ then $k=h^2,k-101=(h-s)^2$ then $h(2h-s)=101$ which can be $s=1,h=51$ or $s=101,h=51$.$y=51^2+51\cdot50=51\cdot 101,x=51$

You will have: $$\frac AB=\frac{x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d}{x^2+px+q}=C?$$ Now, performing synthetic division is not possible and performing long division is likely to produce mistakes, so I sort of cheated? I know $B$ goes into $A$ perfectly, which means polynomial $C$ is a quadratic in the form: $$C=x^2+tx+u$$ Now, I did a sort of cheatery. I substituted $x=0$ everywhere to obtain: $$\frac dq=u$$ Then I substituted $x=1$ to get: $$\frac{1+a+b+c+d}{1+p+q}=1+t+u=1+t+\frac dq$$ And so, you can easily solve for $t,u$ through my method.

1651317,How to determine if this musical exercise is valid: will the pattern complete?,"I'm hoping that math has an answer to a question arising out of a musical exercise. In music terms, the exercise is: Choose two arpeggios (sets of notes) of equal (or roughly equal) span (number of notes and distance between them) Start at the bottom of one, and play N notes going upwards until the top, then back down again After N, chose the very next note from the ""other"" arpeggio in the same direction you are going and repeat (play N notes) until you have done ""every possible transition from one arpeggio to the other"" I am trying to figure out what characteristics of the arpeggios determine whether: you will in fact go through every possible transition from one arpeggio to the other? Whether this also means inherently that you arrive back where you started. That, in a nutshell, is the question. The exercise was given with arpeggios of length 10 and N=8 Here is my attempt to cast it in a "" mathemetical way "", escaping the musical context. We have a an ordered set of nodes (aka notes :) ). In this case 30 of them.  Their ordinality can be represented by a number - they are numbered, and ""higher"" means... higher in the numerical sense. (N1, N2, ..., N30) We take two subsets, call them 'A' and 'D'.   These have equal size (in this case 10). A: (N1, N5, N8, N11, N13, N17, N20, N23, N25, N29)
 D: (N1, N4, N6, N10, N13, N16, N18, N22, N25, N28) An ""up"" transition means ""find the next highest number in the target set to the current one"".   Inversely for a down transition. We can transition inside the current set or to the ""other"" set. The exercise is: Start in the direction 'up"", at the lowest node in set A and make N transitions in set A If at any point there are no remaining notes upwards, reverse direction Having made N transitions in set A, transition in the same direction to set D Make N transitions in Set D, then transition to set A ... repeat until all transitions have been made. The question is: what characteristics of the sets (A and D) determine whether you will take every possible transition? (and thus arrive back at ""the beginning"") With N=8, the sequence starts like this: start in A : N1, N5, N8, N11, N13, N17, N20, N23,
  trans to D : N25, N28, N25, N22, N18, N16, N13, N10,
  trans to A : N8, N5, N1, N5, N8, N11 ... and the question is ""do we 'trans to X: NY' for all X in A,D and Y in nodes-in-A-and-D ?"""" (And a simpler question - ""do we ever arrive back at 'trans to A: N1'?"") I tried to represent this graphically.   I laid out the initial set of 30 notes, then illustrated the subsets A and D.   Then I drew in all the possible transitions. In doing so I discovered that the specific sets (A and D) from the exercise have some interesting properties: they have some nodes in common, which result in one-way transitions, which I have highlighted. (Edit: deleted detailed discussion of how I simulated this for guitar - I think it was a distraction). I wrote a simulation of this.   When I run it for N=3, what I see is that I do get back to the beginning and thus will repeat from here, but not every transition was covered.

1651379,Evolution semigroups for differential equations,"I would like to ask whether ""evolution semigroups"" are really useful (to discover something that can't be discovered in some other way?). There is a huge machinery to deal with them, but from my point of view the theory fails to provide new insight. Let me recall the notion with a simple example. Say that you consider a differential equation $x'=A(t)x$, where $A(t)$ is an $n\times n$ matrix varying continuously with $t\in\mathbb R$. It induces what is sometimes called an evolution family $X(t,s)$ such that $X(t,s)x(s)=x(t)$ for any solution $x$. The evolution semigroup (perhaps it would be better: evolution semiflow) associated to the equation is defined by $$(T(t)u)(s)=X(s,s-t)u(s-t)$$
for each continuous function $u\colon\mathbb R\to\mathbb R^n$. There are many other possibilities (of equations, spaces, etc), this is just an example. So my question is: What can we gain easier from looking at $T(t)$ instead of looking at $X(t,s)$? As far as I understand the two have the same information (thus why the word ""easier""), although the machinery developed is so huge, that I wonder whether I am missing something.

Thank you so much! Problem statement: Karl conducted an experiment to study whether honey bees have color vision. He trained bees to feed on a dish of sugar water that was set on a colored card. Later he set the colored card (without the sugar water) onto an array of four cards colored in grey. The experiment was repeated with the colored tile in different positions on the array. Of $27$ incoming bees who landed on a tile, twelve landed first on the colored tile. i) Define the population and sample involved in this experiment. Explain how this experiment can be used to test whether bees have color vision. ii) Define a parameter of interest and state a null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis involving this parameter. Hint: If bees could not see in color, what proportion of incoming bees would you expect to first land on the blue card? If you are using symbols, define what they represent. iii) Conduct a statistical hypothesis test to answer the question whether bees can see in color (at significance level $\alpha= 0.05$). Report the $p$-value of your test together with a conclusion sentence. Show your work. My work: i) Because the bees are incentives with (I suppose $4$ dish with water) and the one with sugar was blue, then Karl must to change the position of the blue dish for making sure the bees don’t use their memory if they have it. After some time, he can take away the water and leave the blue card, with the others gray cards, knowing the proportion of the bees landed in the blue card, compared with the others gray cards. He can inferred that bees can distinguises blue over gray, because the only difference among the cards are the color, and no other sense is involve he can conclude bees are not color blind. Population: All honeybees fed with the dish of sugar water that was set on the colored card varying the position. Sample: $27$ incoming honeybees fed with the dish of sugar water that was set on the colored card, which landed on a tile. ii) Parameter of interest: proportion of bees that land first in the blue tail $\mathbf{H_0:}$ The proportion of bees land first in a blue tail is equal to the proportion of bees landed first in other card. That means that bees are color blind (Extra: also it is possible they has no memory at all, that why he change position to discard such possibility) $\mathbf{H_a:}$ If the proportion of bees that first landed in blue car is greater than the bees landed first in other card then bees aren’t color blind. It can differentiate blue color from others (at least one more color). iii) $P=12/27$ (bees land first in blue card)

I came across an exercise that questions about the converse statement. That is, if $A \otimes B$ is a unital non-zero algebra then $A$ and $B$ must also be unital . I started by denoting $e$ the unit of $A \otimes B$. We can write $e = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \otimes b_i$, with $n$ being minimal. This minimality implies that $a_1, \cdots, a_n$ and $b_1, \cdots, b_n$ are linearly independent. If we can prove that $n = 1$, then $e = a \otimes b$ is a pure tensor. These elements $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ are the ideal candidates for units in $A$ and $B$, respectively. However, I have not been able to arrive to a contradiction if $n > 1$ using only the basic tools and computations of tensors.

$$
−\psi''(x) − (ix)^ N \psi(x) = E\psi(x).
$$
where $N$ can be any real number, the boundary condition  $\psi(x) \to 0$ as $|x| → ∞$ causes a great difficulty for numerical method, because there are infinite number of contour paths which go from zero to complex infinity. Bender et al on their paper only considered the contour paths (e.g. the black path on the following figure) which are entirely confined in two Stokes wedges symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis. Based on my understanding on what they say, each asymptotic series expansion for $ψ(x)$ is only valid within certain sector or wedge, therefore for any path which is outside of these two wedges, the corresponding asymptotic series is no longer asymptotic to the value of the function $ψ(x)$ . However, there exists a new, unique and valid asymptotic series for $ψ(x)$ outside the wedge. Yet, this new asymptotic series, say $f(x)$, does not satisfy the boundary condition  $f(x) \to 0$ as $|x| \to \infty$ . My question :
I don't really understand why the contour path has to be entirely inside the Stokes sector. How about the red and yellow path shown on the figure above?
They are partly inside the Stokes wedges.

I hope this hasn't been posted before but I'm new and maybe not very good at using the search function effectively..) Let $p>3$ be a prime. Show that there exists a primitive root $r$ mod $p$ with $0<r<p$ so that $\gcd (r, p-1)=1$. I've tried a few things, but the main difficulty seems to be that the primitive root $r$ must be reduced mod $p$ and then taken mod $p-1$, and it's hard to do both at the same time. If $d_1<d_2<... < d_{\varphi (p-1)}$ are the totatives of $p-1$, then we want to show that $\{ g^{d_1}, g^{d_2} , ... g^{d_{\varphi (p-1)}} \}$ and $\{ d_1,d_2,..d_{\varphi (p-1)} \}$ have a non-empty intersection but I'm not sure how to proceed at all.","['number-theory', 'primitive-roots']"

1651740,Every Hilbert space is isometrically isomorphic with $\ell^2$,"Let $H$ be a hilbert space and let $\{u_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ be a
  orthornormal basis ($A$ is not supposed to be countable a priori).
  Then there is an isometric isomorphism between $H$ and
  $\ell^2(\mathcal{A})$ given by $x \mapsto \hat{x}$ with $\hat{x}_\alpha = \langle x,u_\alpha\rangle$. Proof: Linearity follows by linearity of scalar product: $(\widehat{ax + by})_\alpha = \langle ax + by,u_\alpha\rangle = a\langle x,u_\alpha\rangle + b\langle y,u_\alpha\rangle = a\hat{x}_\alpha + b\hat{y}_\alpha$ From Parseval we have $\|x\| = \sum_{\alpha \in A} |\langle x, u_\alpha\rangle| = \|\hat{x}\|_2$ and then the mapping is an isometry (and hence also injective). To conclude we need to prove that this isometry is also surjective. Let then $f$ be in $\ell^2(A)$. Then, by definition of $\ell^2$, $\sum_{\alpha \in A} |f_\alpha|^2 < \infty$, this implies that $|\{\alpha : f_\alpha \not = 0 \}| \le |\mathbb{N}|$ and thus also the sum $\sum_{\alpha \in A} f_\alpha u_\alpha$ has countable many nonzero terms. Then, by Pythagorean theorem (using continuity of inner product) $\|\sum f_\alpha u_\alpha \|^2 = \sum_{\alpha \in A} |f_\alpha|^2 < \infty$ so this series is absolutely convergent and then $z = \sum_{\alpha \in A} f_\alpha u_\alpha$ exists. Clearly $\hat{z} = f$ 
$\square$ Q1: Is this proof correct? This proof is worked out from Folland's Real Analysis book. In the book though, Prof. Folland writes: If $f \in \ell^2(A)$ then $\sum_{\alpha \in A} |f_\alpha|^2 < \infty$
  so the Pythagorean theorem shows that partial sums of the series
  $\sum_{\alpha \in A} f_\alpha u_\alpha$ (of which only countable many
  terms are nonzero) are Cauchy. I know the definitions but I don't get why Prof. Folland says that Pythagorean theorem asserts that partial sums are Cauchy. I think Pythagorean theorem in this case give us absolute convergence of the sum, not just the fact partial sums are Cauchy. In this case the space is complete so there is no real distinction between Cauchy and convergence but I care about logical order of the proof. Q2: Why Pythagorean theorem asserts only Cauchy property of partial sums and not absolute convergence as I said? Thanks in advance Note: Uncountable sums of non negative terms are defined like this:

Order isn't important  and you can put something back gives me: one element is even and the other two are not: $$\binom{50+1-1}{1}\binom{50 +2 - 1}{2}$$ or all three elements are even which gives me: $$\binom{50+3-1}{3}$$ Now I add both and multiply it by $3!$ because there are $6$ possibilities for an unordered set to be ordered and order is important in tuples. I get 
$$3! \cdot \left[\binom{50 +2}{3} + 50 \binom{50 +1}{2}\right] = 515. 100$$ I think the solution is $500.000$ isn't it? Can't find my mistake...",['combinatorics']

There is a natural metric $d'$ on this set, which is not induced by euclidian metric on $R^3$, but it is the length of the geodesic curve between 2 points.

Suppose that $T$ is onto. Then, since we are also given that $T$ is linear, then $T$ has to be one-to-one. Thus $T$ is both one-to-one and onto which means $\dim(V) = \dim(W)$ hence contradiction the fact that $\dim(V) < \dim(W)$. (b) Again proving by contradiction, suppose that $T$ is one-to-one. Then we know that $\dim N(T) = 0$. And since $\dim R(T) + \dim N(T) = \dim(V)$, this makes $\dim R(T) = \dim(W)$, and thus $V$ maps onto $W$, which contradicts the fact that $\dim(V) > \dim(W)$ and hence proving the statement.
