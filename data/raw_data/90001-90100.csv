1209036,To show number of left cosets equals number of right cosets,"I need to prove that the number of left cosets of a subgroup $H$ in $G$ is equal to that of right cosets in general(even when $|G|$ is not finite). Here is my argument. For every $aH$ in $G$, the element $a$ that is in $aH$ is also in exactly one right coset $Ha$ and no more.
Is this enough to prove that no. of left cosets equals of H to no. of it's right cosets? Please point out if there are any flaws in my statement. Thanks EDIT:
I'll try to make my statement a little more clear. Consider a coset $aH$. It has $a$ in it which is mapped to identity $e$ in $H$. Now similarly $Ha$ also has $a$ in it and no other right coset contains $a$. Of all the left cosets of $H$, $aH$ is the only one which has $a$ in it and of all the right cosets $Ha$ is the only one which has $a$ in it. $a$ is like a representative element for $aH$  and $Ha$. Similarly I can argue for each left coset of $H$. This to my understanding should prove that there are as many right cosets as left cosets. Now I can make a similar argument in the other direction which shows that there are as many left cosets as there are right cosets.

1209039,Nonconstant holomorphic function f in unit disk such that f(0)=1,"This question is in light of a previous question $f$ be a nonconstant holomorphic in unit disk such that $f(0)=1$. Then it is necessary that There are infinitely many points inside unit disk such that $|f(z)|=1$ $f$ is bounded. There are at most finitely many points inside unit disk such that $|f(z)|=1$ $f$ is rational function. 2 is wrong by Liouville's theorem. The author has used $f(z)=e^z$, (holomorphic and $f(0)=1$) to show that option 4 is wrong. Isn't $|f(z)|=1$ only for $z=0$ in this case?

1209076,Showing that arcs do not separate the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$,"Is $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus f([0,1])$ connected if $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^2$ is an embedding? It seems that this is clearly true but I am having a hard time proving it.
The only things that I know is that $f([0,1])$ is compact and simply connected. Since $H=\mathbb{R}^2\setminus f([0,1])$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^2$, we can prove that $H$ is locally path-connected and therefore its connected components and path-connected components are the same, or more precisely $A\subset H$ is a connected component if and only if is a path-connected component. Since $f([0,1])$ is bounded, it is contained in a disk $D$. Hence if $H$ has a separation $\{U,V\}$ (both non-empty, open and disjoint with union $H$), then $U\cap (\mathbb{R^2}\setminus D)$ and $V\cap (\mathbb{R^2}\setminus D)$ are open, disjoint with union $\mathbb{R^2}\setminus D$. Thus we can assume without lose of generality that $U\subset D$. In fact, either $U\cap (\mathbb{R^2}\setminus D)$ or $V\cap (\mathbb{R^2}\setminus D)$) is empty because $\mathbb{R^2}\setminus D$ is connected. Finally we have that $\{U,V,f([0,1])\}$ is a partition of $\mathbb{R}^2$ where $U$ and $V$ are open and $f([0,1])=\partial U \cup \partial V$ and $U$ is bounded. It sounds like I have to use the Jordan Curve Theorem somehow.","['connectedness', 'general-topology']"

Then the box topology on $\mathbb{R}^J$ by definition is the topology having as a basis all sets of the form $\prod_{\alpha \in J} U_\alpha$ , where $U_\alpha$ is open in $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology for each $\alpha \in J$ . The product topology on $\mathbb{R}^J$ has as a basis all sets of the form $\prod_{\alpha \in J} U_\alpha$ , where $U_\alpha$ is open in $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology for each $\alpha \in J$ and the sets $U_\alpha$ are distinct from $\mathbb{R}$ for at most finitely many indices $\alpha \in J$ .

How? Can we explicitly exhibit a set that is in the box topology but is not in the uniform topology?

1209465,What is a geometric interpretation of regular sequences in various instances?,"This question arose from my attempts to understand the inclusion Regular $\subset$ Complete Intersection $\subset$ Gorenstein $\subset$ Cohen Macaulay There are many related questions here and in mathoverflow and they have been really helpful but I didn't find much on a geometric interpretation of regular sequences themselves. Although what follows makes sense in a more general fashion, I am mainly interested in rings $k[x_1,\cdots,x_n]/I$ that are coordinate rings of algebraic varieties $V$ (and I'll be happy to take an answer based on them). It seems to me that there are at least two different contexts in which regular sequences are important: When they live inside the ideal $I$ that defines the variety: There, after we localize at a point, if $I$ is generated by a regular sequence, the local ring is a Complete Intersection ring. When they live inside the ring itself: There, after we localize at a point $P$, if the maximal size of a regular sequence is equal to $\operatorname{codim}P$, the ring is Cohen Macaulay. For the first part of my question, I am asking for a geometric interpretation that maybe binds these two cases together. Is it just the normal way of treating depth as a sort of dimension where we want to describe our variety via succesive intersections of hypersurfaces? Would that make it clear why Complete Intersection $\Rightarrow$ Cohen Macaulay? For the second part, I would like to understand (geometrically) why things change when we localize. For instance the ring $k[x,y,z]/(xz,yz)$ is not Cohen Macaulay (indeed, it is clearly not equidimensional). In particular, the localization at the origin has no regular sequence of size 2. However, the ring itself does; it is not difficult to see that $\{xy+3,x-y\}$ is one. The same sequence is not regular in the localization because there $xy+3$ is a unit. I would like to understand if there is a geometric meaning to this. Is it interesting or useful for a non-local ring to have a maximal regular sequence equal to its dimension?","['algebraic-geometry', 'cohen-macaulay', 'commutative-algebra']"

1209481,How does the Enigma machine ensure that no letter is substituted for itself?,"In Alan Turing: The Enigma Andrew Hodges describes how the letter encodings performed by a German Enigma machine ""would always be swappings "" (original emphasis). And goes on to say that There was a practical advantage to this Enigma property. It meant that
  the deciphering operation was identical with the enciphering
  operation. (In group-theory terms, the cipher was self-inverse). ...
  But it was associated with a grave weakness, in that the substitutions
  thus performed were always of this very special kind, with the
  particular feature that no letter could ever be enciphered into
  itself. This passage suggests that any encoding that performs swappings, and is thus self-inverse, must have the property that no letter is ""enciphered into itself"". However this isn't the case, is it? Isn't this only a property of ""swappings"" in which all letters are swapped for a different letter. That is, doesn't he mean to say that the Enigma substitutions ""would always be swappings of every letter for a different one "" so that the non-substitution of the same letter is enforced by the specific swappings preformed by the machine? If so, how is the property of ""non-self-substitution"" achieved by the machine as a whole? I can see that at the reflector is physically constrained to have this property, but the plugboard clearly lacks it, as does at least one rotor (Rotor III substitutes N for N). And in any case, it isn't clear to me how self-substituted in guaranteed to be avoided in all possible configurations and rotor positions. What specific properties of the components and configuration of the Enigma machine ensure that no letter is substituted for itself?

It's a grade 12 math question. It's telling us to explain the changes that were made to the first function $y = |x + 3| + 4$ to get the second function $y = {1\over4}|2x + 3| + 4$. What my friend said was that $y = {1\over4}|2x + 3| + 4 \Rightarrow y = {1\over4}|2(x + {3\over2})| + 4$ so there was a vertical stretch of ${1\over4}$, a horizontal stretch of ${1\over2}$, and a horizontal shift of ${3\over2}$ units right. However, I had a slightly different answer. I set the first equation as $f(x)$ instead of $y$. So $f(x) = |x + 3| + 4$. Then: $f(2x) = |2x + 3| + 4$ $\Rightarrow {1\over4}f(2x) = {1\over4}|2x + 3| + 1$ $\Rightarrow {1\over4}f(2x) + 3 = {1\over4}|2x + 3| + 4$ This means that ${1\over4}f(2x) + 3$ is exactly same as the second equation $y = {1\over4}|2x + 3| + 4$. This implies that the first graph was vertically stretched by ${1\over4}$, horizontally stretched by ${1\over2}$ and vertically shifted up by 3 units. Since we did not get the same answer, I'm assuming at least one of us are wrong. I'm pretty confident I'm right but so is my friend.

1209619,Proof of a tensor identity involved in the derivation of the Einstein field equations?,"On the wikipedia page for the einstein-hilbert action, the section for the derivation of the einstein field equations cites this identity: $$ \sqrt{g} \nabla_\mu A^\mu = \partial_\mu (\sqrt{g} A^\mu) $$
Where $g$ is the determinant of the metric tensor, $\nabla_\mu$ is the covariant derivative, $\partial_\mu$ is the ordinary derivative with respect to the $x^\mu$ coordinate, $A^\mu$ is an arbitrary rank 1 tensor, Einstein summation notation is implied.  So I tryed to prove this and started by first expanding the right side: $$ \partial_\mu (\sqrt{g} A^\mu) = \frac{\partial_\mu g}{2\sqrt{g}} + \sqrt{g}\partial_\mu A^\mu = \sqrt{g}(\frac{\partial_\mu g}{2g}A^\mu + \partial_\mu A^\mu) $$
From here one must simply show that the expression in parentheses is equal to the definition of $\nabla_\mu A^\mu$ which is $$ \partial_\mu A^\mu + \Gamma^\mu_{\mu \nu} A^\nu $$ Since we see both terms have the partial derivatives we just have to prove that $$\frac{\partial_\mu g}{2g}A^\mu = \Gamma^\mu_{\mu \nu}A^\nu $$ or $$ \frac{\partial_\nu g}{g} = g^{\mu \alpha}(\partial_\mu g_{\nu \alpha} + \partial_\nu g_{\mu \alpha} - \partial_\alpha g_{\mu \nu})$$ I've tried this by plugging in the definition of the metric tensor's determinant both in tensor notation and fully written out.

$$ When $m=n=1$, the result is well-known: $F$ is either a constant function, or locally $z\mapsto z^n$.

When $m,n>1$, maybe there's no complete classification, but I want some partial results. Thoughts: Maybe we can view the problem formally. Instead of holomorphic maps, we can consider formal power series, especially when $n=1$. Weierstrass preparation theorem might work.

It is a line for $n=1$, a plane for $n=2$ and hyperplane for higher dimensional input spaces. Is there such an interpretation as well when $f$ is a vector function where $m>1$? When this is the case and $f(x)=(u_1(x),\dots,u_m(x))^T$, then the definition of the derivative defines separate linear approximations for each $u_i(x)$ component of $f(x)$ via the each row of the partial derivative matrix $D_{f(a)}$. This looks like a straightforward expansion of the scalar case to vector valued functions. But I cannot imagine a geometric justification of this like in the scalar case (where $m=1$).

1209985,About the differential notation in measure theory,"Is there any good reason for which integrating according to a measure includes a $\mathrm d$ as in $\int f\mathrm d\mu$ ? Or is it just a manner to keep formal consistency with the traditional notation for integration ? Among others, this notation suggests the possibility of ""formal differentials of measures"" like in $\mathrm d \nu = f \mathrm d\mu$ and of course this is consistent with the definition of the radon-nikodym derivative $f = \frac{\mathrm d\nu}{\mathrm d\mu}$. But precisely I'm wondering if there any good reason to speak of a ""derivative"" here. Broadly speaking the notion of derivation generally implies linearity and Leibnitz's product rule but here I cannot see how one could make sense of this (with $\times$ the product of measures ): $\frac{\mathrm d(\nu_1 \times \nu_2)}{\mathrm d\mu} = \nu_1 \times \frac{\mathrm d\nu_2}{\mathrm d\mu} + \frac{\mathrm d\nu_1}{\mathrm d\mu} \times \nu_2$ given that neither of the members of this equation seems defined. Are they other products on measures ? Are the name ""the radon-nikodym derivative"" and the notations $f = \frac{d\nu}{d\mu}$ and $\nu(A) = \int_A f \mathrm d\mu$ better in any sense than if it would have been called ""the radon-nikodym transform"" and written down $f = RN_{\mu}(\nu)$ and $\nu = f \bullet \mu$ ? Or do we know similarities that suggest that there is a good reason for this? Edit Rethinking about it I realize that equality $\frac{\mathrm d \nu}{\mathrm d \mu} \cdot \frac{\mathrm d \mu}{\mathrm d \lambda} = \frac{\mathrm d \nu}{\mathrm d \lambda}$
suggests some algebraic behaviour not implied by my notation. However this simply implies a quotient, not a derivative.
So we may speak of the ""Radon Nikodym quotient"" and write
$\frac{\nu}{\mu} \cdot \frac{\mu}{\lambda} = \frac{\nu}{\lambda}$. Now let us go a step further. What can we say about $\frac{\mathrm d(\nu_1 \times \nu_2)}{\mathrm d(\mu_1 \times \mu_2)}$ (with $\nu_1 \ll \mu_1$ and $\nu_2 \ll \mu_2$)? My guess is that we have:
$$\frac{\mathrm d(\nu_1 \times \nu_2)}{\mathrm d(\mu_1 \times \mu_2)} = \frac{\mathrm d\nu_1}{\mathrm d\mu_1} \otimes \frac{\mathrm d\nu_2}{\mathrm d\mu_2}$$
which strongly supports the quotient notation:
$$\frac{\nu_1 \times \nu_2}{\mu_1 \times \mu_2} = \frac{\nu_1}{\mu_1} \otimes \frac{\nu_2}{\mu_2}$$
In the end I really feel $\int$ and $\mathrm d$ where kept for historical reasons. And that is quite unfortunate because it seems to be a false good idea.","['derivatives', 'notation', 'measure-theory']"

1210148,Explain densities to me please!,"When it comes to integration on manifolds, I speak two languages. The first is of course the language of differential forms, which is something I am relatively well acquainted with. The second language is what is often used in general relativity books that follow a rather traditionalist viewpoint (eg. no explicit usage of modern differential geometry, just coordinate and index-based tensor-analysis with ""funky coordinates""), which try to define ""tensor densities"" as indexed objects that pick up some power of the jacobian determinant during coordinate change, in addition to the usual jacobian matrices on the tensor indexes. It is then stated that these ""densities"" can be integrated invariantly. These concepts generally do not come with any rigorous, or even semi-rigorous explanation, just stated and then used without much thought. In time I came to understand ""scalar densities"" as the single independent component of a top-order differential form expressed in some coordinate basis, seeing as this component transforms by picking up the jacobian determinant, which comes directly from the skew-symmetric properties of the differential form, as well as the fact that a top-order form has one independent component only. On the other hand, I have been told by a mathematician whose Lie-groups course I have been attending that densities are perfectly well defined mathematical objects that can be used to integrate on manifolds that aren't orientable. I understand the general idea behind densities, but I have no idea how to rigorously define objects like these, neither do I know how any concrete density even ""looks like"". I mean, if someone asked me the same thing I am asking here, but with differential forms, I would Explain to them algebraic exterior forms on finite dimensional vector spaces, exterior products, etc. Show them that on a tangent space of a differential manifold, any exterior form can be written as a linear combination of wedge products of coordinate differentials, eg. $\mathrm{d}x^\mu$ . Define fields of these objects by either showing what it means for a $p\mapsto\omega_p$ assignment ( $p\in M$ , $\omega_p\in\Lambda^kT^*_pM$ ) to vary smoothly or by ""bundle-izing"" exterior products of cotangent spaces over the manifold. Define the exterior derivative and show how it works. Show that an integral of $k$ -differential form over a $k$ -dimensional submanifold of $M$ is independent of coordinates, basically by defining ( $k=n$ for simplicity) $$ \int_\mathcal{D}\omega=\int_\mathcal{D}F\mathrm{d}x^1\wedge...\wedge\mathrm{d}x^n=\int_{\Psi(\mathcal{D})}F(x^1...x^n)dx^1...dx^n, $$ where $\Psi$ is the coordinate map, and the right side is a standard Riemann-integral or an integral against the standard Lebesgue-measure of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\omega=F\mathrm{d}x^1\wedge...\wedge\mathrm{d}x^n$ , and then showing that if I change the coordinates, everything in the integral transforms in such way that the value of the integral stays the same. Questions: How do I (mostly) rigorously define and construct a density on a manifold and how does it look like? (Eg. like, a differential $n$ -form on an $n$ -dimensional manifold, when expressed in a chart looks like $\omega=F\mathrm{d}x^1\wedge...\wedge\mathrm{d}x^n$ , where $F$ is a scalar function, plus I'd appreciate a similar explanation to what I outlined above for difforms). How are they related to measures? I mean, as an example, I thought about the following:
As far as I am aware, every smooth non-orientable manifold is locally orientable, so I guess if I take a differential form defined in some chart, $F\mathrm{d}x^1\wedge...\wedge\mathrm{d}x^n$ (so that the basis $n$ -form is nonvanishing) and then define a measure as $$ \mu_x(\mathcal{D})=\left|\int_\mathcal{D}\mathrm{d}x^1\wedge...\wedge\mathrm{d}x^n\right| ,$$ then this case the integral $$ \int_\mathcal{D}Fd\mu_x $$ makes sense in the chart in a way that is independent of coordinates, because if I change the coordinates, I first transform the differential form, then construct another measure $\mu_y$ , then extend this via a partition of unity, but this isn't really explicit in the sense that I don't think $$F\ d\mu_x $$ is a well defined object without the integral symbol, and I am not even sure what I'm doing here is even correct.","['smooth-manifolds', 'differential-forms', 'measure-theory', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

Define $ S[a,b] $ as the set of all step functions on [a,b] with values in X. We have a very obvious definition of Riemann integral for such a function, where we take values of the function on subintervals, multiplied by the length of the corresponding subinterval and sum all of those. The function $ I $ which to a step function $ f $ assings a value $ I(f) $ as described above is linear and continuous on $ S[a,b] $ as a subspace of the Banach space of bounded function from $ [a,b] $ to $ X $, so we can uniquely extend $ I $ to a linear operator on the closure of $ S[a,b] $. So $ I $ gives us a notion of integrability. Continuous functions are clearly integrable according to the construction above, so all's fine up to this point. But for this to be a proper generalisation, we would need functions continuous almost-everywhere to be integrable(at least when $ X = \mathbb{R} $), so possible to approximate uniformly by step functions, which is not the case. I thought about using topology of pointwise convergence instead of topology of uniform convergence induced by the typical norm on the space of bounded functions. But from what I've found, we can approximate almost-everywhere continuous functions with step functions almost-everywhere, but not everywhere, so even with this topology these functions might not be integrable. Is there a simple way to fix this construction to make almost-everywhere continuous real-valued functions integrable? Or is there a different way to define the integral which will work better?","['analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'integration']"
1210267,Does this series $\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{4}{3^n}$ diverge or converge?,"I a newbie to series, and I have not done too much yet. I have an exercise where I have basically to say if some series are convergent or divergent. If convergent, determine (and prove) the sum of the series. This is the first series: $$\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{4}{3^i}$$ I have heard about the ratio test , so I decided to try to apply it in this case to see if the series is or not convergent. The ratio test is basically defined like this: $$L = \lim{\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|}$$ Where $a_n$ is in this case $\frac{4}{3^n}$ and $a_{n+1}$ is consequently $\frac{4}{3^{n+1}}$. Thus, we have: $$L = \lim{\left|\frac{\frac{4}{3^{n+1}}}{\frac{4}{3^n}}\right|} = \lim{\left|\frac{4 \cdot 3^n}{3^{n+1} \cdot 4}\right|} = \lim{\left|\frac{3^n}{3^{n+1}}\right|} = \lim{\left|\frac{3^n}{3^n\cdot 3}\right|} = \lim{\left|\frac{1}{3}\right|} = \frac{1}{3} < 1$$ From the ratio test , we know if $L< 1$, then the series converges. Now, I need to find the sum. I have followed a video which explain how to find the sum using the ratio , which sincerely I have not understand well what it is. Can you explain a general rule to find the ratio, and what exactly is it? Ok. So, following the same process done during the video, I have: $$\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{4}{3^n} = 4 \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{1}{3^n} = 4 \sum_{i=0}^n \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n$$ Apparently, our ratio $r$ is $\frac{1}{3}$. Now, to find the sum of the series, he uses a formula: $$\frac{\text{first term}}{1 - r}$$ Where first term is the first term of the series. Can you explain where this formula comes from? Applying that formula, we obtain: $$\frac{\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^0}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{3}{2}$$ I checked the sum using a online calculator, and apparently it is not $\frac{3}{2}$, so I decided to manipulate, and I thought I left a $4$ outside the series, so I multiply that $4$ by $\frac{3}{2}$, which produces $\frac{12}{2} = 6$, which is exactly the sum I found using 2 online calculators. Now, my 3rd question is: why what I did is correct (or not correct)?","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'divergent-series', 'convergence-divergence']"
1210278,Curvature of a principal bundle and the exterior covariant derivative,"Let $P\to M$ a principal fibre bundle with fibre $G$, and let $A\in \Omega^{1}(P)\otimes\mathfrak{g}$ be a connection on $P$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $G$. Associated to every connection there is a curvature $F\in\Omega^{2}(P)\otimes\mathfrak{g}$ defined as $F = DA$ where $D\colon \Omega^{r}(P)\otimes\mathfrak{g}\to \Omega^{r+1}(P)\otimes\mathfrak{g}$ defined as $D\Omega(X_{1},\dots, X_{r+1}) = d\Omega(X^{H}_{1},\dots, X^{H}_{r+1})$. The superscript $H$ denotes the projection to the horizontal distribution given by the connection and $d\colon  \colon \Omega^{r}(P)\to \Omega^{r+1}(P)$. Now, $F$ induces (using local sections), a two form $\mathcal{F}\in\Omega^{2}(M;\mathrm{ad} P)$ taking values in the adjoint bundle of $P$, which is a vector bundle of rank $dim\, \mathfrak{g}$. The two-form $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies $\mathcal{D}\mathcal{F} = d\mathcal{F} + [\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F}] = 0$ where $\mathcal{A}$ is the local form of the connection one-form $A$. The two-form $\mathcal{F}$ is a particular case of a form taking values in a vector bundle with a connection. For this kind of forms there is a natural derivative $d_{\nabla}$, the exterior covariant derivative. In the case of $\mathcal{F}$ the vector bundle is $\mathrm{ad}\, P$ and the connection $\nabla$ is the induced on the adjoint bundle by $A$. My question is, what is the relation between $\mathcal{D}$ and $d_{\nabla}$? Are they the same? Thanks.","['differential-geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'connections', 'fiber-bundles']"
1210284,Abel's theorem for the derivative of a power series,"Suppose $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function, $(a_0, a_1, \dots)$ is a sequence of real numbers and $x_*$ is a positive real number, such that the following two conditions hold: for all $x \in (-x_*, x_*)$, the power series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n$ converges to $f(x)$ and $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n {x_*}^n$ converges. Abel's theorem tells us that
$$
\lim_{\substack{x \rightarrow x_* \\ x < x_*}} f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n {x_*}^n
$$ Suppose $f$ is continuous from the left at $x_*$. It is a standard result that $f$ is differentiable inside $(-x_*, x_*)$ and that for every $x \in (-x^*, x^*)$, the series $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty n a_n x^{n - 1}$ converges to $f'(x)$. Suppose the last series converges at $x_*$ as well, and denote this sum by $s$. Is it the case that $f$ is differentiable from the left at $x_*$? Suppose $f$ happens to be differentiable from the left at $x_*$. Is it the case that $f'(x^*) = s$, where the derivative is the left-sided one?","['power-series', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'derivatives']"

  $$\int |f_n - f| \longrightarrow 0.$$ To me, the question ""makes sense"" since $\int |f_n - f| \longrightarrow 0$ implies $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int |f_n - f| = 0,$ and $|f_n - f|$ is approaching zero as $n$ is approaching infinity, therefore the integral is approaching zero.

1210341,What's an intuition behind $\lambda=1$ for $dx\;dy = \lambda r\;dr\;d\theta$?,"I've read a bunch of articles here on converting between rectangular and polar coordinates in integrals. I get the intuition about how the natural infinitesimal area segment in rectangular coordinates is an infinitesimal square (ergo $dx\;dy$) but is an infinitesimal chunk of an annulus in polar coordinates (ergo $r\;d\theta\cdot dr$). What I don't get is why we can just swap the two out without some kind of scaling factor. That is, why is it that if we write $dx\;dy = \lambda{}r\;dr\;d\theta$, we have $\lambda=1$? E.g., when I imagine making $\theta$ infinitesimal first, the infinitesimally thin sector in polar coordinates has area $\frac{1}{2}r^{2}\theta$ whereas the rectangle with infinitesimal height has area $xy \approx r^2\theta$ since the part of the sector falling outside the rectangle vanishes and what we're left with is practically a triangle within the rectangle. In other words, the rectangular coordinate area is twice that of the polar coordinate area. If we look at the infinitesimal band of the annulus at the end (i.e., looking at the ""crust"" of the ""pie slice""), won't that cause the part of the sector falling outside the rectangle to play a dominant role again? Why would that just happen to have the same area as a rectangle with the same infinitesimal width? I've read that this is ""explained"" by using the Jacobian in converting between rectangular and polar coordinates since the determinant of the Jacobian is $r$ and not $\lambda r$ for some $\lambda \neq 1$. But this doesn't really inform my intuition. I get that the Jacobian of a function $f$ at $p$ is $f$'s best linear approximation at $p$, but I don't get why the thing to do here is to take its determinant and inject that into an integral when you're switching between coordinate systems. And that seems so much more general than what I'm looking for here. Is it actually necessary to understand all square Jacobians to get why the infinitesimal areas of rectangular and polar coordinates just happen to be equal? So$\ldots$ why is $\lambda=1$?","['infinitesimals', 'multivariable-calculus']"

1210488,Personal Experiences with Probability Simulation,"Simulations methods are increasingly used in theoretical and (especially) applied probability. Personally, I have used simulation for purposes that range from recreational Q&A to applications of considerable practical importance. Examples include (a) discovering
that 'solutions' to combinatorial problems are clearly wrong, (b) checking the practical usefulness of bounds, and (c) multidimensional integration with MCMC
methods where it seems simulation is the only feasible path to an answer. For teaching simulation, I would very much like to have a collection of specific applications of probability simulation methods from people at various mathematical levels and in various areas of the mathematical and other sciences. Your personal accounts of specific, actual uses of probability simulation would be much appreciated. Some applications might be bootstrap, permutation test, MCMC, Gibbs sampling, Metropolis-Hastings, but many others. (I am not especially interested here in philosophical comments on the nature of randomness, the quality of PRNGs, or uses of software for exact probability computations that don't involve simulation--all perhaps useful discussion for another venue.)","['economics', 'statistics', 'mathematical-physics', 'simulation', 'probability']"
1210491,"Standard deviation of mean of a set of numbers, which are imprecise","I have a problem which seems very simple, but for some reason I can not find out what I have to do exactly. Let's say I have a set of derived values, where each of them has an individual error:
    $$X_{all}=(x_1 \pm \sigma_{x_1}, x_2 \pm \sigma_{x_2}, ..., x_n \pm \sigma_{x_n})$$
(where $\sigma_i$ stands for the standard deviation). Now I want to have the average value of $X_{all}$ and some confidence of that value. The average is of course: $X_{avg}=\frac{1}{N}\sum x_i$ But for the standard deviation of $X_{avg}$, I dont know what I should use. There are two possibilities that seem neccesary: 1) From error-propagation: $$\sigma_{X_{avg}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_i \sigma_{x_i}^2}$$ 2) Normal standard-deviation when creating a mean value: $$\sigma_{X_{avg}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_i (x_i-X_{avg})^2}$$ Concrete Example: I perform a measurement to get the value $X$. In order to get a statistical significant knowlegde about $X$ and its standard deviation, I perform the measurement n times, leading to the results $x_i$. However, I can not measure $x_i$ directly, but only $y_i=x_i+BG$, where BG is a background value. For each measurement of $y_i$, I automatically get the information about $BG$ 1000 times, which gives me $BG_{avg}$ and $\sigma_{BG}$ for each $y_i$ ($BG$ is gauss distributed). Now I have $x_i = y_i - BG_{avg}$, thus I get a $\sigma_{x_i}=\sigma_{BG}$. Other Concrete Example: I want to know the average of the lap-time of a racing car. I measure 100 laps. However, I know my clock has an uncertainty $\sigma_{clock}$. Moreover, for some reason I use for each lap a different clock with a different uncertainty $\sigma_{clock_i}$. So I get 100 times $t_i$ for the time in lap $i$, with an uncertainty of $\sigma_{clock_i}$, corresponding to the uncertainty I introduce due to the clock itself. What is my uncertainty of the average lap-time of the racing car?","['statistics', 'stochastic-processes']"
