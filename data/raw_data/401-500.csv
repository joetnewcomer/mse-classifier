2755,Why can you turn clothing right-side-out?,"My nephew was folding laundry, and turning the occasional shirt right-side-out. I showed him a  ""trick"" where I turned it right-side-out by pulling the whole thing through a sleeve instead of the bottom or collar of the shirt. He thought it was really cool (kids are easily amused, and so am I). So he learned that you can turn a shirt or pants right-side-out by pulling the material through any hole, not just certain ones. I told him that even if there was a rip in the shirt, you could use that to turn it inside-out or right-side-out, and he was fascinated by this and asked ""why?"" I don't really know the answer to this. Why is this the case? What if the sleeves of a long-sleeve shirt were sewn together at the cuff, creating a continuous tube from one sleeve to the other? Would you still be able to turn it right-side-out? Why? What properties must a garment have so that it can be turned inside-out and right-side-out? Sorry if this is a lame question, but I've always wondered. I wouldn't even know what to google for, so that is why I am asking here. If you know the answer to this, could you please put it into layman's terms? Update: Wow, I really appreciate all the participation. This is a really pleasant community and I have learned a lot here. It seems that the answer is that you need at least one puncture in the garment through which to push or pull the fabric. It appears that you can have certain handles, although it's not usually practical with clothing due to necessary stretching. Accepted (a while ago actually -- sorry for not updating sooner) Dan's answer because among the answers that I understand, it is the highest ranked by this community.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"

2791,Binomial coefficients: how to prove an inequality on the $p$-adic valuation?,"In section 4 of the article by Afred van der Poorten's A Proof That Euler Missed ... the following inequality is used: $$\nu_{p}\displaystyle\binom{n}{m}\leq\left\lfloor\dfrac{\ln n}{\ln p}\right\rfloor-\nu_{p}(m)\qquad(\ast)$$ ( In the original denoted $\text{ord}$ $_{p}(\cdot)$ instead of $\nu_p(\cdot)$). where $\nu_{p}(k)$ is the $p$-adic valuation of $k\in\mathbb{Q}$, i. e. the exponent of the prime $p$ in the prime factorization of $k$. 
I know some properties of the foor function and that $$\nu_{p}(a/b)=\nu_{p}(a)-\nu_{p}(b),$$ $$\nu_{p}(a\cdot b)=\nu_{p}(a)\cdot \nu_{p}(b)$$ and $$\nu_{p}(n!)=\displaystyle\sum_{i\geq 1}\left\lfloor \dfrac{n}{p^{i}}\right\rfloor $$ but I didn't convince myself on the correct argument I should use to prove $(\ast )$.

2815,Find taxicab numbers in $O(n)$ time,"This is a final exam question in my algorithms class: $k$ is a taxicab number if $k = a^3+b^3=c^3+d^3$, and $a,b,c,d$ are distinct positive integers. Find all taxicab numbers $k$ such that $a,b,c,d < n$ in $O(n)$ time. I don't know if the problem had a typo or not, because $O(n^3)$ seems more reasonable. The best I can come up with is $O(n^2 \log n)$, and that's the best anyone I know can come up with. The $O(n^2 \log n)$ algorithm: Try all possible $a^3+b^3=k$ pairs, for each $k$, store $(k,1)$ into a binary tree(indexed by $k$) if $(k,i)$ doesn't exist, if $(k,i)$ exists, replace $(k,i)$ with $(k,i+1)$ Transverse the binary tree, output all $(k,i)$ where $i\geq 2$ Are there any faster methods? This should be the best possible method without using any number theoretical result because the program might output $O(n^2)$ taxicab numbers. Is $O(n)$ even possible? One have to prove there are only $O(n)$ taxicab numbers lesser than $2n^3$ in order to prove there exist a $O(n)$ algorithm. Edit : The professor admit it was a typo, it should have been $O(n^3)$.

I don't need to be able to discern between tangent or running through a circle, I just need to be able to discern between the line segment making contact with the circle in any way and no contact. If the line segment enters but does not exit the circle (if the circle contains an endpoint), that meets my specs for it making contact. In short, I need a function to find if any point of a line segment lies in or on a given circle. EDIT: My application is that I'm using the circle as a proximity around a point. I'm basically testing if one point is within R distance of any point in the line segment. And it must be a line segment, not a line.",['geometry']

2851,Constructing an Extrusion between two non-parallel planes,"I am crossposting this question from Stack Overflow since it is more math then programming related. In Reference to my question about projecting a planar Polygon to a plane, i came to another problem. I want to project a base contour which is aligned to the x-y-plane along a projection vector from from a point P1 to a point P2. This already works, but now i also need to change the alignment of my base contour using the position of P1  and two vectors defining the new alignement base's x and y should be transformed to. I want to use a transformation matrix M for this, which premultiplied to my projecton matrix p should give me the transformation matrix from a vertex v in the base contour to a vertex v' on the projection plane such as v' = (P x M) * v So, my question is: How to create a transformation matrix which transforms a vertex v relative to a coordinate system with O = (0,0,0), xdir = (1,0,0), and ydir = (0,1,0) to a vertex relative to a coordinate system with O'=(ox, oy, oz) and xdir and ydir as two arbitrary perpendicular unit vectors?

2864,Area of a triangle $\propto\pi-\alpha-\beta-\gamma$,"A hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidian geometry with constant negative curvature. It has the property that given a line and a point, many lines can be drawn containing the point that never meet the given line. The picture below (Circle Limit by M.C.Escher) is a conformal map of hyperbolic geometry to Euclidian plane. How do you show that in a space with hyperbolic geometry, area of a triangle with angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ is $\Delta\propto\pi-\alpha-\beta-\gamma$? A similar result exists for sphere: $\Delta=R^2(\alpha+\beta+\gamma-\pi)$. I could prove this, but I suspect my proof cannot be modified for hyperbolic geometry.

2865,Is a direct limit of topological groups always a topological group?,"If $(G_i,f_{ij})$ is a direct system of topological groups, is it always the case that the  topological\group-theoretical direct limit $G:=\varinjlim_iG_i$ is a topological group? (The topology on $G$ is the final topology with respect to the canonical homomorphisms $\psi_i:G_i\rightarrow G$). It is immediate from the group structure on $G$ and the definition of its topology that the inversion map is continuous. Moreover, I'm pretty certain that if the transition maps $f_{ij}$ are open, then the $\psi_i$ are open, and this gives continuity of multiplication. It's not at all clear to me that this condition is necessary though. I have always sort of assumed that this was true, but it's never really been an issue because I never start with a system of topological groups and take the direct limit; I always have a topological group and express it as a direct limit (e.g. the idele group of a global field, or the Cartier dual of a finite free $\mathbb{Z}_p$-module).","['general-topology', 'topological-groups']"
2869,Is there an analytic solution for the density function of this complex random variable?,"The process below yields a distribution of ""response times"" (RT), and I'd like to know if there is an analytic solution to obtain the density function of this distribution. An RT is recorded at the earliest time ($t_1$) at which a function, $f(t)$, reaches a threshold. The threshold varies across iterations of the process according to a random uniform distribution with bounds specified by the parameters $P_1$ and $P_2$. $f(t)$ begins at $t=0$ and has a form whose derivative is defined by the function $g(t)$: $$g(t) = P_3\left (\frac{P_4}{P_4+P_5}\right )\left (1-\exp\left [-(P_4+P_5)\int_{0}^{t}h(s)ds\right ]\right )$$ where $h(t)$ is defined as: $$h(t) = P_6\Gamma(t,P_8,n)[1 - \Gamma(t-P_7,P_9,n)]$$ and the gamma function defined as: $$\Gamma(t,\beta,n) = 1- \left ( e^{-\beta t} \right )\left ( \sum_{n-1}^{j=0} \frac{(\beta t)^{j}}{j!}  \right )$$ So, there are in total 10 parameters in the process: $P_1$ through $P_9$, and $n$. I could of course perform a Euler simulation to generate a distribution of RT values for given a particular set of 10 parameter values, but it would be nice to avoid this because I'm hoping to use a Nelder–Mead search algorithm to find the set of 10 parameter values that maximizes the likelihood of a set of observed RT data points, and it really slows down the search if I have to compute estimates of the density function for every candidate set of parameter values. Thanks for any help you're able to provide! Pursuant to comments, here is a further description of the process: The process is an adaptation of the model presented by Smith & Racliff ( PDF ) which models perception, attention and decision in the context of a speeded detection task. Function $h(t)$ models perception: accumulation of information about a brief visual stimulus. Function $g(t)$ models the transfer of this information to memory via attention, and function $h(t)$ is a linear ballistic decision process in the vein of Brown & Heathcote ( PDF ). I thought that supplementing an LBA as the decision mechanism in place of Smith & Ratcliff's diffusion process might simplify the derivation of the final density function. $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the upper and lower bounds of the random uniform threshold.
$P_3$ is the asymptote of $g(t)$.
$P_4$ is the intensity of the stimulus.
$P_5$ is the intensity of the background.
$P_6$ is the amplitude of the stimulus.
$P_7$ is the duration of the stimulus.
$P_8$ is the rate at which the stimulus comes on.
$P_9$ is the rate at which the stimulus turns off. Smith & Ratcliff (2009) note that $n$ might be reasonably fixed to a value of 3, so possibly that can further simplify things. Additionally, while Smith & Ratcliff sought to fit their model to different stimulus intensities, I don't need this particular feature, so I'm not sure if I need parameters $P_4$ and $P_5$ (though I'm not sure how to properly remove them either).","['functional-analysis', 'stochastic-processes', 'functions', 'gamma-function', 'probability']"
2879,Mapping natural numbers into prime-exponents space,"Take any natural number $n$, and factor it as $n=2^{e_1} 3^{e_2} 5^{e_3} ... p^{e_i}$, 
where $i$ is the $i$-th prime.
Now map $n$ to the point $n \mapsto (e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_i,0,\ldots)$, where $i$ is the last prime in the factorization
of $n$.
For example, 
$$n=123456789
\mapsto
(0,2,\ldots,1,\ldots,1,\ldots)$$ 
because $123456789=2^0 3^2 \cdots 3607^1 \cdots 3803^1$.
So every number in $\mathbb{N}$ is mapped to a point in an arbitrarily high dimensional space.
This mapping has the property that addition of the vectors corresponds to multiplication of
the numbers. My (extremely vague!) question is: Does this viewpoint helps gain any insights into the 
structure/properties of natural numbers?
Do line/planes/curves in this space mark out numerically interesting regions?
Perhaps allowing real or complex numbers?
The numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ fill this infinite-dimensional space very sparsely. This is (very!) far from my research expertise, so any comments/references/links would be appreciated.","['prime-numbers', 'number-theory']"

2943,Schur–Zassenhaus exercise: coprime subgroup contained in a complement,"Exercise 3B.4 on page 84 of Isaacs's Finite Group Theory asks one to prove a precursor of the Sylow theorems for $π$-subgroups, and I only know how to do it using the Sylow theorems, so I have missed the point.  I actually needed a similar (false) statement in my research, so I thought it would be wise to get the point. Suppose $G$ is a finite group, and $N$ is a normal subgroup whose index and order are coprime.  Let $U$ be a subgroup of $G$ whose order is coprime to the order of $N$.  If either N or $U$ is solvable, then show that $U$ is contained in some subgroup $H$ whose order is the index of $N$ in $G$. Available tools: We already have Schur–Zassenhaus, and so we know that $G$ has a subgroup whose order is the index of $N$. In other words, if $G$ has a normal Hall $π$-subgroup, then every $π′$-subgroup is contained in some Hall $π′$-subgroup.  However Hall subgroups are the next section, and containment and $π$-separability are even in the section after that, so appealing to Hall's generalization of Sylow's theorem will miss the point. Attempt: Let $M$ be a maximal subgroup of $G$ containing $U$.  If $N$ is not contained in $M$, then $M∩N$ is a normal subgroup of $M$ whose order is coprime to its index, and so we can find $H ≤ M$ with $U ≤ H$ and $|H| = [M:M∩N]=[G:N]$, and we are done. If $N$ is contained in every maximal subgroup of $G$ containing $U$, then $\ldots$ . It'd be nice if $N$ was in the Frattini, but that's not true.

Cayley's theorem ensures that these two definitions are equivalent: any abstract group acts as a collection of permutations of its underlying set, and this action is faithful. Similarly, rings can be defined abstractly as sets with a pair of binary operations satisfying certain identities, or concretely as a collection of endomorphisms of an abelian group.  There is a ""Cayley's theorem"" here as well: any abstract ring acts as a collection of endomorphisms of its underlying abelian group, and this action is faithful. The situation for Lie algebras seems much less clear to me.  The adjoint representation is not generally faithful, and Ado's theorem comes with qualifications and doesn't have the simplicity of the two theorems above.  For me, the problem is that I don't have a good sense of what the concrete definition of a Lie algebra is supposed to be. I suspect that a good concrete definition of a Lie algebra is as a space of derivations on some algebra closed under commutator.  In that case, is it correct to say that a Lie algebra acts faithfully as derivations on its universal enveloping algebra?  Is this a good analogue of Cayley's theorem? (Motivation: in the books on Lie algebras I have read, the authors verify that Lie algebras which occur in nature satisfy alternativity and the Jacobi identity, but I have never seen any simple justification that these axioms are ""enough"" in the same way that Cayley's theorem tells you that the axioms for a group or a ring are ""enough.""  There is just Ado's theorem which, again, comes with qualifications and is hard.)","['lie-algebras', 'abstract-algebra']"

A few years later I was a TA for a course where the problem was assigned.  I still didn't know how to solve it, nor did any of my students.  If you can give me a simple answer, my gratefulness will far outweigh my embarrassment. Define $f(z)=z\sin(\frac{1}{z})$ on the punctured plane.  What is the image under $f$ of a (small) punctured disk at the origin? Remarks: The corresponding problem for $\sin(\frac{1}{z})$ is straightforward to solve using the definition of $\sin$ in terms of exponentials, the fact that $\exp$ is onto the punctured plane, and periodicity.  The answer in this case is the whole plane. The corresponding problem for $z\cos(\frac{1}{z})$ is straightforward to solve using Picard's theorem, because the oddness of the function implies that 0 is the only possible excluded point, and it is easy to see that 0 is in the image by taking reciprocals of large zeros of $\cos$.  Thus the answer in this case is also the whole plane. (The same argument could be applied to the previous remark, but there no big theorems are needed.  Perhaps Picard's theorem isn't needed here either.) Another part of the problem I couldn't solve generalizes this, taking $z^n\sin(\frac{1}{z})$ when $n$ is a positive integer.  When $n$ is even, there is no problem, because the argument from the previous remark applies.  But I don't know how to solve it when $n$ is odd. By Picard's theorem, there is at most one point missing. I would be surprised if there is a point missing, but I have no argument to back up this expectation. Although an elementary argument would be nice, I do not care whether the argument is ""appropriate"" for what is covered up to that point in the text.  This is pure curiosity.",['complex-analysis']
3170,Why do we need noetherianness (or something like it) for Serre's criterion for affineness?,"Serre's criterion for affineness (Hartshorne III.3.7) states that: Let $X$ be a noetherian scheme. Suppose $H^1(X, \mathcal{F})= 0$ for every quasi-coherent sheaf on $X$. Then $X$ is affine. There is a more general statement (EGA II.5.2.1) that reaches the same conclusion with the hypothesis that $X$ is a separated quasi-compact scheme or one where the topological space is noetherian. I don't, however, understand why we need these hypotheses.  The idea of the proof is to find a set of $g_i \in \Gamma(X, O_X)$ generating the unit ideal and such that the $X_{g_i}$ are affine.  This can be done by showing the $X_{g_i}$ form a basis at each closed point using the cohomology statement (an argument which I'm pretty sure works without any conditions on the scheme). Then, you take open affine sets of the form $X_f$ containing each closed point and take their union; this is an open set whose complement is closed and must contain no closed point, hence is empty. This part of the argument relies on the fact that every closed subset contains a closed point, a fact which is true under noetherian hypotheses since a scheme is a $T_0$-space. But isn't it true that every quasi-compact $T_0$  space has a closed point? A minimal closed set must be reduced to a point. So I'm unclear why ""quasi-compactness"" alone is not enough. (It shouldn't be enough. Grothendieck is not one to mince hypotheses!) Questions: Where does the standard argument break down for schemes which are only quasi-compact? Is this true if $X$ is only quasi-separated and quasi-compact? (Are there counterexamples otherwise?)","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

However, the answer given is that we are looking at pairs of people with at least one born on Tuesday (13 out of 49) and only one of these pairs has both people born on the same day, so the answer is 1 in 13. If by ""given one was born on Tuesday"", you mean that we the birthdays of the two people are uniformly distributed between all possible pairs where at least one was born on a Tuesday"", then this analysis is correct. However, the question stated just says that we are ""given"" this fact. It doesn't explain how we came to know this fact. Lets suppose someone blurted this fact out randomly. Generally it wouldn't be because they looked at groups of people and discarded them until they found a pair where at least one was born on a Tuesday. Instead, I think it would be better to model it as someone randomly getting a pair of people, then making a true statement about them. For simplicity, we will assume they statements are of the form: ""One of these people was born on a (INSERT DAY)"". We will assume that if they were born on different days, each is equally likely. In this model, the statement that someone was born on a Tuesday actually makes no difference to the chance they were born on the same day.

3329,Parametrizing implicit algebraic curves,"Back in the day, I was absolutely enthralled by the study of plane curves and their properties (I have Lockwood and Zwikker to thank). I learned early on that for the purposes of generating plots on a computer (and for that matter deducing equations of ""derived curves"" and determining other special properties), one should try to find a representation in parametric equations for your plane curve. As I recall, in dealing with algebraic curves represented by an implicit Cartesian equation, I knew of only three tricks to derive parametric equations from an implicit equation (listed in decreasing order of effectiveness; I note that I did all these investigations even before I knew computer algebra systems existed): 1: Convert to polar coordinates to express in the form $r=r(\theta)$; the parametric equations are then $\begin{align*}x&=r(\theta)\cos\,\theta\\y&=r(\theta)\sin\,\theta\end{align*}$ 2: The $y=mx$ ""trick"" (I never did get to learn the formal name for this technique); to use the implicit equation for the folium of Descartes as an example: $x^3+y^3=3xy$ $x^3+(mx)^3=3x(mx)$ and then by solving for x and using the relation $y=mx$ again, $\begin{align*}x&=\frac{3m}{1+m^3}\\y&=\frac{3m^2}{1+m^3}\end{align*}$ (I remember this worked especially well for curves whose (only?) singular points are at the origin, but not very well for other curves; can anybody explain why?) 3: Randomly replacing x or y with any of the six trigonometric functions (maybe multiplied by a convenient constant), and hope that I can easily solve for the other variable. For instance, I managed to derive the parametric equation for the bicorn and the Dürer conchoid in this way. Probably the only other thing I learned way after I had moved on to other things was that elliptic curves can for instance be represented as parametric equations involving the Weierstrass ℘ function or the elliptic exponential, but this is apparently limited to elliptic curves only. Now for my question: did I miss any other useful (general?) methods for turning an implicit Cartesian equation for an algebraic curve into parametric equations? Addendum, 8/7/2011 I didn't want to ask a separate question, so: are there systematic methods for parametrizing a plane algebraic curve in terms of (Jacobi or Weierstrass) elliptic functions? For instance, we find here that the Fermat cubic $x^3+y^3=a^3$ can be parametrized in terms of Weierstrass functions, in addition to the elliptic curve example I gave previously. I've also encountered in my readings that the Cartesian ovals can also be parametrized with Weierstrass functions, but I have been unable to find an explicit construction of the parametric equations.","['geometry', 'plane-curves']"

3352,Positive definite Hessians from strictly convex functions,"Let $f: D \to \mathbb{R}\ $ be a function on non-singular, convex domain $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ and let us assume the second-order derivatives of $f$ exist. It is well known that $f$ is convex if and only if its Hessian $\nabla^2 f(x)$ is positive semi-definite for all $x \in D$. It is also known that if $\nabla^2 f(x)$ is positive definite for all $x \in D$, we may conclude that $f$ is strictly convex (for a reference, see Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004 ). On the other hand, if $f$ is strictly convex, we still merely know that $\nabla^2 f(x)$ is positive semi-definite for all $x \in D$. That is, there may be $x \in D$ such that $y^T \nabla^2 f(x) y = 0\ $ for some $y\not=0$. As an example, consider $f(x)=x^4$. In this case, $f$ is strictly convex, but $f''(x)=12x^2$ and, hence, $yf''(x)y=0$ for $x=0$ and $yf''(x)y>0$ for all $x\not=0$. Yet, these points that ruin the complete positive definiteness seem to be very sparsely distributed within $D$. So, my question is as follows: If $f$ is strictly convex, how can we characterize the set of points $X$ for which
  $\nabla^2f(x)$ is not positive definite for $x \in X$, and 
  $\nabla^2f(x)$ is positive definite for $x \in D \setminus X$? That is, has such a set $X$ been investigated before, what properties are known, and where can I learn more about it? Any reference is welcome. In particular, my guess is that on can state the following: Conjecture 1: The set $X$ is merely a discrete subset of $D$. EDIT: Since Conjecture 1 has obviously been disproved by George Lowther below, allow me to restate my guess as the following (less bold) statement: Conjecture 2: The set $X$ is does not contain a non-empty open ball. or, even more cautious: Conjecture 3: The set $D \setminus X$ does contain a non-empty open ball.","['convex-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

3405,Convergence of $np(n)$ where $p(n)=\sum_{j=\lceil n/2\rceil}^{n-1} {p(j)\over j}$,"Some years ago I was interested in the following Markov chain
whose state space is the positive integers. The chain begins at state ""1"", 
and from state ""n"" the chain next jumps to a state uniformly
selected from {n+1,n+2,...,2n}. As time goes on, this chain goes to infinity, with occasional
large jumps. In any case, the chain is quite unlikely to hit any
particular large n. If you define p(n) to be the probability that this chain
visits state ""n"", then p(n) goes to zero like c/n for some 
constant c. In fact, $$    np(n) \to c = {1\over 2\log(2)-1} = 2.588699. \tag1$$ In order to prove this convergence, I recast it as an analytic 
problem. Using the Markov property, you can see that the sequence
satisfies: $$   p(1)=1\quad\mbox{ and }\quad p(n)=\sum_{\lceil n/2\rceil}^{n-1} {p(j)\over j}\mbox{ for }n>1.  \tag2$$ For some weeks, using generating functions etc. I tried and failed to find
an analytic proof of the convergence in (1). Finally, at a conference
in 2003 Tom Mountford showed me a (non-trivial) probabilistic proof. So the result is true, but since then I've
continued to wonder if I missed something obvious. Perhaps there is
a standard technique for showing that (2) implies (1). Question: Is there a direct (short?, analytic?) proof of (1)? Perhaps someone who understands sequences better than I do could take a shot at this. Update: I'm digging through my old notes on this. I now remember that I had a proof (using generating functions) that if $\ np(n)$ converges, then the limit is $1\over{2\log (2)-1}$. It was the convergence that eluded me. I also found some curiosities like: $\sum_{n=1}^\infty {p(n)\over n(2n+1)}={1\over 2}.$ Another update : Here is the conditional result mentioned above. As in Qiaochu's answer, define $Q$ to be the generating function of $p(n)/n$, that is,
 $Q(t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty {p(n)\over n} t^n$ for $0\leq t<1$.
 Differentiating gives
 $$Q^\prime(t)=1+{Q(t)-Q(t^2)\over 1-t}.$$
 This is slightly different from Qiaochu's expression because
 $p(n)\neq \sum_{j=\lceil n/2\rceil}^{n-1} {p(j)\over j}$ when $n=1$,
 so that $p(1)$ has to be treated  separately. Differentiating again and multiplying by $1-t$, we get
 $$(1-t)Q^{\prime\prime}(t)=-1+2\left[Q^\prime(t)-t Q^\prime(t^2)\right],$$
 that is,
 $$(1-t)\sum_{j=0}^\infty (j+1) p(j+2) t^j =  -1+2\left[\sum_{j=1}^\infty (jp(j)) {t^j-t^{2j}\over j}\right].$$ Assume that $\lim_n np(n)=c$ exists. Letting $t\to 1$ above the left hand side gives $c$,
 while the right hand side is $-1+2c\log(2)$ and hence $c={1\over 2\log(2)-1}$. Note: $\sum_{j=1}^\infty {t^j-t^{2j}\over j}=\log(1+t).$ New update: (Sept. 2) Here's an alternative proof of the conditional result that my colleague Terry Gannon
 showed me in 2003. Start with the sum $\sum_{n=2}^{2N}\ p(n)$, substitute the formula in the title,
 exchange the variables $j$ and $n$, and rearrange to establish the identity: $${1\over 2}=\sum_{j=N+1}^{2N} {j-N\over j}\ {p(j)}.$$ If $jp(j)\to c$, then
$1/2=\lim_{N\to\infty} \sum_{j=N+1}^{2N} {j-N\over j^2}\  c=(\log(2)-1/2)\  c,$ so that
$c={1\over 2\log(2)-1}$. New update: (Sept. 8) Despite the nice answers and interesting discussion below, I am still holding out for an (nice?, short?) analytic proof of convergence. Basic Tauberian theory is allowed :) New update: (Sept 13) I have posted a sketch of the probabilistic proof of convergence under ""A fun and frustrating recurrence sequence"" in the ""Publications"" section of my homepage. Final Update: (Sept 15th) The deadline is approaching, so I have decided to award the bounty to T.. 
Modulo the details(!), it seems that the probabilistic approach is the most likely to lead to a proof. My sincere thanks to everyone who worked on the problem, including those who tried it but

I would like to know how this particular piece of the number field / function field analogy is made precise. As a preliminary question, does anyone know a reference to where Weil (or someone else) explains it? I have a suspicion that it might be discussed in the notes from Weil's 1959-1960 lectures on ""Adeles and algebraic groups"", but the copy in my local library is checked out so I'm not sure. My next question is for an explanation of the analogy in what I assume is the simplest case: holomorphic vector bundles on a compact Riemann surface. There are two obstacles here. First, I don't know what a gauge transformation is, and the ""Mathematical Formalism"" section 
of the Wikipedia page seems nonsensical to me. What is being transformed, and what is the transformation itself? Can anyone provide a physics-free definition, purely in the language of geometry? Now given a curve $X$ over the complex numbers (or any field), we can form a topological ring $\mathbf{A}_X$ as the restricted product of the completed local rings at the closed points of $X$. The second obstacle is that when the ground field is infinite, these completions are not locally compact, so it seems unlikely that $\mathbf{A}_X$ is a good thing to consider. Nonetheless, can one put the constructions of the previous two paragraphs together to produce, for any rank $n$ holomorphic vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$, a bijection as follows? $${\text{gauge transformations of }\mathcal{E}}\stackrel{?}{\leftrightarrow} \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{A}_X)$$ My final question is, what is the correct version of this when the complex numbers are replaced by  a finite field? Now we can consider algebraic vector bundles, and even better the adeles of $X$ are now a good thing to consider. So in trying to extend the putative bijection above to this case, the content seems to be in algebraizing the notion of gauge transform. Thus, I'm asking for a (second?) definition of gauge transformation which is native to algebraic geometry, if such exists.","['riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'number-theory']"

But what do these things actually mean for people, especially the calculus student and the professor teaching a calculus course?","['calculus', 'terminology']"
3483,What are some good resources for brushing up on geometry and trigonometry?,"I'm brushing up on my calculus, and geometry and trigonometry keep coming up. However, these are probably my weakest areas mathematically. Are there any good sites or free PDFs/ebooks that I can use to quickly (in a weekend, preferably) work through geometry and trigonometry and refresh myself in topics such as areas and volumes of various geometric shapes, trigonometric functions, relationships between angles of a given shape or structure? It's been over 8 years since I took a geometric or trigonometric course (it was back in high school) and over 2 years since I took any course that even relied on geometry or trigonometry. I'm not looking for anything incredibly complex, either. Just something to cover the topics that I'm encountering in integral and differential calculus.","['geometry', 'algebra-precalculus', 'self-learning', 'trigonometry', 'reference-request']"
