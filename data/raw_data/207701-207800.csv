4157016,"trigonometrical inequality $\tan{A} + \tan{B} + \tan{C} = \tan{A}\tan{B}\tan{C}$, Hint to prove $S2\neq 1$? [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : $\tan A + \tan B + \tan C = \tan A\tan B\tan C\,$ in a triangle (12 answers) Closed 3 years ago . I was studying conditional identities for triangle in trigonometry where I had to prove that $\tan{A} + \tan{B} + \tan{C} = \tan{A}\tan{B}\tan{C}$ So I started with $\tan({A+B+C)}=\frac{S1-S3}{1-S2}$ where $S1=\sum_{cyc}\tan A$ , $S2=\sum_{cyc}\tan A.\tan B$ and $S3=\prod_{cyc}\tan A$ Now since $A+B+C=\pi$ and since $\tan\pi=0$ , therefore $\frac{S1-S3}{1-S2}=0$ and hence $S1=S3$ but I got stuck when I realized that another condition, $1-S2\neq0$ should also be true. Now I can't prove this. I'm not having any idea how to start to prove $S2\neq1$ for a triangle. please give me a hint.",['trigonometry']
4157020,"$\text{ If }\sin{x} + \cos{x} = m\text{, prove:- }\sin^{6}{x} + \cos^{6}{x} = \frac{4 - 3(m^2 -1)^2}{4}\text{, where }m^2 \leq 2$","My question is not exactly what's in the title. The proof is pretty straight forward:- From $\sin{x} + \cos{x} = m$ , we get $3\sin^2{x}\cos^2{x} = \frac{3(m^2 - 1)^2}{4}$ . Consequently, $\sin^{6}{x} + \cos^{6}{x} = 1 - 3\sin^2{x}\cos^2{x} = 1 - \frac{3(m^2 -1)^2}{4}$ . My question is what's the purpose of $m^2 \leq 2$ in the question? I always get extremely scared whenever I see some form of inequality included in a question. It took me about 15 minutes to solve the above problem just because I got scared of the inequality. But as it turns out I did not need it at all. So Why include it in the question at all? Or does my solution have some critical flaw? Any insight will be very helpful. Additionally, please let me know of any tips for working with inequalities if possible. For example, how to find a possible path to just start because that's the biggest issue with me. I don't seem to be able to start working a problem if there's an inequality, I start panicking for some reason. Not sure if I'm making this last part much clear or not.","['trigonometry', 'inequality']"
4157074,Using the Residue theorem to solve contour integral $\oint_{|z|=R}\frac{z^2}{1-e^{2\pi i z^3}}dz$ with $n<R^3<n+1$ for positive integer $n$.,"I'm a second-year undergraduate in a non-major complex analysis course. We just started looking at using residues to compute the values of contour integrals, and I've run into a homework problem that's giving me some trouble. I spent a lot of time on this one and I think I got it, but my answer is off by a negative compared to the one in a student-created answer bank that on rare occasion does have incorrect answers, but is usually right. I'm looking for help confirming my thought process and making sure that I didn't make any mistakes here. The integral is $\oint_{|z|=R}\frac{z^2}{1-e^{2\pi i z^3}}dz$ with $n<R^3<n+1$ for positive integer $n$ . I started by identifying all singularities as those $z$ where $1-e^{2\pi i z^3}=0$ , and discovered that this is true exactly when $z^3=k$ for some integer $k$ . I then let $z=re^{i\theta}$ , which gives $z^3=k\Rightarrow r^3e^{3i\theta}=ke^{i(0)}\Rightarrow r=k^{1/3},\theta=\frac{2\pi l}{3}$ , where $l$ is an integer. Since $z$ is like a ""3rd root of $k$ "" (like a 3rd root of unity), there are 3 of them with unique positions in the complex plane, these are those $z$ with $l=0,1,2$ , or $\theta=0,\frac{2\pi}{3},\frac{4\pi}{3}$ , and all with $r=k^{1/3}$ . Then, for a particular integer $k$ , we have 3 distinct roots that solve $1-e^{1\pi i z^3}=0$ . However, the integers $k$ that we are concerned with are restricted by those that fall within the interior of the contour $|z|=R$ . These are those $k$ where $|k|\leq n$ , or $k=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\dots , \pm n$ . This is because of the fact that if a number $z$ is to fall within the interior of $|z|=R$ , then its modulus $|z|$ should surely be less than $R$ , or $|z|<R$ , which implies that $|z|^3<R^3$ , and since we have $n<R^3<n+1$ , this implies that $|z|^3\leq n<R^3<n+1$ (All of this was difficult for me to visualize at first. I can't really think of a better way to explain this fact, and to be honest, I only feel like I've half convinced myself of it). Given that we have our general singularity $z=re^{i\theta}$ from above, and the constraint that $|z|^3\leq n$ for a point to be in the contour, we can now put a restriction on the values of $k$ that allow $z=re^{i\theta}=k^{1/3}e^{i\theta}$ to fall within the interior of the contour. We have $|z|=|k^{1/3}|\Rightarrow |z|^3=|k|\leq n$ , so we select $k=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\dots , \pm n$ as previously stated. Now that we have a finite number of singularities that fall within the interior of the contour, we can count them and see that there are $2n$ values of $k$ (not counting $k=0$ ) and 3 values of $l$ , which makes for $6n$ distinct singularities. When $k=0$ , we only count 1 singularity, since the length of $z$ just becomes 0 and changing to different angles makes no difference in its distinct position on the complex plane. We let all of the $6n$ distinct non-zero singularities be defined as $z_{k,l}=k^{1/3}e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}l}$ for ranges of $k$ and $l$ previously defined. We now compute the integral using the Residue theorem. Let $f(z)=\frac{z^2}{1-e^{2\pi i z^3}}$ . This is $\oint_{|z|=R}\frac{z^2}{1-e^{2\pi i z^3}}dz
=\oint_{|z|=R}f(z)dz=2\pi i \left[
\sum_{k=1}^{n}\sum_{l=0}^{2}(Res(f(z),z_{k,l}))
+\sum_{k=1}^{n}\sum_{l=0}^{2}(Res(f(z),z_{-k,l}))
+Res(f(z),0)\right]$ . Now to compute the residue for each non-zero singularity $z_{k,l}$ . I claim that each $z_{k,l}$ is a finite pole of order 1, or a simple pole. This can be shown by taking \begin{eqnarray}
\lim_{z\to z_{k,l}}(z-z_{k,l})f(z)\\
=\lim_{z\to z_{k,l}}(z-z_{k,l})\frac{z^2}{1-e^{2\pi i z^3}}\\
=\lim_{z\to z_{k,l}}\frac{z^3-z_{k,l}z^2}{1-e^{2\pi i z^3}}\\
=\lim_{z\to z_{k,l}}\frac{3z^2-2z_{k,l}z}{-e^{2\pi i z^3}(6\pi i z^2)}\\
=-\frac{1}{6\pi i}\lim_{z\to z_{k,l}}\frac{3-2z_{k,l}z^{-1}}{e^{2\pi i z^3}}\\
=-\frac{1}{6\pi i}\frac{3-2z_{k,l}z_{k,l}^{-1}}{e^{2\pi i z_{k,l}^3}}\\
=-\frac{1}{6\pi i}\frac{1}{e^{2\pi i z_{k,l}^3}}
\end{eqnarray} Since this value is certainly not zero, each non-zero $z_{k,l}$ is indeed a simple pole, and it just happens that the limit we just computed is the same limit that computes exactly the residue at the point $z_{k,l}$ , since it is a simple pole. Since $z_{k,l}^3=k$ as we have previously defined we then have $-\frac{1}{6\pi i}\frac{1}{e^{2\pi i k}}$ , where $e^{2\pi i k}=1$ since the coefficient $k$ is an integer. This leaves us with a residue of $-\frac{1}{6\pi i}$ for all non-zero $z_{k,l}$ . Now we look at the residue at $z=0$ . We similarly use a limit to simultaneously show that $f(z)$ has a simple pole at $z=0$ and compute the residue at that pole. \begin{eqnarray}
\lim_{z\to 0}zf(z)\\
=\lim_{z\to 0}z\frac{z^2}{1-e^{2\pi i z^3}}\\
=\lim_{z\to 0}\frac{z^3}{1-e^{2\pi i z^3}}\\
=\lim_{z\to 0}\frac{3z^2}{-e^{2\pi i z^3}(6\pi i z^2)}\\
=-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\lim_{z\to 0}\frac{1}{e^{2\pi i z^3}}\\
=-\frac{1}{2\pi i}
\end{eqnarray} This gives the residue $Res(f(z),0)=-\frac{1}{2\pi i}$ . With the residues $Res(f(z),z_{k,l})=-\frac{1}{6\pi i}$ for all valid $k,l$ from before, this gives $$
\oint_{|z|=R}\frac{z^2}{1-e^{2\pi i z^3}}dz

\sum_{k=1}^{n}\sum_{l=0}^{2}(Res(f(z),z_{k,l}))

+Res(f(z),0)\right]

4157083,"Find the equations of circles passing through $(1, -1)$ touching the lines $4x+3y+5=0$ and $3x-4y-10=0$","Find the equations of circles passing through $(1,-1)$ touching the lines $4x+3y+5=0$ and $3x-4y-10=0$ The point of intersection of the lines is $(\frac25,-\frac{11}5)$ If we want this point of intersection to be $(0,0)$ (because the given lines are perpendicular) then define the new $X=x-\frac25,Y=y+\frac{11}5$ , where $x,y$ are the original coordinates. So, the point $(1,-1)$ in the new system becomes $(\frac35,\frac65)$ . Since it's in the first quadrant, so, the center of the circle will be $(r,r)$ where $r$ is the radius of the circle. So, $(\frac35-r)^2+(\frac65-r)^2=r^2\implies r=\frac35,3$ So, the equations of circles are $$(X-\frac35)^2+(Y-\frac35)^2=\frac9{25}\implies(x-1)^2+(y+\frac85)^2=\frac9{25}$$ and $$(X-3)^2+(Y-3)^2=9\implies(x-\frac{17}5)^2+(y-\frac45)^2=9$$ Is this correct?","['circles', 'geometry', 'transformation']"

4157127,"Is there an explicit example of an uncountable collection of pairwise disjoint, dense, countable subsets whose union equals $[0,1]$?","Question: Is there an explicit example of an uncountable collection of pairwise
disjoint, dense (in $[0,1]$ ), countable subsets (i.e. each subset has countable many elements) of $[0,1]$ whose union equals $[0,1]$ ? I know that if we change the question to, ""Is there an explicit example of an uncountable collection of pairwise disjoint, dense, uncountable subsets of $[0,1]$ ? "", then there is a good answer here . But I can't seem to answer the question if countable subsets are required. The obvious attempts are something like $$\huge{\cup}_{\normalsize{\text{p prime}}} \ \normalsize{ \left(\sqrt{p}+\mathbb{Q}\right)}$$ but I think this is the wrong route to go down, because we're not going to get an uncountable number of disjoint sets whose union is $\ [0,1]$ . Alternatively if we start with, $$\huge{\cup}_{\normalsize{ i\text{ is Irrational}}} \ \normalsize{ \left(i+\mathbb{Q}\right)}$$ then I don't see an easy way to deal with repeat sets, other than invoking the axiom of choice. But I don't want to invoke AOC, I want an explicit example. And repeat sets are a problem because I require them to be disjoint. So I don't see a way round this, although maybe there is one? But probably a different approach altogether is necessary. Something tells me the answer is easy and I have forgotten the solution, but I can't think of what it is. Also, I require an explicit example: invoking the axiom of choice is not an acceptable answer imo. And I'm fairly sure the answer is ""yes"", although maybe the answer is no because of something like the Baire Category Theorem, which I don't really understand? It's also possible this question is not easy (for me) and is out of my depth... I don't know.","['general-topology', 'rational-numbers', 'irrational-numbers', 'real-analysis']"

Intuitively I think there is no solution but I am unable to prove it. Any help would be appreciated. Edit-1: As pointed out by @WillJagy it is possible for $n=3,4,5$ .

4157267,Question on a proof involving linear algebra,"I've encountered the following proof, but I'm stuck at the last step. Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}^s$ be a vector space. Let $p(x): X \to \mathbb{R}$ be a linear transformation such that $p(x)$ must be positive if every element of $x \in X$ is positive. Create $$M = \{ (-p(x), x); x \in X \}$$ Then $M$ is a vector space given the linearity of $p(x)$ . In fact, $M$ cannot consist entirely of positive elements, so $M$ is a hyperplane that only intersects the positive orthant of $\mathbb{R}_+^{s+1}$ at the point $0$ . I understand everything above, but at the end, it says: We can then create a linear function $F : \mathbb{R}^{s+1} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $F(-p,x) = 0$ for $(-p,x) \in M$ , and $F(-p,x) > 0$ for $(-p,x) \in \mathbb{R}_+^{s+1}$ except the origin.

I don't believe it matters, but this distribution was obtained as a result of summing a large number of independent, identically distributed random numbers with finite variance (hence invoking the central limit theorem).

4157348,Divergence of complex series,"Let be $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} z_k $ a complex series which converges (only) conditionally. Show that there exists a bijection $\varphi:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ such that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} z_{\varphi(k)}\right| =\infty$ . My ( edited ) approach: For each $k\in\mathbb{N}$ let be $z_k=a_k i + b_k$ . If $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k\right|=\infty$ or $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} a_k\right|=\infty$ then $$
\left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} a_k i + b_k\right|=\sqrt{\left(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} a_k\right)^2+\left(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k\right)^2}\geq  \left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} a_k\right|\left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k \right|$$ which would imply that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} z_k$ doesn't converge (Cauchy-Schwarz inequality). If $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} a_k$ oscillates and $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k $ converges and then I will always find a small enough $\epsilon >0$ such that for each index $n_0$ I find a $n$ with $n>n_0$ and $\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n} a_k>\epsilon$ . Hence, $$
\left|\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n} a_k i + b_k\right|=\sqrt{\left(\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n} a_k\right)^2+\left(\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n} b_k\right)^2}\geq  \left|\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n} a_k\right|>\epsilon,
$$ which again would imply that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} z_k$ doesn't converge. In both cases we get a contradiction, hence both series must converge. Further, if both limits $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} |b_k|$ and $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} |a_k|$ exist at the same time then  it follows: $$
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \left|a_k i + b_k\right|\leq\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} |a_k i |+\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} |b_k |= \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} |a_k|+\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} |b_k|.
$$ This would mean that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} z_k $ converges unconditionally which again is a contradiction. So at least one series must diverge (towards $\infty$ ). WLOG let be $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} |b_k|$ the divergent (towards $\infty$ ) series. We define two sets: $I_-$ which contains all the indices of terms $b_k<0$ and $I_+$ which contains all indices of the terms $b_k\geq 0$ . Now  we consider two real series which are made by indices of $I_+$ and indices of $I_-$ respectively, $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k^+$ and $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k^-$ . If only one of the series diverges then $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k$ diverges which is a contradiction. If both converges then it follows that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} |b_k|$ converges which is also a contradiction. Hence, both series $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k^+$ and $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k^-$ must diverge (towards $\infty$ ). Let be $\epsilon >0$ arbitrarily chosen. We define a bijection $\varphi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}= I_+\cup I_-$ (note that $I_+$ and $I_-$ are clearly a disjoint decomposition of $\mathbb{N}$ ): $$\begin{align*}
&\varphi(1)=\min\{k\in I_-\}\\
&\varphi(2)=\min\{k\in I_+\}\\
&\varphi(3)=\min\{k\in I_+\setminus \{\varphi(2)\}\}\\
&\vdots\\
&\varphi(n_0)=\min\{k\in I_+\setminus \{\varphi(2), \varphi(3), \cdots , \varphi(n_0-1)\}\},\\

$$ where we increment $n_0$ until reach $$
\left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_0}z_{\varphi(k)}\right|= \left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_0} a_{\varphi(k)} i + b_{\varphi(k)}\right|=\sqrt{\left(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_0} a_{\varphi(k)}\right)^2+\left(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_0} b_{\varphi(k)}\right)^2}\geq  \left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_0} b_{\varphi(k)} \right|>\epsilon.
$$ Then we start the procedure again: $$\begin{align*}

$$ The function $\varphi$ is injective because every element of each both sets $I_+$ and $I_-$ is chosen once.

However, this means that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k^+$ converges which is a contradiction. (The same argument can be used if we assume that there existed an $i_+\in I_+$ which has no preimage). To summarize, we have found a bijection $\varphi$ which rearranges the series $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} z_{\varphi(k)}$ such that we can push $\left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} z_{\varphi(k)}\right|$ above any value $M$ .

4157381,Determining the type of a differential form on an elliptic curve,"As we know, there are three types of differential forms on an elliptic curve: those of first kind  -- which have no poles or zeroes, those of the second kind -- which have poles with residue 0, and third kind -- which have simple poles with non-zero residue. Now, if the elliptic curve is given in Weierstrass form I know that $\frac{dx}{y}$ is a differential of the first kind, and that $\frac{xdx}{y}$ is a differential of the second kind, and one could similarly write a differential of the third kind. However, I was wondering if there is a way of determining the type of a meromorphic differential form, say $\frac{u(x_1,x_2)dx_1}{f(x_1,x_2)}$ , where $f$ is a cubic polynomial in the variables $x_1,x_2$ , and $u(x_1,x_2)$ is any polynomial, without changing variables to get $f$ into Weirestrass form?","['complex-geometry', 'elliptic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'differential-forms']"

My hope is that there is some pattern I can recursively exploit to generate new solutions from old ones. It is easy to get rid of odd powers of $s$ because of the parity of their coefficients, but the even powers are more troublesome. By Taylor expanding, I can tell that this problem would be equivalent to solving a system of equations involving powers and trig functions, but I do not know enough about such systems to find my required sequence of $(u_i,t_i)$ . I looked online and it seems there is a link to the Matrix Membership problem, which is in general undecidable, but perhaps in this case, with such an explicit form for $A$ , something more can be said. Are there any references that I might find useful?

By choosing $|u_i|=1$ and looking at the zeroth order term of the general product of $A(u_i,t_i)$ 's, it is easy to see that $\sum_i t_i \in 2\pi \Bbb N$ .

4157735,Using Bayesian inference to optimize my food stand - Is this feasible?,"During the last days I was learning about bayesian inference, and am now wondering if this could be of any practical use for a food stand I own. Here is the problem: I own a food stand and sell sausages before football matches. Before every match, I have to decide how many buns and sausages I have to buy / how many sells I expect. This depends mostly on the condition, of how many tickets have been sold for the match. This condition can change quite dynamically from match to match. So although I can make quite an educated guess out of the years of experience, I still end up throwing away many buns and sausages after each match. So the problem I am thinking about can be summarized as: Given the number of sells I've made in the past for number of tickets T, how many buns and sausages shall I buy for todays match, when the sold tickets are T_today. Even if the following approach is of no practical use, I am still curious in terms of it being an academic exercise. So my idea is the following: Describe the guessed number of sells for the next match using a normal distribution, with mean and variance being an educated guess. Measure the number of tickets that have been sold, and the number of sells I have made. Before the next matchday, look at the numbers of tickets that have been sold and update the normal distribution, given this number of tickets and the experience of the last match. Now, its quite straightforward how you update a normal distribution using bayesian inference. You measure a dataset, compute its variance and mean and you are then able to compute the updated normal distributions mean, variance etc. However, in this case, the measurement I do is the number of sells I've made and tickets sold. This I can measure with 100% accuracy, so there is no variance. How can I perform bayesian inference in this case?","['statistics', 'bayesian', 'normal-distribution', 'gaussian', 'bayes-theorem']"

4157859,Understanding the proof of the Full SVD from the Economy SVD,"$\textbf{The Economy SVD}$ : Let $r:=rank(A)\leq \min(m,n)$ where $A\in\mathbb{R^{m\times n}}$ . We know that the number of singular values of $A$ or the cardinality of the set $\Sigma(A):=\{\sigma_{i}|i=1,2,\cdots,m\}$ is $r$ . Considering $AA^{T}$ , we know that it is symmetric and thus by the Jordan-Schur's decomposition, we may write: $$
AA^{T}=QDQ^{T}
$$ Here $D$ which is a diagonal matrix, houses the eigenvalues of $AA^{T}$ which are $r$ in total since $rank(A)=rank(AA^{T})$ . Now this means that if we consider $D_{r}$ which is an $r\times r$ diagonal matrix that removes the $0$ 's from the diagonal entries and only contains that $r$ eigenvalues $\Sigma_{r}^{2}$ , as well as $Q_{r}$ excluding the zero orthonormal vectors we can write : $$
AA^{T}Q_{r}\Sigma_{r}^{-1}=Q_{r}\Sigma_{r}
$$ Now let $U_{r}:=Q_{r}$ , $S_{r}:=\Sigma_{r}$ , and $V_{r}:=A^{T}Q_{r}\Sigma_{r}^{-1}=A^{T}U_{r}S_{r}^{-1}$ , we may write: $$
AV_{r}=U_{r}S_{r}
$$ where $U_{r}^{T}U_{r}=I_{r}$ and it can also be shown that $V_{r}^{T}V_{r}=I_{r}$ which lets us to rewrite the equation above as: $$
A=U_{r}S_{r}V_{r}^{T}
$$ Request : I hope someone can explain the beginning of the proof as I didn't understand it. The proof below essentially derives the full scale SVD from the economy SVD $\textbf{Theorem (Full Scale SVD)}$ : Consider the matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ with $\operatorname{rank}(A)=r\leq p=\min(m,n)$ . We claim that there exist two orthogonal matrices $U\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ and $V\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and a diagonal matrix $S\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ , such that : $$
AV=US\iff A=USV^{T}\iff S=U^{T}AV
$$ where $S$ has the singular values of $A$ on its diagonal $\operatorname{diag}(S):=\begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{1}&\sigma_{2}&\cdots&\sigma_{p}\end{bmatrix}$ . Furthermore, $\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\cdots,\sigma_{r}>0$ and the remaining $p-r$ singular values $\sigma_{r+1}=\sigma_{r+2}=\cdots=\sigma_{p}=0$ . The columns of $U$ and the columns of $V$ are called the left-singular vectors and right-singular vectors of $A$ , respectively . $\textbf{Proof}$ . Construct $V:=[V_{r}\;\;V_{n-r}]$ and $U:=[U_{r}\;\;U_{n-r}]$ , by adding orthogonal vectors so that $V$ forms a basis for $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $U$ forms a basis for $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ . Recall that $Av_i \in \operatorname{Im}(A) = \{y \in \Bbb C^n \mid y = Ax; x \in \Bbb C^n\}$ with $Av_i = \sigma_i u_i$ for $i = 1,\dots,r$ and $\sigma_i > 0$ .

4158402,Geometric condition number for uniform sampling a real algebraic set,"A problem I'm on a hunt to figure out. I'm not sure whether it's better placed here or on Overflow- it has the feeling of being very standard for the right person but I haven't done enough geometric measure theory to spot it. Happy to be prompted to migrate if it seems beyond scope. Setup: Let $f \in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_N]$ and assume the real part of the corresponding algebraic set $S$ defined as $\mathcal{V}(f)\cap\mathbb{R}^N$ is compact. If it helps, assume that it's smooth. Let $\epsilon > 0$ and suppose $x\in S$ , i.e. $f(x) = 0$ . Question: Let $B(x,\epsilon)$ be the Euclidean ball of radius $\epsilon$ around $x$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ . Can we associate some geometric condition number $c(S)$ based on a well-known geometric quantity (e.g. extrinsic curvature) to $S$ and give a lower bound on the (N-1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure (in $\mathbb{R}^N$ ) of the set $ S \cap B(x,\epsilon)$ in terms of $c(S)$ ? This is related to a probability question: Given $x$ and $\epsilon$ , is there a somewhat satisfying lower bound on the probability you get a point within $\epsilon$ of $x$ when you sample from the uniform distribution on $S$ given by Hausdorff measure? It seems visually intuitive that this should depend on extrinsic curvature, but I can't quite get it there. An upper bound would also be nice, but that's going to be trickier and rely on the algebraic properties more (you need Bezout's Theorem at least to limit spirals, I think). The background: Diaconis et al. have a type of tutorial on these questions https://statweb.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/sampling11.pdf . In particular, Section 2.2 recalls the following area formula recorded in Federer's Geometric Measure Theory . It gives a formula for the Hausdorff measure of a set in terms of a parameterization. The following is a slightly weaker form of the result for conciseness. Theorem Let $\lambda^m$ denote the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^m$ . If $u:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^n$ is Lipschitz, $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^m$ is $\lambda^m$ measurable, $u(A) = P$ , and $u$ is injective: $$
H^m(P) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} 1_P(y) H^m(dy) = \int_A J_m u(z) \lambda^m(dz)
$$ where $J_m u(z)$ is the Jacobian $\sqrt{\det((Du(z)^T Du(z))}$ . In our context $P$ is our set $S\cap B(x,\epsilon)$ and we a priori don't know a parameterization $u:\mathbb{R}^{N-1}\to\mathbb{R}^N$ . The Implicit Function Theorem is standard for this, with the caveat that $\epsilon$ must be small enough. Assume for the sake of convenience that we can use the IFT on the last variable. We at least know that if $\epsilon$ is small enough we have a parameterization $u:U\to\mathbb{R}^N$ with $U\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{N-1}$ of the form $u(z) = (z,g(z))$ for some $g:\mathbb{R}^{N-1}\to\mathbb{R}$ . Furthermore, let $B=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_N}(u(z)))^{-1}$ . Then $Du(z)$ is a matrix of the form $(I_{n-1} | (-B\hat\nabla_f(u(z)))^T$ where $\hat\nabla_f(u(z))$ is the first $n-1$ coordinates of $\nabla_f(u(z))$ . So $Du(z)^T Du(z) = I_{n-1} + B^2 \hat\nabla_f(u(z))\hat\nabla_f(u(z))^T$ . That's the best I have for now: There's probably some better way to write that matrix for the determinant, or even a better approach to the question. It still seems like there's more say after that if it's related to e.g. extrinsic curvature or some other familiar quantity.","['geometric-measure-theory', 'differential-geometry']"

A. 0.314 B. 0.485 C. 0.562 D. 0.686 My guess with the observed value and mean value for the $z$ -score equation would be to substitute $0.83$ for the former and 0.85 for the latter. For the standard deviation, I believe I use the equation $\sqrt{np (1-p)}$ , substituting $0.85$ for $p$ and $75$ for $n$ . However, when I found the calculation to be $\approx 3.0923$ , I thought it was higher than what I'm normally used to. And sure enough, when it was substituted into the $z$ -score equation, the z-score was far too small. How do I find the correct answer? What methods were incorrect?","['statistics', 'probability']"
4158457,Proving chain rule for Caratheodory derivative,"I am trying to follow the argument given in the following papers: S. Kuhn, ""The Derivative a la Caratheodory"" (1991); E. Acosta G., C. Delgado G., ""Frechet vs. Caratheodory"" (1994); S. Arora, H. Browne, D. Daners, ""An alternative approach to Frechet derivatives"" (2019). Definition of differentiability. Function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m $ is said to be differentiable (in a sense of Caratheodory) at point $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ if there is a one-parameter family of linear functions $\Phi_{x, \cdot} : \mathbb{R}^n \to L(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathbb{R}^m)$ that for all $y$ satisfies the following condition $$ \Phi_{x,y}(y-x) = f(y)-f(x) $$ and is continuous at $x$ , in other words, $$ \lim \limits_{y \to x} \Phi_{x,y} = \Phi_{x,x}. $$ Here, limit is to be understood in the usual sense where there is some metric on the space of all linear functions from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ (usually taken to be operator norm). Derivative of $f$ at $x$ is then said to be linear function $\Phi_{x,x}$ . Proof of the chain rule given in the papers. Let us assume that we are given functions $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ and $g : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^p$ which are differentiable at $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $f(x) \in \mathbb{R}^m$ respectively. In that case, let us start by thinking of family of linear functions that might be reasonable for $g \circ f$ . Here, we use that $f$ and $g$ are differentiable and we use some one-parameter family of linear functions $\Phi^{f}_{x, \cdot}$ and $\Phi^{g}_{f(x), \cdot}$ . $$ (g \circ f)(y) - (g \circ f)(x) = \Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(y)}(f(y)-f(x)) = (\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(y)} \circ \Phi^{f}_{x,y}) (y-x)$$ This motivates to consider one-parameter family of linear functions given as follows. $$ \Phi^{g \circ f}_{x,\cdot} = \Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(\cdot)} \circ \Phi^{f}_{x,\cdot} $$ Now, the only remaining thing is to show that it is continuous at $x$ . Part of the proof I do not understand: The claim is that this one-parameter family of linear function $\Phi^{g \circ f}_{x,\cdot} $ is continuous because $\Phi^{g}_{f(x), \cdot}$ , $\Phi^{f}_{x, \cdot}$ and $f$ are all continuous functions and composition of continuous functions is again continuous. I have trouble understanding this as I think that the composition of one-parameter families of linear functions is not with respect to variable $y$ . My approach: Instead, I would propose the following proof where the key idea is not that the composition of continuous functions is continuous but rather that if we take operator norm then it has submultiplicativity property, so the proof is similar to the proof of limit of product where the product is now the composition. Use that functions are linear and triangle inequality to have the following. $$|\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(y)} \circ \Phi^{f}_{x,y}-\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(x)} \circ \Phi^{f}_{x,x}| = $$ $$ = |(\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(y)}-\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(x)}) \circ (\Phi^{f}_{x,y}-\Phi^{f}_{x,x})
+ (\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(y)}-\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(x)}) \circ \Phi^{f}_{x,x} + \Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(x)} \circ (\Phi^{f}_{x,y} - \Phi^{f}_{x,x}) | $$ $$ \leq |(\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(y)}-\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(x)}) \circ (\Phi^{f}_{x,y}-\Phi^{f}_{x,x})| + 
| (\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(y)}-\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(x)}) \circ \Phi^{f}_{x,x} | + |\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(x)} \circ (\Phi^{f}_{x,y} - \Phi^{f}_{x,x}) |$$ Now, use submultiplicative property of operator norm to bound norm of composition by a multiplication of individual norms. $$|\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(y)} \circ \Phi^{f}_{x,y}-\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(x)} \circ \Phi^{f}_{x,x}| $$ $$  \leq |\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(y)}-\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(x)}||\Phi^{f}_{x,y}-\Phi^{f}_{x,x}| + 
|\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(y)}-\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(x)}| | \Phi^{f}_{x,x} | + |\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(x)}||\Phi^{f}_{x,y} - \Phi^{f}_{x,x}| $$ Now, from continuity of one-parameter family of linear functions and from continuity of $f$ (as it is differentiable), we get that there is $\delta_1 > 0$ such that if $0 < |y-x| < \delta_1$ then $|f(y) - f(x)| < \delta_2$ and $|\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(y)}-\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(x)}|< \textrm{min}(1,\varepsilon)/(3+| \Phi^{f}_{x,x} |)$ . Also, there is $\delta_2 > 0$ such that if $0 < |y-x| < \delta_2$ such that $|\Phi^{f}_{x,y}-\Phi^{f}_{x,x}| < \textrm{min}(1,\varepsilon)/(3+|\Phi^{g}_{f(x), f(x)}|)$ . Then, taking $\delta = \textrm{min}(\delta_1, \delta_2)$ gives the desired results. Problems with my approach: even if we assume that my proof is correct, this is somewhat in contradiction with what authors claim about why Caratheodory derivative might be useful. The usual claim is that all proofs become easier as one just needs to consider continuity of functions and does not rely on many computations with $\varepsilon-\delta$ . On the other hand, my proof shows that Caratheodory derivative approach requires many details to be proved, for example, it requires that out of all norms we use norm which is submultiplicative (not obvious to me why such choice of norm would be natural or obvious), and proof required to work with $\varepsilon - \delta$ . Also, it is not clear to me how (and if possible) to rewrite my approach in a more concise way using only that composition of continuous functions is continuous (or a similar result).","['derivatives', 'chain-rule', 'real-analysis']"

That being said, the combinatorial meaning of the LHS (and even the RHS) is rather clear: it iterates over $q = \{1,2,...,n\}$ couples, selects $2k-2q$ couples from the remaining $n-q$ and then picks one person from each of these $2k-2q$ couples,  which can be done in $2^{2k-2q}$ ways, to form the group. The RHS does this by composition: removing those groups that do not contain one couple. However, while I know what the LHS is supposed to do, I don't know how it works. I know that the groups that do not contain 1 couple is given by $\binom{n}{2k}2^{2k}$ (after all, this is the case where $q=0$ ), but I have little idea as to how the $\binom{2n}{2k}$ term counts the ""rest"". And I have way fewer ideas about how would I prove this thing algebraically. Later edit: I realized that the $\binom{2n}{2k}$ term simply counts the number of ways of grouping $2k$ people from the overall $2n$ people of the $n$ couples. So ofc all you'd need to do after that is remove those groups that do not contain 1 couple.","['summation', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics', 'combinatorial-proofs']"

It says: Calculate how many subfields has the splitting field of $P=X^7+4X^5-X^2-4$ over $\mathbb Q$ . What I first noticed is that $P$ can be expressed as product of irreducibles as: $$P=(X-1)(X^4+X^3+X^2+X+1)(X^2+4),$$ so the roots of $P$ are $\{1,\omega,\omega^2,\omega^3,\omega^4,2i,-2i\}$ , where $\omega=\cos\frac{2\pi}{5}+i\sin\frac{2\pi}{5}$ .

My problem is finding this degree. I know $$[\mathbb Q(i):\mathbb Q]=2, \quad [\mathbb Q(\omega): \mathbb Q]=4,$$ but I'm not sure if the degree of $\mathbb Q(i,\omega)/\mathbb Q$ is $4$ or $8$ . My intuition tells me the easiest path will be checking if $i\in\mathbb Q(\omega)$ (implying degree $4$ ) or if $i\notin\mathbb{Q}(\omega)$ (implying degree $8$ ).

\left<\gamma'(\lambda),  \gamma(\lambda^{+}) - \gamma(\lambda) \right>

\left<\gamma'(\lambda^{+}),  \gamma(\lambda^{+}) - \gamma(\lambda) \right>,

Therefore, one can find with the Intermediate Value Theorem a value $\lambda_1$ such that $f(\lambda_1) = 0$ . If I define and $\lambda_2 = \lambda^+(\lambda_1)$ , this implies that $$

Show that $T$ is diagonalizable (elementarily),"While revising for my linear algebra exam I came across this exam problem: Let $T: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ be a linear mapping such that $T^3 = T$ and $T^2 \neq T,T^2 \neq \text{id}_V$ . If $ \text{dim(ker(} T )) = 2$ , show that the matrix of $T$ is equal to diag $(0,0,-1)$ with respect to a suitable basis. My idea Assume for the moment that $T$ is diagonalizable. If $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ then $\lambda^3 = \lambda$ since $T^3 = T$ , so $\lambda \in \{ 0,-1,1 \}$ . Since $ \text{dim(ker(} T )) = 2$ , clearly $0$ is an eigenvalue. If all three values above would be eigenvalues then the geometric multiplicity of $0$ would be $1$ and not $2$ , so $-1$ and $1$ can't both be eigenvalues. If $1$ is the other eigenvalue then since $T$ is diagonalizable we'd have that the matrix of $T$ is $M = $ diag $(0,0,1)$ with respect to some basis. But $M^2 = M$ so we'd have $T^2 = T$ which is not the case. So $-1$ must be the other eigenvalue and the result follows. Question How can I prove that $T$ is diagonalizable? For some context, the only definition of diagonalizability we have is that $T: V \rightarrow V$ diagonalizable if there is a basis of $V$ made up of eigenvectors of $V$ and that's how we usually prove diagonalizability (by explicitely providing a basis). We also have the spectral theorem for symmetric matrices but I doubt it helps here. (I also know that the minimal polynomial of $T$ must divide $x(x-1)(x+1)$ via the relation given, so the minimal polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors, so $T$ is definitely diagonalizable. But we haven't done this in the course and this method wouldn't be accepted in the exam without a full proof, so I'm looking for a more elementary way.)","['diagonalization', 'linear-algebra']"

Given the problem of finding the Laplace transform of the function $$f(t)=t^ne^{at}$$ with $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $a\in\mathbb{R}$ , I realize it can be shown the transform is $$\frac{n!}{(s-a)^{n+1}}$$ by more than one direct method. However, I'd like to show this using strong induction. I began the problem by showing that \begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}\{te^{at}\}=\int_{0}^{\infty}te^{-(s-a)t}\,dt&=\frac{1}{(s-a)^2},\\
\mathcal{L}\{t^2e^{at}\}=\int_{0}^{\infty}t^2e^{-(s-a)t}\,dt&=\frac{2}{(s-a)^3},\text{ and}\\
\mathcal{L}\{t^3e^{at}\}=\int_{0}^{\infty}t^3e^{-(s-a)t}\,dt&=\frac{6}{(s-a)^4}.

Then, I began the proof as follows. $\textbf{Proof:}$ Let $P(n)$ be the statement $$P(n): \mathcal{L}\{t^ne^{at}\}=\frac{n!}{(s-a)^{n+1}},$$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}.$ We have already shown $P(1), P(2), P(3)$ are true, so the base case has been proven. Inductive Step: Assume $P(k)$ is true for all $k$ . We must then show that $P(k)\implies P(k+1).$ We see \begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}\{t^{k+1}e^{at}\}&=\frac{(k+1)!}{(s-a)^{k+2}}\\
&=\frac{k+1}{s-a}\frac{k!}{(s-a)^{k+1}}\\
&=\frac{k+1}{s-a}\mathcal{L}\{t^{k}e^{at}\} \quad\text{(by the inductive step)}

However, it can tile $3\times3$ squares glued together in various ways: I am interested in the polyominoes $P$ for which the $L$ -tromino can tile a copy of $P$ scaled up by a factor of $3$ along both axes. It is easy to see that some $P$ will fail, such as any $1\times k$ rectangle for odd $k$ . However, it appears that every polyomino $P$ with an even number of cells can be tiled by $L$ shapes when it is scaled up by $3$ . This holds for all polyominoes $P$ with $2, 4, 6, \ldots, 12$ cells. One might be tempted to argue from induction: given a polyomino $P$ of size $2k$ , subtract a $3\times 6$ domino from $P$ (which can be tiled), and tile the remaining size- $(2k-2)$ polyomino with $L$ s by the inductive hypothesis. The problem with this is that there are arbitrarily large polyominoes for which it is not possible to remove a domino and leave a single connected polyomino behind; in fact, there are polyominoes that cannot be split into any collection of smaller polyominoes of even size. ( This is one example.) A variant of this inductive argument that might work is to show that from any polyomino $P$ , one can remove either a domino, a $T$ -tetromino, or two $L$ trominoes, to leave a smaller connected polyomino. If this were true, it would suffice for the induction, but I don't see a great way to prove it. (It may well have a counterexample!)

What comes to my mind and what is more suitable to the setup I'm working on is something like this: assume that $P$ and $V$ have inner products $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_P$ and $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_V$ , respectively. Then, we can identify $P \otimes V$ with $\text{Hom}(P,V)$ using the map $p \otimes v \mapsto \langle \cdot, p \rangle_P v$ and we can consider the canonical inner product on $P \otimes V$ given by $\langle p \otimes v, q \otimes w \rangle_{P \otimes V} := \langle p, q \rangle_P \langle v, w \rangle_P$ . But how this translates to the Hom space? I've tried this: choosing basis $\{p_1,\ldots,p_k\}$ and $\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ (and I can't assume those basis are orthogonal) and defining $G$ as the Gram matrix of $V$ , ie, $G = (\langle v_i, v_j \rangle_V)_{i,j}$ , I've identified $\text{Hom}(P,V)$ as the space of matrices $n \times k$ written in those basis and then defined the inner product as $\text{tr}(A^{\top}GB)$ .

4159510,Why do we write the rule for integration by substitution in a way that is different from what we're actually doing?,"The statement of the rule is the following: For a continuous function $f:I\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ on a real interval $I$ , and a continuously differentiable function $\phi:[a,b]\rightarrow I$ , it holds that \begin{equation}\int_a^bf(\varphi(t))\cdot\varphi'(t)dt=\int_{\varphi(a)}^{\varphi(b)}f(x)dx\tag{1}\end{equation} My question is how one is supposed to actually use this equation, or how to make it intuitively agree with what one is actually doing, mechanically, when integrating by substitution. This has always bugged me, and I give the precise difficulties in my understanding below. I first learned integration by substitution 'procedurally', and was confronted with the actual theorem only later. To demonstrate what I mean by procedurally, consider this example integral, disregarding whether integration by substitution is useful for solving it, as that is not the purpose of my question. $$\int_1^2 t\exp(\frac{t}{2})dt$$ Naively, I could try to do the following: $$x:=\varphi(t)=\frac{t}{2} \implies t=2x$$ $$\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{1}{2} \implies \text{'}dt=2dx\text{'}$$ and since I 'replace $x$ by $\frac{t}{2}$ ' the limits of integration become $\frac{1}{2}=0.5$ and $\frac{2}{2}=1$ .
Substituting $x$ and $dx$ in my integral accordingly, I arrive at $$\int_{0.5}^1 2x \exp(x) 2dx$$ Now I see that the function $f$ which 'fits' my chosen $\varphi$ 'in hindsight' is $f(x)=4x \exp(x)$ , and indeed $f(\varphi(t))=2t\exp(\frac{t}{2})$ and $\varphi'(t)=\frac{1}{2}$ , which allows me to write my original integral in the form $$\int_1^2 2t\exp(\frac{t}{2})\frac{1}{2}dt$$ which agrees with the left-hand-side of (1) and thus justifies what I did after the fact, since $f$ is continuous and $\varphi$ is continuously differentiable on $[1,2]$ . However, assume I do not know the above procedure, and instead only equation (1). How could I apply it, not yet knowing $f$ ? If I were to just chose $\varphi(t)=\frac{t}{2}$ as above, I would be left with this partially substituted integral: $$\int_1^2t\exp(\varphi(t))dt$$ and proceed how? To go strictly by the formula, I would still need to find $f$ , whose form isn't immediate from the integral (or at least it isn't obvious to me that it would always be reasonably apparent, in particular for more complicated integrals). You might object that I could start on the other side of equation (1), defining $f(x)=x\exp(\frac{x}{2})$ , choose $\varphi(t)=2t$ , and immediately obtain $$f(\varphi(t))\varphi'(t)=2t\exp(t)2$$ However , this leads to a problem with the limits of the integral: The rule for integration by substitution does not require $\varphi$ to have an inverse. And even if it did, then to make the equation agree with what is actually done it would be more sensible to write $$\int_a^b f(x)dx = \int_{\varphi^{-1}(a)}^{\varphi^{-1}(b)}f(\varphi(t))\varphi'(t)dt$$ because this is what I'm actually doing.

For example, in the case when $B$ is simply-connected, one has $$b_k(X)\leq \sum_{p+q=k}b_p(F)b_q(B),$$ where $b_i$ signifies the Betti numbers.","['complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'fibration', 'betti-numbers']"
4159647,For what orders does Cauchy's theorem hold?,"If a prime number $p$ divides the order of a finite group, then there is an element in $G$ of order $p$ — this is Cauchy's Theorem. For what numbers $n$ does this hold? In other words: what is the set $C$ of positive integers $n$ such that every group with order divisible by $n$ has an element of order $n$ ? If $n\in C$ and $G$ is a group of order $n$ then clearly $G$ is cyclic: it follows that $n$ is what is called a cyclic number, and this tells us that it is square-free and if $p_1\cdots p_r$ is its factorization into primes we have $p_i\not\equiv1\mod p_j$ for all choices of $i$ and $j$ in $\{1,\dots,n\}$ . On the other hand, it is not difficult to show that $C$ is closed under divisors: if $n\in C$ and $m\mid n$ , then $m\in C$ . Finally, Cauchy's theorem tells us that $C$ contains all primes. Is there anything else in there?","['group-theory', 'finite-groups']"
4159655,Solving $a + \frac1a = 12$,"I recently came across this problem in a textbook and I have no idea how to solve it : $$a + \frac1a = 12$$ Here is what I tried: $$\begin{align}

a^2 + 1 &= 12a \tag2 \\[4pt]
a + 1 &= 3.4641a \tag3 \\[4pt]
1 &= 2.4641a \tag4 \\[4pt]
a &= 0.4058 \tag5

a + \frac1a &= 12 \tag6\\
0.4058 + \frac{1}{0.4058} &= 12 \tag7\\[4pt]
0.4058 + 2.4642 &= 12 \tag8 \\[4pt]
2.87 &\neq 12 \tag9

L^{c}(\theta \mid \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z})=h(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z} \mid \theta)

So, I think that we can construct such a sequence such that this limit (and thus upper limit) is exactly 1, to prove that we cannot reach a stronger result. The solution directly gives the sequence $a_n=n\ln n$ without any rough work, and I can verify the alleged limit is indeed 1.
