340544,Prove the similarity of isosceles triangles...,"Two similar isosceles triangles are constructed outside of an parallelogram ABCD, the first being $ABB_1$ and second $CBC_1$ i.e. $|AB| = |AB_1|$ and $|CB| = |CC_1|$. Since $ABB_1$ and $CBC_1$ are similar, prove that the triangle $DB_1C_1$ is similar to $ABB_1$ and $CBC_1$. I don't know where to start, I don't see any relations so it would be great if someone could give me a starting point/hint what to look for so that I can try to solve the rest by myself. As for now, I am only allowed to use elementary geometry i.e. Thales, Pythagoras, theorems of the similarity/coherence of 2 triangles, the surface of triangles and quadrilaterals, theorems for circles (the angle over an arc) and the properties of tangential quadrilaterals and cyclic quadrilaterals but no trigonometry properties (we don't use any trigonometry as for now). I tried to prove the similarity but I am missing an angle or a side to use a similarity theorem. If I understood the task correctly, the picture should look something like this and by looking at the triangles $DAB_1$ and $DCC_1$ I notice:  ABCD is a parallelogram and $BCC_1$ is an isosceles triangle so $|AD| = |BC| = |CC_1|$. The angles $DAB_1$ and $DCC_1$ are equal because
    $$ \angle DAB_1 = \angle DAB + \angle B_1AB $$
    $$ \angle DCC_1 = \angle DCB + \angle C_1CB $$
    $$ \angle DAB = \angle DCB$$ because ABCD is a parallelogram
    $$ \angle B_1AB = \angle C_1CB $$ because they are both angles within similar triangles but I am missing an information (angle or side) which I don't know how to get/conclude because
the task says that I have to prove that the red triangle ( $DB_1C_1$ ) is similar i.e. isosceles.
So I can't conclude that both triangles ($DAB_1$ and $DCC_1$) have another side of the same size. ABCD is a parallelogram so $|DC| = |AB| $ and $|AB| = |AB_1| $ because the triangle $ABB_1$ is isosceles hence $|DC| = |AB_1|$ Now I got 2 sides and an angle between them. I will make another update later and let you know if I need more help (or hopefully have figured it out). In update 1 and 2 I concluded the similarity and (since the sides are of the same size) coherency of the triangles $DAB_1$ and $DCC_1$ and since they are equal, the sides $DB_1$ and $DC_1$ of the triangle $DB_1C_1$ are equal which proves that the triangle $DB_1C_1$ is an isosceles triangle. Last step, the angles: As for now, we have: $\alpha = \angle DAB = \angle DCB$ $\beta = \angle BAB_1 = \angle BCC_1$ Now using the similarity of triangles $DAB_1$ and $DCC_1$: $\gamma = \angle DB_1A \implies \gamma = \angle CDC_1$ $\delta = \angle B_1DA \implies \delta = \angle DC_1C$ Now, our notation on the triangle $DAB_1$ implies: $\alpha + \beta + \gamma + \ \delta = 180°$ 
$\implies \beta = 180° - \alpha - \gamma - \delta  
\implies \beta = \angle ADC - \gamma - \delta \implies \beta = \angle B_1DC_1$ Note: $\alpha = \angle DAB \implies 180° - \alpha = \angle ADC$ (ABCD is a parallelogram) And that's our needed angle (because we already proved that the triangle $B_1DC_1$ is an isosceles triangle $\implies \angle DB_1C_1 = \angle DC_1B_1 = \frac{1}{2} (180° - \beta)$ ) $\implies ABB_1 \sim CBC_1 \sim DB_1C_1$","['geometry', 'euclidean-geometry']"

340567,"Show that for all $(x,y)$ there exists $(r,\theta)$...","Given a problem wherein $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, I often transform to polar coordinates by introducing the assumption that $(r,\theta)$ satisfy $x = r\cos \theta, y = r\sin \theta.$ Of course, it's only safe to introduce assumptions if you have an existence theorem. This motivates the following. Theorem 1. For all $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, there exists $r \in [0,\infty)$ and $\theta\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x = r\cos \theta, y = r\sin \theta.$ It occurs to me that I have no idea how to prove this. Ideas, anyone? Note that the above result is equivalent to the following. Theorem 1'. For the the unique function $f : [0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ with defining property $f(r,\theta)=(r\cos \theta, r\sin \theta)$, it holds that $f$ is surjective. Another interesting result adds uniqueness into the mix. Theorem 2. For all real $\alpha$, we have that for all $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{(0,0)\}$, there exist unique $r \in (0,\infty)$ and $\theta \in [\alpha,\alpha+2\pi)$ such that $x = r\cos \theta, y = r\sin \theta.$ Again, this can be recast into the language of functions. Theorem 2'. For all real $\alpha$, we have that for the unique function $g : (0,\infty) \times [\alpha,\alpha+2\pi) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ with defining property $g(r,\theta)=(r\cos \theta, r\sin \theta),$ it holds that $g$ is bijective. I wouldn't know where to start proving any of these. Now there's also an issue here of how we're defining $\cos$ and $\sin$. I'm thinking it would best to use the following definitions. Definition 1. There is a unique function $c$ satisfying the initial value problem $c''=-c,$ $c(0)=1,$ $c'(0)=0$. Call it $\cos$. Definition 2. There is a unique function $s$ satisfying the initial value problem $s''=-s,$ $s(0)=0,$ $s'(0)=1$. Call it $\sin$. If somebody knows how to prove the theorem(s) using another set of definitions, that is also fine.",['trigonometry']

340603,Nullstellensatz in the coordinate ring $\Gamma (X)$,"One of the many statements of the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is the following: If $k$ is an algebraic closed field, and $\mathfrak a$ is an ideal of the ring $k[T_1,\ldots,T_n]$ then $I(V(\mathfrak a))=rad(\mathfrak a)$ Let $X\subseteq\mathbb A^n_k$ be an affine algebraic set with the induced Zariski topology, and let $\Gamma(X)=k[T_1,\ldots,T_n]/I(X)$ be its coordinate ring. If $\overline{\mathfrak a}$ is any ideal of $\Gamma(X)$, it is easy to prove that every closed set of $X$ is of the form: $$V|_X(\overline{\mathfrak a}):=\{x\in X\,:\, f(x)=0\,\forall f\in \overline{\mathfrak a} \}$$ Now, Görtz & Wedhorn in their book ""Algebraic Geometry I"" at page 21 (in the proof of Proposition 1.40) say that if  $\overline{\mathfrak a}$ is any ideal of $\Gamma(X)$, by Hilbert's Nullstellensatz 
  we have that $I(V|_X(\overline{\mathfrak a}))=rad(\overline{\mathfrak a})$. Why is this true? I disagree with the above statement, infact if $\mathfrak a$ is the ideal of $k[T_1,\ldots,T_n]$ corresponding to $\overline{\mathfrak a}$ through the canonical projection, we have the following equality: $$I(V|_X(\overline{\mathfrak a}))=I(V(\mathfrak a)\cap X)=I(V(\mathfrak a+I(X)))=rad(\mathfrak a+I(X))$$ EDIT: attempt of solution Probably I should indicate the operator $I|_X$ which is different from $I$; if $Y\subseteq X$ we have that: $$I|_X(Y)=\{f\in\Gamma(X)\,:\, f(y)=0\,\forall y\in Y\}$$
$$I(Y)=\{F\in k[T_1,\ldots,T_n]\,:\, f(y)=0\,\forall y\in Y\}$$ clearly if $\overline F=f$ we have that $F\in I(Y)$ if and only if $f\in I|_X(Y)$. Now the correct statement is: if  $\overline{\mathfrak a}$ is any ideal of $\Gamma(X)$, by Hilbert's Nullstellensatz 
  we have that $I|_X(V|_X(\overline{\mathfrak a}))=rad(\overline{\mathfrak a})$. and the proof should be: $$I|_X(V|_X(\overline{\mathfrak a}))=I|_X(V(\mathfrak a)\cap X)=I|_X(V(\mathfrak a+I(X)))=\overline{I(V(\mathfrak a+I(X)))}=\overline{rad(\mathfrak a+I(X))}=\overline{rad(\mathfrak a)}=rad(\overline{\mathfrak a})$$","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

340687,Nice proof for finite of degree one implies isomorphism?,"Let $f: X \longrightarrow Y$ be a morphism of varieties over $\mathbb{C}$ and assume it is finite of degree 1, i.e. it is surjective and
$$
[K(Y):K(X)] = 1 \quad \quad (*)
$$
i.e. the function fields are isomorphic. Since one can show $f$ to be flat, this means all its fibres consist of a single point, hence the morphism is  unramified hence étale (see some exercise in Hartshorne in the chapter on smooth morphisms). It is also bijective. Now, to show that $f$ is an isomorphism one can use the euclidian topology and the fact that étale coverings induce isomorphisms on the tangent spaces at all points, so $f$ is euclidian-locally an isomorphism. Since it is also bijective, it is an isomorphism globally. Could anyone give me an elegant short proof that works in all characteristics? Or if this happens not to be true, an algebraic proof over $\mathbb{C}$? If this proof works more generally for certain schemes, i'd be happy to know about it too. Idea 1: Locally $f$ is given by an inclusion of rings $R \rightarrow S$ and i hope to somehow deduce from $(*)$ that $S$ is a $R$ module of rank 1, so indeed $R \cong S$ and we are  done locally, hence also globally Idea 2: By $(*)$, $X$ and $Y$ are birational, but i am not sure how to continue from here. This is most probably just a simple application of commutative algebra knowledge that i lack.. Thanks! Edit: This is incorrect! I worked with the assumption of smooth varieties but failed to mention so. Smoothness is necessary to show flatness (Hartshorne exercise III.9.3(a)) and without it the reasoning collapes, as Georges points out below.

340701,Test for Bernoulli distribution,"I'm thinking about the following problem. Assume that one is given a sequence of binary data $(x_i)_i\in\{0,1\}^n$ and that wants to determine whether or not this sequence has been generated by a Bernoulli-like random mechanism, such as coin tosses. My first idea was to use classical statistical test theory, but the null hypothesis
$$
H_0=\{\text{data are not generated by a Bernoulli mechanism}\}
$$
seems difficult to model mathematically. In particular, it includes the possibility that the data are not generated by any well-defined random mechanism. I have a feeling that any probabilistic reasoning breaks down, if one is not willing to make the assumption of an underlying distribution from which the observed data are sampled. My second idea was not to try and refute the (ill-defined) null-hypothesis that the data are not Bernoulli, but rather to extract from the data as much evidence as possible to show that it is consistent with the hypothesis that the data are generated by a Bernoulli-like mechanism. One example would be to subdivide (maybe randomly)  the  observed data into (maybe disjoint) subsets, count the number of 1's in each subset, and compare the empirical distribution of the number of 1's to a binomial distribution. This raises the question, how the subdivisions should be done, if the order of the data matters, and if the whole approach makes any sense. It seems to contradict the fact that the number of 1's is a sufficient test statistics for a repeated Bernoulli experiment. My question is thus the following: What methods can one use to establish that a sequence of binary data has been generated by a Bernoulli-like random mechanism? Alternatively, how can one refute the possibility that the data have been generated by some unspecified non-Bernoulli-like random mechanism or that they have not been generated by a well-defined random mechanism at all?

340780,Bounded operator and Compactness problem,"Let $H$ be a Hilbert space with orthonormal basis $(e_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ . Furthermore, let $T\colon H\rightarrow C[a,b]$ be a bounded operator. a) Let $x\in [a,b]$ . Show that there is a unique $g_{x}\in H$ with $\langle f,g_x\rangle=(Tf)(x)$ and all $f \in H$ . Updated version 1. So far I have: Let $x\in[a,b]$ , define the linear continuous map $L_{x}:H\rightarrow \mathbb{K}$ , with $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ by $$ L_{x}(f):=T(f)(x).$$ Since $H$ is an Hilbert space and $L_{x}:H\rightarrow \mathbb{K}$ is a bounded linear functional on $H$ we can apply the Riesz-Frechet theorem. According to the Riesz-Frechet theorem there exists a unique $g_{x}\in H$ such that for $x\in[a,b]$ and all $f\in H$ $$L_{x}(f)=T(f)(x)=(Tf)(x)=\langle f,g_{x}\rangle.$$ Question 1: have I proven it correctly? Or am I missing some important details? b) Show that $$\sup_{x\in [a,b]} \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|(Te_{j})(x)|^{2}<\infty.$$ A hint is that $||g_{x}||\leq ||T||_{H \rightarrow C[a,b]}$ . Updated version 1. Question 2: how do I prove this hint? I want to prove it before I make use of it. For the rest of the problem I have this so far: Using part a), we have that: $$\sup_{x\in [a,b]} \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|(Te_{j})(x)|^{2}=\sup_{x\in [a,b]} \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|\langle e_{j},g_{x}\rangle|^{2}.$$ Since the $e_{j}$ form an orthonormal basis in $H$ , Bessel's inequality yields $$\sup_{x\in [a,b]}\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|\langle e_{j},g_{x}\rangle|^{2}\leq \sup_{x\in [a,b]}||g_{x}||_{2}^{2}.$$ Now by definition of the operator norm we have: $$\sup_{x\in [a,b]}\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|\langle e_{j},g_{x}\rangle|^{2}\leq \sup_{x\in [a,b]}||g_{x}||_{2}^{2}\leq ||T||\cdot ||g_{x}||.$$ Using the hint and the fact that operator $T$ is bounded we get: $$\sup_{x\in [a,b]}\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|\langle e_{j},g_{x}\rangle|^{2}\leq \sup_{x\in [a,b]}||g_{x}||_{2}^{2}\leq ||T||\cdot ||g_{x}||\leq ||T||\cdot ||T||_{{H \rightarrow C[a,b]}} <\infty.$$ Question 3: Is the proof now complete or am I missing a detail/making a mistake?
In class for example for Bessel's inequality we usually had this form $\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|\langle f,e_{j}\rangle|^{2}\leq ||f||_{2}^{2}<\infty$ . c) Show that $\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}  ||Te_{j}||_{L^{2}}^{2}< \infty$ . Updated version 1. What I have so far: We define the function $$x\mapsto\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|Te_{j}(x)|^{2}.$$ We have from part b): $$\sup_{x\in [a,b]} \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|(Te_{j})(x)|^{2}<\infty.$$ Integrating the function over $(a,b)$ yields $$\int_{a}^{b}\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|Te_{j}(x)|^{2}dx<\infty.$$ Now making use of the Fubini-Tonelli theorem we can interchange limit and integral and get: $$\int_{a}^{b}\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|Te_{j}(x)|^{2}dx=\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\int_{a}^{b}|Te_{j}(x)|^{2}dx=\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}||Te_{j}||_{L^{2}}^{2}<\infty.$$ Question 4: Is the proof now complete or am I missing a detail/making a mistake? In fact the interchange is not clear to me. We did treat Fubini in class but only shorty to change integrals not integral and sum. Usually when changing integral and summation we used monotone convergence. d) Show that $T\colon H\rightarrow L^{2}(a,b)$ is compact. We have to get the result by making use of estimates. Updated version 1.
I could prove it without estimating and had: We note that $H$ and $ L^{2}(a,b)$ are Hilbert spaces and the operator $T\colon H\rightarrow L^{2}(a,b)$ is a bounded linear operator as given before.  Furthermore in part c) we obtained an inequality. Thus we have that $T\colon H\rightarrow L^{2}(a,b)$ is an abstract Hilbert-Schmidt operator. Now we can apply a certain theorem that states that every abstract Hilbert-Schmidt operator is compact. Now for the proof making use of estimates: To show that $T$ is compact, we have to approximate $T$ in the operator norm by finite rank operators. For $N\in\mathbb{N}$ define the linear operator $T_{N}\colon H\rightarrow L^{2}(a,b)$ . Question 5: I don't know how to show that $T_{N}$ is of finite-rank? Normally you would have something along the lines that $T_{N}$ has range within $span\{f_{1},\ldots,f_{N}\}$ and hence is of finite-rank. But for this problem I don't see it. I think you can say that $ran(T)\subseteq C[a,b]$ , but $C[a,b]$ is infinite diminesional so this confuses me. Question 6: How do I show that $||T-T_{N}||\rightarrow 0$ , so I can conclude that $T$ is a compact operator.","['operator-theory', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'compact-operators']"
340798,Largest rectangle in a convex polygon,"What is the least $k > 0$ such that every convex polygon of area $k$ contains a rectangle of area 1? I can prove that $k \le 8$, but surely this can be improved. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a convex polygon of area 8, and let $\overline{PQ}$ be a diameter of $\mathcal{C}$. There is a bounding rectangle $ABCD$ such that $\overline{AB}$ is parallel to $\overline{PQ}$. The line segment $\overline{PQ}$ divides $ABCD$ into two rectangles, at least one of which has area 4 or greater. Assume without loss of generality that the area of $PQBA$ is at least 4, and let $R$ be a point where $\mathcal{C}$ meets $\overline{AB}$. Then the area of the triangle $PQR$ is at least 2, and the largest rectangle inscribed in $PQR$ has area at least 1. Update: Andrés Koropecki pointed out the following theorem of W. Blaschke. Let $K$ is a convex body in $\mathbb{E}^2$, and let $T$ be a triangle with maximum area among all triangles contained in $K$. Then $\frac{\mathrm{Area}(T)}{\mathrm{Area}(K)} 
\ge \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4\pi}$ with equality iff $K$ is an ellipse. This implies that my constant $k$ is at most $\frac{8\pi}{3\sqrt3} \approx 4.837$. Update 2: Bertram Felgenhauer has kindly shown me a proof that $k \le 4$. I will post it later.","['optimization', 'geometry']"

341154,"Is there a rigorous theory of context, whereby sets can gain additional structure within a context?","Consider sets $G$ and $H$ and a function $f : G \rightarrow  H$. So far, it doesn't really make sense to ask whether $G$ and $H$ are groups (technically, the answer is ""no, they're not groups""), and it certainly doesn't make any sense to ask whether $f$ is a group homomorphism. However, viewing $G$ and $H$ as sets equipped with a binary operation , it suddenly makes sense to ask whether $G$ and $H$ are groups. Suppose they are. Then, it also makes sense to ask whether or not $f$ is a group homomorphism. So $G$ and $H$ are just sets, but in context they can be viewed as groups, or topological spaces, or whatever. So what I'm looking for is a rigorous way of endowing sets with additional structure within specific contexts. So for example, in the ""empty-context,"" set $G$ is just a set, with no additional structure. But within a context, $G$ might be equipped with a binary operation, or some open sets, or whatever. As a more complete example, I'd like to make precise the meaning of theorems like the following. Theorem . Let $G$ and $H$ denote sets and $f : G \rightarrow H$ denote a function. Let $\Gamma$ denote a context wherein $G$ and $H$ are groups and $f$ is a group homomorphism. Then the following are equivalent. $f$ is an injection In the context $\Gamma$, it holds that the kernel of $f$ is a singleton set. Note that condition 1 is context-independent, because whether or not $f$ is an injection or not does not depend on the additional structure that $\Gamma$ endows upon $G$ and $H$. On the other hand, condition 2 is context-dependent, because the meaning of ""the kernel of $f$"" depends on the additional structure that $\Gamma$ endows upon $H$. So in conclusion, I'm looking for a rigorous approach to this idea that sets can gain structure within contexts. I want something that is near computer-readable, and not ""hand-waivy."" Remark. Groups are just an example; I am not specifically interested in groups. Edit. What follows is the thinking that lead me to the idea of context. Usually, we can make assumptions by opening a new ""environment"" in our proof. For instance, if $p$ is already a natural number, we can open a new environment in which we assume that $p$ is prime. If we prove the statement $p>10$ within the new environment, then we get to write the statement ""If $p$ is prime, then $p>10$"" in the original environment. Now importantly, when we open a new environment in this way, we are not usually allowed to ""remove"" assumptions. For instance, if $p$ is already natural, we can write ""Assume $p$ is prime,"" but we cannot write, ""Assume $p$ is no longer natural."" That is, we cannot undo an assumption by making a new assumption. In a sense, this is exactly what I'm looking for. I'd like to be able to say, ""Assume $G$ is no longer just a set; assume it is now a set together
  with a binary operation satisfying the group axioms."" Of course, no assumption could possibly achieve this. An assumption cannot undo a previous assumption. So we get clever; we invent the notion of a context. Our sentence becomes: Let $\Gamma$ denote a context in which $G$ is no longer just a set; rather, it is now a set together with a binary operation satisfying the group axioms. Now we've made a bit of progress, because we're no longer trying to use assumptions to undo other assumptions. But this begs the question: what does the above sentence even mean? And what is the right definition of the word ""context""?","['notation', 'soft-question', 'reference-request', 'abstract-algebra']"

where $l>p^{k-1}$ since if $l \leq p^{k-1}$ then we could multiply $m(x)$ be the appropriate factor to obtain $$m(x)p(x) = (x^r - 1)^{p^{k-1}} = x^{p^{k-1}} - 1.$$ and since $\phi$ satisfies $m(x)$ it satisfies the right side which is a contradiction to $n$ being the smallest power of $\phi$ which is the identity.

Borel sets are generated by countable intersections, countable unions, and complements of open sets, but all sets of nonzero measure must be a union of uncountably many points. The union may contain an interval or be composed entirely of discrete points (each with some neighborhood containing no other point from the union).

The following is my proof and I think it is wrong, because I only use the fact that $S^1$ is 1-dimentional. However, I do not know how to correct my proof. ($S^1$ is the unit circle). For any $p\in S^1$, we can choose a chart $(U,\varphi)$ around it. Therefore, every $p\in S^1$ is associated with a vector $v_p^0=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}|_p$ if a chart is given. Now, a function $F$ from $S^1\times\mathbb{R}$ to $TS^1$ is defined by
$$F(p,\lambda)=(p,\lambda v_p^0)$$ I want to show that $F$ is a diffeomorphism. Clearly, $F$ is injective. For any $(p,v)\in TS^1$, we have
$$v=v^1\frac{\partial}{\partial x}|_p$$
$$v_p^0=v_p^{0,1}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}|_p$$
under some chart around $p$. Therefore, we choose $\lambda=v^1/v_p^{0,1}$. $\lambda$ should be independet of choice of charts. Therefore, $F$ is also surjective. Now choose two charts $(U\times\mathbb{R},\varphi\times i)$ and $(\pi^{-1}(U),\tilde{\varphi})$ for $S^1\times\mathbb{R}$ and $TS^1$, respectively. The expression of $F$ is
\begin{align*}
\hat{F}(q,x)&=\tilde{\varphi}\circ F\circ(\varphi\times i)^{-1}(q,x)\\
   &=\tilde{\varphi}\circ F(p,x)\\
   &=\tilde{\varphi}(p,xv_p^0)\\
   &=(q,xv_p^{0,1})

$\hat{F}$ is smooth, since $v_p^{0,1}$ is smooth with respect to $p$. For $F^{-1}$, my proof to show that it is smooth is similar. Therefore, $F$ is diffeomorphism. However, I do not use any specific property of $S^1$ except that $S^1$ is 1-dimentional.

341490,Reference Request: Smoothness Structure on a Set,"I'm reading Milnor's 'characteristic classes', and in the first chapter he defines smoothness structure on a set M, which is confusing for me, as what follows: (these are not Milnor's words so please let me know if something is unclear) He first defines a smooth manifold as a subset of $R^A$ where $A$ can be any index set by means of charts: ($R^A$ is topologized as a Cartesian product) A subset $N \subset R^A$ is a smooth manifold of dimension $n$ if each point in $M$ has a neighborhood diffeomorphic to an open set in $R^n$ such that in each point the tangent space be $n$-dimensional (equivalently the transition functions be smooth). Also a smooth function on $N$ can be defined using charts. Then he defines a smoothness structure on a set: Let $M$ be a set and let $F$ be a collection of real valued functions on $M$ which separates points (that is, given $x \neq y $ in $M$ there exists $f\in F$ with $f(x) \neq f(y)$ ). Then  $M$ can be identified with its image under the canonical imbedding $i :M \rightarrow R^F $.
  The collection $F$ is a smoothness structure on $M$ if the subset $i(M) \subset R^F$ is a smooth manifold, and if $F$ is precisely the set of all smooth real valued functions on this smooth manifold. This definition is confusing for me and I don't know how to work with it, can anyone give me some intuition on this and clarify me or give me a reference? Maybe it's strange for me because he defines smoothness structure on a set not on a topological space. This is one of the problems in this chapter about smoothness structure: Let $P^n$ be the set of all lines through the origin in $R^{n+1}$ and let $q:R^{n+1}-{0} \rightarrow P^n$ be the quotient map. Let $F$ denote the set of all functions $f:P^n \rightarrow R$ such that $f \circ q$ is smooth. Show that F is a smoothness structure on $P^n$. Also it's not clear why this is equivalent to usual smooth structure on real projective space which we talk about it. sorry for long question.","['differential-topology', 'reference-request', 'differential-geometry']"
341521,Baby Rudin theorem 2.41,"I am reading Baby Rudin chapter 2 and came across some question on Theorem 2.41 .
When Rudin tries to prove that every infinite subset of $E$ has a limit points in $E$ implies $E$ is closed, he first supposes $E$ is not closed. Then there exists $x_0$ in $\mathbb{R}^k$ which is a limit point of $E$ but not a point in $E$. Then he constructs the set $S$. But later, he introduces $y$ and applies triangular inequality. I do not understand what $y$ is, and also, how he gets the last inequality of greater than or equal to $\frac12|x_0-y|$? For reference, here is the proof given by Rudin: 2.41 $\ \ $ Theorem $\ \ $ If a set $E$ in ${\bf R}^k$ has one of the following three properties, then it has the other two: $\quad(a)\ \ $ $E$ is closed and bounded. $\quad(b)\ \ $ $E$ is compact . $\quad(c)\ \ $ Every infinite subset of $E$ has a limit point in $E$. Proof $\ \ $ If $(a)$ holds, then $E\subset I$ for some $k$-cell $I$, and $(b)$ follows from Theorems $2.40$ and $2.35$. Theorem $2.37$ shows that $(b)$ implies $(c)$. It remains to be shown that $(c)$ implies $(a)$. $\qquad$ If $E$ is not bounded, then $E$ contains points ${\bf x}_n$ with $$|{\bf x}_n|>n\qquad(n=1,2,3,...).$$ The set $S$ consisting of three points ${\bf x}_n$ is infinite and clearly has no limit point in ${\bf R}^k$, hence has none in $E$. Thus $(c)$ implies that $E$ is bounded. $\qquad$ If $E$ is not closed, then there is a point ${\bf x}_0\in {\bf R}^k$ which is a limit point of $E$ but not a point of $E$. For $n=1,2,3,...,$ there are points ${\bf x}_n\in E$ such that $|{\bf x}_n-{\bf x}_0|<1/n$. Let $S$ be the set of these points ${\bf x}_n$ Then $S$ is infinite (otherwise $|{\bf x}_n-{\bf x}_0|$ would have a constant positive value, for infinitely many $n$), $S$ has ${\bf x}_0$ as a limit point, and $S$ has no other limit point in ${\bf R}^k$. For if $\mathbf y\in{\bf R}^k$, ${\bf y}\neq{\bf x}_0$, then $$\begin{align}|{\bf x}_n-{\bf y}| & \geq |{\bf x}_0-{\bf y}| - |{\bf x}_n-{\bf x}_0| \\ & \geq |{\bf x}_0-{\bf y}|-\dfrac1n\geq \dfrac12|{\bf x}_0-{\bf y}|\end{align}$$ for all but finitely many $n$; this shows that $\bf y$ is not a limit point of $S$ (Theorem $2.20$). $\qquad$ Thus $S$ has no limit point in $E$; hence $E$ must be closed if $(c)$ holds. $\qquad$ We should remark, at this point, that $(b)$ and $(c)$ are equivalent in any metric space (Exercise $26$) but that $(a)$ does not, in general, imply $(b)$ and $(c)$. Examples are furnished by Exercise $16$ and by the space ${\scr L}^2$, which is discussed in Chap. 11.","['proof-explanation', 'real-analysis']"
341533,Dimension of subspace is greater then dimension of space,If $X$ is a topological space then it's (covering) dimension is defined as a minimal number $n$ such that for every finite open cover $\{U\}$ of $X$ there is a finite open cover $\{V\}$ of $X$ that refines $\{U\}$ and such that every point $x \in X$ is contained in no more than $n+1$ set of $\{V\}$. If $X$ has a dimension $n$ and $F$ is a closed subspace of $X$ then $\dim F \leqslant n$. It is an easy exercise: if $\{U\}$ is an open cover of $F$ then $\{U\}$ and $F^c$ give and open cover of $X$ and we can use the definition of dimension for $X$ to obtain $\dim F \leqslant \dim X$. But I didn't find in any book that it is true in general. Also I didn't find a counterexample.   Is it possible that a subspace $Y$ of $X$ has a dimension greater then dimension of $X$?

341535,"Is the theory of dual numbers strong enough to develop real analysis, and does it resemble Newton's historical method for doing calculus?","I've been interested in non-standard analysis recently. I was reading up on it and noticed the following interesting comment on the Wikipedia page about hyperreal numbers , right after giving an example of a nonstandard differentiation: The use of the standard part in the definition of the derivative is a rigorous alternative to the traditional practice of neglecting the square of an infinitesimal quantity... the typical method from Newton through the 19th century would have been simply to discard the $dx^2$ term. I've never heard anything like this before, and really find it fascinating that Newton's method was to define the relation $dx^2 = 0$. If we actually formalize the above structure by taking $\mathbb{R}$ and adjoining an element $dx^2 = 0$ to it, we get the ""dual numbers,"" isomorphic to the quotient ring $\mathbb{R}[x]/x^2$. I'd seen some things about how this algebra plays into automated differentiation algorithms for some computer software systems, but I've never heard anything about Newton directly working in this algebra. So I have a few questions: Does anyone have more historical information on the way that Newton performed differentiation, and its relation to the dual numbers? Does anyone know how effectively real analysis can be formalized with the dual numbers? Does the resulting system play nice enough to develop all of the important modern results? If we start with $\mathbb{C}[x]/x^2$ instead, can we likewise develop complex analysis? Since this idea is so simple, I'm very curious how powerful it is. I'm also curious if it has any major drawbacks too, since I'm not sure why anyone would mess with the foundational baggage involved in defining the hyperreals if this simple 2-dimensional real algebra could really do the trick.","['calculus', 'math-history', 'abstract-algebra', 'real-analysis', 'nonstandard-analysis']"

341542,"""Coordinate ring'' of the algebraic $n$-torus","I'm trying to calculate the ""coordinate ring'' of the algebraic $n$-torus $(\mathbb C^n)^\ast$: If $X:=\mathbb C^n$ and $U:=(\mathbb C^n)^\ast$, we have that $X$ is an irreducible affine algebraic set ad $U$ is an open subset (with the Zariski topology). By definition we have that the ring of regular functions on $U$ is: $$\mathcal O_X(U)=\bigcap_{x\in U}\Gamma(X)_{\mathfrak m_x}$$ where $\Gamma(X)=\mathbb C[T_1,\ldots,T_n]$ is the coordinate ring of $X$ and $\mathfrak m_x=\{f\in\Gamma(X)\,:\, f(x)=0\}$. But clearly 
$$U=X\setminus V(T_1,\ldots,T_n)= D(T_1)\cup\ldots\cup D(T_n) $$ so 
$$\mathcal O_X(U)=\mathcal O_X(D(T_1))\cap\ldots\cap\mathcal O(D(T_n))$$ and by the fact that $\mathcal O_X(D(f))=\Gamma(X)_f$ we can conclude finally that: $$\mathcal O_X(U)=\mathbb C[T_1,\ldots, T_n]_{T_1}\cap\ldots\cap\mathbb C[T_1,\ldots, T_n]_{T_n}$$ Now I have two questions. (technical question). How can I describe formally the ring $\mathbb C[T_1,\ldots, T_n]_{T_1}\cap\ldots\cap\mathbb C[T_1,\ldots, T_n]_{T_n}$? Why it should be $\mathbb C[T_1^{\pm 1},\ldots, T_n^{\pm 1}]$? With the coordinate ring of an algebraic affine set $X$ in $\mathbb C^n$, I intend the ring $\mathbb C[T_1,\ldots,T_n]/I(X)$; in this case $U$ is not an affine variety but is a prevariety (finite union of affine variety), so what is the meaning of saying ""the coordinate ring of $U$""?  If $X$ is an affine variety then $\mathcal O_X(X)=\Gamma(X)$, so the global sections of the structural sheaf are the elements of the coordinate ring, why in this case $\mathcal O_X(U)$ should be the coordinate ring of $U$?",['algebraic-geometry']
