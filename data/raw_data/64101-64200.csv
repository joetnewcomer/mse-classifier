741710,"Closed, orientable surface whose genus is very hard to find intuitively","I'm introducing the Classification Theorem on closed and orientable surfaces in a talk on (intuitive) topology, and to motivate it I'd like an example of an embedding of a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose genus is very hard to find. The requirements are: Closed and orientable 2-manifold Difficult to mentally bend and twist (even allowing ""ghostly passing-through"") into any familiar surface (e.g. connected sum of $g$ tori ) I allow ""ghostly passing-through"" so that knotting won't hinder the investigation of homeomorphisms. But after allowing that, some nice examples becomes easy: (Image from ""An Introduction to Topology"" by E. C. Zeeman ) The above example would have been hard, but once ghostly passing-through is allowed, It's easy to pull out the internal tunnels and show that it is homeomorphic to a triple torus. The difficulty of finding the surface's genus will also help me to motivate my introduction of the Euler characteristic .","['examples-counterexamples', 'general-topology', 'education', 'manifolds', 'surfaces']"
741722,"Given a differentiable function for every $x \geq 0$, define a differentiable function for every $x$","Given $f(x)$: $f(0)=1$ Positive for every $x \geq 0$ Differentiable for every $x \geq 0$ Let $g(x)=

  f(x)    & \text{$x \geq 0$}\\
  1/f(-x) & \text{$x \leq 0$}

$ Is $g(x)$ differentiable for every $x$? I believe that the answer is yes, because the only questionable point is at $x=0$. And since $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to 0^-}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to 0^+}{g(x)} = 1}$, function $g(x)$ is differentiable  at that point. For $x>0$, function $g(x)$ is differentiable because function $f(x)$ is differentiable. For $x<0$, function $g(x)$ is differentiable because function $1/f(-x)$ is differentiable. Is this correct, or am I missing something (a counterexample would be appreciated in this case)?","['calculus', 'derivatives']"

741771,Pull-backs of diagrams of groups with free product.,"Until recently I calculated only pull-back of diagrams of finite groups. 
Now I am trying to calculate the pull-back of diagram of groups when the groups are free products of other groups.
It seems very hard to prove that a group $G$ is a pull-back of such diagram by definition.
Is there an easier way to either calculate the pull-back or proving that a group is the pull-back of such diagram.
My easiest example I am interested is the following:
$G_1=F_1*C_3$, $G_2=F_2*C_2$ with natural epimorphisms to the group $C_6$ (the generator of $F_1$ goes to an element of order 2 in $C_6$ and generators of $F_2$ goes to elements of order 3 in $C_6$). Here $F_n$ is the free group with $n$ generators and $*$ is the free product.","['category-theory', 'group-theory']"

741860,Lebesgue Measure - positive measure sets not containing intervals,"I've encountered two statements regarding the Lebesgue measure that don't exactly contradict each other, but seem to me to be a little bit unintuitive when regarded with respect to one another.
The statements are: For each interval $[a,b]$
  there exists a set $K\subset[a,b]$
  that is compact , totally disconnected and with positive measure (i.e. doesn't contain an interval). Let $A\subset\mathbb{R}$
  be some measurable set, and $0\leq\alpha<1$
  such that for every interval $I\subset\mathbb{R}$
  it holds that $m(A\cap I)\leq\alpha m(I)$
  then $m(A)=0$ The second statement seems to imply that any positive measure set must contain an interval up to a set of arbitrary measure $\epsilon>0$ (since a suitable $\alpha$ can't be found for a positive measure set). On the other hand the first statement says that for any interval I can find a subset of any desired positive ""not-full"" measure.
I realize these statements don't contradict, but they seem a little ""contradictory in nature"". Intuitively I would expect the first statement to somehow allow me to  construct a positive measure set with the property desired in the second statement. I don't really have a question here but was hoping maybe someone can shed their own perspective on how they see these two properties of the Lebesgue measure co-existing. Maybe you can give me some further intuition. Thanks a lot!","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"
741869,The principal curvatures of a surface of revolution,"The principal curvatures of the surface at a point is defined as the maximal and the minimal curvature among all normal sections. It's claimed (say, on Stillwell's Geometry of Surfaces ) that for a pseudosphere (or generally a surface of revolution) the extremal curvatures are obtained when the normal section coincides or is perpendicular to the plane determined by the longitude and the axis of revolution. It's said that the proposition follows clearly from symmetry. According to that book, there's no differential geometric tool (such as the second fundamental form, etc) introduced, so I need an intuitive and elementary explanation for that fact. After googling, I found an explanation which depends on the knowledge of Dupin indicatrix, which is intuitive and computation-free, though not that elementary. It's really clear that the Dupin indicatrix is reflection-symmetric along the plane determined by the longitude and the axis of revolution, thus one direction of principal curvature is determined. The other one is normal to this. Any help? Thanks!","['surfaces', 'differential-geometry']"

It seems that we can weaken the condition as follows: If $X$ is second countable (even not $T_1$), then any closed subset $F$ of $X$ can be written as the disjoint union of a perfect subset and an at most countable subset The canonical proof applies as follows: Suppose $\mathcal B$ is a countable base. Let $P$ be the set of condensation points, since $F$ is closed, $P\subseteq F$. For each $x\in F\setminus P$, we assign $B_x\in\mathcal B$ such that $x\in B_x$, and $B_x\cap F$ is at most countable, then there's a map $\phi\colon F\setminus P\to\mathcal B,x\mapsto B_x$. Note that the preimage of each $B_x$ is at most countable, therefore $F\setminus P$ is countable. It remains to show that $P$ is perfect. Every point $p\in P$ is a condensation point of $F$, hence $P$, since $F\setminus P$ is countable, hence a limit point of $P$. Conversely, if $x\not\in P$, there's an open set $\mathcal O$ contains $x$ such that $\mathcal O\cap F$ is at most countable, hence $\mathcal O\cap P=\emptyset$.

742164,Working out an example of a Chern class,"I'm trying to understand page 161 of Fulton's ""Young tableaux"" in an explicit example. I'm looking at flags in $\mathbb{C}^4$, which I think of as flags in $\mathbb{CP}^3$ (and I'm really just able to think of its real points). I denote by $X$ the set of all such flags. I have fixed a flag, consisting of a point $p$ contained in a line $l$ contained in a plane $\pi$, all in $\mathbb{CP}^3$. They correspond to a flag $F_1 \subset F_2 \subset F_3$ in $\mathbb{C}^4$, with $\dim(F_i) = i$. Now Fulton defines a class $x_1$ in $H^2(X)$ as follows: $x_1 = -c_1(U)$ where $U$ is the line bundle which to the point $E_1 \subset E_2 \subset E_3$ associates $E_1$. I'm fully aware that there is an axiomatic definition of Chern classes which accomplish most of what one wants to use them for, but in this case I'm interested in finding an explicit representative for this cycle $x_1$ on $X$.

Take any section $X \to U$ and define $c_1(U)$ to be the class of its zero locus. his is well-defined as a class, at least if there are globally defined sections on $X$.

742285,Fermat Curve example and questions from coding theory.,"I've been studying the basics of Algebraic Geometry for coding theory using the Pless-Huffman book. However since this is mostly self study, and without good resources I still feel a little shaky on the subject as a whole. So I'm attempting to work through an example from the book and see how it works out, with hopefully some help. Statement: Let X be the Fermat Curve over $F_2$ of genus 1 defined by $x^3+y^3+z^3=0$. Let $P_\infty$=(1:1:0) and $P^1_\infty$={$(\omega:1:0),(\overline\omega:1:0)$} be the points at infinity on X. Let D= k($P_\infty + P^1_\infty$) for some positive integer k. Question1: Show that dim(L(D))=3k Question2: Find the intersection divisor of the Fermat Curve with the curve x=0. Question3: Find the intersection divisor of the Fermat Curve with the curve y=0. Question4: Find the intersection divisor of the Fermat Curve with the curve z=0. Question5: Compute ($x^i y^j$/$z^i z^j$) Where i and j are non-negative integers. Question6: What is the restriction on div($x^i y^j$/$z^i z^j$ so that it is in L(D) Attempt:
Q1: By Riemann-Roch theorem if deg(D)>2g-2 => dim(L(D))=deg(d)-g+1 where g is the genus. Since the genus is 1. deg(D)>2(1)-2 or deg(D)>0 using D from above we get deg(k$P_\infty$)+deg(k$P^1_\infty$)=k(1)+k(2). Since k>0 => deg(d)>0. So we can use the Riemann-Rock theorem. So dim(L(D))=deg(k$P_\infty$)+deg(k$P^1_\infty$)-g+1 =>k+2k-1+1=3k. Q2:The curve x=0 does not meet with the divisor(s) of the Fermat Curve. So by Bezout's Theorem the intersection divisor should be zero. Q3: The curve y=0 again does not meet with the divisor(s) of the Fermat Curve. So by the same theorem the intersection divisor should be zero. Q4: The curve z=0 meets both the divisors of the Fermat Curve. So then the intersection divisor should be $deg_D * D$ = 1$P_\infty$ + 2$P^1_\infty$ (Not too sure on this one due to multiplicity and degree) Q5:div($x^i y^j$/$z^i z^j$) works a lot like a log from the examples in the book. So I get div($x^i y^j$/$z^i z^j$)= div($x^i y^j$) - div($z^i z^j$) = 0 - (i)div(z)+(j)div(z)  (Not sure about this part since the examples in the book replace div(z) with the answer from Q4) => -(i+j)($P_\infty$+2$P^1_\infty$) Q6: Since I am not sure about Q5, I cannot be too sure about Q6. But we look for when div($x^i y^j$/$z^i z^j$)+D is effective. But if Q5 is right that means that k$P_\infty$ + k$P^1_\infty$ -(i+j)($P_\infty$+2$P^1_\infty$)$\geq$0 So if at all possible I'd like some direction on Q4-Q6.

742440,Is this counter-intuitive result actually correct?,"I was trying to calculate the surface area of part of a sphere. The result seems counter-intuitive. I have found that the surface area of a sphere increases linearly. Consider the circle, centre $(r,0)$ and radius $r>0$. This has equation $(x-r)^2 + y^2 = r^2$. For $y>0$, we can write $y$ as a function of $x$. Direct calculation shows that $y(x) = \sqrt{2rx-x^2}$ for all $0 < x < 2r$. The usual formula for rotating the graph of a curve (given as a function of $x$) around the $x$-axis to find the surface area of revolution is
$$A = 2\pi \int_{x_1}^{x_2} y\sqrt{1+(y')^2} \, \mathrm{d}x$$ In my case, I have the limits $x_1=0$ and $x_2=h \le 2r$. We have
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
A &=& 2\pi \int_0^h \sqrt{2rx-x^2}\sqrt{1+\frac{(r-x)^2}{2rx-x^2}} \, \mathrm{d}x \\ \\ \\
&=&2\pi\int_0^h \sqrt{2rx-x^2}\sqrt{\frac{r^2}{2rx-x^2}} \, \mathrm{d}x \\ \\ \\
&=&2\pi\int_0^h r\, \mathrm{d}x \\ \\ \\
&=&2\pi r h
\end{eqnarray*}$$ This gives two correct results: when $h=0$ we have $A=0$ and when $h=2r$ we have $A=4\pi r^2$. However, it seems counter-intuitive that the area should be a linear function in $h$. For example, let $B(a,b)$ be the ""belt"" bounded by $x=a$ and $x=b$. Two belts of the same width should have different surface areas depending on how close their centres are to $x=r$.

742486,Combining confidence intervals for sums of generic random variables,"So my fiancee is a civil servant and asked me for help with the following problem. She has been given a collection of upper and lower bounds on expenditure for a collection of projects like: Project A: 2 million- 70 million Project B: 55 million to 60 million and so on... She wants to provide a suitable interval for probable total expenditure. Now the obvious technique is to just add up the upper bounds and add up the lower bounds, but a lot of the ranges are huge and there's over 300 projects- so this gives something like: 65 million-700 million This is obviously rubbish in the sense that both of the extremes are incredibly unlikely, and the upper bound differs from the lower by a factor of 10. Her colleagues have variously suggested narrowing the bounds in cases where they are less likely (which strikes me as very bad for birthday paradox type reasons), and to do something my fiancee remembers as being called 'Optimisation Bias', which google has never heard of. After some thought, it struck me that modelling these as gaussians, you can translate pretty easily from confidence interval to standard deviation and then back after some playing, that is: If $r_i:=\max(X_i)-\min(X_i)$ And we pretend $r_i=Z_i\sigma_i$ then $R:=\sqrt{\Sigma r_i^2}=\sqrt{\Sigma Z_i^2 \sigma_i^2} \geq \min_i Z_i \sigma$ (where $\sigma$ is the s.d. of the sum) So you get a confidence interval with at least the confidence level of at least that of the 'least confident variable', which you can put either side of your expected value to get a much reduced interval. But when you don't assume normality, you need to start playing with Chebychev-type inequalities to translate between confidence and s.d., and the sheer variety of these makes my head hurt, and after some mucking around with the tamer ones trying to get a theoretical bound on the confidence level of the resulting interval, I've decided it's time to ask the internet. So my questions: First, this seems like a common problem, is there a current consensus on best practice here, possibly using a totally different approach? ('Optimisation Bias' perhaps?!?!?) Second, and this is just out of interest for me really, if one prats about with inequalities for long enough, does a sensible bound for confidence emerge for the 'square-sum-square-root interval' I've concocted if the distribution is generic?

It is well-known as an example of a function that is everywhere continuous and nowhere differentiable. When reading about fractals for the first time, I quickly recalled the Weierstrass function, which indeed made understanding fractals more simple. Recall that the Mandelbrot set is the set of values in the complex plane where $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$ where $z_0 = 0$ and $c$ is a number so that the sequence remains bounded. The Mandelbrot set is just one of many examples where self-similarity is a prominent feature. I chose it because its the only one I can define. Is there a purely mathematical connection/similarity between the Weierstrass function and the Mandelbrot set that is not a trivial consequence of self-similarity? (Note that I, as a first-year undergraduate, am very slack with the word ""trivial."" I would deem almost any example other than ""they are similar in the sense that they both display self-similarity"" non-trivial.) Can such connections be found between the Weierstrass function and (every other) fractal? Lastly, is there a connection between (the lack of) differentiability/slopes and self-similarity of functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$? In particular, are there examples of everywhere continuous, nowhere differentiable functions in all dimensions trivially similar to the Weierstrass function?","['calculus', 'fractals']"
742525,Unusual result when comparing trigonometry and Pythagoras in triangles.,"I'm a Scottish Higher maths student. I was looking over some old textbooks, and came across a seemingly easy question, involving a circle within a triangle. I used the expected method to solve it; that is, it was in a chapter on Pythagoras' theorem, and I used this method to solve it. However, I was curious, and decided to solve it using trigonometry, the ""SOH CAH TOA"" method. Upon doing this, I received a different answer, and I don't understand why. This isn't urgent, I'm just curious! I've attached the question and my method below. Can anyone help? Question: An equilateral triangle has a circle inside it. The sides of the triangle are tangents to the circle. The radius of the circle is 2.4cm, and the distance from the centre of the circle to the vertex of the triangle is 5.1cm. Find the length of the triangle's side. As I mentioned, I used pythag to find half of the equilateral triangles side, making a right angled triangle with half of the equilateral triangle's side, the radius of the circle, and the known length between the circles centre and the corner. This gave me a result of 4.5cm.
I then realised there were multiple ways to solve the same problem using trigonometry.
I used sine, using the same triangle I used for the pythag, and using the rules of the triangles, I found that the top, unknown angle, was 60 degrees, as the corner of the equilateral triangle had to be 60 degrees, and the hypotenuse of my smaller triangle cut it in half, leaving the inner angle as 30 degrees. However, when I solved this out, I got an answer of 4.42cm. This of course is not 4.5cm, my pythag result! I've been looking at this over and over, but I just can't figure it out.

I have attempted this so many times and just keep getting so confused with what the question really wants, since I get something very complicated, as I get when I try to solve it. However, when I look at a similar markscheme it's quite simply put, but I don't understand how. I know that I can use $det(AᵀA)$ to get $σ^2$ or I can get σ with $det(A-λI)$. So those give me the same, which are the diagonals of $Σ$ and the rest of $Σ$ consists of zeros. So I get $$\Sigma = \left(

 \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left(3+\sqrt{5}\right)} & 0 \\
 0 & \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left(3-\sqrt{5}\right)} \\

742871,Newton's Method for Roots of Polynomials,"The standard way to use Newton's Method for finding a root of a polynomial $p(x)$ is to use the iteration formula $$x_{n+1}=x_n-{p(x)\over p'(x)}$$ I recently thought of a new way of finding the roots. Letting $x_1,...,x_n$ denote the $n$ roots and setting $p(x)=x^n+\cdots +a_1x+a_0$, we have the formulas $$x_1+\cdots +x_n=-a_{n-1}$$ $$x_1x_2+\cdots +x_{n-1}x_n=a_{n-2}$$ and so on to $$x_1x_2\cdots x_n=(-1)^na_0$$ This gives a non-linear system of $n$ variables and $n$ equations, which can be solved using the multivariable version of Newton's method. We would use the iteration $$\bf x_{n+1}=x_n-[Df(x_n)]^{-1}f(x_n)$$ where $$f(x_1,...,x_n)=\begin{bmatrix}x_1+\cdots +x_n+a_{n-1} \\ x_1x_2+\cdots +x_{n-1}x_n-a_{n-2} \\ \vdots \\ x_1\cdots x_n-(-1)^na_0 \end{bmatrix}$$ and $Df$ is the derivative matrix of $f$. My question is: is there any advantage to using this method for finding roots? The obvious plus is that using the multivariable Newton's method provides all $n$ roots simultaneously while the regular method only gives them one at a time. However, I'm also interested in how the rate of convergence of this method would compare with the other, and if one would tend to be more numerically stable than the other.","['multivariable-calculus', 'newton-raphson', 'numerical-methods']"
742880,Help with this trigonometry problem?,"Is there an easier way of doing this problem: A square tower stands upon a horizontal plane.

Show that the height of the tower is to the breadth of one of its sides as $\sqrt{6}(\sqrt{5}+1)$ is to 4. I'm not sure if my approach is  correct since it seems that to get the result using the way I've done it isn't as simple as previous questions have been (a few lines of working). In the digram $a$ is the length of the side of the tower and $h$ is the height of the tower. To start I tried to find $x$ in the diagram:
$$ h^2=\frac{a^2}{2}+(x+\frac{\sqrt{2}a}{2})^2 $$
which already isn't very straight forward to find $x$ but I was using Mathematica just to see if this method would eventually work which gave $x$ to be: $$ x=\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{4 h^2-2 a^2}-\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} $$
which if we then use the top right triangle that $\tan{60^\circ}=h/x$:
$$ \sqrt{3}=\frac{h}{\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{4 h^2-2 a^2}-\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}}$$
which simplifies to give (well it reduces to this according to Mathematica, I can't seem to easily do it, but since I'm convinced there's an easier way I didn't spend too long on it.):
$$ a=\frac{h(\sqrt{5}-1)}{\sqrt{6}}$$

Prove that if $a$ is an element of $G$, then the subset $aHa^{-1} = \{g ∈ G | g = aha^{-1} \text{ for some } h \in H\}$ is a subgroup of $G$ that is isomorphic to $H$. Proof: Let $G$ be a group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. Suppose $a$ is any element of $G$. Now $ϕ: H \rightarrow aHa^{-1}$ be defined by $ϕ(h) = aha^{-1}.$  So $$ϕ(h_1 h_2) = ah_1h_2a^{-1} = ah_1a^{-1} ah_2a^{-1} = ϕ(h_1) ϕ(h_2)  $$
Thus, ϕ is a homomorphism. (one-to-one) Now
$$\begin{eqnarray*}h \in \operatorname{ker}(ϕ) &\text{if and only if}&ϕ(h) = 0\\

\sum_{i}^r \left[\left(\sum_{\sigma_1\in t_iH}\chi_{1}(\sigma_1)\right)\left(\sum_{\sigma_2\in t_iH}\chi_{2}(\sigma_2)\right)\left(\sum_{\sigma_3\in t_iH}\chi_{3}(\sigma_3)\right)\right]
$$ Actually, I just need to know if it is zero or not. In the case where $H=\{e\}$ (the trivial group) we get $$
\sum_{\sigma\in G}\chi_1(\sigma)\chi_2(\sigma)\chi_3(\sigma),
$$ and we can reinterpret this as the multiplicity of the trivial rep of $G$ in the (tensor) product rep $\chi_1\otimes \chi_2\otimes \chi_3$ of $G\times G\times G$ restricted to $G$ via $g \mapsto (g,g,g
)$. In the case where $H=G$ we get $$
\left(\sum_{\sigma_1\in G}\chi_{1}(\sigma_1)\right)\left(\sum_{\sigma_1\in G}\chi_{2}(\sigma_2)\right)\left(\sum_{\sigma_3\in G}\chi_{3}(\sigma_3)\right),

Hence if $\chi_1$, $\chi_2$ and $\chi_3$ are irreducible we get a non-zero answer iff each character is trivial. In the intermediate cases with $H$ a proper subgroup, I was hoping it would also just be a matter of reinterpreting using inner products of induced characters $H\uparrow G$, but this doesn't seem to work out (unless I am missing something). As per my question title you see it comes down to average values of the characters on each coset, but I can't see a nice way of understanding what this is telling me.
