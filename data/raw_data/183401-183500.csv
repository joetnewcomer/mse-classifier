3356768,What is a positively oriented Jordan curve?,"I'm reading the book ""Methods of Nonlinear Analysis"" written by Pavel Drábek. In this book there's the following proposition: Let $\gamma$ be a positively oriented Jordan curve , $\sigma(B)\subset \text{int}\,  \gamma $ ( $\sigma(B)$ is the set of
  all eigenvalues of $B$ ), and let $f$ be a holomorphic function on a
  neighborhood of $\overline{\text{int}\, \gamma}$ . Then $$f(B)x=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int _\gamma f(w)\left(w I-B\right)^{-1}xdw,\,
 \, \, \, x\in X$$ However, the book doesn't say what a positively oriented Jordan curve is. Question 1: What does it mean precisely to say that $\gamma$ is a positively oriented Jordan curve? In the book ""Noncommutative Functional Calculus"", written by Fabrizio Colombo, there's the following proposition: Let $U$ be an open bounded set in $C$ such set $\partial U$ is a finite union of continuously differentiable Jordan curves . Let $f:U\cup \partial U\to X$ be a holomorphic function. Then $$\int_{\partial U}f(z)dz=0$$ Question 2: What does it mean precisely to say that a set $\partial U$ is the finite union of Jordan curves? Thank you for your attention!",['complex-analysis']
3356878,Transformation of Yang Mills field,"I am trying to recover the transformation properties of a Yang-Mills field and I'm not sure if I am wrong or if I am misunderstanding what is meant by a Yang-Mills field. Suppose I had a principle $G$ bundle $P \xrightarrow\pi M$ and a connection 1-form $\omega$ . Given a local section $\sigma_i : U_i \to P$ , I can do two things with my connection Pull $\omega$ down to $U_i$ by defining $\omega_i = \sigma_i^*(\omega)$ I can use my section to trivialize $\pi^{-1}(U_i)$ by $h_i :U \times G \to \pi^{-1}(U_i) $ taking $(m,g) \mapsto \sigma_i(m) \cdot g $ . With this I can pull back $\omega$ to $U \times G$ by $\omega \mapsto h_i^* \omega$ . As I understand it, the Yang-Mills field is $\omega_i$ , i.e. the object defined on the local patch $U_i$ . The claim is that under change of section the Yang-Mills field transforms as $$\omega_j = Ad_{\Omega^{-1}}\omega_i + (R_\Omega)^*\theta$$ Where $\sigma_j = \sigma_i\cdot\Omega$ is a new section on $U_j$ , $(R_\Omega)^*$ is the pushforward arising from the right $G$ action, and $\theta$ is the Maurer-Cartan form on $G$ . However if I try and compute the transformation of the what I've been calling the Yang-Mills field I get something else. The action of $\omega_j$ on $v\in T_mU_j$ is $\omega_j(v) = \sigma_j^*\omega(v) = \omega({\sigma_j}_* v) = \omega((\sigma_i \cdot \Omega)_* v) = (R_\Omega^*\omega)({\sigma_i}_* v) = Ad_{\Omega^{-1}}[\omega({\sigma_i}_* v)] = Ad_{\Omega^{-1}}[\omega_i (v)]$ Where the first equality follows from the definition of $\omega_j$ , the next from the definition of the pushforward, the next follows from $\sigma_j = \sigma_i\cdot\Omega$ . The next equality follows from associativity of pushforward, the next equality follows from the definition of a connection 1 form, and the final equality follows from the definition of $\omega_i$ . All this seems to give me that $\omega_j = Ad_{\Omega^{-1}}\omega_i$ . On the other hand I know that $$h_i^*\omega = \omega_i + \theta$$ Again, $\theta$ is the Maurer-Cartan 1-form on G. In this case under change of section the $\omega_i$ should transform as I worked out before and $\theta$ should transform as any form defined on G, namely $\theta \mapsto (R_\Omega)^*\theta$ . this gives me that $$h_j^*\omega = Ad_{\Omega^{-1}}\omega_i + (R_\Omega)^*\theta$$ But this is precisely what is claimed to be the transformation properties of the Yang-Mills field. So am I making a mistake in my calculations, or am I misunderstanding which field is the Yang-Mills field?",['differential-geometry']

3357335,Homotopy equivalence between spaces intuition,"Before this is marked as a duplicate , I have already went through all similar titled threads and none were helpful for the confusion I'm having, which I will explain shortly. Two spaces $X$ and $Y$ are homotopy equivalent if there are continuous functions $f$ and $g$ such that $f:X \to Y,g: Y \to X$ such that $g \circ f$ and $f \circ g$ are both homotopic to the identity. What I want to understand is what intuitive idea this definition captures and why that idea follows from the definition. All threads I've seen that address this question only address the former and not the latter. Here is what I mean by this. These threads usually are something to the effect of ""Homotopy equivalent spaces can be thought of as spaces that can be continuously stretched, squished, deformed into the other"" without explaining how this intuitive sentiment is translated from the formal definition. If not, these threads will try to make the idea of a homotopy intuitive through the use of various examples, usually deformation retractions. Here are some examples of these threads: 1 , 2 , this one, I don't have the background to fully understand , 4 , Wikipedia, and a lot more. I understand the idea behind a homotopy and I intuitively understand how a deformation retraction looks like. Indeed, I understand that a deformation retraction satisfies the definition of homotopy equivalence - but that's just it. I know how to show it satisfies the property of homotopy equivalence, just like I know that integer addition satisfies associativity. But why should I believe that the homotopy equivalence definition captures the intuitive idea that people claim it captures when associativity of a binary operator doesn't fully capture the idea addition? It feels arbitrary. In conclusion, Homotopy equivalence seems like an arbitrary weakening of the homeomorphism definition and I can't seem to divine any intuition from its formal definition. I've scoured the internet and multiple texts and none were helpful. This is a problem as I try to proceed through Hatcher without any intuition of it whatsoever.","['general-topology', 'soft-question', 'algebraic-topology']"
3357351,Dual of $L^1(\mu)$ in general...,"I've been wondering about the dual of $L^1(\mu)$ when $\mu$ is not $\sigma$ -finite. Just got a copy of Cohn Measure Theory . I  see various results showing the dual is $L^\infty$ for some non- $\sigma$ -finite  measures, but of course that's simply not true for a general measure; so far I don't see anything about what the dual actually is in general. I'm wondering: Say $g$ is locally meaasurable if $g\chi_E$ is measurable for every measurable  set $E$ with $\mu(E)<\infty$ (equivalently, if $fg$ is measurable for every $f\in L^1$ ). Question. Suppose $\mu$ is a measure and $\Lambda\in L^1(\mu)^*$ . Does it follow that there exists  a bounded locally measurable function $g$ with $\Lambda f = \int fg$ ? Probably it's a standard counterexample and I'm just being ignorant again.  But the few counterexamples to $(L^1)^*=L^\infty$ that I know are not counterexamples to this: Example. Say $X$ is an uncountable set, $A$ is the algebra of countable or co-countable sets, and $\mu$ is counting measure on $X$ , restricted to $A$ . It's  easy to see that if $\Lambda\in (L^1)^*$ then there exists a bounded  function $g$ with $\Lambda f=\int fg$ , and here every function is locally measurable. (If $g$ is bounded and not mesasurable then $f\mapsto\int fg$ is an element of $(L^1)^*$ that is not induced by an $L^\infty$ function.) Warning: If like me you find yourself skimming through Cohn without  reading the first few chapters carefully, Proposition 3.3.5 will seem clearly false: Cohn 3.3.5, paraphrased. If $\mu$ is a measure and $g\in L^\infty(\mu)$ then $||g||_\infty=||g||_{(L^1)^*}$ . $\newcommand\set[1]{\{#1\}}$ Apparent Counterexample. Let $X=\set{1,2}$ , $\mu(\set 0)=1$ , $\mu(\set 1)=\infty$ . Let $g=\chi_{\set 1}$ . Then $||g||_\infty=1$ , $||g||_{(L^1)^*}=0$ . Resolution. Cohn's $||g||_\infty$ is not what you think. Say the measurable set $N$ is locally null if $\mu(N\cap E)=0$ for every measurable set $E$ with $\mu(E)<\infty$ . He defines $||g||_\infty$ to be the infimum of the $M$ such that $\set{x:|f(x)|\ge M}$ is locally null. (Of course in the $\sigma$ -finite case that's equivalent to what seems to me to be the more standard definition.)

3357379,Need your thoughts on a faster approximation for the signum function I came up with.,"I recently was kind of fascinated with the whole signum function out of the blue, and was generally really curious of the already existing approximations of it. I really don't want to lag this down and before I show you mine, here are the pre-existing ones; $$\bbox[5px,border:2px solid blue]
{sgn(x)\approx\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+k_2^2}},\;\;\;\;\; for\;k_2 \to 0}\tag{Eq. 1}\label{1}$$ $$sgn(x)\approx tanh(kx), \;\;\;\;\; for\; k >> 1\tag{Eq. 2}\label{2}$$ These are the basic ones, and can be found at the wikipedia page for signum function . I've also looked for other sources for other approximations to this and here is what I've found; $$sgn(x)\approx\frac{x\left(1+k\left|x\right|\right)}{1+\left|x\right|\left(1+k\left|x\right|\right)},\;\;\;\;\; x ∈ R, k ≥ 0\tag{Eq. 3}\label{3}$$ $$\bbox[5px,border:2px solid black]
{sgn(x)\approx\frac{e^{kx}-e^{-kx}}{e^{kx}+e^{-kx}},\;\;\;\;\; x ∈ R, k ≥ 1}\tag{Eq. 4}\label{4}$$ These two has been taken from this research paper . Where Eq. 3 is called Parametric Algebraic Activation (PAA) function and Eq. 4 is called Parametric Hyperbolic Tangent Activation (PHTA) function . And the last one which I found is really good, is; $$\bbox[5px,border:2px solid darkviolet]
{sgn(x)\approx\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{k_2}x\right),\;\;\;\;\;k_2 \to 0}\tag{Eq. 5}\label{5}$$ Unfortunately, I'm still finding the source paper for this. I'll put it soon enough (If anyone knows it, please edit it in, thank you). Here $erf$ is called the error function (also called the Gauss error function).This has been the best approximation that I could find. Now as that is over, here is my approximation; $$\bbox[5px,border:2px solid darkorange]
{sgn(x)=\frac{kx}{|kx|!}||kx|-1|!, \;\;\;\;\; k≥1}\tag{Eq. 6}\label{6}$$ Now Eq. 6 is somewhat a really good approximation on its own, but Eq. 05 still beats it to a little degree. So I wanted to make another much more good expression, So I came up with this; $$\bbox[5px,border:2px solid red]
{sgn(x)=\frac{k\left(x+\frac{x}{\left|kx\right|!}\right)\left(\left|\left|k\left(x+\frac{x}{\left|kx\right|!}\right)\right|-1\right|\right)!}{\left|k\left(x+\frac{x}{\left|kx\right|!}\right)\right|!}, \;\;\;\;\; k≥1}\tag{Eq. 7}\label{7}$$ Now this equation is just an extended form of Eq. 6 and is much more good. And when I say it is good, I meant that even for fewer values of $k$ ,
  the graph of this approximation will tend to  look like this; . Btw, if you're thinking why are factorials doing in Eq 6 & 7, when it is only for integers, this uses the Gamma function (Γ) which extends the factorial function for all positive numbers as compared to the usual positive integers. Now there is one big motive to why I came up with Eq. 6; some may notice it, but as this is getting long as it is, I'm not going to explain. And also the reason why I color-coded some of these approximations is that, I want to show them in a graphing calculator as follows. https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lsb0sonxxq . I've selected some of the best approximations and my 2 approximations for comparison. And all the colored lines are as per the respective color-coded approximation that I did in this post. Here is an image of it. For the grph-image above, I put $k=4$ for Eq $\color{black}{4}$ , $\color{orange}{6}$ , $\color{red}{7}$ and $k_2=4^{-1}$ for Eq $\color{blue}{1}$ , $\color{darkviolet}{5}$ FURTHERMORE ; I know that this isn't much of a question that are usually asked in here, I just wanted to know whether my methods are correct or not as I was not able to get any help elsewhere. I'm really new to complex contents of math myself. So if I did any mistake or some of these are just too obvious or things I do ignorantly, please forgive them. Any opinion, criticism, comment is really appreciated. So what do you guys think of this? I've never seen factorial function used in any approximations. And I think my approximation is kind of a Hard-sigmoid/Saturation type of function while the others are regular Sigmoids.","['functions', 'approximation', 'discrete-mathematics']"

The author wrote as follows ( p. 555 ): Moreover, if we replace $z$ by $i z$ in the series for $e^z$ , and make a rearrangement of the terms (justified by absolute convergence), something particularly interesting happens: $$e^{i z} = 1 + i z + \frac{(iz)^2}{2!} + \frac{(iz)^3}{3!} + \frac{(iz)^4}{4!} + \frac{(iz)^5}{5!} + \cdots \\
=1 + iz - \frac{z^2}{2!} - \frac{i z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} + \frac{i z^5}{5!} + \cdots \\

3357414,Which version of the Pigeonhole principle is correct?

Note that the $\lceil \ \rceil$ enclosing the $n/m$ tells us to round the value up. The latter version is just a more powerful version, no? It seems strange to me that one version of a theorem can objectively give more information than another, so it's likely that either the latter version is not correct or I am incorrect in thinking that it somehow has more utility.

For (b) I am not sure how to approach the problem. I know that $|y-x|<1$ is the same as $-1<y-x <1$ . The problem becomes reduced to only look at points in $R^2$ that satisfied that the distance between them are not more than 1, and are positive.

3357428,What is a constant morphism of schemes,"I am dealing with some basic notions on schemes and I was asking myself what does it mean for a morphism between two schemes $$f:(X,\mathcal{O}_X)\rightarrow(Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)$$ to be constant. The obvious answer is that $f(X)$ is reduced to a point $\{y\}$ , however I was wondering what happens on the level of the sheaf morphism: $$f^\#:\mathcal{O}_Y\rightarrow f_*\mathcal{O}_X$$ Now for any open $U\subseteq Y$ , one has $$f_*\mathcal{O}_X(U)=\left\{\begin{array}[c],
X\text{ if }y\in U\\
\emptyset\text{ if }y\notin U
\end{array}\right.$$ thus ignoring the canonically zero maps $\mathcal{O}_Y(U)\rightarrow f_*\mathcal{O}_X(U)=0$ , when $y\notin U$ , this amounts to a system of maps $\big(\mathcal{O}_Y(U)\rightarrow

First we need to check if the span(S) is a subspace of $V$ . 0-vector: $0 = 0v_1 + \dots + 0v_m$ is in $S$ Closure under addition: $$(a_1v_1 + \dots + a_mv_m) +  (c_1v_1 + \dots + c_mv_m)\\ = (a_1+c_1)v_1 + \dots + (a_m+c_m)v_m$$ Closure under scalar multiplication for $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$ : $$\lambda (a_1v_1 + \dots a_mv_m) = \lambda a_1v_1 + \dots + \lambda a_mv_m$$ Now by the given subspace properties of closure under addition and scalar multiplication, each $v_j$ is a linear combination of the span $(v_1, \dots , v_j)$ . Let $W$ be a subspace in $V$ that only contains a linear combination $x=a_1v_1 + \dots + a_mv_m$ for $v_i \in S$ .

We want to find a rational $\frac{a}{b}$ such that $\frac{p_1}{q_1}<\frac{a^2}{b^2} <\frac{p_2}{q_2}$ .

So I cannot use any argument that directly references square roots. Here is some work I have done so far.  I went down the rabbit hole a bit and this may be a dead end, I'm not sure. Since $\frac{p_1}{q_1} = \frac{p_1q_1q_2^2}{q_1^2q_2^2}$ and $\frac{p_2}{q_2} = \frac{p_2q_1^2q_2}{q_1^2q_2^2}$ , it is sufficient to prove that: (2) there exists a perfect square, $n^2$ , (possibly 1) such that the interval between $n^2p_1q_1q_2^2$ and $n^2p_2q_1^2q_2$ contains a perfect square. To prove (2) it is sufficient to prove that: (3) for all positive integers $n$ there exist perfect squares, $k^2$ and $m^2$ , such that $k^2n<m^2<k^2(n+1)$ So my question is either for assistance proving any of (1), (2), or (3) without using the existence of square roots of positive real numbers, OR if this is something that MUST be proven using the existence of square roots, then just state that.  I would NOT like help in proving the existence of square roots another way.  If it MUST be done another way, I would like to figure out the other way myself. That being said, I am sure that proving the existence of square roots of positive reals CAN be proven another way (likely much simpler), but I am hoping that the path I am taking may work too.

Consider the set of complex functions that are holomorphic except for a finite or countably infinite set of isolated singularities (either poles or essential singularities).  I break these functions up into tiers, where the tier can be written in shorthand as a subscript of T followed by the level tier.  Let a ""tier-0"" function be a nonzero constant function.  Let a ""tier-1"" function be any complex function that can be written as $f_{T1}(z)=f_{T0}\prod_i(1-\frac{z}{\sigma_i})^{\mu_i}$ , where $\mu_i$ is the multiplicity of a zero $\sigma_i$ if it is positive, and is the order of a pole $\sigma_i$ if it is negative.

The sum or product of two tier A functions is a tier B function, where $A\geq B$ . 2) The derivative of a tier A function for $A\geq 2$ will always be a tier A function.  The derivative of a tier 1 function can be either a tier 1 or a tier 0 function. 3) The integral of a tier A function for $A\geq 1$ will always be a tier A function. 4) Every complex function that is analytic everywhere except for a finite or countably infinite number of isolated singularities can be expressed as a tier A function for some finite tier A.

I realise there is a fair bit of literature on this, but I really wanted to nail down what exactly is the most general form of this statement. Most of the introductory texts do this in the case of varieties, and I am finding it hard to distil out exactly what hypotheses are necessary. I am happy to allow some mildly reasonable assumptions: Suppose $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is a finite type morphism of noetherian schemes. Then we obtain the following: For $p \in X$ , $$
\dim (\mathcal{O}_{X,p}) = \dim( \mathcal{O}_{Y, f(p)} )+ \dim( \mathcal{O}_{X,p} \otimes \kappa(f(p))).
$$ I was surprised when I learned the proof of this to find that it is entirely a claim about local rings: One inequality is obtained by going-down property of flatness, and the other is obtained by lifting generators of an $\mathcal{m}$ -primary ideal in the local ring. This most definitely requires noetherianness, but only locally of finite type, but let's stick with finite type. But this doesn't really seem to tell us the dimension of the fibre. Indeed it may be the case that neither $p$ nor $f(p)$ is a closed point, and so the codimension of the point $p$ in the fibre $f^{-1}(p)$ may not be the dimension of $f^{-1}(p)$ at all. So to give some kind of precise questions: 1) What exactly is ""the dimension of the fiber at $p \in X$ ""? 2) What extra hypotheses need to be put on $f: X \rightarrow Y$ in order to ensure that the fibre is of pure dimension? Since indeed it may have many irreducible components. 3) What extra hypotheses are needed on $f: X \rightarrow Y$ in order to ensure all fibres have the same dimension, assuming ""dimension of the fibre"" has been defined.","['local-rings', 'algebraic-geometry', 'flatness', 'schemes']"

I am particularly interested in the case $N=6$ . Here we take a conic as a quadric curve contained in a plane. Take $L$ the polarization on $S$ associated to the embedding $S\hookrightarrow\mathbb{P}^N$ (there is no hyperplane containing $S$ ); the couple $(S,L)$ is uniquely determined by the even unimodular lattice $(H^2(S,\mathbb{Z}),(\cdot,\cdot))$ , where $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the intersection form. So I think that we should be able to keep trace, in $NS(S)\subset H^2(S,\mathbb{Z})$ or at least in $H^2(S,\mathbb{Z})$ , of a conic $C\subset S$ . As $C$ is a quadric, I thought that there would be some class $\eta\in NS(S)$ such that $(L,\eta)=2$ and either $(\eta,\eta)=0$ or $(\eta,\eta)=-2$ . However I am confused because, since $C$ come from a linear section of $S$ , its class in $NS(S)$ should come from $L$ , but the general linear section of $S$ is irreducible. I think that the presence of a conic should give some divisorial condition in the moduli space of polarized $K3$ surfaces. I know my guesses are a bit confused, but I tried to sum up my toughts.

We know that $\mathbb{T}$ is a $2$ -dimensional embedded submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^3$ . Now consider $p = (1,0,0) \in \mathbb{T}.$ I want to find a local parametrization of $\mathbb{T}$ around $p$ , that is, a function $$f: U \to V, $$ where $V \subset \mathbb{T}$ is open in $\mathbb{T}$ and $p \in V$ , $U$ is an open set of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $f$ is a diffeomorphism (or at least a homeomorphism), and after that, find a correspoding chart and adapted chart to $\mathbb{T}$ . Of course, I thought about the standard parametrization of the torus, that is, the function $$f: (\theta, \phi) \mapsto ((2+\cos(\theta))\cos(\phi), (2+\cos(\theta))\sin(\phi), \sin(\theta)). $$ However, how can I find an actual open set of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and an open set of $\mathbb{T}$ such that the above properties hold? We can see that, with the above function, $f(\pi, 0) = (1,0,0) = p.$ Hence, I thought about a neighbourhood of $(\pi, 0)$ , namely $\displaystyle U = \left( \frac{3\pi}{4}, \frac{5\pi}{4} \right) \times \left( -\frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \subset \mathbb{R}^2.$ Obviously this is an open set of $\mathbb{R}^2$ . After that, I though about proving that $V = f(U)$ will be open in $\mathbb{T}$ (I chose this $V$ so that $f$ is bijective), but I am not sure how. In doing so, I thought about the chart of $\mathbb{T}$ around $p$ corresponding to $f$ , by which I mean $(V, \varphi)$ , with $\varphi: V \to U, \varphi = f^{-1}$ . I will remark that it is trivial to see that $f$ is smooth on $U$ . Furthermore, with this definition, we get that $$\varphi (x,y,z) = \left( \arcsin(z), \arctan \left( \frac{y}{x} \right) \right).$$ The function $\varphi$ is smooth if it is defined on a set that does not contain points $(x,y,z)$ with the property that $x = 0$ . Particularly, these type of points are not in $V$ by the definition of $U$ and $f$ , so $\varphi$ is smooth, hence, in particular, $f$ is a homeomorphism, so $V$ is an open set of $\mathbb{T}$ . Is this good enough for the question? Now, I want to find an adapted chart to $\mathbb{T}$ around $p$ , by which I mean a smooth chart of $\mathbb{R}^3$ , $(X, \chi)$ , with $X \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ open, $p \in X$ , $\chi$ diffeomorphism between $X$ and another open subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $$\mathbb{T} \cap X = \{t \in X \ \mid \ \chi_3(t) = 0 \}, $$ where $\chi = (\chi_1, \chi_2, \chi_3)$ is the coordinate representation of $\chi$ . However, I don't know how to construct such an adapted chart to $\mathbb{T}$ . I know we can somehow determine it by using the previous parametrization $f$ and chart $\varphi$ , but I don't know how. Edit: I have thought a bit more about the last question. Observe that by letting $g: V \to \mathbb{R}, g(x,y,z) = 1 - \left( \sqrt{x^2+y^2}-2 \right)^2 - z^2$ , we have that $g$ is smooth on $V$ . Can we deduce that the function $\chi' = (\varphi, g)$ is such an adapted chart of $\mathbb{T}$ ? Edit 2: The function $\chi'$ would satisfy the property that $\mathbb{T}$ can be locally written as $g = 0$ , but I cannot find a good domain and range to define the function such that it is an actual chart (bijective, smooth, with smoot inverse). More specifically, it's not hard to choose a domain such that $\chi'$ is smooth, but how do I choose it such that it is bijective, because $g$ is a function from $\mathbb{R}^3$ to $\mathbb{R}$ , which is difficult to make injective.","['proof-verification', 'manifolds', 'differential-topology', 'parametrization', 'differential-geometry']"

3358853,Summing the digits of Pi,"I find $\pi$ and other transcendental numbers quite fascinating. Lately I've been playing around with sequences and $\pi$ and found something relatively intriguing. Consider $\pi$ written in base $10$ , that is, $$
\pi=3.1415926535897932384626433832...
$$ Now, let $\pi_i$ be the $i$ th digit of $\pi$ , such that $\pi_1=3$ , $\pi_2=1$ , $\pi_3=4$ and so on. Then, consider the sequence which terms $a_k$ are defined by $$
a_k=\sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^{i+1} \pi_i
$$ so that, for $k=7$ , for example, we get $$
a_7=3-1+4-1+5-9+2=3.
$$ I then plotted the sequence $\{a_k\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ up to $5000$ terms and, surprisingly enough, most of the terms are positive and there are some drastic jumps at specific (and suspiciously periodic) points. I have also computed some further terms in the sequence, including $$
a_{7500}=380,\,\,\,a_{10000}= 181 ,\,\,\,a_{15000}=145,\\
a_{25000}=86,\,\,\,a_{50000}=265,\,\,\, a_{100000}=1694.
$$ Well, naturally this is a very random sequence and my humble computer is unable to evaluate a bigger number of terms, so something tells me the randomness of $\pi$ is, in some sense, extended to this sequence. However, I was wondering whether something can be said about the behaviour of such sequence. For instance, would it be reasonable to assume that the different sums will average to $0$ the more terms we consider? What is exactly happening in these initial stages? And beyond that?

3358865,Is the Schwarzian Derivative a connection?,"The Schwarzian derivative is the quadratic differential $$ S(f) = \Bigg( \frac{f'''}{f'} - \frac{3}{2} \Big( \frac{f''}{f'} \Big)^2 \Bigg) (dz)^2 .$$ Bill Thurston, in his Math overflow answer here and his paper ""Zippers and Univalent Functions"" presents one interpretation of the Schwarzian derivative as being the ""rate of change of the best approximating Mobius transformation of $f$ ."" More rigorously, define $$ M(f, w)(z)$$ to be the Mobius transformation $$
M(f, w)(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}
$$ that has the same value, first derivative, and second derivative of $f(z)$ at $z = w$ . There are four unknowns, $a,b,c,d$ and the four equations $$
ad - bc = 1
$$ $$
M(f,w)(w) = f(w)
$$ $$
(\partial_z  M(f,w) )(w) = f'(w)
$$ $$
(\partial_z^2  M(f,w) )(w) = f''(w)
$$ which allows us to solve for $a,b,c,d$ explicitly (but the expressions are not enlightening so I will not write them here). Thurston's ""rate of change"" of the best approximating Mobius transformation is defined to be $$
\frac{d}{dt} M(f, w)^{-1} \circ M(f, w + t) \Big\rvert_{t = 0}.
$$ Note that because, for any Mobius transformation $A$ , $$
M(A \circ f, w) = A \circ M(f, w).
$$ This implies that if we send $f \mapsto A \circ f$ , our rate of change becomes $$
\frac{d}{dt} M(A \circ f, w)^{-1} \circ M(A \circ f, w + t) \Big\rvert_{t = 0} $$ $$=
\frac{d}{dt} M(f, w)^{-1} \circ A^{-1} \circ A\circ M(f, w + t) \Big\rvert_{t = 0}.
$$ and the overall expression doesn't change. In fact, it can be explicitly shown that this is actually just the Schwarzian derivative: $$
\frac{d}{dt} M(f, w)^{-1} \circ M(f, w + t) \Big\rvert_{t = 0} = \frac{1}{2} (z - w)^2 \Bigg( \frac{f'''}{f'} - \frac{3}{2} \Big( \frac{f''}{f'} \Big)^2 \Bigg).
$$ Here is my question: the schematic expression $\partial_t M^{-1} M(t)$ looks an awful lot to me like the expression for a connection. Can the Schwarzian derivative be thought of, in any way, as a connection? What is the base space and the Principal bundle? Also, connections are usually thought of as ""Lie algebra valued one forms,"" but the Schwarzian has a $(dz)^2$ instead of a $dz$ .

Let $\Psi_{t}$ by the time dependent linear flow with $\Psi_{0}=Id$ . Prove by writing down the determinant directly that $$\dfrac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t=0}\det(\Psi_{t})=Tr(A(0)).$$ (b)Use part $(a)$ to generate an alternative proof of the following: Let $\varphi_{t}$ be a flow generated by a vector field $X$ . Then $\varphi_{t}$ is volume preserving if and only if $div(X)=0$ everywhere on $\mathbb{R}^{n}.$ I have shown part $(a)$ as following: Recall that $\Psi_{t}$ is the solution of the ODE $\dot{x}=A(t)x,$ and thus it satisfies $$\dfrac{d}{dt}\Psi_{t}=A(t)\Psi_{t}.$$ Now, by Jacobi's Formula, we have \begin{align*}
\dfrac{d}{dt}\det(\Psi_{t})&=Tr\Big(adj(\Psi_{t})\cdot\dfrac{d\Psi_{t}}{dt}\Big)\\
&=Tr\Big(adj(\Psi_{t})\cdot A(t)\cdot\Psi_{t}\Big)\ \text{by above recall}.
\end{align*} Then, at $t=0$ , we have \begin{align*}
\dfrac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t=0}\det(\Psi_{t})&=Tr\Big(adj(\Psi_{0})\cdot\Psi_{0}\cdot A(0)\Big)\\
&=Tr\Big(adj(Id)\cdot Id\cdot A(0)\Big)\\
&=Tr\Big(Id\cdot Id\cdot A(0)\Big)\\
&=Tr\Big(A(0)\Big), \ \text{as desried}.
\end{align*} However, I don't see the connection between $(a)$ and Liouville's Theorem. The proof of Liouville's Theorem I learnt can be sketched as following: (1) Let $m_{0}$ denote the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ , and let $m_{t}$ denote $m_{0}$ transported forward by $\varphi_{t}$ , i.e. $$m_{t}(V)=m_{0}(\varphi_{-t}(V)).$$ Then, we show that $m_{t}=m_{0}$ if and only if $\dfrac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t=0}m_{t}(V)=0$ for all Borel $V.$ (2) The rate of flow of measure across a cross-section $\Sigma$ to the flow is given by $$\int_{\Sigma}X\cdot \textbf{n}ds,$$ where $\textbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector to $\Sigma$ in the direction of the flow, and $ds$ is surface area on $\Sigma$ . (3) Let $V\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a bounded region with smooth $\partial V$ . Then by Gauss-Green Theorem, we have $$\dfrac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t=0}m_{t}(V)=\int_{\partial V}X\cdot\textbf{n}ds=\int_{V}div(X),$$ which concludes the proof. However, I did not see how to apply $(a)$ to this proof since we never used $\det(\Psi_{t})$ in the original proof.","['alternative-proof', 'ergodic-theory', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems']"

3359145,Find the values of x where curve is concave,"This is a question found in an A-Level math book. Given a curve $$f(x) = \frac{\cos2x}{e^x}, 0\le x\le\pi$$ Determine the interval where $f(x)$ is concave. According to the math book: The function $f(x)$ is concave on a given interval if and only if $f''(x) \le 0$ for every $x$ in that interval. Also The point at whitch a curve changes from being concave to convex is called a point of inflection . A point of inflection is a point at which $f''(x)$ changes sign. Hence, to calculate the interval, I first calculates the second derivative of $f(x)$ : $$f''(x)=\frac{4\sin2x-3\cos2x}{e^x}$$ From this point and onwards, I can either use the definition of concavity or the definition of the point of inflection to find the interval. Using the definition of concavity Set $f''(x) \le 0$ : $$\therefore\frac{4\sin2x-3\cos2x}{e^x} \le 0 $$ $$\because e^x > 0$$ $$\therefore4\sin2x-3\cos2x \le 0$$ $$\therefore\tan2x \le 0.75$$ Hence, the answer is \begin{align}
0\le &x \le-0.322\\
\pi/4\le &x \le1.892\\
0.75\pi\le &x\le\pi\\
\end{align} Using the definiton of point of inflection The point of inflection is at $x=0.322$ and $x=1.892$ . And from the first derivative, one can find a local minimal at $x=1.34$ meaning the curve between the two point of inflection is convex. Hence, the answer is \begin{align}
0\le &x \le-0.322\\
1.892\le &x\le\pi\\
\end{align} Which one is correct? And why is the other incorrect? Update I think both approaches are valid, but a mistake is produced when I divide $sin$ by $cos$ in the first answer. Is it because $\cos2x < 0$ when $0.25\pi< x <0.75\pi$ , so $\le$ needs to be changed to $\ge$ ? i.e. \begin{cases}
\tan2x \le 0.75, &0\le x<0.25\pi \text{    and    } 0.75< x<\pi\\
\tan2x \ge 0.75, &0.25\pi <x<0.75\pi\\

3359678,Do we ever need irrational coefficients to generate a rational?,"Three easier warm-up questions and then The Real Question... Question 1: Do there exist numbers $p$ and $q$ in $\mathbb Q$ such that in order to have $pr=q$ we must have that $r$ is irrational? Answer to Question 1: No. Either $p=q=0$ , in which case $r$ can be anything, or $q\neq0$ , in which case $r=\frac qp$ is the only solution, and this is rational. Question 2: Do there exist polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ in $\mathbb Q[x]$ such that in order to have $p(x)r(x)=q(x)$ we must have that $r(x)$ has at least one irrational coefficient? Answer to Question 2: No. Actually, given that $q(x)\in\mathbb Q[x]$ is nonzero, it is not possible for $q(x)$ to be expressed as the product of $p(x)$ and some polynomial $r(x)$ unless $r(x)$ has strictly rational coefficients.  This is less obvious than the situation with the previous question. Question 3: Do there exist polynomials $p_1(x),\ldots,p_k(x)$ and $q(x)$ in $\mathbb Q[x]$ such that in order to have $$p_1(x)r_1(x)+\cdots +p_k(x)r_k(x) = q(x)$$ at least one of $r_1(x),\ldots,r_k(x)$ must have at least one irrational coefficient? That is, $q(x)$ has rational coefficients, and can be expressed as a linear combination of some specific other polynomials that have rational coefficients, but only by multiplying them by some polynomials that do not have rational coefficients. Is such a situation possible? This is the same as asking: Is it possible to start with polynomials in $\mathbb Q[x]$ , allow them to generate an ideal in $\mathbb R[x]$ , and then find within that ideal some polynomial in $\mathbb Q[x]$ which would not have appeared had the ideal been generated over $\mathbb Q[x]$ instead? Perhaps the first two warm-up questions were misleading; in each of those cases, we rule out the multiplier being irrational altogether.  That is, we show that only a rational multiplier is possible.  But in the third question, certainly it is possible that the multipliers $r_i(x)$ could live outside of $\mathbb Q[x]$ .  The question is, can some choice of the $p_i(x)$ and $q(x)$ ever force that to happen? Note: This has already been pointed out in the comments, so I might as well acknowledge it: For the sake of simplicity, I am intentionally neglecting instances like $p=0$ and $q=1$ (in Question 1) or $p(x)=x^2$ and $q(x)=x$ (in Question 2) in which the condition is impossible and therefore (technically/vacuously) implies anything. Answer to Question 3: (added later) I think I can answer Question 3.  Consider the ideal generated by the $p_i(x)$ in $\mathbb R[x]$ .  Since $\mathbb R[x]$ is a PID, this ideal is principal.  Now I think it suffices (by Question 2, actually) to show that the generator of this ideal can be taken in $\mathbb Q[x]$ .  But the most natural generator is the $\rm gcd$ of all the polynomials $p_i(x)$ , and this is in fact in $\mathbb Q[x]$ .  So every polynomial in this ideal is a multiple of this generator, which is rational, and hence by Question 2 every rational polynomial in the ideal is a rational multiple of the generator, and hence has to be in the ideal that the $p_i(x)$ would generate over $\mathbb Q[x]$ . Since I have (I think) answered Question 3, let me move on to... The Real Question: If in Question 3 we replace $\mathbb Q[x]$ and $\mathbb R[x]$ by $\mathbb Q[x_1,\ldots,x_k]$ and $\mathbb R[x_1,\ldots,x_k]$ , does that change the answer?","['modules', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials', 'real-analysis']"

3359759,Paraboloid is diffeomorphic to a plane,"Consider the paraboloid $x^2+y^2=z$ . I need to show that this paraboloid is diffeomorphic to a plane. Let $P$ be this paraboloid and $S$ be the plane that I will use. So, by definition, I need to show that a function $\phi:P\rightarrow S$ satisfies the following. Let $\alpha:U_{1}\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow P$ a local parametrization of $P$ , with $p\in\alpha (U_1);\beta:U_{2}\rightarrow S$ a local parametrization of $S$ with $\phi(\alpha(U_{1}))\subset\beta(U_{2})$ . We have $\beta^{-1}\, \circ\,\phi\,\circ\,\alpha:U_{1}\rightarrow U_{2}$ differentiable at $q=\alpha^{-1}(p),$ and $\phi$ has a differentiable inverse $\phi^{-1}:S\rightarrow P.$ I take the parametrization of $P$ given by $$\alpha(u,v)=(v\cos(u),v\sin(u), v^2)\quad u\in[0,2\pi),v\in\mathbb{R}.$$ For $S$ , I think that I can take an arbitrary plane to be diffeomorphic to $P$ , so, consider the plane $xy$ , that is, the set of points with form $(x,y,0), x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ . Take the parametrization of $S$ given by $$\beta(u,v)=(u,v,0),\quad u,v\in\mathbb{R}$$ So, I can define a $\phi:S\rightarrow P$ by $\phi(u,v,0)=(v\cos(u),v\sin(u),v^2)$ . Is this $\phi$ a diffeomorphism?","['diffeomorphism', 'parametrization', 'differential-geometry']"

3359819,Simple example of a moduli space?,"This relates to my previous question: Is $\zeta_{\Bbb R^n}$ a space of moduli spaces? Moduli Space I asked two professors about this but they said they didn't know enough about moduli spaces to help. I just want to look at a simple example, $\zeta_{\Bbb R^2}.$ The $x-$ coordinates in the space are the solutions to polynomials of the form: $x^T-(1-x)^S=0.$ Plugging the solution back into the original function (given in the previous post) gives the $y-$ coordinate in the space. So basically each point encodes the solutions of two algebro-geometric problems. Maybe I'm missing something, but wouldn't this be a simple example of a moduli space?","['algebraic-geometry', 'moduli-space']"
3359853,Real numbers whose digits are the even digits of their squares,"The Context The origin of my question is my own answer to this question , where the continuity of the function $f: [0,1) \to [0,1)$ that only preserves the odd digits of its input value is analyzed. In this context, I will slightly modify the definition given there, as follows. The function I am considering now is $f: [0,+\infty) \to [0,+\infty)$ that preserves only the even digits of the input. So if $x$ has decimal expansion $$x = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty}a_k 10^k,$$ then $$f(x)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty}a_{2k}10^{k}.$$ So for example $$f(5\textbf{8}7\textbf{4}1\textbf{2}.7\textbf{8}0\textbf{3}4\textbf{0}5\textbf{1})=842.8301.$$ With a very similar approach to the one given here , it can be shown that $f$ is continuous almost everywhere (the only exception being the numbers whose least significant digit occupies an odd position), and right-continuous everywhere. Edit. I am assuming, as in the original question, to adopt, in case of ambiguity, the finite version of the number's decimal expansion . Note the self-similarity $$f\left(10^{2k} x\right)=10^k f(x), \ \ \forall k\in \Bbb Z.$$ Below an approximate plot of the function $f$ in the range $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ . Red dots represent points actually belonging to the graph of $f$ . The yellow line represents the graph of $$s(x) = \sqrt x.$$ By self-similarity, a scaling of $10^{2k}$ of the $x$ -axis and of $10^{-k}$ of the $y$ -axis, for any $k\in \Bbb Z$ , would give an exact replica of the given plot. Introductory Observation Aside from the trivial intersections between $f$ and $s$ , that is all the points with coordinates $$\left(10^{2k},10^k\right),$$ there are many other interesting intersections, such as (limiting ourselves to the range shown in the picture) $$(0.25,0.5),$$ $$(0.36,0.6),$$ $$(0.0121,0.11),$$ and 'trikiest' ones, such as $$(0.5776,0.76),$$ or even $$(0.35295481,0.5941).$$ The Question Is there any non-terminating decimal (or even irrational) $x$ such that $$y=f(x) = s(x),$$ that is, is there any non-terminating decimal $y$ whose square contains - in the even positioned digits - the digits of the original number $y$ ? Edit. I emphasize again that no infinite sequences of $9$ 's are allowed, since we are adopting the finite decimal expansion version of the number, if this ambuiguity arises.","['real-numbers', 'decimal-expansion', 'real-analysis']"
3359866,Throw 40 dice and arrange them in a row - check my proof,"Assume you throw $40$ dice and arrange them in a row so that you got a $40$ -tuple. Then you throw antoher die. The result of this die indicates the number of the starting die of the $40$ -tuple. E.g. you throw a $5$ then you start at the $5$ -th die of the $40$ -tuple. Then you traverse the $40$ -tuple in steps determined by the die you are standing on. Let's say the $40$ -tuple looks like this: $$ (4, 4, 5, 1, 6, 6, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 6, ....., 2)$$ If you throw a $3$ you start at the die which shows a $5$ , then you go 5 steps further to the die that shows a $2$ and from there you go $2$ steps further and so on ... If you cannot complete the steps because you would exceed the $40$ -tuple then you remain on the actual die and remove all the subseqeunt dice. Let's say you are on the die which shows the $6$ $$ (3,.., 2, 1, 4, \color{red}6, 4, 5, 5, 2, 1)$$ You cannot go $6$ steps further so you stay there and remove all subsequent dice. You get: $$ (3,.., 2, 1, 4,\color{red}6)$$ So in this case you finally would get a $35$ -tuple beacuse you have removed 5 dice. The question is: If I throw a die a second time to traverse the remaining tuple again how can I estimate the probability of exactly landing on the last die of the remaining tuple? Note that if I once arrive a die which was already visited during the first run I will never leave the path and will automatically end on the last die. My approach: Let be $A$ the event of landing excatly on the last die and $B= A^c$ the complement. If I find an upper boundary $U$ for $P(B)$ I can then estimate $P(A)$ by $P(A)\geq 1-U$ . So I need to figure out when $P(B)$ is highest. If I stand somewhere in the tuple and I am about to take my next steps then the maximum probability of not finishing on a die which I have already visited is $\frac{5}{6}$ . So $P(B)$ must be something like $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^k$ . Where $k$ refers to each time I have finished my steps. The smaller $k$ is the greater becomes $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^k$ . So $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^k$ is highest if I always end my steps on a die showing a $6$ beacuse then I traverse the tuple fastest. So after ending my steps six times on a $6$ I will at least have traversed the tuple. But If I had removed 5 dice after the first run I am even able to traverse the tuple after ending my steps five times on a $6$ . So, $P(B)\leq\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^5$ . Hence, $P(A)\geq 1-\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^5$ . What do you think, is this correct? I have absoultey no idea how to tackle this problem in a rigorous way. May be you have different approaches. Any comments or suggestions are welcome!","['dice', 'proof-verification', 'combinatorics', 'probability']"
