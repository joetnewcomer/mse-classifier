4576580,Function defined differently on rationals and irrationals with derivative given by classic rules,"Today, one of my students was given the function $$f(x) = \begin{cases} x^3+1 \quad \text{ if }x\in \Bbb Q\\ x^3+x \quad \text{ if }x\in \Bbb R \backslash \Bbb Q \end{cases} $$ He had some questions on the derivative and he wrote $$ f'(x)=\begin{cases} 3x^2 \quad \text{ if }x\in \Bbb Q\\ 3x^2+1 \quad \text{ if }x\in \Bbb R \backslash \Bbb Q \end{cases}$$ Which is not true of course, but I was wondering if there exists some function where it could be the case i.e. a function defined differently on rationals and irrationals with derivative given by the classic rules of derivation like my student wanted to do. The main problem I see is that the function will not be continuous at almost every point so not differentiable almost everywhere, right ? Or can someone maybe find such a function ?","['derivatives', 'examples-counterexamples', 'real-analysis']"

4576690,Find for what values of a and b in R the limit exists (No De L'Hopital),"I was given this exercise in my math course at university.
The question is to find, without using De l'Hopitals and other methods which may use derivates and similars, for what values of $a$ and $b$ in $\mathbb{R}$ the following statement is true. $$
f(x)= \left\{\begin{matrix}  \dfrac{\sin x}{x} & x > 0  \\  ax + b & x \leq 0  \\ \end{matrix}\right. $$ $$ \lim_{x \to 0^+} \dfrac{f(x) - ax - b}{x} = 0$$ I started by writing it as: $$ \lim_{x \to 0^+} \dfrac{\dfrac{\sin x}{x} -ax - b}{x} = 0$$ because, due to the fact that we are approaching from $x > 0, \, f(x) = \dfrac{\sin x}{x}$ Then I multiplied $\frac{\sin x}{x}$ by $\frac{\sin x}{\sin x}$ in order to get: $$ \lim_{x \to 0^+} \dfrac{\dfrac{\sin^2x}{x\sin x} -ax - b}{x} = 0$$ From there: $$ \lim_{x \to 0^+} \dfrac{\dfrac{\sin^2x}{x\sin x} -ax - b}{x} = 0$$ $$ \Longleftrightarrow \lim_{x \to 0^+} \dfrac{\dfrac{1-\cos^2x}{x\sin x}-ax-b}{x} = 0 $$ $$ \Longleftrightarrow \lim_{x \to 0^+} \dfrac{\dfrac{1-\cos x}{x} \times \dfrac{1+\cos x}{\sin x}-ax-b}{x} = 0$$ $$ \Longleftrightarrow \lim_{x \to 0^+} \dfrac{\dfrac{1-\cos x}{x} \times \dfrac{1+\cos x}{x} \times \dfrac{x}{\sin x} - ax - b}{x} = 0$$ $$ \Longleftrightarrow \lim_{x \to 0^+} \dfrac{\dfrac{1 - \cos x}{x} \times \dfrac{1}{x} \times \left(1 + \cos x\right) \times \dfrac{x}{\sin x} -ax - b}{x} = 0$$ $$ \Longleftrightarrow \lim_{x \to 0^+} \dfrac{\dfrac{1-\cos x}{x^2} \times \left(1+ \cos x\right) \times \dfrac{x}{\sin x} -ax - b}{x} = 0$$ Which, substituting the value of $x$ to the value it is approaching, results in: $$ \dfrac{\dfrac{1}{2}\times\left(1+1\right)\times 1 - a \times 0 - b}{x} = 0 $$ $$ \Longleftrightarrow \dfrac{1 - b}{x} = 0 $$ Which should resolve to the I.F. $$\dfrac{0}{0}$$ when $b=1$ So to me it seems like, with the calculations I've done, I can't reach an answer about which value of $a$ and $b$ make the statement true","['limits-without-lhopital', 'analysis', 'real-analysis', 'functions', 'limits']"

I also looked at whether you could employ $u=\cos\theta\sin\theta$ , but then $du=\cos^2\theta-\sin^2\theta$ and that would not simplify the calculations either since I then need to divide with the expression.

4576818,"Efficient way to find all polygons of the same shape within a set, regardless of position, scale, or rotation","I've got a big set of 2D polygons described as a set of points. I would like to take this set of polygons and find any that are the same shape, regardless of rotation, translation, or scale. Each polygon has 3 or more points, and in some cases may have hundreds or thousands of points. There are hundreds of polygons in total. The polygons are optimised to remove runs of points that would form a straight line, e.g. the sequence $[(0,0), (10,10), (20,20)]$ would not be allowed. The polygons also aren't allowed to intersect themselves. The context for this problem is geometry instancing in 3D rendering, specifically rendering polygon regions and fills from PCB designs. Polygon regions are frequently repeated or copy-pasted around boards, so I would like to reduce the number of draw calls I need per frame by finding any polygon that I can instance using a transformation matrix. My first idea was to normalise the scale of all polygons, then compare the line lengths and angles between line vectors. Two polygons with the same shape should be composed from the same line lengths and same angles in the same order. I started implementing this, using the following procedure: Group all polygons by point count. Discard any groups that contain only one polygon, since they are guaranteed to be unique in shape. Center each polygon to $(0,0)$ and normalise its scale to a 1x1 bounding box. Calculate a ""hash"" for each polygon based on the sum of the magnitudes of all points, i.e. $\sum \sqrt{{x_i}^2 + {y_i}^2}$ , which for any two polygons sharing the same shape should be equal. Further group the polygons by this hash, and discard any groups that have only one member. This acts as a fast filtering step to quickly reject any polygons which are obviously not the same. Turn each polygon's point list into a circular list of angle-distance pairs, $(\theta,d)$ , where $\theta$ is the angle formed between the vectors meeting at the point, and $d$ is the length of the next clockwise vector. Within each group, compare all of the lists to each other to find matches. This works in theory, but I ran into two issues. First, ""clockwise"" isn't well-defined for arbitrary polygons that may have both concave and convex regions. This can be solved by traversing the lists in both directions during the final step, which has the added bonus of finding mirror-image copies of the same polygon, which could be described as a negative scale in one or both of the axes, and which I can handle just fine in the instancing code. Second, and more importantly, I couldn't come up with an efficient way to compare the two circular lists of points without knowing the correct starting offsets. It occurs to me that there might be some efficient mathematical way of identifying whether two circular sequences of number pairs contain the same ordered sequence of values regardless of whether the sequences are offset from each other. For example, $[1,2,3,5,2]$ and $[3,5,2,1,2]$ should be considered equal because they are the same set of numbers in the same order, just with a different starting offset (the latter is the former shifted two places left). However, $[1,2,3,5,2]$ and $[2,5,3,2,1]$ should not be considered equal, because the ordering is incorrect despite the same numbers appearing in the set. In practice the elements in each list would actually be a pair of numbers rather than a single number, but that's an implementation detail. Is there a clever way to solve this? If not, is there an alternative approach to the polygon shape comparison problem?","['combinatorics', 'geometry', 'polygons', 'algorithms']"

Lee, but things didn't go well: Following Lee's hint, I was trying to use Exercise 1.12 and view $\color{red}{g}$ as the background metric ( $\bar g$ in Exercise 1.12). In Exercise 1.12, I've shown that the Ricci curvature of a Riemannian metric $g$ and the Ricci curvature of another Riemannian metric $\bar g$ are related by $$R_{ij}=\bar{R}_{ij}+(\overline{\nabla}_k W_{ij}^k-\overline{\nabla}_j W_{ki}^k)+(W_{k\ell}^k W_{ij}^\ell-W_{j\ell}^k W_{ik}^\ell).\tag{1}$$ Please see Relating the Ricci curvatures of two Riemannian metrics to know about (1). Now I have $$R_{g_t}=g_t^{ij}\bar{R}_{ij}+g_t^{ij}(\overline{\nabla}_k W_{ij}^k-\overline{\nabla}_j W_{ki}^k)+g_t^{ij}(W_{k\ell}^k W_{ij}^\ell-W_{j\ell}^k W_{ik}^\ell)\tag{2}$$ and $$\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}R_{g_t}=\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{R_{g_t}-R_g}{t}=\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{R_{g_t}-g^{ij}\bar{R}_{ij}}{t}.\tag{3}$$ To evaluate the difference quotient in (3), I write $$R_{g_t}\simeq (g^{ij}+t\dot{g}^{ij})\bar{R}_{ij}+(g^{ij}+t\dot{g}^{ij})(\overline{\nabla}_k W_{ij}^k-\overline{\nabla}_j W_{ki}^k)+(g^{ij}+t\dot{g}^{ij})(W_{k\ell}^k W_{ij}^\ell-W_{j\ell}^k W_{ik}^\ell)\tag{4}$$ for small $t$ . I'm not sure if the linear approximation of $g_t$ at $t=0$ is legitimate, but I can't imagine what it would be like if there were any other ways. Now I have $$\frac{R_{g_t}-g^{ij}\bar{R}_{ij}}{t}\simeq \dot{g}^{ij}\bar{R}_{ij}+(\frac{g^{ij}}{t}+\dot{g}^{ij})(\overline{\nabla}_k W_{ij}^k-\overline{\nabla}_j W_{ki}^k)+(\frac{g^{ij}}{t}+\dot{g}^{ij})(W_{k\ell}^k W_{ij}^\ell-W_{j\ell}^k W_{ik}^\ell)\tag{5}$$ for small $t\neq 0$ . If the above is true, all we have to do now is take its limit at $t=0$ . But after seeing that $$\lim_{t\to 0}\dot{g}^{ij}\bar{R}_{ij}=\dot{g}^{ij}\bar{R}_{ij}=\langle\mathrm{Ric}_g,\dot{g}\rangle_g,\tag{6}$$ I began to hesitate about the computation because I didn't have a minus sign to compensate (6) for the formula to be derived in Exercise 1.18. Why's that? What should I do next? Thank you. Remark 1. I'm not worried about $\dot{g}^{ij}(\overline{\nabla}_k W_{ij}^k-\overline{\nabla}_j W_{ki}^k)$ and $\dot{g}^{ij}(W_{k\ell}^k W_{ij}^\ell-W_{j\ell}^k W_{ik}^\ell)$ in (5) because these terms contribute nothing as indicated by the hint. Remark 2. The hint says that in any orthonormal frame $\{v_i\}_i$ , the double divergence of $\dot{g}$ is given by $$\mathrm{div}_g\mathrm{div}_g\dot{g}=\sum_{i,j}\dot{g}_{ij;ij},$$ which I have just checked. And in the same frame, I also checked that $$\begin{align}
\Delta_g\mathrm{tr}_g\dot{g}&=\mathrm{div}_g\mathrm{grad}(g^{ij}\dot{g}_{ij})\\
&=\sum_k\left(v_k(v_k(\sum_i \dot{g}_{ii}))+\sum_j v_j(\sum_i\dot{g}_{ii})\overline{\Gamma}_{kj}^k\right)
\end{align}$$ and that $$\langle\mathrm{Ric}_g,\dot{g}\rangle_g=\sum_{i,j}\bar{R}_{ij}\dot{g}_{ij}.$$ These local expressions follow from a straightforward computation. The crux of my attempt really lies in the expansion of those $W$ terms. Originally, I planned on taking it by employing $$W_{ij}^k=\frac{1}{2}g_t^{k\ell}\left(\overline{\nabla}_i(g_t)_{\ell j}+\overline{\nabla}_j(g_t)_{i\ell}-\overline{\nabla}_\ell(g_t)_{ij}\right),$$ another result obtained previously (see The components $W_{ij}^k$ of the difference $W=\nabla-\overline{\nabla}$ between two Levi-Civita connections ), but the algebra really hurts.","['curvature', 'linearization', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

\end{cases}$$ (i.e., the $n$ th element of $q$ is opposite of the $n$ th element of $f(n)$ ), which would mean that $x \neq f(n)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\prod \limits^\infty_{i=1} \{0, 1\}$ is uncountable. However, it seems possible to define a bijection for $f: \mathbb{N} \to \prod \limits^\infty_{i=1} \{0, 1\}$ if we define $f(n)$ to be an ordered tuple representing the coefficients of the binary expansion of $n -1$ . For example: $$
0 = 0 \cdot 2^0 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + \cdots \\
1 = 1 \cdot 2^0 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + \cdots  \\
2 = 0 \cdot 2^0 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + \cdots \\
3 = 1 \cdot 2^0 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + \cdots \\
n = a_{n_0} \cdot 2^0 + a_{n_1} \cdot 2^1 + a_{n_2} \cdot 2^2 + \cdots 
$$ So then we could define $f: \mathbb{N} \to \prod \limits^\infty_{i=1} \{0,1\}$ by $$f(k) = (a_{k-1_0}, a_{k-1_1}, a_{k-1_2}, \cdots)$$ which would give us $$
f(1) = (0, 0, 0, \cdots) \quad \text{(the coefficients of the binary expansion of 0)}\\
f(2) = (1, 0, 0, \cdots) \quad \text{(the coefficients of the binary expansion of 1)} \\
f(3) = (0, 1, 0, \cdots) \quad \text{(the coefficients of the binary expansion of 2)} \\
f(4) = (1, 1, 0, \cdots) \quad \text{(the coefficients of the binary expansion of 3)} \\
f(n + 1) = (a_{n_0}, a_{n_1}, a_{n_2}, \cdots) \quad \text{(the coefficients of the binary expansion of n)}
$$ (Note: I use $k$ and $k - 1$ to preserve the domain of $\mathbb{N}$ , but it is trivial to prove that $|\mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}| = |\mathbb{N}|$ . Also, assume that more significant coefficients omitted by the ellipses are an infinite number of zeros.) In my mind, $f$ would be injective because every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ would have a unique binary expansion comprised of only 0s and 1s as coefficients (hence, the basis for the base-2 number system working), and $f$ would be surjective because we can turn a tuple of coefficients back into a base-10 integer. (i.e., $(b_0, b_1, b_2, \cdots)$ would translate directly to ${\dots b_2 b_1 b_0}_2 = n = k - 1$ .) Thus we've established a bijection that allows us to conclude that $|\mathbb{N}| = |\prod \limits^\infty_{i=1} \{0, 1\}|$ , making it countable. Would this disprove Cantor's diagonalization argument for this instance, or are there flaws to the binary expansion argument? Reference: Doud, Darrin, and Pace P.

4577063,Norm of the inner product on an inner product space when considered as a continuous linear functional,"Let $V$ be a vector space equipped with the inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ . Fix some arbitrary $y \in V$ and define the map $f_y: V \to \mathbb{C}$ by $$f_y(x) = \langle x,y \rangle, \qquad x \in V.$$ A few questions on MSE have shown that $f_y$ is a continuous linear functional with respect to the standard norm on V $\lVert x \rVert_V = \sqrt{\langle x,x \rangle}$ , for example by showing that $f_y \in B(V,\mathbb{C})$ (the space of bounded linear functionals from $V$ to $\mathbb{C}$ ). I want to show that the norm of $f_y$ in $B(V, \mathbb{C})$ equals $\lVert y \rVert_V$ . By the Cauchy-Shwarz inequality we have that $\lvert f_y(x) \rvert = \lvert \langle x,y \rangle \rvert \leq \lVert x \rVert_V \lVert y \rVert_V$ , so $f_y$ is bounded and hence continuous. I suspect that I can use this result to find an upper and lower bound for $\lVert f_y \rVert$ that are equal (in other words showing that $\lVert f_y \rVert \leq K$ and $\lVert f_y \rVert \geq K$ , for $K = \lVert y \rVert_V$ ), but am not sure on how to proceed along this line of reasoning.

$$ Let’s start with its partner integral $$
I(a)=\int_0^{\infty}\left(x^n+1\right)^a d x

4577100,Global sections of algebraically trivial line bundle,"Let $\pi \colon X \rightarrow C$ be a smooth minimal elliptic surface over an algebraically closed ground field $k$ . Furthermore assume that $\pi$ has a section and that the fundamental line bundle $R^1\pi_*(\mathcal{O}_X) \in \text{Pic}(C)$ has positive degree. A standard result, found e.g. as Theorem 6.5 in Schütt's survey on elliptic surfaces , states that the Neron-Severi group $\text{NS}(X) = \text{Pic}(X)/ \text{Pic}^0(X)$ and the numerical group $\text{Num}(X) =  \text{Pic}(X) /  \text{Pic}^{\tau}(X)$ agree. Since the numerical group is the torsion-free part of the Neron-Severi group, this can be reformulated as the Neron-Severi group of such an elliptic surface being torsion-free. I would like to understand why that statement is true. If we denote by $\mathcal{L}$ a representative of a non-trivial torsion class in $\text{NS}(X)$ , then I can manage to prove that the class of $\mathcal{L}$ is trivial based on the assumption that $h^0(\mathcal{L}) = 0$ , i.e. that $\mathcal{L}$ has no non-trivial global sections. This assumption seems very plausible to me: $\bullet$ If $X$ were a curve, so that algebraically trivial line bundles are exactly the line bundles with degree $0$ , then it is standard to show that such line bundles have no non-trivial global sections, unless they agree with the structure sheaf. $\bullet$ If $X$ were an abelian variety, I also have an argument. It is quite simple to show that a tensor power $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}$ of a line bundle is the pullback of $\mathcal{L}$ along the $n$ -th power map of the abelian variety (by induction). Therefore, if $\mathcal{L}$ has a section, so does its dual $\mathcal{L}^{\otimes -1}$ . Hence $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{O}_X$ . $\bullet$ Furthermore, algebraically trivial line bundles are in particular numerically trivial and hence have degree $0$ when restricted to any curve in $X$ . Therefore we have no non-trivial global sections on curves in $X$ . Maybe one can pull this back? Most likely there is a simple generalization of the argument for curves  to general algebraically trivial line bundles, but I cannot seem to figure it out or to find it online. Therefore: Question: Why do non-trivial algebraically trivial line bundles (on a smooth minimal elliptic surface if necessary) have no non-trivial global sections?","['algebraic-geometry', 'intersection-theory', 'picard-scheme']"
4577115,Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation for symmetric matrix-valued measures,"Let $\Theta$ be a closed $d$ -manifold (and hence a metric space with Borel- $\sigma$ -algebra $\Sigma \subset 2^\Theta$ ), $S^d$ the set of real symmetric $d \times d$ matrices, which we can identify with the vector space $\mathbb{R}^{\frac{d(d + 1)}{2}}$ , $M(\Theta; S^d)$ be space of Borel vector measures on $(\Theta, \Sigma)$ with values in $S^d$ , $C(\Theta; S^d)$ the space of continuous functions from $\Theta$ to $S^d$ . (If I should instead consider compactly supported continuous functions, then this is fine, too.) I am trying to find a duality statement along the lines of $[M(\Theta; S^d)]^* \cong C(\Theta; S^d)$ , where $^*$ denotes the dual vector space. For $d = 1$ I think I know how a isometric isomorphism $\Psi \colon [M(\Theta; S^d)]^* \to C(\Theta; S^d)$ and its inverse looks like, but I am not sure how to generalise this result and its proof to higher dimensions. It should be relatively straightforward since $S^d$ is finite-dimensional, so we should be able to ""copy the one-dimensional procedure componentwise"", see e.g. the comment on this highly related question or this pretty similar question , but I don't know how to do that. For $d = 1$ I have the following: consider $$
\Psi: [M(\Theta, \mathbb R)]^* \to C(\Theta; \mathbb R), \qquad
Z \mapsto \big(\theta \mapsto Z(\delta_{\theta})\big),
$$ where $\delta_{\theta}(A) := \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if } \theta \in A, \\ 0, &\text{else.}\end{cases}$ is the Dirac measure at $\theta \in \Theta$ for $A \in \Sigma$ . This map is clearly linear.
It is also injective: for $Z_1, Z_2 \in [M(\Theta; \mathbb R)]^*$ we have $\Psi(Z_1) = \Psi(Z_2)$ if and only if $Z_1(\delta_{\theta}) = Z_2(\delta_{\theta})$ for all $\theta \in \Theta$ .
By the linearity of $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ this implies that $Z_1$ agrees with $Z_2$ on any spike train $\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k \delta_{\tilde{\theta}_k}$ for $n \in \mathbb N$ , $(a_k)_{k = 1}^{n} \subset \mathbb R$ and $(\tilde{\theta}_k)_{k = 1}^{n} \subset \Theta$ . By the continuity of $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ and the density of those spike trains in $M(\Theta; \mathbb R)$ , we can conclude that $Z_1 = Z_2$ . As inverse I suggest $$
\Psi^{-1}(f)
:= \left(\mu \mapsto \int_{\Theta} f(\theta) \; \text{d}\mu(\theta) \right).
$$ Indeed, for $f \in C(\Theta; \mathbb R)$ we have $$
\Psi(\Psi^{-1}(f))
= \Psi\left(\mu \mapsto \int_{\Theta} f(\theta) \; \text{d}\mu(\theta) \right)
= \left( \tilde{\theta} \mapsto \int_{\Theta} f(\theta) \; \text{d}\delta_{\tilde{\theta}}(\theta\right)
= f.
$$ Furthermore, for $Z \in [M(\Theta; \mathbb R)]^*$ we have $$
\Psi^{-1}(\Psi(Z))
= \Psi^{-1}\left(\theta \mapsto Z(\delta_{\theta})\right)
= \left( \mu \mapsto \int_{\Theta} Z(\delta_{\theta}) \;\text{d}\mu(\theta) \right).
$$ Due to the linearity of $Z$ we have for any spike train as above $$
\big[\Psi^{-1}(\Psi(Z))\big]\left(\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k \delta_{\tilde{\theta}_k} \right)
= \sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k Z(\delta_{\tilde{\theta}_k})
= Z \left(\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k \delta_{\tilde{\theta}_k} \right).
$$ Hence by continuity of $Z$ and the density of the spike trains we conclude $\Psi^{-1}(\Psi(Z)) = Z$ . What are the higher-dimensional analogues of $\Psi$ and $\Psi^{-1}$ ? I tried $\Psi(Z) := \big(\theta \mapsto Z(P \delta_{\theta})\big)$ , where $P = \text{id}_{d \times d} \in S^d$ and $\Psi^{-1}(f) := \left( \mu \mapsto \text{tr}\left( \int_{\Theta} f(\theta) \; \text{d}\mu(\theta)\right)\right)$ , but they don't seem to fulfil either $\Psi \circ \Psi^{-1} = \text{id}_{C(\Theta; S^d)}$ nor $\Psi^{-1} \circ \Psi = \text{id}_{[M(\Theta; S^d)]^*}$ . Update When equipping $M(\Theta; S^d)$ with the (strong) generalised total variation norm, then by Singer's representation theorem we have the opposite duality $[C(\Theta; S^d)]^* \cong M(\Theta; S^d)$ via the dual pairing $$
\langle \phi, u \rangle_{C(\Theta; S^d) \times M(\Theta; S^d)}
= \int_{\Theta} \langle \phi(\theta), u'(\theta) \rangle_{S^d} \; \text{d}| u |(\theta),
$$ where $| u | \in M(\Theta; [0, \infty))$ is the total variation measure of $u$ and $u'$ is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $u$ with respect to $| u |$ . Hence we only have to figure out how $| u |$ and $u'$ look in this specific case.
If $u = \sum_{k = 1}^{N} P_k \delta_{\{ \theta_k \}}$ , we have $$
| u |
= \sum_{k = 1}^{N} \| P_k \|_{S^d} \delta_{\{ \theta_k \}}
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
u'(\theta_k)
= \frac{1}{\| P_k \|_{S^d}} P_k,
$$ so that $$
\langle \phi, u \rangle_{C(\Theta; S^d) \times M(\Theta; S^d)}
= \sum_{k = 1}^{N} \text{tr}\big(P_k \phi(\theta_k)\big).

4577337,Filling space with polycube snakes,"One of Martin Gardner's ""Mathematical Games"" columns ( Scientific American June 1981, pp24–29 ; reprinted in The Last Recreations (1997), pp274–283 , and The Colossal Book of Mathematics (2001) pp203–211 ) describes the following problem due to Scott Kim: First we must define a snake. It is a single connected chain of identical unit cubes joined at their faces in such a way that each cube (except for a cube at the end of a chain) is attached face to face to exactly two other cubes. The snake may twist in any possible direction, provided no internal cube abuts the face of any cube other than its two immediate neighbors. The snake may, however, twist so that any number of its cubes touch along edges or at corners. A polycube snake may [...] have just one end and be infinite in length, or it may be infinite and endless in both directions. We now ask a deceptively simple question. What is the smallest number of snakes needed to fill all space? We can put it another way: Imagine space to be completely packed with an infinite number of unit cubes. What is the smallest number of snakes into which it can be dissected by cutting along the planes that define the cubes? [...] Kim has found a way of twisting four infinitely long one-ended snakes into a structure of interlocked helical shapes that fill all space. The method is too complicated to explain in a limited space; you will have to take my word that it can be done. [...] Kim has conjectured that in a space of $n$ dimensions the minimum number of snakes that completely fill it is $2(n-1)$ , but the guess is still a shaky one. In the reprints (I can't find this ever printed in the Scientific American back issues, but maybe I missed it), Gardner adds: Dr. Koh Chor Jin, a physicist at the National University of Singapore, sent a clever proof that given a finite volume of space it is possible to cover it with two of Kim's cube-connected snakes. However, as Kim pointed out, Jin's construction does not approach all of space as a limit [...] So my question for StackExchange is: What was Scott Kim's (or, what is a ) four-snake space-filling construction? And what was Koh Chor-Jin's (or, what is a ) way to cover any finite volume with two snakes? This guy is also looking for information on the problem. Footnote: At first I wondered if $2(n-1)$ was a typo for $2^{n-1}$ , since obviously it takes one snake (not zero snakes) to fill 1-space. But it's consistently typeset as $2(n-1)$ in all three primary sources, so I think the ""for $n\ge 2$ "" is implied.","['recreational-mathematics', 'conjectures', 'tessellations', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Suppose $X_n\to X$ in distribution  and suppose $Y_n\to y$ in probability, where $y$ is a constant. How to prove $$\Bbb P(Xy\leq b) \leq \liminf_{n\to\infty}\Bbb P(X_nY_n\leq b)?$$ I've asked the question before but I didn't get any answer. So I tried myself and hopefully someone can follow my reasoning. Note : I know that this follows from Slutsky's theorem, but I'm trying to use this question to prove Slutsky's theorem. My try: Since $X_n\to X$ in distribution, then given $\epsilon>0$ there an $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n\geq N$ $$\Bbb P(Xy\leq b)\leq\epsilon+\Bbb P(X_ny\leq b),\;\;\text{ and so }\;\;\; \Bbb P(Xy\leq b)\leq\epsilon+\inf_{n\geq N}\Bbb P(X_ny\leq b).$$ Now we need to use the fact that $Y_n\to y$ in probability.
We can write the set $$\{X_ny\leq b\}=\{X_ny\leq b,Y_n\in (y-\epsilon,y+\epsilon) \}\cup \{X_ny\leq b,Y_n\not\in (y-\epsilon,y+\epsilon) \},$$ and so $$
\{X_ny\leq b\}\subseteq\underbrace{\{X_nY_n\leq b+\epsilon}_{:=A_n} \}\cup \underbrace{\{Y_n\not\in (y-\epsilon,y+\epsilon) \}}_{:=B_n},$$ Now we know that $\liminf_{n\to\infty}\Bbb P(B_n)=0$ . Now let's look at $A_n$ . For the sake of simplicity let's assume $X_n>0$ .
Then we have that $$A_n=\{X_nY_n\leq b\}\cup \underbrace{\{b<X_nY_n\leq b+\epsilon\}}_{C_n}.$$ In total, we have that $$\Bbb P(X_ny\leq b)\leq \Bbb P(B_n) + \Bbb P(X_nY_n\leq b)+\mathbb{P}(C_n) $$ and $$ \Bbb P(Xy\leq b)\leq \Bbb P(X_nY_n\leq b)+\epsilon + \Bbb P(B_n) +\mathbb{P}(C_n) $$ and so finally we have made the set $\{X_nY_n\leq b\}$ appear. Taking $\liminf$ we have that $$ \Bbb P(Xy\leq b)\leq \liminf_{n\to\infty}\Bbb P(X_nY_n\leq b)+\epsilon  +\liminf_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{P}(C_n) $$ But then is it possible to bound the probability of $C_n=\{b<X_nY_n\leq b+\epsilon\}$ as a function of $\epsilon$ ?","['limsup-and-liminf', 'measure-theory', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"
4577368,What number of group elements of a specific order are (non-)realisable?,"My question is as follows: Let $G$ be an arbitrary finite group. Let $n_r(G) \in \mathbb{N}_0$ be the amount of elements that have exactly order $r \geq 2$ in $G$ . For which numbers $k \in \mathbb{N}_0$ can we find/construct groups $G$ such that $n_r(G) = k$ ? For $k$ such that it is possible, can one find representatives only constructed using cyclic groups and semidirect (including direct) products? What about if we drop the finiteness requirement? Disclaimer: My knowledge about Group Theory extends to about that of a first course in Abstract Algebra (Quotient Groups, Group Actions, Sylow theorems, Solvability) and I have just begun trying to understand semidirect products and getting used to GAP. Feel free to call me out on any nonsense I may write. As already discussed in this question debating the existence of a group with exactly $68$ resp. $92$ elements of order $3$ , this question is highly non-trivial for the case $r \neq 2$ (but affirmative if $r = 2$ by using dihedral groups).
I have been able to deduce from this post that for $p$ prime we have $$n_{p} \equiv p-1 \mod p(p-1)$$ by a result of Frobenius ( $n_p = p-1 \mod p$ ) and using that every element (except $e)$ has order $p$ in element-generated subgroups of size $p$ (such that $n_p \equiv 0 \mod p-1$ ). This weeds out the cases we must check dramatically, e.g. we have $$n_3 \equiv 2 \mod 6 \text{ and } n_5 \equiv 4 \mod 20 \text{ and } n_7 \equiv 6 \mod 42 \ldots$$ For a given prime $p$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$ , we can obviously cover the cases $n_p = p^m-1$ with the group $(\mathbb{Z}_p)^m$ - the $m$ -times iterated direct product of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ . But for everything in between, it always has involved guess work and pattern spotting from my side. The reason why I ask if this can be done with cyclic groups and semidirect products only is simple: I used GAP to search for the smallest groups $G$ that have the property $n_r(G) = k$ and in all - except one - examined cases it has always spat out a combination of cyclic groups by (semi)direct products. Now, since the linked question answers the stated premise negatively, we obviously cannot realise all these possibilities given by above condition. Specifically, I constructed a table with small primes and their conjectured non-realisible numbers: $$\begin{array}{c|c}
p & k \in \mathbb{N}: ?\exists G: n_p(G) = k \text{ gives no output from GAP}  \\
\hline
3 & \require{enclose}\enclose{horizontalstrike}{68}, \require{enclose}\enclose{horizontalstrike}{92}^*, 110,140,164,176,212,230,236,260,\ldots

7 & 90, 132, 216, 300, 468, \ldots
\\
11 & 340, 450, 560,\ldots
\end{array}$$ *As pointed out by spin in the comments. A crossed out number in this table means that one provably cannot find such a group, I still include it to keep it consistent with the (non-existing) output of my small GAP program. Also keep in mind that this table could include some false negatives since I cannot search with GAP for obscenely large groups that might fulfill the given property (or straight up do not exist as in the case $n_3 = 68$ ). This brings us back to the following thoughts: Are these truly not realisable? What general families of realisable groups do exist? Are there notable exceptions of realizations?... as possible jumping off points to attacking the question.

4577513,Collatz-like problem involving prime factors,"Unfortunately I am not well-versed in LaTeX so I will try my best to keep this looking presentable. As an overview, I was investigating a variation of the Collatz conjecture: Define $f(1) = 1$ Then, if $n$ is even, $f(n) = \frac{n}{2}$ Otherwise, let $n$ 's smallest prime factor be $p$ , then $f(n) = pn+1$ So then I was trying it out for small values: $f(1) = 1$ $f(2) = 1, f(1) = 1$ $f(3) = 10, f(10) = 5, f(5) = 26, f(26) = 13, ...$ and so on. Eventually you get to $f(213) = 640$ which reduces down to $10$ . Evidently, loops/cycles can form. $f(4) = 2, f(2) = 1$ $f(5) = 26$ which is already a part of $3$ 's cycle $f(6) = 3$ which is, again, part of $3$ 's cycle By now, I was thinking that this function had a nice trend of either reducing to $1$ or joining onto another number's cycle. However, $f(7)$ causes an issue. I have iterated for $f(7)$ around $100$ times using python, however it is still unclear whether $f(7)$ converges or not (for want of a better word). I also noticed that convergence of $f(9)$ depended on convergence of $f(7)$ . There is no reason why it should converge, I saw on another page that the average smallest prime factor of integers up to $n$ is asymptotic to $\frac{n}{2\log(n)}$ . So then $f(n)$ has average order $\frac{n^2}{2\log(n)}$ . My question then is ultimately: for any integer n, will $f(n)$ eventually reach 1 or form a cycle? And, if not, is there an interesting reason/proof why not? This question could be (and probably is) fairly difficult, so as a weaker question, does $f(7)$ converge? If this question is similar to, or a corollary of, another question asked here, I apologise. Please let me know and I will remove the question. Edit: I wrote some basic python code to do the computations for me, however, it is not very efficient.

Originally, I had thought that the ""Weighted Mean"" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean ) was a good approach for this problem. That is, cities with larger populations should have more of an influence on the final estimate, and cities with smaller populations should have less of an influence on the final estimate. I could then calculate the standard deviation as well. I started looking at references to perform this calculation (e.g. http://seismo.berkeley.edu/~kirchner/Toolkits/Toolkit_12.pdf), and it appears that individual measurements might be required for this calculation. For example, I would need to have the income of every person interviewed in City A, City B and City C. However, I am only provided with the average income from each of these cities - and furthermore, I am not even provided with the standard deviation of these averages. In such a problem, does it still make sense to calculated the Weighted Mean on essentially three measurements? Or in such cases, is it better to refrain from calculating any statistics, seeing that any estimate generated in such a context is likely to be inherently flawed? Note: these 3 measurements I am provided with are themselves ""means"" of other measurements - I am not sure if this further complicates things. E.g. since I am not provided with the variance of each individual mean - will it still be published to calculate the variance of the weighted mean?","['statistics', 'probability']"

If $A$ is the base area, $P$ is the perimeter of the base, and $h$ is the height of the prism, then $$V=Ah$$ $$S=2A+Ph$$ Dividing $V$ by $S$ and solving for $h$ gives you $$\frac{V}{S}=\frac{Ah}{2A+Ph}=c$$ $$Ah=c(2A+Ph)$$ $$Ah-Pch=2Ac$$ $$h=\frac{2Ac}{A-Pc}$$ So if I have a prism and change its height without changing the base, the ratio $c$ would have to change.

4578294,Prove that the generalized eigenvalue equation in normal mode analysis has positive eigenvalues,"Context I am studying normal modes oscillations and normal modes [1,2].
I am trying to complete a proof to show that the eigenvalues (i.e., the eigenvalues are positive). There is a proof in [2], but I find it verbose and likely incorrect. There is a short proof of this in [4]. Nonetheless, I proceed with my questions on the topic. Questions Question 1 In my understanding an eigenvalue equation [3], I write the following definition. Definition
If $T$ is a linear transformation from a finite-dimensional vector space $\mathbb{C}^n$ over the field of complex number into itself and $\mathbf{v}$ is a  nonzero  vector in $\mathbb{C}^n$ , then $\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvector of $T$ if $T\,\mathbf{v}$ is a scalar multiple of $\mathbf{v}$ . This can be written as the eigenvalue equation $$T(\mathbf{v}) = \lambda \mathbf{v},$$ where $\lambda$ is a scalar in $\mathbb{C}$ , known as the eigenvalue associated with $\mathbf{v}$ . However, in the analysis of normal mode of dynamical systems, I have $n$ -dimensional real symmetric matrices $\mathbf{V}$ and $\mathbf{T} $ , and the "" eigenvalue equation "" $$\mathbf{V}\,\mathbf{a} = \lambda\,\mathbf{T}\,\mathbf{a}.\tag{1}$$ In my mind, if $T$ is invertible, I can make an actual eigenvalue equation $$\left( \mathbf{V}\,\mathbf{T}^{-1}\right)\left(\mathbf{T}\,\mathbf{a}\right) = \lambda\,\left(\mathbf{T}\,\mathbf{a}\right).\tag{2}$$ Now, I would have that $\mathbf{T}\mathbf{a}$ is an eigenvector of $\mathbf{V}\mathbf{T}^{-1}$ since $\mathbf{V} \mathbf{a}$ is a scalar multiple of $\mathbf{T}\mathbf{a}$ . So my first series of questions: (1) Can we agree that, as written, Equation 1 is not actually an eigenvalue equation? (2) Does this type of equation have a name? If so what is it? Question 2 In [2] there is a claim that $\lambda$ is always finite and positive. It comes down to faith. I really like [2], but when it comes to such matters as the proofs of mathematical claim, I just have no faith in [2]. For example, there is even an example later in the book when one of the eigenvalues is zero valued. (3) How can we prove or disprove the following propositions? [Please note that both propositions cannot be proven to be true.  An amended proposition is given and proven in OP's answer below.] Proposition. Given two $n$ dimensional real symmetric matrices $\mathbf{T}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ show that any solution of the equation $$\mathbf{V}\,\mathbf{a} = \lambda\,\mathbf{T}\,\mathbf{a}$$ has a scalar lambda that is positive. Proposition. Given two $n$ dimensional real symmetric matrices $\mathbf{T}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ show that any solution of the equation $$\mathbf{V}\,\mathbf{a} = \lambda\,\mathbf{T}\,\mathbf{a}$$ has a scalar lambda that is non-negative. These two propositions are closely related. Thus, I assume that some other predicates need to be set in order to distinguish the proofs.

4578350,Proof about block matrices,"During a test today I had this question: Given $$ M = \begin{pmatrix} A & C \\ 0 & B\\ \end{pmatrix}$$ where $A$ and $B$ are $n \times n$ diagonalizables matrices without eigenvalues in common, prove that $M$ is diagonalizable. No information about $C$ was given. First, I tried $$\det(M - \lambda I) = \det(A - \lambda I)\cdot \det(B - \lambda I)$$ So $$p_M(\lambda)=p_A(\lambda)\cdot p_B(\lambda)$$ So the set of eigenvalues of $M$ is the union of the eigenvalues of $A$ and $B$ (given they don't have any in common). My next step was to do $$ M^k = \begin{pmatrix}
     A^k & C'\\ 
     0 & B^k\\ \end{pmatrix}$$ so if $m_M(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $M$ , we have that $m_A(x)|m_M(x)$ and $m_B(x)|m_M(x)$ . But how can I conclude that hence the minimal polynomial of M will have just linear factors? I know that $m_M(x) = m_A(x)\cdot m_B(x)\cdot Q(x)$ , but how can I show that $Q(x) = 1$ ? If $m_M(x) = m_A(x)\cdot m_B(x)$ it´s clear that M is diagonalizable, but I can´t see how to prove this. In fact, in the end my approach was the same of the first answer, but after I still looking to a solution using the minimal polynomial.","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'diagonalization', 'block-matrices']"

I read a solution that went like this. On a stereographic chart, a vector field $X$ looks like this: $$X|_U=\sum_i \varphi_i \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$$ Evaluating this vector field on the function $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$ , we get: $$\sum_{i=1}^n \varphi_i(x_1,...,x_n)x_i=0$$ So we just need to take $\Phi=(\varphi_1,...,\varphi_n)$ .

So I was wondering if anybody here knows of a more elegant proof, or rather just a different proof, given that ""elegant"" is subjective. Forgot to mention, the proof I know is where we consider $A\in Z(M)$ and calculate the effect on the standard basis of the set of n by n matrices, to notice that A must be scalar in light of the implied conditions on the rows and columns of A. Thank you for all the proofs, I am most definitely satisfied in elegance and variety.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
4579114,Which region is this triple integral reffering to?,"$$Integral =  \iiint_V x+z\;dV $$ $$Region$$ $$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq 1$$ $$z \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$ Geogebra shows that the region looks like in the picture below but given the inquality sign in the equations, is the actual region inside the cone and sphere (icecream cone) or is the actual region inside the sphere but minus the icecream cone? Initially I thought it is the first one but given the inquality, it made me think it is the second one. Which one is it? Thank you very much!","['integration', 'analysis', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'spherical-coordinates']"

4579170,Want to simplify $z\cos\phi_1\cos\phi_2+z^*\sin\phi_1\sin\phi_2$,"I have an integral that has the term $z\cos\phi_1\cos\phi_2+z^*\sin\phi_1\sin\phi_2$ located in an exponent term. I am attempting to solve this integral (there are other terms but I am focused on this one). Clearly, if $z$ was real, this would be pretty simple to simplify; however, $z$ is decidedly complex. I have tried using trigonometric identity $A\cos x+B\sin x=\sqrt{A^2+B^2}\cos[x-\arctan(B/A)]$ , but this didn't work. Does anyone have any idea of how to combine these terms somehow? I would appreciate any help with this.","['integration', 'trigonometry', 'complex-numbers']"
4579186,Urn Ball Probability problem from Sheldon Ross' Probability Textbook,"Seven balls are randomly withdrawn from an urn that contains 12 red, 16 blue, and 18 green balls. Find the probability that (b) at least 2 red balls are withdrawn; I understand that one way to do the problem is to subtract the probability that 0 or 1 red ball is drawn from 1 to get the probability of at least 2 red balls being drawn. However, I don't understand why this method fails: Pick 2 red balls, then pick any 5 balls of the remaining 44. For the position of the red balls to not matter, take $\binom{7}{2}$ . The total number of possibilities is $\binom{46}{7}$ . So P(at least 2 red) = $\frac{\binom{12}{2} \binom{44}{5} \binom{7}{2}}{\binom{46}{7}}$ This is greater than 1, so it's definitely wrong.","['combinations', 'probability']"

4579291,Are there any other decent methods to evaluate $\int_0^1 \frac{\ln \left(1-x^4\right)}{1+x^2} d x?$,"We first split the integrand into 3 parts as \begin{aligned}
\int_0^1 \frac{\ln \left(1-x^4\right)}{1+x^2} d x &= \underbrace{\int_0^1 \frac{\ln \left(1+x^2\right)}{1+x^2} d x}_J+\underbrace{\int_0^1 \frac{\ln (1+x)}{1+x^2} d x}_K+ \underbrace{\int_0^1 \frac{\ln (1-x)}{1+x^2} d x}_L
\end{aligned} Denotes the Catalan’s constant by $G$ . By my post , $$J=\frac{\pi}{2}\ln2-G$$ Dealing with the last $2$ integrals, we use a powerful substitution $x=\frac{1-t}{1+t} ,$ then $dx=-\frac{2dt}{(1+t)^2}.$ $$
\begin{aligned}
K&=\int_1^0 \frac{\ln 2-\ln (1+t)}{\frac{2+2 t^2}{(1+t)^2}} \frac{-2 d t}{(1+t)^2} \\
&=\ln 2 \int_0^1 \frac{d t}{1+t^2}-\int_0^1 \frac{\ln (1+t)}{1+t^2}
\end{aligned}
$$ Hence $$K=\frac{\pi}{8} \ln 2 $$ $$
\begin{aligned}
L=& \int_0^1 \frac{\ln 2+\ln t-\ln (1+t)}{1+t^2} d t \\
&=\frac{\pi}{4} \ln 2+\int_0^1 \frac{\ln t}{1+t^2}-\int_0^1 \frac{\ln (1+t)}{1+t^2} d t . \\
&=\frac{\pi}{4} \ln 2-G-\frac{\pi}{8} \ln 2 \\
&=\frac{\pi}{8} \ln 2-G

$$ Combining them to get $$
\begin{aligned}
I &=\left(\frac{\pi}{2} \ln 2-G\right) +\frac{\pi}{8} \ln 2  +\left(\frac{\pi}{8} \ln 2-G\right)\\
&=\frac{3 \pi}{4} \ln 2-2 G
