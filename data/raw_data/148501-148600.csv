2449353,Are there infinitely many primes with digit sums of the form $n^2+1$?,"The motivation for this question is from one of well known Landau Problems which asks for proof of the statement: Are there infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p − 1$ is a perfect square? In other words: Are there infinitely many primes of the form $n^2 + 1$ . But this is not what I am asking. Before I ask my question let me explain the scenario. A prime $p$ is called $\color{blue}{\text{Nice prime}} \ $ if sum of its digits is of the form $n^2+1$ For example $37\rightarrow 3+7=3^2+1$ . The primes sum of whose digits is of the form $n^2$ (Eg $31\rightarrow 4=2^2$ ) or $n^2-1$ (Eg $71\rightarrow 8=3^2-1$ ) will be called Almost Nice primes. The question is are there infinitely many Nice primes? Now, I tried to find Nice and Almost Nice primes by hand till $400$ and here is what I've got: Nice primes are: $5,11,19,23,37,41,73,89,101,109,113,127,131,163,179,181,197,271,307,311,359,373$ . While Almost Nice primes are: $n^2\rightarrow 1,3,31,79,97,103,211,277,367,349$ $n^2-1\rightarrow 3,17,53,71,107,233,251$ There is a reason why I called primes whose sum of digits is of the form $n^2$ and $n^2-1$ Almost nice primes. If you have an Almost Nice Prime of the form $n^2-1$ then adding $2\times10^k$ to it (here $k$ is the highest power of $10$ in decimal expansion of $n^2-1$ ) will give you a Nice prime if it is a prime (by it I mean $n^2-1+2\times10^k$ ).  In a similar manner, if a prime $p$ is an Almost Nice prime of the form $n^2$ then if $n^2+10^k$ is a prime then it will be a Nice prime. But introducing Almost Nice prime is not much helpful as we have to make sure that $\text{Almost Nice prime (of the form $n^2$)}+10^k$ $\text{or Almost Nice prime (of the form $n^2-1$)+$2\times10^k$}$ is a prime before concluding that it met our Nice prime criteria. Since the post is long, I again remind you the question. Are there infinitely many Nice primes? Thanks.","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'arithmetic', 'elementary-number-theory']"
2449473,"Given this matrix $A$, find $A^{144}$","I know this is a very common question to ask when one is making their way into Linear Algebra (i.e. given a matrix, find the result of that matrix to the nth -power). I'm given this matrix: $$
   A=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   0 & -1 \\
   1 & 0 \\
  \end{array} } \right]$$ I'm asked to compute, by hand, the matrix $A^{144}$ What I tried: I calculated $A^2$, $A^3$, $A^4$ and $A^5$ and tried to find a pattern, so that I could first find the more general $A^n$ expression, and then make $n=144$. This is what I got: $$
   A^2=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   -1 & 0 \\
   0 & -1 \\
  \end{array} } \right]$$
$$
   A^3=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   0 & 1 \\
   -1 & 0 \\
  \end{array} } \right]$$
$$
   A^4=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   1 & 0 \\
   0 & 1 \\
  \end{array} } \right]$$
$$
   A^5=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   0 & -1 \\
   1 & 0 \\
  \end{array} } \right]$$ So there seems to be kind of a ""circular pattern"", where $A^6=A^2$ and therefore, since $144/6=24$, I'm suspecting that: $$¿\,\boxed{A^{144}=A^2} \,?$$ However, I was hoping to find the more general $A^n$ matrix first and confirm the above result. But, I can't seem to find a function such that:
$$f(n) =
\left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		0  & \mbox{if n is odd}  \\
		1 & \mbox{if n is even} 
	\end{array}
\right.
$$
This function would allow me to sort out the (1,1) and (2,2) elements of $A^n$ being 0 when n is odd (and the (1,2) and (2,1) being 0 when n is even). I'm a bit confused at this point, your help is greatly appreciated.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
2449475,Proof of $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}a^x$ and $\lim\frac{a^h-1}{h}$,"I was looking for the proof of $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}a^x$ as the $\lim_{h\to0}\frac{a^{x+h}-a^{x}}{h}$ which is $a^x\lim_{h\to0}\frac{a^{h}-1}{h}$. To solve that, I need to know the $\lim_{h\to0}\frac{a^{h}-1}{h}$. In terms of $t$ I defined $\frac{1}{t}=a^h-1=e^{h\ln(a)}-1$, therefore $e^{h\ln(a)} = 1+\frac{1}{t}$ and $h=\frac{\ln\left (1+\frac{1}{t}  \right )}{\ln(a)}$. When $h\to0$, $t\to\infty$. $$\begin{aligned}\lim_{h\to0}\frac{a^{h}-1}{h}&=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{\frac{1}{t}}{\frac{\ln\left (1+\frac{1}{t}  \right )}{\ln(a)}}\\
&=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{\ln(a)}{t\cdot \ln\left (1+\frac{1}{t}  \right )}\\
&=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{\ln(a)}{\ln\left (\left (1+\frac{1}{t}  \right )^t  \right )}\\
&=\frac{\ln(a)}{\ln\left ( \lim_{t\to\infty}\left (1+\frac{1}{t}  \right )^t \right )}\end{aligned}$$ In terms of $n$ Now, I need to solve the limit $\lim_{t\to\infty}\left (1+\frac{1}{t}  \right )^t$. I defined $t=\frac{1}{n}$. When $t\to\infty$, $n\to0$. $$\begin{aligned}\lim_{t\to\infty}\left (1+\frac{x}{t}  \right )^t&=\lim_{n\to0}\left (1+\frac{n}{\frac{1}{x}}  \right )^\frac{1}{n}\\
&=\lim_{n\to0}\left (\frac{\frac{1}{x}+n}{\frac{1}{x}}  \right )^\frac{1}{n}\\
&=e^{\lim_{n\to0}\ln\left (\frac{\frac{1}{x}+n}{\frac{1}{x}}  \right )^\frac{1}{n}}\\
&=e^{\lim_{n\to0}\frac{\ln\left (\frac{\frac{1}{x}+n}{\frac{1}{x}}  \right )}{n}}\\
&=e^{\lim_{n\to0}\frac{\ln\left ( \frac{1}{x}+n \right )-\ln\left ( \frac{1}{x} \right )}{n}}\\
&=e^{\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\frac{1}{x}}\ln\left ( \frac{1}{x} \right )}\end{aligned}$$ Now I tried to solve $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\ln(x)=\frac{1}{\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\ln(x)}x}=\frac{1}{\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\ln(x)}e^{\ln(x)}}$. And I get back to $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}a^x$, when $a = e$. Is there a way to solve one of the limits or the derivatives in another way that does not create a loop? Note that I can't use L'Hopital rule, since I did now proof the derivatives. Thanks.","['derivatives', 'limits']"

On $D_+(X)$ we have the section $d(Y/X)$ and similarly we have the section $d(X/Y)$ on $D_+(Y)$. According to this answer , the relation $(X/Y)^2 d(Y/X)=-d(X/Y)$ on $D_+(X)\cap D_+(Y)$ implies that $(X/Y)^2 d(Y/X)$ is a global section of $\mathcal{O}_X(2)\otimes \Omega_{X/A}$. How is that? We have $\Gamma(D_+(X),\mathcal{O}_X(2)\otimes \Omega_{X/A})\cong X^2d(Y/X) A[Y/X]$, so $X^2d(Y/X)$ defines a section over $D_+(X)$. Similarly, we have the section $Y^2d(X/Y)$ over $D_+(Y)$ and we cannot quite glue them due to the sign. Anyway, this doesn't seem to make sense of $(X/Y)^2 d(Y/X)$ defining a global section.","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

2449632,How to solve $x \times 0 = n$ where $n$ does not equal $0$?,"So recently I was watching some videos on complex numbers. I was surprised to learn the uses of $i$ in different problems. For example, I never thought it would make sense that $x^2 + 1 = 0$ has any solutions at all. But apparently it does when you consider that this equation actually has two solutions that aren't visible by graphing this equation on your calculator. However, my question is somewhat related yet somewhat different. What if we had the following equation: $$x \times 0 = 1$$ Now, from my knowledge, there's no solutions to this problem because no number that I know multiplied by zero would be equal to anything but zero. But would it be possible to create your own solutions to this problem? I noticed when I tried to solve this problem I came across two main issues: $$x \times 0 \, / \, 0 = 1 \, / \, 0$$ First off, what is $0 \, / \, 0$? Does $0 \, / \, 0$ ""cancel out?"" Secondly, isn't $1 \, / \, 0$ undefined? Not to mention, what if I have another problem like this one: $$x \times 0 = 5$$ How would the solutions, if any, differ from this problem and the first problem? Keep in mind, I'm not a mathematics genius or anything, so I hope you won't be disappointed with me for suggesting a problem like this because I'm simply just curious. This is not meant to stump anyone, nor is it meant to waste your time. Any responses would be greatly appreciated.",['algebra-precalculus']

The method that I decided to use is contour (square) integrals and the residue theorem. Progress I noticed that $f(z)=\frac{1}{z^2\sin\pi(z+\alpha)}$ has poles at $z=0, k-\alpha, k\in \mathbb{Z}$ with residues $$\mbox{res}(f(z);0)=-\pi \cot (\pi \alpha) \csc( \pi \alpha) \\ \mbox{res}(f(z);k-\alpha)=\frac{(-1)^k}{\pi(k-\alpha)^2}$$ which one can obtain by simply calculating. So then I considered a path $\Gamma_N$ defined by a square with vertices at $N(1, i), N(1, -1), N(-1, i), N(-1, -i)$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$. So if we let $a_k$ be the list of poles of $f$ inside the region formed by $\Gamma_N$, by the residue theorem, we get: $$\begin{align*} \oint_{\Gamma_N}f(z)dz &= 2\pi i\sum_{a_i} \mbox{res}(f(z);a_k) \\ &= 2\pi i \left[ -\pi \cot (\pi \alpha) \csc( \pi \alpha)+\sum_{n=-N+1}^N \frac{(-1)^n}{\pi(n-\alpha)^2}\right] \\ &\to 2\pi i \left[ -\pi \cot (\pi \alpha) \csc( \pi \alpha)+\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{\pi(n-\alpha)^2}\right] \end{align*}$$ Now, supposing $\oint_{\Gamma_N}f(z)dz \to 0$, we get $$0=-\pi \cot (\pi \alpha) \csc( \pi \alpha)+\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{\pi(n-\alpha)^2}$$ and then we're done.

2449986,How to prove the converse of Carathéodory's theorem,"The following problem is an assignment of my complex analysis course, which seems to be a converse of the Carathéodory's theorem that a biholomorphism between two Jordan regions can be extended to a homeomorphism between their closures. Suppose that $G$ and $\Omega$ are Jordan regions and $f$ is a continuous function on the closure $\overline G$ of $G$ such that $f$ is analytic on $G$ and $f(G)\subset\Omega$. If $f$ maps $\partial G$ onto $\partial\Omega$ homeomorphically, then $f(G)=\Omega$ and $f$ is univalent. To be honest it is a bit difficult to prove and I have worked on it for days. By Riemann mapping theorem and its extension to the boundary, we can take both $G$ and $\Omega$ in this problem as the unit disk $\Delta$ and $f(0)=0$. The image of $f$ is a region since $f$ here cannot be constant in $G$, and then we can consider a formally simpler but in fact equivalent problem as follows. Suppose that $f\colon\overline\Delta\to\overline\Delta$ is continuous. If $f\in\mathcal O(\Delta)$ and $f(0)=0$ and $f\colon\partial\Delta\to\partial\Delta$ is a homeomorphism, then $f\in\mathrm{Aut}\,(\Delta)$, namely $f(z)=e^{i\theta}z$ where $\theta\in\mathbb R$. For what happens next I completely have no idea. So may I ask how to prove such an $f$ is a bijection? Thanks in advance.. ps. I found it an exercise in J. B. Conway's Functions of One Complex Variable II , GTM159. It is the Excercise 10 of Section 14.5, while a preceding one (Excercise 8, for which a proof is here ) says that if $f$ is continuous over $\overline\Delta$ and $f\in\mathcal O(\Delta)$, then there is a sequence of polynomial $P_n(z)$ such that $P_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $\overline\Delta$. I think this may help since if we managed to prove the moduli of coefficients $a_n$ of $z$ in $P_n$ tend to $1$ then by Schwarz's lemma we can conclude that $f$ is biholomorphic. However, I don't know what the use of $f$ being homeomorphic on $S^1=\partial\Delta$ is and maybe it is the bottleneck of this proof. Now I would like to ask if I am in a right way, and what to do next...","['complex-analysis', 'analytic-functions', 'holomorphic-functions', 'inverse-function']"

It was proven by considering a curve $\gamma$ and showing that $f(\alpha)=f(\beta)$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the points connected by $\gamma$ and the function $t\to f(\gamma (t))$ is differentiable. Next it shows that for all the points $\alpha, z_0, z_1, \ldots , z_n, \beta$, where $z_i$ is a end and a star point of two curves on a path, $f(z_i)=f(\alpha)$. In other words, if you take the derivative of a path, it's constant on every point joining two curves. Then it claims that this proves the theorem.

$x_1=r \cdot \sin \theta \cdot \cos \varphi $ $x_2=r \cdot \sin \theta \cdot \sin \varphi $ $x_3=r \cdot \cos \theta$ So you instead get the limit:

The category of abelian groups is denoted by $\mathrm{Ab}. $It's well known that the sheafification functor is exact. My question is whether it preserves injective objects. EDIT : To my best knowledge of sheaves of abelian groups over a topological space, I view them through localization theory of abelian categories. Let me describe it now. The stalk at every point $x\in X$ can be seen as a (exact) functor $(-)_x:\mathrm{Prshf}_X\rightarrow \mathrm{Ab}$. Consider the intersection of the kernel of $(-)_x$ at every point $x\in X$: $$\mathcal N=\bigcap_{x\in X} \mathrm{ker}(-)_x$$ 
This is a localizing subcategory of $\mathrm{Prshf}_X$, i.e. it is closed under taking subobjects, quotient objects, and closed under extensions and arbitrary coproducts. Then the $\mathcal N$-closed objects(an object $A$of $\mathrm{Prshf}_X$ is $\mathcal N$-closed if $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal N,A)=0$  and $\mathrm{Ext}^1(\mathcal N, A)=0$ ) of the category $\mathrm{Prshf}_X$ are exactly sheaves. The full subcategory of $\mathcal N$-closed objects is denote by $\mathcal L$ (which is just the category of sheaves). Then we have the well-known adjoint pair $\mathrm (F,G):{Prshf}_X\rightleftharpoons \mathcal L$ where $F$ is the sheafification functor and $G$ is the inclusion functor. Since $\mathrm{Prshf}_X$ is a Grothendieck category, we may ask whether the sheafification functor preserves injectives. Two results are known (see Popescu, Abelian categories with applications,p182)  : If the injective presheaf $\mathcal I$ is an injective envelope of a presheaf $\mathcal F$ having no non-zero $\mathcal N$- subobjects, then we know the sheafification of $\mathcal I$ is injective. If the topological space $X$ is good enough to make the category $\mathrm{Prshf}_X$ contain the injective envelope of each of its objects in $\mathcal N$, then the sheafification functor preserves injectives.","['localization', 'algebraic-geometry']"

(2) Internal product: The internal product of subgroups $A$ and $B$ is $AB = \left\{ ab \:{:}\: a \in A, b \in B \right\}$. (3) Sum: The sum of subgroups A and B is $A + B = \left\{ a + b \:{:}\: a \in A, b \in B \right\}$. So (2) and (3) are basically the same objects because (2) is used under the multiplicative notation and (3) is used under the additive notation. (4) Direct product: The internal product $AB$ is called a direct product and denoted $A \times B$ (confusingly enough) if $A \cap B = \left\{ 1 \right\}$. (5) Direct sum: The sum $A + B$ is called a direct sum and denoted $A \oplus B$ if $A \cap B = \left\{ 0 \right\}$. So (4) and (5) are basically the same objects because (4) is used under the multiplicative notation and (5) is used under the additive notation.

2450848,"What makes the Cauchy principal value the ""correct"" value for a integral?","I haven't been able to find a good answer to this searching around online. There is a related old question here, but it never received much attention. Suppose I have some physical property that I believe depends on $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xdx$. Ordinarily, we would say the integral is undefined, but we could also hypothetically take the Cauchy principal value and say the integral evaluates to zero. My question is under what conditions should I let the integral remain undefined and when should it equal zero? It seems odd to me that based on different circumstances of the problem we could say that the same integral has different values. For pure math, as long as you work within a consistent framework, it doesn't really matter which you decide is true. But for physics, chemistry, etc if the integral relates to some property, it would seem there would be some definitive, empirical solution to the problem. This question arises from some problems I have been doing with the Cauchy distribution. It seems that for certain physical examples, there is certain camp that treats the location parameter as the mean of the distribution, which is effectively saying the integral to determine the mean is equal to its principal value. I don't like this because it seems to suggest to me that all the higher order odd moments could also be argued to exist, at least in case where the distribution is symmetric about zero,","['cauchy-principal-value', 'integration', 'mathematical-physics', 'probability-distributions']"

If $a \cdot b$ is even then by definition of even there exists an integer $r$ such that $a \cdot b = 2r$. So we have $a \cdot b = (2p) (2q+1) = 2r$, where $r$ is an integer.

2451129,Solving the differential equation $q \vec{v} \times \vec{B} + q \vec{E} = m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$,"This is more of a physics-y question, but it's not the physics I care about here -- just the mathematics. In my physics class we learned a particle with constant velocity in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to it causes it to rotated in a circle of constant radius. The professor told me how to ""prove this"", in essence solving the following: $$q \vec{v} \times \vec{B} = m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$$
with $\vec{v}=\langle v_x, v_y, v_z \rangle$ and $\vec{B}=\langle 0,0,B \rangle$ with $B\in\mathbb R_{>0}$, and it worked out great! Got the equation for a circle. He then told me that if there was an electric field perpendicular to both the moving particle and field, I should get a cycloid from solving this (with $\vec{E}= \langle 0,E,0 \rangle$): $$q \vec{v} \times \vec{B} + q \vec{E} = m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$$ And, well, I didn't get a cycloid as an answer, but another circle. Here's my attempt at this differential equation, does anyone see anything wrong? To clarify to those who haven't taken Electromagnetism, $q \in \mathbb R$ is charge, $m,B,E \in \mathbb R_{>0}$, and $v_x,v_y,v_z: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$. So let $\vec{v}=\langle v_x, v_y, v_z \rangle$, $\vec{B}=\langle 0,0,B \rangle$, and $\vec{E}=\langle 0,E,0 \rangle$. Then $\begin{align*}
&\ q \vec{v} \times \vec{B} + q \vec{E} = m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} \\
&\implies \langle qv_yB, -qv_xB+qE \rangle = \langle m \frac{dv_x}{dt}, m \frac{dv_y}{dt} \rangle \\
&\implies \begin{cases} \frac{dv_x}{dt} = \frac{q}{m} v_y B \\ \frac{dv_y}{dt}=-\frac{q}{m} v_xB+\frac{q}{m}E \end{cases} \\
&\implies \frac{d^2v_x}{dt^2} = \frac{qB}{m} \frac{dv_y}{dt} \\
&\implies \frac{dv_y}{dt} = \frac{m}{qB}\frac{d^2v_x}{dt^2} \\
&\implies \frac{m}{qB} \frac{d^2v_x}{dt^2}=-\frac{qB}{m}v_x+\frac{qE}{m} \\
&\implies \frac{d^2 v_x}{dt^2}=-\frac{q^2B^2}{m^2}v_x+\frac{q^2BE}{m^2} \\
&\implies \frac{d^2 v_x}{dt^2} + \frac{q^2B^2}{m^2}v_x = \frac{q^2BE}{m^2}
\end{align*}$ Now the auxiliary equation of the $LHS$ is 
$$g^2+\frac{q^2B^2}{m^2}=0\implies g=\pm \frac{qB}{m} i$$
so we get $(v_x)_c=c_1 \cos\left(\frac{qB}{m}t\right)+c_2\sin\left(\frac{qB}{m}t\right)$. And $$RHS=\frac{q^2BE}{m^2} \implies \begin{cases} (v_x)_p = A \\ (v_x)_p' = 0 \\ (v_x)_p''=0\end{cases} \implies (0)+\frac{q^2B^2}{m^2}(A) = \frac{q^2BE}{m^2} \implies A = \frac{E}{B}$$ Thus, $$v_x = (v_x)_c+(v_x)_p = c_1 \cos\left(\frac{qB}{m}t\right)+c_2\sin\left(\frac{qB}{m}t\right) + \frac{E}{B}.$$ Now back from the top, we knew $$\frac{dv_x}{dt} = \frac{qB}{m} v_y \implies v_y = \frac{m}{qB} \frac{dv_x}{dt}$$ and $$\frac{dv_x}{dt} = \frac{c_2qB}{m} \cos \left(\frac{qB}{m}t\right)-\frac{c_1qB}{m} \sin \left(\frac{qB}{m}t\right)$$ so we get $$v_y =  c_2 \cos \left(\frac{qB}{m}t\right)- c_1 \sin \left(\frac{qB}{m}t\right)$$ and in totality $$\vec{v} = \left[c_1 \cos\left(\frac{qB}{m}t\right)+c_2\sin\left(\frac{qB}{m}t\right) + \frac{E}{B} \right] \hat{i} + \left[ c_2 \cos \left(\frac{qB}{m}t\right)- c_1 \sin \left(\frac{qB}{m}t\right) \right] \hat{j}.$$ This doesn't even look remotely close to an equation of a cycloid . Does someone know where my mistake may be? Edit: Upon integrating, I arrived at
$$\vec{x}= \left[ \frac{c_1m}{qB} \sin \left( \frac{qB}{m}t \right) - \frac{c_2m}{qB} \cos \left( \frac{qB}{m}t \right) + \frac{E}{B}t \right] \hat{i} + \left[ \frac{c_2 m}{qB} \sin \left( \frac{qB}{m}t \right) + \frac{c_1 m}{qB} \cos \left( \frac{qB}{m}t \right) \right] \hat{j}$$

$$\frac{1}{n}\left[1 + \dfrac{n-1}{n} + \dfrac{n-1}{n} \cdot \dfrac{n-2}{n} + ... +\dfrac{(n-1)!}{n^{n-1}}\right]$$ and the minimum $n$ is 6 by brute force calculation. Is there any way to pretty it up?","['probability', 'discrete-mathematics']"
2451503,"Is there a relationship for a triangle's side lengths, altitude/height, and acute/obtuse/right?","I have 3 arbitrary points in a 2D plane. I like to call them x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 just to make it easier to enter into a computer program. These points are arbitrary. They will define a triangle, but the triangle could be acute or obtuse, and it could be right or non-right. The goal is to figure out what kind it is in each of those categories. So there are 3 possibilities: acute non-right, acute right, and obtuse non-right. There is no such thing as an obtuse right triangle so I guess that simplifies things a bit. First of all, what I like to do is take the length from x1,y1 to x2,y2 and call that the base (B). Then find the height (or altitude) relative to that base. Otherwise there are 3 heights/altitudes we could choose. The reason I do this is to make things independent of angles or which way the triangle is rotated. I find the height by first getting the area using Heron's Formula , then doing this: $A = \displaystyle \frac{BH}{2}$ $2A = BH$ $\displaystyle \frac{2A}{B} = H$ So now I know 4 values: the lengths of the 3 sides, and the height. Can I determine the category of triangle just with this information? I drew this picture to help. Each one of these triangles has the same base and height. I would rather not compute angles using the law of sines, cosines, or tangents. I would have to do that for all 3 angles and then check all three to see if they're 90, less than 90, or greater than 90 degrees. It seems there should be some clever way to compare side lengths and heights and determine the type of triangle. Is this possible?","['trigonometry', 'geometry']"

Now, let $t_0\in[0,T]$ and $X:\Omega\to\mathbb R$ be $\mathcal F_0$-measurable. I want to show that $$X\int_{t_0}^T\Phi\:{\rm d}B=\int_{t_0}^TX\Phi\:{\rm d}B\;.\tag1$$ If $\Phi$ is elementary , i.e. $$\Phi=\sum_{i=1}^k1_{(s_{i-1},\:s_i]}^{[0,\:T]}\eta_i\tag2$$ for some $k\in\mathbb N$, $0\le s_0<\cdots<s_k\le T$ and $\mathcal F_{s_{i-1}}$-measurable $\eta_i:\Omega\to\mathbb R$ with $|\eta_i(\Omega)|\in\mathbb N$, then it's easy to see that $(1)$ holds. In the general case, there is a sequence $(\Phi^n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ of elementary processes with $$\left\|\Phi-\Phi^n\right\|_{L^2\left(\operatorname P\otimes\left.\lambda^1\right|_{[0,\:T]}\right)}\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0\tag3$$ and $$\left\|\Phi\cdot B-\Phi^n\cdot B\right\|_{M^2(\operatorname P)}\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0\;,\tag4$$ where $\Phi\cdot B$ denotes the integral process $\left(\int_0^t\Phi\:{\rm d}B\right)_{t\in[0,\:T]}$ and $M^2(\operatorname P)$ denotes the space of square integrable continous $\mathcal F$-martingales. Let $\tilde\Phi:=1_{(t_0,\:T]}\Phi$ and $\tilde\Phi^n:=1_{(t_0,\:T]}\Phi^n$. By the (omitted) proof of the elementary case, $\tilde\Phi^n$ and $X\tilde\Phi^n$ are elementary (and hence their Itō integral is well-defined). In order to conclude by approximation, we need that $X\tilde\Phi\in L^2\left(\operatorname P\otimes\left.\lambda^1\right|_{[0,\:T]}\right)$ is $\mathcal F$-predictable (such that the Itō integral is well-defined) and $$\left\|X\tilde\Phi-X\tilde\Phi^n\right\|_{L^2\left(\operatorname P\otimes\left.\lambda^1\right|_{[0,\:T]}\right)}\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0\;.\tag5$$ However, I don't see why $X\tilde\Phi$ should even satisfy the integrability assumption, since their is no integrability assumption on $X$.

2451648,Socks on a clothing line,"Recently I was putting some socks on the clothing line after taking them from the laundry machine and I while I was doing that I came up with an interesting math problem. I usually wash $30$ or so socks (amounting for $15$ or so pairs) and then I start putting them on clothing lines. On one clothing line I can put at most $8$ socks. Here's my method of ordering: I pick a random sock and I put it on the first line, in the same time ""reserving"" the place after it for it's partner. Next I pick another random sock and if it's partner is already on one of the lines I just put it in the already reserved place, otherwise I put it in the next free place. First I tend to use all the free space on the first line, then on the second and so on. For example if I have something like $x-x-x-x-$ on the first line (where $x$ is a slot filled with a sock and $-$ is an empty slot, reserved for the partner of the sock ahead of it) and I pick up a new sock from the basket then I will put it on the second line and so on. Once while doing this I started wondering: what is the probability of filling the first line with $8$ socks before any other line is filled? What about the second line being filled first, and so on? Unfortunately I haven't been able to get anywhere close to a solution. In order to avoid inconvenience I assume I have $8n$ socks, where $n$ is the number of clothing line. My idea was to number the pairs and shuffle the $8n$ numbers, order them in a line and then look at the probability of the first four distinct numbers finding their partner before any other set of four doing it, as we go along the line of shuffled numbers. Unfortunately things start to get complicated and I can't achieve anything. I even thought of calculating the probability of the first line NOT filling first. I set the position of the last sock from the first line to be $n$ and then I try to find all combinations of putting $4$ other pairs between the first and $n-$th place. But the calculation of this number isn't easy and I'm afraid of double counting. Anyway I wrote a computer program and here's what I've got for which number will be filled first for $32$ socks and $4$ lines, running it three times for various amounts of tries: $$

I'm looking for a reference where the stochastic differential $d F(t,X_t)$ is calculated (rigorously!) for random mappings $F$ of the form $(1)$. I'm aware of the following publications: Kunita considers the Brownian framework, i.e. $g=h=0$. There is a recent publication by Karachanskaya covering the SDEs of the form (1) with $h=0$. (Just as a side remark: I believe that the proof of the result is not too complicated (in fact, very similar to the proof of Itô's formula), but quite lengthy, and therefore I would prefer to have a nice reference rather than proving the result on my own.)","['stochastic-processes', 'reference-request', 'probability-theory', 'stochastic-analysis']"
