419908,How to define intrinsic curvature?,"I have been exploring differential geometry slightly... And i'm trying to grasp how to define intrinsic curvature, from a visual/geometric viewpoint... One formulation I got was that Intrinsic curvature can be thought in terms how the $n$-volume of an $N$-sphere in your particular $n$-dimensional space (example: a the area of a circle drawn on a $2$d space) differs from the $n$-volume of a euclidean N-sphere... But here is the big problem I found... That definition is all wonderful and whatnot when talking about the curvature of a certain ""area"" of a surface... Example, If I had a big sphere in $3$ dimensional space. I can start from a point in the sphere... walk $10$ meters off of the point and draw a circle of radius $10$... then measure the area using tiles and compare its ratio to that of a euclidean circle... But as I reduce the radius that I'm measuring... The circle I draw out will get increasingly closer to the area of euclidean circle for the same radius... Clearly the point curvature given this definiton will be $0$... At any given point on a sphere the curvature, by this definition, is equivalent to a flat plane... I can't seem to find a way to define intrinsic curvature now. Anyone care to help?","['multivariable-calculus', 'riemannian-geometry', 'curvature', 'differential-geometry']"

Also, the number of distinct conjugates $aHa^{-1}$ is 1 if $H \trianglelefteq G$.  So we need to consider only the case $|H|=\infty, H \ntrianglelefteq G$.

419952,Is $f(x)=o(x^\alpha)$ for every $\alpha\gt0$ enough to know that $\int_c^x dt/f(t) \sim x/f(x)$?,"Let $f$ be a monotone increasing function $[c,\infty)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$ satisfying $f(x)/x^\alpha\to 0$ for all $\alpha>0$. Is it true that $\int_c^x \frac{dt}{f(t)} \sim \frac{x}{f(x)}$ as $x\to \infty$? This question is inspired by the fact that $\operatorname{li}(x)\sim x/\log x$. It seems to me that on heuristic grounds it should be true: in the case $f(t)=\log t$, what's going on is that $\log$ grows slow enough that it spends ""most of the time"" on the interval $[c,x]$ close to its value at the endpoint.  Thus $t/\log t$ is well-approximated by $t/\log x$ on ""most of"" the interval of integration.  The length of the interval is asymptotically $x$, and this is the explanation, morally anyway. Thus it should be that other functions that grow ""slow enough"" work the same way. And it seems to me (this is extremely unrigorous) that if $f(x)/x^\alpha\to 0,\forall \alpha>0$, that should be ""slow enough"", because $$\int_c^x \frac{dt}{t^\alpha} = \frac{1}{1-\alpha}\cdot \frac{x}{x^\alpha} - \text{const.}$$ and $\frac{1}{1-\alpha}\to 1$ as $\alpha\to 0$. However, I have been unable to satisfy myself with a proper proof. The proof I know in the $f=\log$ case doesn't generalize because it involves the specifics of a particular integration by parts and involves facts like $\text{const.}/\log x\to 0$ that seem likely to be extrinsic to the result to me.

419992,Class of finite groups a Fraïssé Class? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Fraïssé limits and groups (3 answers) Closed 11 years ago . Is the class of finite groups a Fraïssé class? Calling this class $K$, does $K$ satisfy the following: Joint embedding property Amalgamation property Hereditary property: if $G \in K$ and $H \le G$, then $H \in K$) (1) holds because if $G, H \in K$, then $G \times H \in K$ as well. Obviously $G$ and $H$ are both subgroups of $G \times H$. (2) seems to hold. Suppose $G_1, G_2 \in K$, with $H = G_1 \cap G_2$. Then the amalgamated free product $G_1 *_H G_2$ contains both $G_1$ and $G_2$ as subgroups. However, is it true that $G_1 *_H G_2$ is finite? (3) holds because substructures of finite groups are again finite groups. By definition, substructures must contain $0$ and must be closed under the group operation. Furthermore, every element has an inverse, because they all have finite order (you will eventually reach the inverse by multiplying an element by itself successively). Associativity is universal, so also holds. So every substructure is also a (sub)group. Is my reasoning correct? I would appreciate some kind of proof that amalgamated free products of finite groups are also finite, if this is true, or some counterexample if not, because I don't know much about amalgamated free products.","['model-theory', 'logic', 'abstract-algebra', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

So I tried to prove it using $\exp(\ln x)=\ln(\exp(x))=x$. Here is what I've tried so far : $$ \left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right) ^n=e^{n\ln(1+\frac{x}{n})}$$
$$\text{I'll now study just } {n\ln\left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)}.$$$$ \text{If this function has the line }y=x \text{ as oblique asymptote, then the equality is proven.}$$ $$
n\ln\left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right) = n\ln\left(\frac{n+x}{n}\right)$$ $$=n[\ln(n+x)-ln(n)]$$
$$=n\left[\int_1^{n}\frac{dt}{t}+\int_{n}^{x}\frac{dt}{t}-\int_1^{n}\frac{dt}{t}\right]$$
$$=n[\ln(x)-\ln(n)]$$ But I just don't know how to show that this expression has an oblique asymptote $y=x$. I've thought that if there is an oblique asymptote as $n$ goes to infinity, than for a huge $n$, we have : $$\ln\left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)\approx \frac{x}{n}\approx0$$
Which looks correct but we could have any other function $f(x)$, $\ln\left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)\approx\frac{f(x)}{n}\approx 0$. Which doesn't prove the oblique asymptote because $x$ is constant. So how can prove $e^x=\lim \limits_{n\to +\infty } \left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)^n$? And where did I go wrong?","['exponential-function', 'limits', 'calculus', 'analysis']"

420031,Is there a preference between proving a total order (strict vs partial)?,"I know that proving a relation $\mathcal{R}$ to be a strict total order (asymmetric, transitive,and  total ) implies that the relation $S$ defined as $X\mathcal{S} Y \longleftrightarrow (X\mathcal{R}Y\vee X=Y)$ is a total order (antisymmetric, transitive, reflexive, and complete). Conversely, if  a relation $\mathcal{R}$ is a total order then the relation $S$ defined as $X\mathcal{S} Y \longleftrightarrow (X\mathcal{R}Y\wedge  X\neq Y)$ is a strict total order. My perception is that people use to prove a relation to be a total order over proving that a relation is a strict total order. If proving a relation to be a total order automatically implies the other to hold why people don't do it by considering strict total orders? For example in the definition of $\mathbb{N}$ I think it should be the same (even easier) if we prove that it's a totally strict ordered set and then automatically it's a totally order set, but books prefer the other way around. They prove that it's a totally ordered set and then the other option follows automatically.

I am having problems with it. notation: $x_i$ is i-th coordinate of $x$ $B(x,r)$ ball with center $x$ and radius $r$ $S(x,r)$ sphere with center $x$ and radius $r$ $n_y$ in integral it means unit outer normal at point $y$ $dS_y$ standard surface measure with $y$ as integration variable Let $\partial M$ be closed surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Than show that this identity hold
  $$ x_i = \frac{\int_{\partial M} \frac{y_i}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y}{\int_{\partial M} \frac{1}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y} $$
  And let $f$ be continuous function defined only on $\partial M$. Than show that $g$ is continuous in $\overline{M}$. Where $g$ is:
   $$ g(x) = \frac{\int_{\partial M} \frac{f(y)}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y}{\int_{\partial M} \frac{1}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y} $$ Reference where I got this problem. I'm reading this paper where they define function $g$ and they just comment that is continuous because $\frac{1}{\| y-x \|}$ goes to infinity as $y$ approaches $x$. Plus they wrote down those integrals in very funny way which I do not completely understand. I am having problems when the surface $\partial M$(they denote it $P$) is not strictly convex. But that is not that important. Ok so the first identity. It is more convinient to write it in this form: $$  \int_{\partial M} \frac{y_i-x_i}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y = 0$$ Intuitively this part: $n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y$ is $dS_y$ projected onto sphere of unit radius and center $x$
and $\frac{y_i-x_i}{||y-x||}$ is just outer normal of that sphere. So the integral is almost this: $\int_{S(x,1)}n_y dS_y$ which is zero. But problem is that in original integral you run over some places multiple times and even in reverse orientation. The only problem with $g$ is to show that it is continuous on the boundary $\partial M$. So we deal with limit: $$ \lim_{x \rightarrow x_0, x\in M} \frac{\int_{\partial M} \frac{f(y)}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y}{\int_{\partial M} \frac{1}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y} \overset{?}{=} f(x_0) $$ Which we can rewrite as: $$ \lim_{x \rightarrow x_0, x\in M} \frac{\int_{\partial M} \frac{f(y)-f(x_0)}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y}{\int_{\partial M} \frac{1}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y} \overset{?}{=} 0 $$ What I try: For give $\epsilon$ I take $\delta$ that $|x_0-y|<\delta \Rightarrow |f(x_0)-f(y)|<\epsilon$ Then I split the integral: $$\left| \frac{\int_{\partial M\setminus B(x_0,\delta)} \frac{f(y)-f(x_0)}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y + \int_{\partial M \cap B(x_0,\delta)} \frac{f(y)-f(x_0)}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y }{\int_{\partial M} \frac{1}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y} \right| \leq $$ $$  \frac{ \left| \int_{\partial M\setminus B(x_0,\delta)} \frac{f(y)-f(x_0)}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y \right| +  \left|\int_{\partial M \cap B(x_0,\delta)} \frac{f(y)-f(x_0)}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y \right| }{ \left|\int_{\partial M} \frac{1}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y \right|} \leq $$ $$ \frac{ \left| \int_{\partial M\setminus B(x_0,\delta)} \frac{f(y)-f(x_0)}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y \right| }{ \left|\int_{\partial M} \frac{1}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y \right|}  + \epsilon $$ But I can't find any bound for the second part. I'm probably doing it completely wrong. Maybe even this inequality I used is wrong. $$ \frac{  \int_{\partial M \cap B(x_0,\delta)}  \left| \frac{1}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} \right| dS_y  }{ \left|\int_{\partial M} \frac{1}{||y-x||} n_y \cdot \nabla_y \frac{1}{||y-x||} dS_y \right|} \leq 1  $$ The can maybe go something terribly wrong with the surface $\partial M$ so this inequality fails.

420465,Azuma's inequality to McDiarmid's inequality?,"I was going through some notes on concentration inequalities when I noticed that there are two commonly-cited forms of McDiarmid's inequality. Long story short: I know how to prove the weaker one from Azuma's inequality. I also know how to prove the stronger one not directly from Azuma. But is there a way to prove the strong one from Azuma's inequality? In what follows I will assume for simplicity that all differences are bounded by 1. Azuma's inequality: Let $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ and $S_0 = 0$. Let the filtration $\{\mathcal{F}_n\}$ be the usual one defined by $\mathcal{F}_n = \sigma(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$. If $\{S_n\}_{n \geq 0}$ is a martingale and $|X_n| \leq 1$ for all $n$, then for $\lambda>0$, $$P(S_n \geq \lambda) \leq \exp \left(-\frac{\lambda^2}{2n} \right)$$ Now here is the ""weak"" version of McDiarmid's which is an obvious application of Azuma's inequality: McDiarmid's inequality: Suppose $\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_n$ are independent. Let $Z = f(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_n)$. Also, assume that: $$
\Big|\; f(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_k, \ldots, \xi_n) - f(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_k', \ldots, \xi_n) \;\Big| \leq 1$$ for two realizations of the same random variable $\xi_k$ and $\xi_k'$. Then for $\lambda>0$, $$
P(Z-EZ \geq \lambda) \leq \exp \left(-\frac{\lambda^2}{2n} \right) $$ Now the strong version of McDiarmid's inequality has the same setup except that the ""2"" in the denominator is moved up to the numerator, so the bound is:
$$P(Z-EZ \geq \lambda) \leq \exp \left(-\frac{2\lambda^2}{n} \right)$$
Clearly this bound is sharper than the one in the version presented above. I know a proof for this bound but it does not explicitly use Azuma's inequality above. The question: Is it possible to adapt Azuma's inequality to prove this second bound. More specifically, is there a more general form of Azuma's inequality that can be applied to the case of McDiarmid's inequality to yield the tighter bound? Edit: After pondering it over, I now think that it is not possible. Just intuitively, the bounded martingale difference condition in Azuma's inequality seems somehow ""weaker"" than the condition in McDiarmid's inequality, which is a Lipschitz-like condition on the function $f$. So one would expect that using Azuma's inequality would not give the sharpest bound. Edit 2: To shed some more light on this, the proof of the ""weak"" McDiarmid's using Azuma's inequality goes like this. Define $S_n = E(Z \;|\; \xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m) - EZ$. Then $\{S_m\}_{m \geq 1}$ is a martingale. Also, for $m=n$, $S_m = S_n = Z - EZ$. To prove that the martingale differences are bounded, let $\xi_1', \ldots, \xi_n'$ be independent copies of the $\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_n$. Then we have:
$$ E\big[f(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m, \ldots, \xi_n) \;\big|\; \xi_1, \ldots, \xi_{m-1}\big] = E\big[f(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m', \ldots, \xi_n) \;\big|\; \xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m\big] $$
Thus we have:
$$\big|S_m - S_{m-1}\big| \leq E\big[|\, f(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m, \ldots, \xi_n) - f(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m', \ldots, \xi_n)\,| \;\big|\; \xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m\big]$$
So to satisfy the bounded martingale difference in Azuma's inequality, we only need the expectation of the difference of $f(\cdot) - f(\cdot)$ (conditional on $\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m$) to be bounded, whereas the assumption in McDiarmid's is slightly stronger. However, the bounded martingale difference must also hold for all $m$, and in particular for the case of conditioning on $\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_n$. In that case it seems to reduce to assumption. So... it does seem like Azuma's inequality (in this form) is not strong enough. Thoughts?

420597,Problem understanding a proof in Model Categories by Hovey,"I have serious problems understanding this proof from the book Model Categories , by Mark Hovey: Here's a list of things I don't understand: He's trying to prove the assertion by contradiction, by showing that there is a sequence in $f(A)$ (which is compact) with no limit point. Thus he should prove that $S$ is discrete in the subspace topology and is closed as a subset of $f(A)$ (only discreteness wouldn't be sufficient, indeed the sequence $\{1/n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subset\mathbb{R}$ has the discrete topology as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$ and $0$ as a limit point). Hovey claims to have proven discreteness, but I don't seeany proof of closeness. I don't understand why $S$ should have the discrete topology as a subspace of $X_\mu$. Any help in understanding the proof would be gratly appreciated. NOTES: A closed $T_1$ inclusion is defined as an inclusion $f:X\rightarrow Y$ (so, $U\subseteq X$ is open if, and only if, there is some $V\subseteq Y$ such that $f^{-1}(V) = U$) which is also a closed map as such that every point in $Y\backslash f(X)$ is closed.","['general-topology', 'model-categories', 'category-theory']"
420603,How many expected people needed until 3 share a birthday?,"I asked a somewhat related question recently and then became interested in this one: how many people are required, on average, until 3 share a birthday?  More generally, if we have $M$ bins, what is the expected number of balls we must toss before some bin contains exactly 3 balls? The straightforward techniques used in the question cited above seem hard-to-apply here because the number of ways to obtain configurations with 2-balls-or-fewer is quite a bit messier now. Question: what is the expected number of balls needed to obtain a bin with 3 balls in it? To expand a bit on the ""messy"" comment above: the EGF for the number of ways to toss $n$ balls into $M$ bins with no bin containing more than 2 balls is
$$(1+z+z^2/2)^M$$ So, for example, if we have $M=3$ bins, the number of ways for $n$ balls to be arranged (with no bin having more than 2 balls) is found by taking the $n$-th coefficient of 
$$(1+z+z^2/2)^3 = 1/0! + 3 z/1! + 9z^2/2! + 24z^3/3! + 54z^4/4! + 90z^5/5! + 90z^6/6!$$ So if I want the number of 4-letter words from the alphabet $\{a,b,c\}$ where no letter occurs more than twice, it's the coefficient of ${z^4/4!}$ or  54 according to this formula.  We can verify this directly by noticing there are three 4-letter words with all characters the same (aaaa, bbbb, and cccc).  For the words with 3 letters the same and one different, there are 4 ways to choose the position of the different letter, then 3 choices of what that letter is, then 2 choices for the three letters that match.  The total number of 4-letter words is therefore $3^4=81$, so we have $81-3-4\cdot 3\cdot 2 = 54$.  Of course this gets complicated as $M$ increases. How you get from this EGF to an asymptotic estimate of the expectation is beyond me. Note: Byron's answer below settles this.  For anyone interested, this fully generalizes to ""k-wise collisions"" using $$E(M,k) \approx \sqrt[k]{k!}\ \Gamma(1 + 1/k)\ M^{1-1/k}$$ where setting $k=3$ yields the result in Byron's answer below.  Of course this is an asymptotic result and gets better as $M$ increases.  For $M$=365 this formula yields about 82.87, whereas the correct answer is about 88.73891.","['balls-in-bins', 'probability', 'birthday']"

  \begin{array}{l l}
    \mid x \mid & \quad \text{if x $\neq$0}\\\\\\\
    1 & \quad \text {if x=0 }
  \end{array} \right.\]$ now, if we do lower Riemann sum of this function on the interval [-1,1] subdivided into 2 equal intervals,then we will have the partition as {0} such that : -1 < 0 < 1. so,we will do the Riemann lower sum as : f(-1) (1) + f(1) (1) = 2 it can also be taken as : f(0) (1) + f(0) (1) =2 or f(-1) (1) + f(0) (1) =2 or f(0) (1) + f(1) (1) =2 (as the infimum of f(x) in all these cases will be 1 for f(1),f(-1),f(0), so they can be written either way) But then i came across the statement ""The lower sum with respect to this partition, on the other hand, is truly zero.Therefore this particular lower sum can not be a Riemann sum."" Why is it ""0""??? having that said,i also saw that the supremum of f(x) between these 2 subintervals is also ""1"" . Thus the infimum and supremum is the same for the function. Is that possible??? I guess its not possible. My question is whats the difference between a ""lower sum"" and a ""Riemann lower sum"" and why a continuous bounded function only has Riemann upper and lower sums??? [i know the fact that a continuous bounded function will have a max and min in all the subintervals it is divided into, but how to relate this fact with it being Riemann upper and lower sums???).

420631,What is the catch in this geometrical/number theory question?,"Here is a simple geometrical construction: $CA \perp x$ and $DE \perp OC$ As a result: $\bigtriangleup CDE \cong \bigtriangleup CAO$ , because $\angle CDE=\angle CAO=\frac{\pi }{2}$ and $\angle ECD$ is common. This means: $$\frac{ED}{AO}=\frac{CD}{CA}=\frac{EC}{OC}$$ Or $$\frac{ED}{AO}=\frac{CO-AO}{CA}=\frac{EC}{OC}$$ because $AO=DO$ . Obviously, $EC<CA<OC$ , as a result: $$CO-AO<EC$$ Also, if $\alpha \to 0$ , where $\cos(\alpha)=\frac{AO}{CO}$ , then $CA \to 0$ and $EC \to 0$ as well. Now, if we take $CO=BO=\sqrt{p_{n+1}}$ and $DO=AO=\sqrt{p_{n}}$ , square roots of the two consecutive primes, we obtain: $$\sqrt{p_{n+1}} - \sqrt{p_{n}} < EC$$ Because $$\lim_{n \to \infty }\frac{\sqrt{p_{n}}}{\sqrt{p_{n+1}}}=1$$ which seems to be true from ( Limit inferior of the quotient of two consecutive primes ), we have $$\cos\left ( \alpha  \right )=\frac{\sqrt{p_{n}}}{\sqrt{p_{n+1}}}\rightarrow 1, n \to \infty $$ which means $\alpha \to 0$ and as a result $EC \to 0$ . So $$\sqrt{p_{n+1}} - \sqrt{p_{n}} \to 0$$ which is inline with my previous invstigations http://rtybase.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/tackling-andricas-conjecture-part-3.html . In a way, this proves Andrica's conjecture ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrica%27s_conjecture ), unless there is a catch. The problem arises when substituting $CO=BO=p_{n+1}$ and $DO=AO=p_{n}$ $$p_{n+1} - p_{n} < EC$$ $$\lim_{n \to \infty }\frac{p_{n}}{p_{n+1}}=1$$ But then $$p_{n+1} - p_{n} \to 0$$ is simply false. Where is the catch? Remark: because $p_{n+1}<2 \cdot p_{n}$ , $\frac{p_{n}}{p_{n+1}} > \frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sqrt{p_{n}}}{\sqrt{p_{n+1}}}>\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ these impose some bounds on $\alpha$ , like $0< \alpha <\frac{\pi }{3}$ for the first case and $0< \alpha <\frac{\pi }{4}$ for the second.","['prime-numbers', 'geometry', 'elementary-number-theory']"
420642,Complex Analysis Question from Stein,"The question is #$14$ from Chapter $2$ in Stein and Shakarchi's text Complex Analysis : Suppose that $f$ is holomorphic in an open set containing the closed unit disc, except for a pole at $z_0$ on the unit circle. Show that if $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nz^n$$ denotes the power series expansion $f$ in the open unit disc, then $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}=z_0.$$ I've shown that we can take $z_0=1$ without a loss of generality, but I'm having trouble showing the proof otherwise. One of the problems I'm having is because we aren't told the definition of a pole except that it is a place where the function isn't holomorphic. Disregarding this fact, the other problem I'm running into is that I don't know the order of the pole. Making some additional assumptions, including that the pole is simple so we can write $F(z)=(z-1)f(z)$ as a holomorphic function, we see that $$F(z)=-a_0+z(a_0-a_1)+z^2(a_1-a_2)+\cdots$$ This almost gets me to the end with these added assumptions, but I don't think it's quite enough (why do we know some of the $a_i$'s aren't $0$, for example). On another note, if we know $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}$ exists, then it is easy to see that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{|a_n|}{|a_{n+1}|}=1=|z_0|$; I, however, do not see why the limit must exist. Are there any hints that someone can provide? Even a solution would be nice, especially if one can avoid making any assumptions about what a pole is or is not. EDIT : So there isn't any confusion, I know the definition of a pole and I'm inclined to believe that the problem, as stated, necessarily has a pole at $z_0$. The problem is that the exercise is in Chapter $2$, and poles are introduced in Chapter $3$.",['complex-analysis']

420884,"If $(|G|, |H|) > 1$, does it follow that $\operatorname{Aut}(G \times H) \neq \operatorname{Aut}(G) \times \operatorname{Aut}(H)$?","Let $G$ and $H$ be finite groups. If $|G|$ and $|H|$ are coprime, then $$\operatorname{Aut}(G \times H) \cong \operatorname{Aut}(G) \times \operatorname{Aut}(H)$$ holds. What about when $(|G|, |H|) > 1$? In this case we know that $\operatorname{Aut}(G) \times \operatorname{Aut}(H)$ is contained in $\operatorname{Aut}(G \times H)$, but the isomorphism above might not hold. For example $\operatorname{Aut}(C_2 \times C_2)$ has order $6$ but $\operatorname{Aut}(C_2) \times \operatorname{Aut}(C_2)$ is  trivial. Is the isomorphism possible at all when $(|G|, |H|) > 1$?","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
420965,How does one obtain the Jordan normal form of a matrix $A$ by studying $XI-A$?,"In our lecture notes, there's the following example problem. Find a Jordan normal form matrix that is similar to the following. $$A=\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 & 0 & 0\\-1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\0 & -1 & 0 & -1\\1 & 1 & 1 & 2\end{bmatrix}$$ The solution begins by demonstrating that the matrix $XI-A$ is equivalent to a matrix of the form $$B=\begin{bmatrix}-1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & -(X-1) & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & (X-2)(X-1)^2\end{bmatrix}$$ From here, the notes immediately deduce that the Jordan normal form of $A$ is $$J=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 2\end{bmatrix}.$$ I'm struggling to understand this final step - how do we get from $B$ to $J$?

420989,How to determine the starting values for linear multistep methods?,"I am so confused with how to determine the starting values for linear multistep methods.

And the case is that the exact solution is already known. So my question is that: for common cases, how to determine the starting values?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'numerical-methods']"
420991,manifold diffeomorphic (?) to SO(3),"Consider the set of all pairs $(\boldsymbol{n},\boldsymbol{v})$ of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $\boldsymbol{n}$ is a vector on the unit sphere centered at the origin and $\boldsymbol{v}$ is a unit vector tangent to the sphere at the point $\boldsymbol{n}.$ i. Introduce a structure of smooth manifold on this set. ii. Prove that this manifold is diffeomorphic to the group $SO(3).$ To my understanding, this manifold is $S^2 \times S^1,$ which gives a parametrization of $SO(3),$

$$= \lim_{m\to0} {{((x+m)\times 10^9 - 2^{\log_{10} (x+m)\times 10^9}) - (x\times 10^9 - 2^{\log_{10} x\times 10^9})} \over m}$$

\pi_{21}^{x_{21}}(1-\pi_{11}-\pi_{12}-\pi_{21})^{x_{22}}
$$ Obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. I have tried this by the following way: the likelihood function is \begin{align}
L & =L(\pi_{11},\pi_{12},\pi_{21},(1-\pi_{11}-\pi_{12}-\pi_{21})) \\[8pt]
& =\prod_{i=1}^{50}[\pi_{11}^{x_{11}} \pi_{12}^{x_{12}}
\pi_{21}^{x_{21}}(1-\pi_{11}-\pi_{12}-\pi_{21})^{x_{22}}] \\[8pt]

\pi_{21}^{x_{21}}(1-\pi_{11}-\pi_{12}-\pi_{21})^{x_{22}}]^{50} \\[8pt]

\pi_{21}^{2}(1-\pi_{11}-\pi_{12}-\pi_{21})^{1}]^{50} \\[8pt]
& =\pi_{11}^{2250}\pi_{12}^{100}
\pi_{21}^{100}(1-\pi_{11}-\pi_{12}-\pi_{21})^{50}

L^*& =\log L=\log \left[\pi_{11}^{2250} \pi_{12}^{100}
\pi_{21}^{100}(1-\pi_{11}-\pi_{12}-\pi_{21})^{50}\right] \\[8pt]
