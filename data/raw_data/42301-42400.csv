418693,Need explanation of passage about Lebesgue/Bochner space,"From a book: Let $V$ be Banach and $g \in L^2(0,T;V')$. For every $v \in V$, it holds that
  $$\langle g(t), v \rangle_{V',V} = 0\tag{1}$$
  for almost every $t \in [0,T]$. What I don't understand is the following: This is equivalent to $$\langle g(t), v(t) \rangle_{V',V} = 0\tag{2}$$ for all $v \in L^2(0,T;V)$ and for almost every $t \in [0,T]$. OK, so if $v \in L^2(0,T;V)$, $v(t) \in V$, so (2) follows from (1). How about the reverse? Also is my reasoning really right? I am worried about the ""for almost every $t$ part of these statements, it confuses me whether I am thinking correctly. Edit for the bounty : as Tomas' comment below, is the null set where (1) and (2) are non-zero the same for every $v$? If not, is this a problem?

I know a few topics about Calculus due to my own interest in the topic, but they've been entirely self-taught and no formal lecturing about them ( maybe this will hold me back?).  I seem to understand this part of the book without too much difficulty, but should I first complete a Calculus course before moving on with the book and gather a firm background, or is it not needed?

418902,Maximum likelihood estimation and efficiency,"Let $X_1, ..., X_n$ be independent observations of a random variable $X$ that has with probability $p$ the distribution $\mathcal{U}[0,a]$ and with probability $1-p$ the distrbiution $\mathcal{U}[0,b]$ where $a$ and $b$ are known with $a<b$. What is the maximum-likelihood estimator for $p$? Is that estimator efficient? (This means, is the Cramér–Rao bound achieved?) I'm having quite some trouble with this task for several hours now. I think the density of $X$ is given by $$f_X(x) = p \frac{1}{a}1_{[0,a]}(x) + (1-p) \frac{1}{b}1_{[0,b]}(x).$$ For the trivial case $n=1$ this gives $\hat{p}=1_{[0,a]}(x_1)$ where the expected value of $X_1$ is $a/b$. So the estimator is in fact biased. So this doesn't really help with the second task. I can't even figure out the general likelihood function. I think it should be something like $L(p) = (p \frac{1}{a})^k ... + ((1-p) \frac{1}{b})^m ...$ where $k$ denotes the number of values from the sample $x_1, ..., x_n$ where $x_i\le a$ and $m=n-k$. But I don't understand how to deal with the indicator functions and if maybe I have to add a factor like with the binomial distribution. However, I took the raw form $L(p) = (p \frac{1}{a})^k + ((1-p) \frac{1}{b})^{(n-k)}$, $k$ like explained above and tried to maximize by using the log-likelihood. But from that I got $\hat p = \frac{an-bN}{an-bn}$ which doesn't strike me as correct as because of $a<b$ it's negative for small $N$. Nonetheless, I tried to calculate the Fisher information and compared it's inverse to the variance of $\hat p$ - I wasn't very surprised not to get an equality... Could be that I messed up some calculations, too - dealing with the derivatives of the log-likelihood was a little messy. Now I'm rather frustrated. Can anyone show me how to solve this?",['statistics']
418939,"Confused by $\Re(z)$ and closed contours, why isn't it the integral 0?","Let the contour $\gamma$ be the triangle with vertices $\ 0, 1, 1+i $, taken anticlockwise.

However, how are you meant to evaluate $$\oint \Re(z) \ dz$$ As it's not analytic inside the contour, I split the triangle into three parametrised lines: $$\gamma_1: t\quad 0\le t\le 1 \\

418945,Cholesky decomposition in positive semi-definite matrix,"While trying to apply the algorithm described in the article: Robust adaptative metropolis algorithm with coerced acceptance rate (2011), Matti Vihola I used the a Cholesky decomposition to find $S_n$: $S_n S_n^T = S_{n-1} D_n S_{n-1}^T$ The article ensures that the (known) matrix in the right hand side will always be positive definite. However, after a lot of iterations, it seems that floating point imprecision is causing it to be only positive semi-definite. I would like to know if it is possible (and how?) to get $S_n$ using a robust Cholesky decomposition of a matrix with pivoting which works when standard Cholesky fails. The problem is when using it, the result is obviously not the $S_n$ matrix, but rather an $X_n$ of the form: $P^T X_n Y X_n^T P = S_{n-1} D_n S_{n-1}^T$ From what @J.M. has said here , it seems possible: The Cholesky decomposition might fail in floating point when given a
  symmetric positive semidefinite matrix. However, one can modify
  Cholesky to do symmetric pivoting so that the matrix is factored for
  ""as long as the matrix seems positive definite"". You'll have to modify
  your Kalman formula if you adopt this, though. So, it seems that I need to do some algebra here to get $S_n$, I just don't know how since I'm pretty n00b in such subject.","['positive-semidefinite', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'cholesky-decomposition']"

418954,solvable subalgebra,"I want to show that a set $B\subset L$ is a maximal solvable subalgebra. With $L = \mathscr{o}(8,F)$, $F$ and algebraically closed field, and $\operatorname{char}(F)=0$ and 
$$B= \left\{\begin{pmatrix}p&q\\0&s \end{pmatrix}\mid p \textrm{ upper triangular, }q,s\in\mathscr{gl}(4,F)\textrm{ and }p^t=-s, q^t=-q\right\}.$$ $B$ is a subalgebra by construction. So my problem now is how I can show that it is maximal solvable. I tried the approach by '$L$ solvable $\Leftrightarrow$ $[L,L]$ nilpotent'. I am not sure how good this idea is, but here what I have: $[B,B]= span\{[x,y]\mid x,y\in B\}$. So $x$ and $y$ are matrices of the form above.
That means, that for the '$p$-part' we see already that it is nilpotent. Since with each multiplication there is one more zero-diagonal. But how can I show now, that we will also get rid of the $q$ and $s$ part? I tried to look at $[x,y] = xy-yx = \begin{pmatrix}\bigtriangledown&*\\0&ss' \end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}\bigtriangledown&*\\ 0&s's \end{pmatrix}$ (with $\bigtriangledown$ any upper triangle matrix minus one diagonal, $s$ the part in the $x$ matrix and $s'$ in the $y$ matrix). (Sorry for the chaotic notation. I don't realy know how to write it easier..) Is this a beginning where I should go on with? Or does someone have a hint how to approach this problem?

418965,Contour integral of $\sqrt{z^2-1}$ on $|z| = 2$,"I've been wrestling with this problem (available here ): Evaluate the integral of $f(z) = \sqrt{z^2-1}$ around the circle $\{z: |z| = 2\}$, where the branch of the square root function is chosen so that $\sqrt{2^2-1} > 0$. I came up with the answer
$$\int\limits_{|z| = 2} \sqrt{z^2-1} dz = \pi i$$
using the following argument, which seems a little like voodoo to me. You notice that there are two points, at $z \pm 1$, where you might have to pick a branch of $log()$ to define the square root. Then, I convinced myself that as long as you exclude from your domain the real interval $-1 \le x \le 1$, the function $f(z)$ can be continuously defined (maybe the two branches somehow cancel?), and so is analytic on its domain. Therefore you can shrink the contour of integration continuously using the Cauchy Closed Curve Integral Theorem, so that you wind up reducing it to the real integral
$$2\int_{-1}^1 \sqrt{x^2-1} dx = \pi i$$ I'm not really sure the answer is correct, and I'm even less certain about the way I got it. I had a hard time convincing myself that $\sqrt{z^2-1}$ was not multi-valued on the domain. To try to get at that I tried $\sqrt{z^2-1} = \sqrt{z+1} \sqrt{z-1}$ and reasoned that the product makes the discontinuity disappear, using
$$e^{\frac{\pi}{2}i}\cdot e^{\frac{\pi}{2}i} = -1 = e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}i}\cdot e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}i} $$
for the different branches of $log()$ you can choose. I'd appreciate any input that would help me get a a better way to look at this. Thanks! EDIT An attempt to use the Residue at infinity: By substituting $z = 1/w$ you get
\begin{eqnarray}
\int\limits_{|z| = 2} \sqrt{z^2-1} dz &=& \int\limits_{|w| = 1/2} \frac{1}{w^2}\sqrt{\frac{1}{w^2}-1} dw \\
&=& \int\limits_{|w| = 1/2} \frac{1}{w^2}\sqrt{\frac{1-w^2}{w^2}} dw \\
&=& \int\limits_{|w| = 1/2} \frac{1}{w^3}\sqrt{1-w^2} dw
\end{eqnarray}
The integrand is analytic in $|w| \le 1/2$ except at $w = 0$, so we can apply the Residue Theorem. Near $w = 0$, $\sqrt{1-w^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{2}w^2 + \dots$, so the residue of $\frac{1}{w^3}\sqrt{1-w^2} $ at $w = 0$ is $-\frac{1}{2}$. Then the integral is
$$\int\limits_{|z| = 2} \sqrt{z^2-1} dz = 2\pi i \cdot (-1/2) = -\pi i$$","['branch-cuts', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"

419035,smooth approximate parameterization to polygonal boundary,"I can ""almost"" parameterize the boundary of a square using
$${\bf r}(t) = (\cos t)^{1/p} {\bf i} + (\sin t)^{1/p} {\bf j},$$
$0\leq t\leq 2 \pi$, and $p$ is odd. This parameterization is smooth (or at least $C^1$), and of course is the unit ball in the $L^p$ norm. Letting $p\rightarrow \infty$ makes our approximation better. Now suppose I have a triangle, or in general, a convex polygon with vertices $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. Is there some relatively simple, explicit smooth approximate parameterization of the boundary? It should, of course, have some tweakable parameter that allows for convergence, like $p$ in the example I gave. The simpler, and the ""cuter"", the better. Another issue is the following. With my parameterization of the square, if I want to get a list of roughly equally distributed points on the boundary, I cannot do this by letting $t=2 \pi i/N$.

Why is this? And related to that: why then is $S = \{a + b\sqrt{2} : a, b \in \Bbb{Z}\}$ closed under multiplication? I figured the following, but I'm totally unsure about the correctness:
A multiplication on two numbers of $S$ looks like this: $(\Bbb{Z} + \Bbb{Z}\sqrt{2}) \cdot (\Bbb{Z} + \Bbb{Z}\sqrt{2})$ is of the form $\Bbb{Z}² + 2\Bbb{Z}\Bbb{Z}\sqrt{2} + 2\Bbb{Z}$. Because any $\Bbb{Z}^2$ yields an integer, $2\Bbb{Z}$ yields an integer as well and $2\Bbb{Z}\Bbb{Z}\sqrt{2}$ yields an $\Bbb{Z}\sqrt{2}$, the result can again be expressed as $a + b\sqrt{2} : a, b \in \Bbb{Z}$ and therefore the set is closed under multiplication.
