1932285,Vector Space and Column Space of linear models?,"I've started reading a book on linear models, and it turns out there's a lot of linear algebra (which I'm a bit weak in). There were two exercises that I think might be simple, but I don't know if I'm doing right. (1) You are given that $X$ is an $(n \times p)$ matrix and $b ∈ R^p$. Prove that the linear model $y =Xb ∈ R^n$ satisfies the conditions of a vector space. (2) For a linear model $y = Xb$, is the origin 0 in the column space $C(X)$? Why or why not? OK, so for (1) I think what I need to do is show that for any two vectors that are in $y$, then the addition of those two vectors are also in $y$ (addition rule). The other condition I think, is that for any scalar $q$ in $R^n$, then $qy$ must also be in $y$. If I have this right, can someone show me how I go about proving this? My current answer seemed a little simple, which is why I doubt it. For (2), it actually confuses me. I thought the column space referred to all possible linear combinations of the columns of $X$ where the scalars which multiply each column is nonzero. So by definition, I thought you can't have the zero vector be in the column space of $X$? Seems a little weird to me, unless I'm missing something obvious.

Assume that $A$ is normalized, then we can find (by Gram-Schmidt) an ONB of all skew-Hermitian matrices with zero trace including $A$ . So $A,M_1,...,M_{n^2-2}$ form an ONB of the vector space of skew-Hermitian matrices with zero trace. Question: Is there now a matrix $B^*=-B$ that does not commute with $A$ but with all other matrices of the ONB? Or if that is impossible, is there at least a matrix that is somehow good, in the sense that it does not commute with $A$ but with many other matrices of the ONB?

More specifically, I have to find a $q$ in $A$ such that $q$ is larger than any $p$ in $A$. The only thing I can think of is using (${2 - {p^2}}$) somehow, or ${(p+x)^2}<2$, but other than that I don't know how to proceed. This exercise is taken from the very first chapter of Walter Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis . Quoting the exercise: To do this, we associate with each rational $p > 0$ the number: $$q = p - \frac{{{p^2} - 2}}{{p + 2}} = \frac{{2p + 2}}{{p + 2}}$$ But he didn't explain how he came up with that number.

$$ Where $X$ and $r$ and $p$ are constants, with $X \geq r$, and $ 0 \leq p \leq 1.$ How did I get there? Well, this is the story: Consider a sequence of independent binomial trials, each one producing the result success or failure, with probabilities $p$, and $1-p$, respectively.
Let $x$ be the total number of trials which must be carried out in order to attain exactly $r$ successes. Knowing that the probability mass function for this Negative Binomial Distribution is as follows, $P(x=X)=\binom{X-1}{r-1}p^r(1-p)^{X-r}$, (for $X \geq r$), I was trying to prove the following about the corresponding Cumulative Distribution Function. $P(x \leq X)=\sum_{x=r}^{x=X}\binom{x-1}{r-1}p^r(1-p)^{x-r}=1-\sum_{x=0}^{x=r-1}\binom{X}{x}p^x(1-p)^{X-x}$ I started out with the following: $\sum_{x=r}^{\infty}\binom{x-1}{r-1}p^r(1-p)^{x-r}=1$, which can be recast as below. (Relation I) $\sum_{x=r}^{x=X}\binom{x-1}{r-1}p^r(1-p)^{x-r}+\sum_{x=X+1}^{\infty}\binom{x-1}{r-1}p^r(1-p)^{x-r}=1$ In addition, from binomial theorem, we have: $\left ( p+(1-p) \right )^X=\sum_{x=0}^{x=X}\binom{X}{x}p^x(1-p)^{X-x}=1$ Which can be restated in Relation II as below. $\sum_{x=0}^{x=r-1}\binom{X}{x}p^x(1-p)^{X-x}+\sum_{x=r}^{x=X}\binom{X}{x}p^x(1-p)^{X-x}=1$ Comparing the relations I and II with the expression for the CDF, the proof boils down to verification of the following: $\sum_{x=r}^{x=X}\binom{x-1}{r-1}p^r(1-p)^{x-r}=\sum_{x=r}^{x=X}\binom{X}{x}p^x(1-p)^{X-x}$ Any idea how to continue form this point onward?

What I have done: Consider $p(x)=2x^3+px^2+(-3-5i)x+q=0$ Since $x=i$ , $x=\frac{1}{k}$ and $x=-1-k$ are roots we will try subbing them in and seperating imaginary and real parts and solving simultaneously hopefully!

$$A_{n+2}=A_{n}A_{n+1}\Longrightarrow \ln{A_{n+2}}=\ln{A_{n}}+\ln{A_{n+1}}$$

where $f_{n}$ be the Fibonacci sequece,which satisfies $f_{1}=f_{2}=1,f_{n}=f_{n-1}+f_{n-2}$ for $B_{n}$ It is difficult to handle, even for a general term If we choose to use mathematical induction (1):if  $n=1$ since
$$B_{3}=k^3+1,\Longrightarrow B_{4}=\dfrac{(k^3+1)^3+1}{k}$$
so we have
$$A_{2}B_{4}=(k^3+1)^3+1$$ is integer if $n=2$,we have
$$B_{5}=\dfrac{B^3_{4}+1}{B_{4}}=\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{(k^3+1)^3+1}{k}\right)^3+1}{k^3+1}=\dfrac{((k^3+1)^3+1)^3+k^3}{(k^3+1)k^3}$$

Customer B spends 2000 and is refunded 100, which is 5%. By the first interpretation, the average refund would be $(10\% + 5\%)/2 = 7.5\%$. For the second interpretation, we compute the total expenses ($500 + 2000 = 2500$) and the total refunds ($50 + 100 = 150$), which is $6\%$ of the total cost, so this value could also be interpreted as the average refund.

1932991,Catalan number and Cayley distance inequality in permutation group,"Problem statement This is the part that I think is analytically tractable. The Cayley distance of element $g_1$ to $g_2$ is the smallest number of transposition that transforms $g_1$ to $g_2$. It is left and right invariant, so
\begin{equation}
d( g_1, g_2) = d( I, g_1^{-1} g_2 ) = d( I, g_2 g_1^{-1} ) 
\end{equation}
The distance to the identity element is just $ n$ minus the number of cycles in the cycle notation. By definition, the distance satisfies triangle inequality
\begin{equation}
d( g_1, g_2 ) + d( g_1, g_3 ) \ge d( g_2, g_3 )
\end{equation}
In particular,
\begin{equation}
d( I, g ) + d( I, \tau g ) \ge d( g, \tau g ) = d( I, \tau) 
\end{equation} Now for a fixed element $\tau = (123\cdots n )$, I want to find the number of elements $a_n$(in terms of $n$) that saturate the triangle inequality,
\begin{equation}
a_n = \text{Cardinality}\{ g \in S_n |  d( I, g) + d( I, \tau g ) = d( I, \tau) = n - 1 \}
\end{equation} For the first few $n$, $a_{2} = 2, a_3 = 5, a_4 = 14$. UPDATE As @san pointed out, $a_n$ is likely to be the Catalan number . So I checked it numerically using sage: up to $n = 10$ $a_n$ agrees with the Catalan number! \begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
a_2 &= 2,\quad  a_3 = 5, \quad a_4 = 14,\quad a_5 = 42,\quad a_6 = 132, \\
a_7 &= 429, \quad a_8 = 1430,\quad a_9 = 4862,\quad a_{10} = 16796
\end{aligned}
\end{equation} Moreover, its derivative is the wanted $\frac{1}{2}$,
\begin{equation}
\partial_n \frac{2n!}{n!(n+1)!}\Big|_{n = 1}  = \partial_n \frac{1}{n(n+1) B( n, n+ 1)}\Big|_{n = 1} = \frac{1}{2}
\end{equation} So I think this is should be an accurate guess, and we shall seek for a proof. @san suggested to prove
\begin{equation}
a_{n, n-k} = \text{Cardinality}\{g \in S_n | d( I, g ) = n-k, d( I, \tau g ) = k - 1 \} = \frac{1}{k} {n \choose k - 1 } {n - 1 \choose k-1}
\end{equation} such that
\begin{equation}
a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{n, n-k} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} {n \choose k - 1 } {n - 1 \choose k-1} = \frac{2n!}{n! (n+1)!} = C_n
\end{equation} Perhaps a recursive route to prove
\begin{equation}
a_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_{i} a_{n-1-i}
\end{equation}
is possible. If $g$ can be decomposed as a permutation of the first $k$ elements $g_1$ and permutation of the rest $n-k$ elements $g_2$, then set $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ to be the shift operation in these corresponding smaller permutation groups, we have
\begin{equation}
d(I, g ) + d(I, \tau g ) =  d(I, g_1) + d( I, \tau_1 g_1) + d(I, g_2) + d(I, \tau_2 g_2 ) + 1 \le k-1 + n-k-1 + 1 = n-1
\end{equation}
The only way to saturate the bound is that both $g_1$ and $g_2$ staturate the bound in the smaller permutation group, hence in for these $g$ the top coefficient is $a_k a_{n-k}$. But obviously chosing different pivot $k$ overcounts, so I still can not construct a recursive formula relating $a_n$ and $\sum_k a_k a_{n-k}$. Original post: a more general problem I was looking for the analytic expression(need to take derivative latter) of following polynomial 
\begin{equation}
f_n(x, y) = \sum_{g \in S_n} x^{\chi(g)} y^{\chi( \tau g )}
\end{equation}
where $g$ is taken from the permutation group $S_n$, the exponent $\chi(g)$ are number of cycles in the cycle notation of $g$, and $\tau$ is a fixed element in $S_n$: $\tau = (123\cdots n )$, i.e. it puts $1$ in the end and shift each letter forward. Maybe it should not be called generating function but I don't have a proper name for it. A few example will clarity the definition. When $n = 4$, taking $g = (12)(3)(4)$, there are 3 cycles(including the cycle of length 1), so $\chi( g ) = 3$. On the other hand, 
\begin{equation}
\tau g = (1234) \cdot (12) (3)(4) = (134)(2) 
\end{equation}
so $\chi( \tau g ) = 2$, the corresponding monomial of $g$ is $x^3 y^2$. Summing over the monomials of all the elements of $S_n$ gives $f_n(x, y)$. I have computed the case of $n = 2,3,4$, the results are
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
f_2(x,y) &= x^2 y + x y^2 \\ 
f_3(x,y) &= x^3 y + 3x^2 y^2 + x y^3 + xy \\ 
f_4(x,y) &= x^4 y + 6 x^3 y^2 + 6x^2 y^3 + x y^4 + 5 x^2 y + 5 x y^2 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation} It would be ideal to have the analytic expression of all the coefficients, but I'm mostly interested in the coefficient of highest power of $f_n(x,x)$
\begin{equation}
f_n(x,x) = a_{n} x^{n+1} + \cdots 
\end{equation}
I'd like to obtain the analytic expression of $a_n$, which is the same $a_n$ in the problem statement. $\chi(g)$ and Cayley distance I read a relevant post about number of cycles and learned that the function $\chi(g)$ is related to the Cayley distance
\begin{equation}
d( I, g ) = n - \chi( g ) 
\end{equation} The power of $x$ in $f_n(x,x)$ is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\chi( g) + \chi(\tau g )  &= 2n - d( I, g ) - d( I, \tau g ) \\
&\le 2n - d( g, \tau g ) = 2n - d( I, g^{-1} \tau g ) \\
&= 2n - d(I, \tau) = n + \chi(\tau)  = n +1 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
so the coefficients $a_n$ is just the number of elements that saturate the Cayley distance triangle inequality
\begin{equation}
d( I, g ) + d( I , \tau g ) = d( I, g^{-1} \tau g ) = n - 1
\end{equation} Generating function From this MO post , there is a nice formula for $f_n( x, 1 )$, which is
\begin{equation}
f_n( x, 1 ) = \sum_{g\in S_n} x^{\chi(g )}  = \prod_{k=1}^{n-1} (x + k )
\end{equation}
and there is a nice bijective proof here EDIT I obtained through an independent non-rigorous approach that $\partial_n a_n\Big|_{n=1} = \frac{1}{2}$, but I still do no know the analytic expression for $a_n$","['permutations', 'combinatorics', 'catalan-numbers', 'generating-functions']"

What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at $1$ or $89$. Why is this true?","['number-systems', 'sequences-and-series', 'elementary-number-theory']"

1933436,Treating dy/dx as a symbol for the derivative as opposed to a fraction of the differentials dy and dx,"I have some questions in solving the seperable differential equation $dy/dx=x/y$.  But first I'll explain what I understand about the problem and how it relates to the differentials $dy$ and $dx$.  Correct me if I am wrong. I understand that we define a dependent variable $dy=dy/dx*dx$ where $dy/dx$ is the single symbol representing the derivative and $dx$ is an independent variable that can be chosen freely.  By solving this equation for $dy/dx$ (the derivative) we get $dy/dx$ (the fraction).  This allows us to freely choose any expression for $dx$ and by definition we will get the exact expression for $dy$ so that $dy/dx$ (the fraction) is the same as the single symbol $dy/dx$ (the derivative). In textbooks we seem to skip the justification above and immediately interpret the single symbol $dy/dx$ as fraction in certain situation. Questions... 1)  Why don't we at least say... ""hey... by our study on differentials in an earlier section... we will interpret $dy/dx$ as a fraction in this next step""? This was always so confusing to me in school when we applied it without saying anything. I didn't understand why there was cancellation.  I do now.  In any case, it does makes sense to me now that the variables cancel and we're left with $y*dy = x*dx$ where $dx$ and $dy$ are variables. 2) So now we are ready to integrate both sides.  But what are we integrating with respect to if both $dy$ and $dx$ are just variables?  It seems that we are treating them differently again, but what's the justification? If if there is some why don't we state it anywhere? 3)  Wouldn't it make more sense to solve the problem this way.  Multiply both of $dy/dx=x/y$ by y only.  This will yield the equation $y*dy/dx=x$.  Then we can integrate both side with respect to x, applying the chain rule on the left side? I know we get the same result by separating the $dx$ and the $dy$ on different sides...and then treating $dx$ and $dy$ as the the part of the integral that tells us which variable we are integrating with respect to... But this seems fuzzy to me as they are really variables. Isn't (3) more technically correct?","['derivatives', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

we set $u = \frac{1}{x} \implies du = \frac{-1}{x^2} dx.$ However, I am

The Kullback–Leibler divergence is additive for independent distributions in much the same way as Shannon entropy. If ${P_{1},P_{2}} $ are independent distributions, with the joint distribution  $P(x,y)=P_{1}(x)P_{2}(y)$ , and $Q,Q_{1},Q_{2}$ likewise, then $D_{KL}(P||Q)=D_{KL}(P_1||Q_1)+D_{KL}(P_2||Q_2)$ If I split up the $log$ in the definition I get the following

Now suppose that $ds^2$ is the standard bilinear form of $\mathbb{R}^n$, then we can write $ds^2=\sum_{i=1}^ndx_i\otimes dx_i$ and it's such that, given the tangent vector $v=\sum_{j=1}^nv_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}$, $ds^2(v,v)=\sum_{i=1}^ndx_i(\sum_{j=1}^nv_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j})\otimes dx_i(\sum_{j=1}^nv_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j})=\sum_{i=1}^nv_i^2$.

A naive approach is to try to use the mean value inequality: For that we need to show the norm $\|d(\sqrt{\cdot})_A\|$ is bounded for $\|A\|$ large enough. We know the derivative satisfies: $$d(\sqrt{\cdot})_A(B) \cdot \sqrt{A} + \sqrt{A} \cdot (\sqrt{\cdot})_A(B)=B$$ for every $B \in \operatorname{sym}_n$.

$$ The equation is derived by my guess that for all $k \geq 1$
$$
\frac{d^k}{dx^k} \arcsin(x) = \frac{1}{\left(1-x^2\right)^{k+\frac{1}{2}}} P_k(x)
$$
Where $P_k(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $k-1$.
(I suppose that you can prove it by induction). Is there a way you can suggest me to solve that equation? The purpose would be basically find all the coefficients of $P_k$ for given $k$. Update : Attempt I made I think I've derived a recurrence relationship for $P_k(x)$ Let's consider the relationship $$
\left(2k - 1\right)xP_{k-1}(x) + (1-x^2)\frac{d}{dx}P_{k-1}(x) = P_{k}(x)
$$ Let's express
$$
P_k(x)= \sum_{j=-\infty}^{+\infty}a_{j,k}x^j, \;\; a_{j,k}=0 \;\; \forall j < 0, j > k - 1
$$
Substituing in recurrence we get
$$
\sum_{j=-\infty}^{+\infty} \left[ \left(2k -j\right)a_{j-1,k-1} + \left(j+1 \right)a_{j+1,k-1}\right]x^j = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{+\infty}a_{j,k}x^j
$$
To be equal the two polynomial it must be verified that
$$
\left(2k -j\right)a_{j-1,k-1} + \left(j+1 \right)a_{j+1,k-1} = a_{j,k}
$$ What puzzles me in the relantionship above is that the $j$-th coefficient of $P_k$ depends from the coefficient $j+1$-th of $P_{k-1}$ do you think there's some mistakes in my derivation? I used series instead of summation because it makes easier to handle boundary conditions.","['recurrence-relations', 'polynomials', 'calculus', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'analysis']"

1934213,Boundedness of Stability Region of Explicit LMMs,"I see that for an explicit method such as AB-n or Forward Euler etc. that the region of absolute stability is always within some contour. Is there a reason why this is? I have tried to deduce a conclusion from the stability polynomial but have come up short...I know that, $$\pi_k(z)=\rho(z)-k\lambda\sigma(z)$$ and considering the roots here, then $$k\lambda= \frac{\rho(z)}{\sigma(z)}$$ The method is convergent if $\rho(1)=0$, $\rho^{'}(1)=\sigma(1) \neq 0 $, and if the roots of $\rho$ are less than or equal to 1, with $|z_i|=1$ a simple root. Now if that is true we know $\rho$ has a root of 1. So, $$k\lambda=(z-1)f(z)$$ where $f(z)$ is a rational function with degree of numerator = degree of denominator since the method is explicit. Now, $p(z)$ has lead coefficient 1, so the numerator of $f$ does also, but $\sigma$ may or may not so the denominator of $f$ may or may not. We also know that the value of $z$ is taken such that $|z|=1$ (ie a number from the unit circle). So all factors of the numerator are less than 1 for all $z$. Thus the numerator is less than 1. So it is known that $|z-1| \leq1$ but is it always true that $f$ is? If so we are golden...","['complex-analysis', 'numerical-methods']"

1934270,How to find all cluster/accumulation points of a given sequence?,"Let U={$x_n$=($\frac{1}{n}$,(-1)$^n\frac{n-1}{n}$) :n$\in\mathbb{N}$
  }.Find all cluster points of the set U and prove rigoriously. First of all, the definition of a cluster point: x $\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is a cluster/accumulation point of set U$\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ if every
  punctured neighbourhood of x B'( x , r) contains elements from the set U. What I've done: Let's take a look at the components $\frac{1}{n}$ and (-1)$^n\frac{n-1}{n}$ separately. It is quite obvious that $\lim_{n\to_\infty} \frac{1}{n}=0$ and that $(-1)^n\frac{n-1}{n}$ diverges. In addition, its subsequences $(-1)\frac{n-1}{n}=\frac{1}{n}-1$ and $\frac{n-1}{n}=1-\frac{1}{n}$  converge to -1 and 1 respectively. Thus my claim is that the cluster points of set U are points (0,1) and (0,-1). Next it needs to be proven in a formal way. Since  ($\frac{1}{n}$, $1-\frac{1}{n}$) converges to (0, 1), $\forall\epsilon>0, \exists$M such that ||$x_n$-(0,1)||<$\epsilon$, when n>M. On the other hand, since  ($\frac{1}{n}$, $1-\frac{1}{n}$) converges to (0, 1), for every neighbourhood U of (0,1) there exists N$\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $x_n$$\in$U whenever n$\geq$N. This implies directly(?) that (0,1) is a cluster point of U (?). Similarly, since  ($\frac{1}{n}$, $\frac{1}{n}-1$) converges to (0, -1), for every neighbourhood U of (0,-1) there exists N$\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $x_n$$\in$U whenever n$\geq$N..? Lastly, it must be shown that (0,-1) and (0,1) are the only cluster points of the set U. By contradiction?","['multivariable-calculus', 'general-topology', 'sequences-and-series']"
