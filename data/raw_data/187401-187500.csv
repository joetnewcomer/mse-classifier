3484467,Supnorms are equivalent with respect to two different bases,"If $F$ is a finite dimensional vector spaces over $\mathbb R$ , I have to show that suprimum norm with respect to two different bases are equivalent. I know how to prove that in a finite dimentional vector space any two norms are equivalent. In that proof we use induction on 
dimention. Edit:  without using that (in finite dimentional spaces two norms are equivalent)

3484541,Is there an intuitive way to view the definition of the McShane integral?,"To my understanding the definition of the McShane integral is identical to the definition of the Henstock–Kurzweil integral with the exception that each tag does not have to be contained in the subinterval for which it is assigned to. However, the gauge function in general will force the corresponding subinterval to be relatively close to the tag. Still, the tag can be picked a bit outside of the subinterval. If I am not mistakes this implies that a function is McShane integrable if and only if it is absolutely integrable. This is not the case for the Henstock–Kurzweil integral. I do not understand how such a subtle modification of the definition of the Henstock–Kurzweil integral makes every McShane integrable function absolutely McShane integrable. By functions I am simply refering to functions on $\mathbb{R}$ for the sake of simplicity. Is there an intuitive way to view the differences between the aforementioned integrals and in particular why McShane integrable functions are absolutely integrable?","['integration', 'lebesgue-integral', 'analysis', 'real-analysis', 'gauge-integral']"
3484576,Is an exponential family the same as an exponentially convex set?,"An exponential family of probability distributions is usually defined as $$
p(x) = e^{\theta\cdot f(x) \,-\, \psi(\theta)},
$$ where $\theta$ is a vector of parameters, $f(x)$ is some arbitrary vector-valued function of $x$ , and $\psi= \log\sum_x e^{\theta\cdot f(x)}$ , which ensures normalisation. This defines a set of probability distributions, one for each value of the parameter vector $\theta$ . It's this set that's referred to as the exponential family. Usually, $\theta$ seems to be assumed to be finite-dimensional, but I think this doesn't have to be the case. I'll assume for this question that it isn't, and the $\cdot$ could be any inner product, i.e. it could stand for an infinite sum or an integral rather than a finite sum. One can also define an exponentially convex set of probability distributions in the following way: a set $C$ of probability distributions is exponentially convex if, for all $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$ , $$
p \in C,q\in C \implies r\in C,
$$ where $$
r(x) = e^{(1-\lambda)\log p(x) \,+\, \lambda \log q(x) \,-\, \psi(\lambda)},
$$ and $\psi = \log\sum_x e^{(1-\lambda)\log p(x) \,+\, \lambda \log q(x)}$ . Note that I don't restrict $\lambda$ to between 0 and 1. One could equivalently define $r(x)$ as $$
r(x) = \frac{1}{Z}p(x)^{1-\lambda}q(x)^\lambda.
$$ My question is, are exponential families and exponentially convex sets the same thing? It's easy to show that all exponential families are exponentially convex sets, but what about the other direction? That is, if I have some set of distributions and I want to show that it's an exponential family, is it enough to show that it is exponentially convex in the above sense, or do there exist exponentially convex sets that are not exponential families? If the answer is no, what would be a simple counterexample?","['probability-theory', 'information-geometry']"

So If I were taking the number $6$ and partitioning for example (just to make sure I understand what the question is asking): The only partition with distinct odd parts would be $6=5+1$ .

3484698,Why do additional Taylor terms lead to an improved approximation of a function?,"I hope my question becomes clear: I understand what a Taylor polynomial does. It approximates an analytical function in the point $x=a$ in a way that the n'th order Taylor polynomial matches the function up to its n'th derivative in the point $x=a$ . Something I could never answer myself though is: Why does each additional Taylor term improve the approximation of the function in the vicinity of the point $x=a$ ? Can't it be that a Taylor polynomial provides a worse approximation in the vicinity of $x=a$ when taking more Taylor terms (i.e. choosing a later truncation for $n$ )? If this is the case: Is it also safe to say that truncating a Taylor series at larger $n$ also improves the approximation of $f(x)$ for points far away from $x=a$ ? And a last question: Why is an analytic function $f(x)$ almost always equal to the Taylor series of the form $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}}{n!} (x-a)!$ Are there function where this is not the case?

3484835,"The proportion of binary digits of $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \Big\lfloor{\frac{k}{2}\sqrt{p}\Big\rfloor}\cdot2^{-k}$ equal to one, is $> 0.978$ if $p=143$.","Can you prove this? Is it true? If $p$ is an integer, is this proportion never equal to 50%? See my related question regarding this sum, here . For $p=143$ , I computed the binary digits in Excel using carry-over operations implemented in Excel formulas. The first few digits equal to zero take place at the following locations: 47, 95, 143, 191, 239, 287, 335, 383, 431, 479, 527, 574, 622, 670, 718, 766, 814, 862, 910, 958, 1006, 1054, 1102, 1149, 1197, 1245, 1293, 1341, 1389, 1437, 1485, 1533, 1581, 1629, 1677, 1724, 1772, 1820, 1868, 1916, 1964, 2012, 2060, 2108, 2156, 2204, 2252, 2299, 2347, 2395 The delta between two successive locations with a zero digit, is 48 most of the time, and sometimes 47. So, less than 1 out of 47 binary digits is equal to zero, though this is not a proof, just a statement based on observations. More precisely, the location delta is 47 (rather than 48) between a zero digit and the previous one, only at the following digit positions: $574+ k \cdot 575$ , for $k=0, 1, 2$ and so on. You can thus compute the exact proportion of binary digits equal to one. Can you compute that proportion? It must be - it seems - between $1-\frac{1}{47}$ and $1-\frac{1}{48}$ , and much closer to $1-\frac{1}{48}$ than to $1-\frac{1}{47}$ . I assumed here that we are only interested in the fractional part, and the first digit for the fractional part of the number in question, is assigned position 1. The exciting thing here is the discovery of a class of (presumably) irrational, non-normal numbers, that are rather natural. Usually such numbers are built artificially. Other similar numbers include the rabbit number , and numbers described here (or problem #11 in this article ). Other spectacular examples in the same family Besides $p=143 = 11 \times 13$ , with first zero digit in position 47 , we have: $p = 17 \times 19$ : the first binary digit equal to 0 is in position 71 ; about 98.3% of the digits are equal to 1. $p = 29 \times 31$ : the first binary digit equal to 0 is in position 119 ; about 98.7% of the digits are equal to 1. $p = 41 \times 43$ : the first binary digit equal to 0 is in position 167 ; about 99.1% of the digits are equal to 1. $p = 59 \times 61$ : the first binary digit equal to 0 is in position 239 ; more than 99% of the digits are equal to 1. Sounds like if $p$ is the product of twin primes, it leads to interesting results. Would be interesting to see if the sequence that includes the numbers $47, 71, 119, 167, 239, \cdots$ is well known. A case with known exact solution By known , I mean that the exact proportion of binary digits equal to 1 is a known, explicit algebraic number. Not a proof, but it is based on my experience dealing with this kind of stuff, and strong empirical evidence. The case $p=2$ leads to very strong and simple patterns in the distribution of the binary digits. The proportion of digits equal to 1 is $\sqrt{2}/2$ . An immediate consequence is that the number that has these digits, is irrational. Below are the first 2,000 or so digits. 11011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011101101110110110111011011101101101110110111011011011101101110110111011011011101101110110110111011011 The lag-1 autocorrelation in this sequence of binary digits seems to be equal to $1 - \sqrt{2} < 0$ , a value that is way too small for the number in question to be normal in any base $b$ with $1< b \leq 2$ .

3484838,Counting problem: Checking 9 squares out of $3\times 5$ board,"I'm self learning some combinatorics and I encountered the following counting problem: How many ways are there to check 9 squares out of $3\times5$ boards such that in every column there's at least one checked square? (To be more precise, the board has 3 rows and 5 columns) I think I know the outline of the solution: Let $C$ be the set of all possible checking of $9$ squares off the greed and let $C_i$ be the checking of the board where the $i^{th}$ column has no square checked- I then proceed by using the Inclusion - Exclusion principle and so the solution is $$|C|-|C_1\cup C_2\cup C_3\cup C_4\cup C_5|$$ So I have two questions: How many ways there are actually to check the board without restrictions ? When I try to think about it I think about selecting a subset of 9 squares out of 15 squares so $\binom{15}{9}$ , is this correct? Somehow it does'nt feel like it's the right number ; Is the outline to the solution I wrote above the right approach to this problem? I know this is very elementary but I'm really confused by all the counting arguments and most of the time my initial intuition turns out to be wrong so any help would be much appreciated! Update with solution For each $C_i$ we restrict our board to be one column less now, so it's actually checking $9$ squares on a $3\times 4$ board- there are $\binom{12}{9}$ ways to do so. Furthermore, up to renaming the columns this procedure is symmetric so there are $5$ ways to do that. For any intersection of the form $C_i\cap C_j$ (for $i\neq j$ ) we restrict our board to be $3\times 3$ , and now there's a single way to check the board. There are $\binom{5}{2}$ such intersections. Any bigger intersection would be empty. From the Inclusion - Exclusion principle we get: $$
\begin{aligned}\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^{5} C_{i}\right| &=5 C_{i}-\left(\begin{array}{c}{5} \\ {2}\end{array}\right)\left|C_{i} \cap C_{j}\right| \\ &=5\left(\begin{array}{c}{12} \\ {9}\end{array}\right)-\left(\begin{array}{c}{5} \\ {2}\end{array}\right) \end{aligned}
$$ And so the number of possible checking that fit the decrepstion of the exercise is: $$
|C|-\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^{5} C_{i}\right|=\left(\begin{array}{c}{15} \\ {9}\end{array}\right)-\left(5\left(\begin{array}{c}{12} \\ {9}\end{array}\right)-\left(\begin{array}{c}{5} \\ {2}\end{array}\right)\right)=3915

However, I have a very basic question concerning this.

3484911,Meaning of higher-order derivations in differential geometry?,"In differential geometry, a derivation is defined to be an operator $D:C^{\infty}(M)\rightarrow C^{\infty}(M)$ that is linear and satisfies the first-order product rule: $$ D(fg) = D(f)g + fD(g). $$ When I say ""second-order derivations,"" I mean operators of the form $DD'$ where $D, D'$ are derivations.
In this case, $DD'$ is linear and satisfies $$ DD'(fg) = DD'(f)g + D(f)D'(g) + D'(f)D(g) + DD'(g). $$ Questions. Are there any references that discuss these types of operators? Does anyone have an intuitive/geometric interpretation of these operators? First-order derivations can be interpreted as vector fields (or tangent vectors if we're talking about pointwise derivations). Is there an extension of this type of reasoning? Edit. It looks like my definition has in general $DD'\ne D'D$ . For example, in local coordinates let $D = \partial_{1}$ and $D' = x^{1}\partial_{2}$ . Then $$ DD' = \partial_{1}(x^{1}\partial_{2}) = \partial_{2} + x^{1}\partial_{1}\partial_{2} \ne D'D. $$ I'm not sure what definition is appropriate, actually. The above is only my attempt.

3485170,Constructing a normal variation using a given smooth function with zero mean,"Let $x_0:\Sigma^n\to\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be an immersion of an orientable compact $n$ -dimensional smooth manifold into the Euclidean space. It is well-known that given a smooth function $\varphi:\Sigma\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the zero-mean condition: \begin{align}
\int_{\Sigma}\varphi d\mu=0
\end{align} (where $d\mu$ is the area element in the induced metric), there always exist a volume-preserving normal variation $X:\Sigma\times(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\to\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ whose variation vector field is \begin{align}
Y:=\frac{\partial X}{\partial t}\bigg|_{t=0}=\varphi\nu
\end{align} where $\nu$ is the unit normal. In Barbosa-do Carmo , the proof begins by considering a two-parameter family of immersion \begin{align}
x(t,u)=x_0+(t\varphi+ug)\nu & & (1)
\end{align} (where $g:\Sigma\to\mathbb{R}$ is any smooth function with $g\equiv 0$ on the boundary $\partial\Sigma$ and $\int_{\Sigma}gd\mu\neq 0$ ), then considers the equation \begin{align}
V(t,u)=const
\end{align} (where $V(t,u)$ is the volume of $x(t,u)$ ) and use the implicit function theorem to deduce that $u$ can be expressed as a function of $t$ in a small open neighbourhood of $0\in\mathbb{R}$ . Finally, one checks that $X(p,t)=x(t,u(t))(p)$ is the desired volume-preserving normal variation of $x_0$ . My question is the following: Instead of considering (1), why not the
  proof considers the one-parameter family \begin{align}
x(t)=x_0+t\varphi\nu & & (2) 
\end{align} of immersions? This seems to directly give the desired variation (by setting $X(p,t)=x(t)(p)$ ) and it looks simpler than (1). For one thing, a big theorem like implicit function theorem will not be needed. Is there any reason that I've failed to observe which makes it necessary to consider (2) instead of (1)?

   &X^2&+163Y^2-2(2\cdot40+1)Y-1=0\\
&X^2&+163Y^2-162Y-1=0

Please watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5c69-A0cEk . If you find a counterexample or proof, please let me know. I assert the following theorem related to this problem. Theorem 1. $ \forall x, \alpha \in \mathbb{N}, \alpha \neq 1$ , The equation $$x=Yy^2+(Y+1)y+Y\alpha$$ has rational solution $y$ and
natural number solution $Y$ $\Rightarrow$ $x^2+x+\alpha$ is a composite number. Proof. We express the two rational solutions as following: $$y=\frac{n_1}{m_1},\frac{n_2}{m_2},\ \ \ \ where \ m_i\in\mathbb{N},\ n_i\in\mathbb{Z},\ gcd(m_i,n_i)=1,\ (i=1,2)$$ From the factor theorem and $gcd(Y,Y+1)=1$ , we can get the following relation. $$(m_1y-n_1)(m_2y-n_2)=Yy^2+(Y+1)y+Y\alpha-x$$ $$m_1m_2y^2-(m_1n_2+m_2n_1)y+n_1n_2=Yy^2+(Y+1)y+Y\alpha-x$$ Hence \begin{eqnarray*}
   m_1m_2 &=& Y \\
   -(m_1n_2+m_2n_1) &=& Y+1 \\
   n_1n_2 &=& Y\alpha-x
\end{eqnarray*} So we can get $$x=m_1m_2\alpha-n_1n_2$$ $$m_1n_2+m_2n_1+m_1m_2=-1.$$ We combine the two equation as following: $$x=\frac{n_1n_2-m_1m_2\alpha}{m_1n_2+m_2n_1+m_1m_2}$$ We enter this $x$ into $x^2+x+\alpha$ and calculate the factorization. We can get $$x^2+x+\alpha = \frac{(n_1^2+m_1n_1+\alpha m_1^2)(n_2^2+m_2n_2+\alpha m_2^2)}{(m_1n_2+m_2n_1+m_1m_2)^2}.$$ Since $\ m_1n_2+m_2n_1+m_1m_2=-1$ , $$x^2+x+\alpha = (n_1^2+m_1n_1+\alpha m_1^2)(n_2^2+m_2n_2+\alpha m_2^2).$$ So $x^2+x+\alpha$ is a composite number. $$\tag*{$\square$}$$ Since $y=\frac{-Y-1 \pm \sqrt{(1-4\alpha)Y^2+2(2x+1)Y+1}}{2Y}$ , we can get a condition from Theorem 1. Lemma. $\forall x,\alpha \in \mathbb{N}$ , The ellipse $$X^2 = (1-4\alpha)Y^2+2(2x+1)Y+1, \ \ \ \ \ \ Y>0$$ has
lattice points $(X,Y)$ . $\Rightarrow$ $y$ is a rational number. If $Y=0$ is allowed, the ellipse has always $(X,Y) = (\pm 1,0)\ \ $ (trivial lattice points). Hence, the following assertion is correct. Theorem 2. $\forall x,\alpha \in \mathbb{N}, \alpha \neq 1$ , The ellipse has one or more non-trivial lattice points. $\Rightarrow x^2+x+\alpha$ is a composite number. The following conjecture is unresolved. Conjecture. $\forall x \in \mathbb{N} ,\ \forall \alpha \in \{3,5,11,17,41\} $ , The ellipse has only trivial lattice points. $\Leftrightarrow x^2+x+\alpha$ is a prime number.

By factoring $$-\frac{d^2}{dx^2}- \lambda^2 = (D_x - \lambda)(D_x + \lambda), \qquad D_x = \frac{1}{i} \frac{d}{dx}, \, \lambda \neq 1, 2, \dots $$ and using the integrating factor method twice, we find that the solution $u$ to the equation $$(A - \lambda^2)u = f \in \mathcal{B},$$ is given by $$u(x) = c_2 e^{-i\lambda t} + \frac{c_1}{i2\lambda}e^{i\lambda t} + F(x), $$ for some $c_1, c_2 \in \mathbb{C}$ and where $$F(x) = \int_0^x e^{i2\lambda t} \int^s_0 e^{-i\lambda t} f(t) dt ds.$$ So the above expression for $u$ is our proposed formula for $(A - \lambda^2)^{-1}f$ , but it remains to show that $(A - \lambda^2)^{-1}$ is bounded and that $u$ can indeed be made periodic. Requiring that $u$ be periodic gives rise to a linear system to solve for $c_1$ and $c_2$ . It appears this system has a unique solution unless $\lambda$ is an integer or half-integer. So, it may be that the spectrum consists of more than eigenvalues above. But I'm not sure how to decide if the half-integers are indeed in the spectrum or not.

Since $\sec \Theta$ is equal to $\frac{x+5}{3}$ and $\tan\Theta$ is equal to $\frac{\sqrt{x^2+10x+16}}{3}$ , the whole integral would be (I had added all like terms before this): $9\left [ \frac{\sqrt{x^2+10x+16}}{3} \right ]^3 + 252\left ( \frac{\sqrt{x^2+10x+16}}{3}\right ) -\frac{135}{2} \left ( \frac{x+5}{3}\right ) \left ( \frac{\sqrt{x^2+10x+16}}{3}\right ) - \frac{385}{2} ln \left | \frac{x+5}{3} + \frac{\sqrt{x^2+10x+16}}{3}\right | + C$ Lastly, I simplified the integral: $\frac{1}{3} \left ( x^2 + 10x+16 \right )^\frac{3}{2} + \frac{(93-15x)\sqrt{x^2+10x+16}}{2} - \frac{385}{2} ln \left | \frac{x+5+\sqrt{x^2+10x+16}}{3}\right | + C$ Have I integrated the integrand appropriately?

3485959,Unexpected yet accessible examples of the probabilistic method,"What are some examples of applications of the probabilistic method to areas where it might not be expected? I was just wondering how feasible it would be to present different ideas about the probabilistic method to those who don't necessarily have a lot of math background. One really interesting example I found was hat games, and the applications of Hamming codes and probabilities to find really slick ways to think about different hat puzzles. I was just wondering if you had any other specific examples that don't take a lot of build up to get to some interesting results. I plan to introduce the basics of probability and expected value, but I don't think I can get to topics like the Local Lemma and Martingales. Also, I don't think I'd like to go very deep into graphs or analysis either, given that a lot of people aren't very familiar with those concepts.","['probabilistic-method', 'soft-question', 'combinatorics']"
3486016,Equivalence of two definitions of Lebesgue integration,"I'm quite new to measure theory, and so far I've come across two different definitions for the integral of a real-valued function over a measure space. I'm having trouble showing that the two definitions are equivalent. Suppose $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ is a measure space. The first approach starts with defining a simple function on $X$ as any function of the form $g=\sum_{i=0}^n a_i\chi E_i$ ,
 where $a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n$ are constants in $\mathbb{R}$ , $E_0,E_1,\ldots,E_n$ are measurable subsets of $X$ with finite measure, and $\chi E_i$ is the characteristic function of $E_i$ . For such a function, we define $$\int g =\sum_{i=0}^n a_i\mu E_i.$$ Next, if $f$ is a nonnegative, real-valued function defined on a conegligible/conull subset of $X$ , we say that $f$ is integrable if there is a non-decreasing sequence $\langle f_n\rangle_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of non-negative simple functions such that $\sup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\int f_n<\infty$ and $\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n =f$ almost everywhere. 
In this case, we set $$\int f = \sup\left\{\int g:g\text{ is a simple function and }g\leq f\text{ almost everywhere}\right\}.$$ Finally, if $f$ is an arbitrary real-valued function defined on a conegligible subset of $X$ , we say that $f$ is integrable if we can write $f=f_1-f_2$ where $f_1$ and $f_2$ are nonnegative, integrable functions (in the sense defined earlier). In this case, we set $\int f= \int f_1- \int f_2$ . For the second approach, we start by defining a quasi-simple function on $X$ as any function of the form $g=\sum_{i=0}^{\color{red}\infty} a_i \chi G_i$ where $\langle G_i\rangle_{i\in\color{red}{\mathbb{N}}}$ is a $\color{red}{\text{partition}}$ of $X$ into measurable sets, $\langle a_i\rangle_{i\in\color{red}{\mathbb{N}}}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ , and $$\sum_{i=0}^\infty |a_i|\mu G_i<\infty.$$ In the above sum, we count $0\cdot \infty$ as $0$ , so that $G_i$ can have infinite measure so long as $a_i=0$ . For such a function, we define $$\int g=\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i\mu G_i.$$ We say a real-valued function $f$ defined on a conegligible subset of $X$ is integrable if the two values $$\sup\left\{\int g:g\text{ is a quasi-simple function and }g\leq f\text{ almost everywhere}\right\}$$ $$\inf\left\{\int h:h\text{ is a quasi-simple function and }h\geq f\text{ almost everywhere}\right\}$$ are equal, in which case we set $\int f$ equal to the common value. I noticed that the difference in approach between these two definitions becomes more apparent when considering the case in which $f$ is unbounded. Indeed, if we suppose $f$ is unbounded below, then although there are quasi-simple functions which are less than $f$ , there are no simple functions less than $f$ (so that splitting up $f$ into $f_1-f_2$ as done in the first definition is necessary). I would greatly appreciate any help in showing that these two definitions are equivalent. For further context, showing the equivalence of these two definitions is exercise 122Yd in Fremlin's first volume of Measure Theory .","['integration', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-integral']"
3486035,Change of Variables -- is it always an isomorphism?,"I think I'm fundamentally confused about what it means to make a change of variables (in the context of an affine/projective variety).

Do we also require a change of variables to be an isomorphism of $k[x_1,..,x_n]$ ? (Does anyone have a reference for the definition?)

3486090,Circle inscribed between quarter circles - proving its center point,"Square $ABCD$ has a side length of $1$ . $BGD$ and $AFC$ are quarter circles, and there is an inscribed circle between the quarter circles. Two points of tangency $F$ and $G$ are labeled. How can I prove $O$ is the center of the inscribed circle? I was thinking to show $EFGH$ is a rectangle (or equivalently an inscribed parallelogram). It is easy to see $FG$ and $EH$ are parallel to $AD$ by symmetry, but I cannot justify why $EF$ and $HG$ are parallel to $AB$ (well I thought it was obvious, but upon further thinking it didn't seem so obvious!). The problem of solving for the radius of the circle has two solutions on Quora . However, I was having issues justifying the steps of the proofs. For example, the first proof seems to assume $O$ is the center of the circle. And the second states the three points of tangency in the circle form an equilateral triangle (which doesn't seem obvious to me). It is definitely true $O$ is the center, but I'm at a mental block for proving this obvious thing. Any suggestions would be much appreciated, thanks!

3486105,Show that $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ is the Lie algebra of the algebraic group $SL_n$,"I am currently reading the book ""Linear Algebraic Group"" by Springer, more precisely in chapter 4 where Lie algebras of linear algebraic groups are introduced. I would like to prove that the Lie algebra of $SL_n$ is given by the algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ of $n\times n$ matrices with trace zero using the formalism developped in the book. Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field and consider the linear algebraic group $G=GL_n$ , whose affine algebra is given by $k[G]=k[T_{i,j},\Delta^{-1}]_{1\leq i,j \leq n}$ where $\Delta=\det(T_{i,j})$ . Inside $G$ , we have the subgroup $H = SL_n$ which is Zariski closed in $G$ , hence it is again a linear algebraic group whose affine algebra is $k[H]=k[T_{i,j}]/(\Delta - 1)$ . I know already that the Lie algebra $L(G)$ of $G$ can be identified with the algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ of $n\times n$ matrices with usual Lie brackets. That is because the $k$ -derivations of $k[G]$ commuting with all left translations are exactly the $D_X$ for $X=(x_{i,j})\in \mathfrak{gl}_n$ , defined by $$D_XT_{i,j}:=-\sum_{h=1}^nT_{ih}x_{hj}$$ To compute the Lie algebra $L(H)$ of $SL_n$ , the book recommends to proceed in the following manner. I let $J=(\Delta-1)$ be the ideal of $k[G]$ defining $H$ , and I consider $\mathcal D_{G,H}$ the set of all the $k$ -derivations of $k[G]$ preserving $J$ . Then, there is a natural isomorphism $$\mathcal D_{G,H}\cap L(G) \cong L(H)$$ Whence, to prove that $L(H)$ identifies with $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ , I need to show the following: We have $D_X(\Delta - 1) \in (\Delta - 1)$ if and only if $\operatorname{Trace}(X)=0$ . By argueing on dimension, it is actually enough to just prove that $D_X(\Delta - 1) \in (\Delta - 1)$ for $X = E_{i,j}$ or $E_{i,i}-E_{j,j}$ for $i\not = j$ . I thought that it would be easy enough, but well... The computations are terrible and I can't reach the desired conclusion (even considering the case $n=2$ ). Is there any ""clever"" way to tackle this problem ? Also, is there maybe another way to characterize the Lie algebra that would make the argument more direct ?","['affine-varieties', 'algebraic-groups', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

If $(x_n) \rightarrow L$ , it is not too hard to show that $(x_{n+1}) \rightarrow L$ . Thus we can take the limit of both sides of $x_{n+1}=\frac{1}{4-x_n}$ to get $L=\frac{1}{4-L}$ . We can solve for $L$ to get $L=0.268$ or $L=3.732$ . My question is why $L=0.268$ is the answer, and not $3.732$ . Is there any significance behind $3.732$ popping out here? Logically, we can conclude that $x_n$ is strictly decreasing and reject $3.732$ on the basis that it is greater than $x_1$ , but is that a valid reason though?

\sum_{n=k}^\infty \frac{x^n}{k!(n-k)!}  = \frac{e^x x^k}{k!}.
$$ As shown in the answer, $$
\sum_{n=k}^\infty \frac{x^n}{k!(n-k)!} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^{n+k}}{k!n!} = x^k \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} = \frac{x^ke^x}{k!}.$$ Hence $$
B(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty B_k \frac{e^xx^k}{k!} = e^x \sum_{k=0}^\infty B_k\frac{x^k}{k!} = e^x B(x).

(I am using the Frobenius Euclidean product here). $X$ is a convex cone. Can we give an explicit characterization of $X$ ? Comment: If we denote by $C$ the space of all  squares of skew-symmetric matrices, we can characterize its dual cone as follows: Since every square of a skew-symmetric matrix is symmetric, and the symmetric and the skew-symmetric matrices are orthogonal, we know that every skew-symmetric matrix belongs to the dual cone of $C$ . So, the question whether a given matrix $A$ belongs to the dual cone of $C$ depends solely on the symmetric part of $A$ . Since $C$ is invariant under orthogonal conjugation , we can orthogonally diagonalize $\text{sym}(A)$ and deduce that $A$ lies in $C^*$ if and only if the diagonal matrix whose entries are the eigenvalues of $\text{sym}(A)$ is in $C^*$ . Thus, the question reduces to determining the case of diagonal matrices. Edit: Omnomnomnom proved in this answer that every $D$ in $X$ has at most one negative entry, and the absolute value of the negative entry is less than or equal to the next-smallest entry.

3486455,To show that for $n\geq 1$ Each $n$ element set has $2^{n-1}$ subsets of even and odd size each,"So for this, I wrote a different proof than the one given in the textbook I'm studying discrete math from. I was wondering if it was a correct proof because I really like it and want to know if it has any logical pitfalls. Let us consider the expansion of $$(1+x)^n= \binom{n}{0} x^n + \binom{n}{1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n-1}x^{1} + \binom{n}{n}x^0$$ Clearly, this contains every power of $x$ from $0$ to $n$ . 
Now this can be seen as the set containing $n$ elements being partitioned into subsets if all sizes from size $0$ to $n$ . For the purposes of this paper we are not concerned with the elements in the subsets only the size. The coefficients $\binom{n}{k}$ in the expansion of $(1+x)^n$ are the number of subsets with $k$ elements if we group them only by size. 
Now, the rest of the proof follows simply, we know that, $$(x+1)^n= \binom{n}{0} x^n + \binom{n}{1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n-1}x^{1} + \binom{n}{n}x^0$$ Putting, $x=1$ in this equation, we get, $$(2)^n= \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n-1} + \binom{n}{n}$$ Or, $$2^n = \sum^{i=n} _{i=0} \binom{n}{i}$$ Also, putting $x=-1$ we get, $$0= \binom{n}{0} - \binom{n}{1} + \ldots - \binom{n}{n-1} + \binom{n}{n}$$ Or, $$0= \sum^{i=n} _{i=0} (-1)^i\binom{n}{i}$$ Now adding the two equations, we get, $$2^n = 2\cdot \sum^{i=n} _{i=0,i\neq 2k+1 \forall k =(0,1\ldots \lfloor {\frac{n-1}{2}}\rfloor)} \binom{n}{i}$$ That is the sum of the even coefficients is $2^{n-1}$ which is the same as saying that the sum of all the subsets having an even number of elements (total number of subsets having an even number of elements) is $2^{n-1}$ and now putting this back into the first equation, $$0= \binom{n}{0} - \binom{n}{1} + \ldots - \binom{n}{n-1} + \binom{n}{n}$$ We get, the sum of the odd coefficients, or total number of subsets with odd number of elements is also $2^{n-1}$","['combinations', 'proof-writing', 'solution-verification', 'combinatorics', 'elementary-set-theory']"

3486507,When are two neighbouring fractions in Farey sequence are similarly ordered,"I am trying exercises from Tom M Apostol and I could not think about this problem in Chapter 5. Problem is - Two reduced fractions $a/b$ and $c/d$ are said to be similarly ordered if $(c-a)\times(d-b)\ge0$ . Prove that any two neighboring fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$ and $\frac{a_{i+1}}{b_{i+1}}$ are similarly ordered. My attempt - I tried using result - for any two consecutive Farey fractions $a/b<c/d$ , $bc-ad=1$ holds and then using definition of similarly ordered fractions. But it doesn't yields result when $b\neq d$ . Can someone please help.","['analytic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'farey-sequences']"

\frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \lvert x \rvert^2 = \langle \dot{x}, x \rangle = \langle Ax, x \rangle = 0 \implies \lvert x \rvert^2 = \lvert x(0) \rvert^2

3486592,Theorem 7.18 Rudin's,"I'm studying the example of a continuous function nowhere differentiable on Rudin's book ""Principles of Mathematical analysis"", but I keep missing the point of an assumption. 
Here you can see the proof. The point I'm struggling with is the (?) weird assumption of not allowing any integer lying on the interval (formula n.38). Intuitively, I see that avoiding an integer on my interval let us evaluate $|\phi(4^n(x+\delta_m))-\phi(4^nx)|$ ( $\star$ ) on a straight line, and the result will be $\frac{1}{2}$ . In the second case, if we have a integer $q$ , the graph of the function $\phi$ change the slope in a neighborhood of $q$ (we have something like a $\land$ or $\lor$ , with the segments of different measure), but I don't understand whhy in this case the difference ( $\star$ ) change, and why this should be avoid. I tried to figure it out what's going on here, but I really didn't find anything. Any hints or solution would be much appreciate, thanks in advance.","['analysis', 'real-analysis']"

But is it true for any space? It seems if we have a homeomorphism $f$ from $S$ to $S' = S - \{p\}$ , $f(p) = q$ , but since a space is homeomorphic to itself, there is some $g(r)=q$ . Then there is no inverse if $f$ and $g$ coincide. However they don't have to and maybe $f$ is somehow the homeomorphism since I can't deduce more information. If it is not true, a counter-example will be super helpful! Thank you.",['general-topology']

However, if this is true, then the same technique would show the result for products of countably compact spaces, which I know isn't true.

3486731,Do a.s. right-continuous paths imply product measurability,"Let $( X_t )_{ t \geq 0}$ be an $\mathbb{R}^d$ -valued stochastic process on the probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ which has right-continuous sample paths. The latter means that the map $t \mapsto X_t (\omega)$ is right-continuous for all $\omega \in \Omega$ . Using this fact I know how to show that $(t, \omega) \mapsto X_t (\omega)$ is $\mathcal{B}[0, \infty) \otimes \mathcal{F} - \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ -measurable. But what if instead of the right-continuity of the sample paths, we require a.s. right-continuity, i.e. assume that there is some $\Omega_0 \in \mathcal{F}$ with $P(\Omega_0) = 1$ such that $t \mapsto X_t ( \omega )$ is right-continuous for all $\omega \in \Omega_0$ . Does it then follow that $(t, \omega) \mapsto X_t (\omega)$ is $\mathcal{B}[0, \infty) \otimes \mathcal{F} - \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ -measurable? Since I think of the concept of measurability to be related to the measurable space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ , and not necesarrily to the measure $P$ on it, it is not clear how to work with this.","['measure-theory', 'probability-theory']"

I claim that since $X$ is every column vector in the set $R^n$ , and $AX=0$ , it is implied that $A=0$ by considering the constituents of the products of $AX$ : $a_j×x_i$ where $a_j$ represents the $j$ th column of $A$ and $x_i$ represents the $i$ th row of $X$ , and $i=j$ . If $a_j×x_i=0$ and vector $X$ is every possible column vector (where $x_i=n$ ), then it's implied that $A$ must be a zero matrix (where $a_j=0$ ) to satisfy the equation $AX=0$ .
