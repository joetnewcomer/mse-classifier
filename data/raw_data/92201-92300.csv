1252704,"If $|x|\leq 1$, $|ax^2+bx+c|\leq 1$, find the max possible value of $|2ax+b|$","Given $a,b,c\in \mathbb{R}$ such that  $|x|\leq 1$ and $|ax^2+bx+c|\leq 1$, find the maximum value of $$
|2ax+b|
$$ My Attempt: Set $x=1$ in $|ax^2+bc+c|\leq 1$ to get $$
\tag{$\star$}|a+b+c|\leq 1
$$ Similarly, set $x=-1$ in $|ax^2+bc+c|\leq 1$ to get $$
\tag{$\star\star$}|a-b+c|\leq 1
$$ Similarly, set $x=0$ in $|ax^2+bx+c|\leq 1$ to get $$
\tag{$\star\star\star$}|c|\leq 1
$$ Now, adding  $(\star)$ and $(\star\star)$ gives $$
|a+c|\leq 1
$$ Subtracting $(\star)$ from $(\star\star)$ gives $$
|b|\leq 1
$$ Now, we have $$
-1\leq (a+c)\leq 1\\
-1-c\leq a \leq 1-c
$$ Since $-1\leq c\leq 1$, we get $$
-2 \leq a \leq 2,\; -1 \leq b\leq 1

1252730,Integration of non-top differential k-forms on a manifold (k<n),"I'm fairly new to differential geometry and have been reading up on integration on manifolds. All the texts/lecture notes that I've read so far always consider integrating an $n$-form over an $n$-dimensional manifold, what confuses me about this is why one can't integrate a $k$-form (with $k<n$) over an $n$-dimensional manifold? Is it only possible to do so by introducing mappings from the $n$-dimensional manifold to $k$-dimensional manifolds (integration on a chain)? Edit : I've also read that in order for integration to be well-defined on a manifold, the integrand must be a top -form (is this to do with ensuring coordinate independence of integration on a manifold?). Is this the case, and if so, why? Apologies if this is a really rudimentary question, but it's proving a real snagging point in my understanding.","['differential-geometry', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-forms', 'integration']"
1252732,About rational curves on elliptic K3 surfaces,"I am trying to read this paper http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9902092.pdf . I have some trouble at the end in Corollary 3.27, and also Proposition 3.24. 0)Morally speaking my main trouble is that i don't quite follow how in that paper they actually prove the fact that in elliptic K3 surfaces there are infinitely many rational nt multisection. More specifically i have the following questions(3) is the question that leave me really puzzled, because i see that i'm not getting the main point of the paper, that is sketched in the three words ""by deformation theory"" at the end) 1)When they speak(Corollary 3.27) of ""Dividing the cocycle defining S' by different primes"", i don't really understand what they are referring to(the cocycle defining the elliptic fibration?), and so i don't understand the relation between the K3 surface obtained by such a cocycle and the original one. 2)In Lemma 3.24 they use the notation ${\epsilon'}^{d_{\epsilon}}$, i don't know what they are referring to. 3)And the most troubling for me:In Corollary 3.27, they say that the $\epsilon_p$ obtained by the procedure of dividing the defining cocycle by p, has ""by deformation theory a rational multisection of degree divisible by $d_{\epsilon_p}$"". It seems that the very generic ""by deformation theory"" is refferring to Lemma 2.12,and the previous Proposition 2.2. But in both cases it is on another deformed surface that i got a rational curve , so i don't see why we get one on $\epsilon_p$, and then i don't see how you get one in the original surface, but probably this is explained by the answer to 1) and 2)) I thank a lot in advance anyone who can help me understand these questions.","['complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'surfaces']"

1252821,Random Walk Without Repetitions,"Suppose that we simulated a random walk on $\mathbb Z$ starting at $0$. At each step, we transition from position $x$ to position $x-3,\,x-2,\,x-1,\,x+1,\,x+2,$ or $x+3$ with equal probability. If we ever move to a position we have been at before, we stop. What is the probability that we will eventually reach (and stop at) $0$ again? This is to say, we consider that walks like $0,2,4,3,2$ end at $2$ because they repeated and walks like $0,2,4,3,1,0$ reach $0$ again - and are interested in the probability of the latter case. I'm not sure what methods I can use to dispatch such a problem; if the step size were $1$ rather than $2$, the answer is obviously $\frac{1}2$, as we would need to immediately undo our first step, otherwise we'd never return. If the step size is $1$ or $2$, then we can solve the problem by noting that we can never leap over any pair of positions $(x,x+1)$ - which allows us to classify and count every possible walk (e.g. walks of the form $0,1,3,5,\ldots,2n+1,2n,2n-2,\ldots,0$ form one class). The probability of returning to $0$ is $\frac{7}{18}$ in this case. However, no such approach extends to the case above. By simulating all random walks of length $8$ or less, I have proven that the probability $p$ satisfies $.32<p<.39$. Running many random trials suggests that $p$ is very close to the lower bound.","['probability', 'random-walk']"

1252924,Are elements of a $C^*$-Algebra strictly positive iff their spectrum is strictly positive?,"Let $A$ be a $C^*$-Algebra. An element $a\in A$ is said to be positive iff $a=a^*$ and the spectrum $\sigma(a)$ is nonnegative, ie. $\sigma(a)\subset[0,\infty)$. This is equivalent to $\varphi(a)\ge 0$ for all positive linear functionals $\varphi:A\to\mathbb{C}$. The standard definition for $a$ being strictly positive seems to be that $\varphi(a)>0$ for all nonzero positive linear functionals. Is this definition equivalent to (the more intuitive characterization) $a=a^*$ and $\sigma(a)\subset(0,\infty)$? I know that this is true in the unital case (proof: An equivalent definition of $a$ being strictly positive is that $a$ is positive and $\overline{aAa}=A$. Assume $a$ is strictly positive, then $a$ is invertible, because $\|axa-1\|<\frac{1}{2}$ for some $x\in A$, hence
$axa$ is invertible, which means that $a$ has a left and right inverse, thus
$a$ is invertible. So $a$ is invertible and positive, ie. $\sigma(a)\subset(0,\infty)$. Conversely assume that $\sigma(a)\subset(0,\infty)$ and $a=a^*$, then $a$ is positive and invertible. Because $a$ is invertible we have $aAa=A$, so $a$ is strictly positive.) What can be said about the non-unital case?","['c-star-algebras', 'operator-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

1253036,Mistake in (Baby) Do Carmo? Elementary topology of surfaces.,"If you have the book, it's proposition 2 of section 5.3. If not, the proposition reads: Given any two points p and q $\in$ a regular, connected surface S, there exists a parameterized piecewise differentiable curve joining p to q. Now the proof begins as follows: Since S is connected, there exists a continuous curve $\alpha:[a,b] \rightarrow S$ with $\alpha(a)=p$ and $\alpha (b)=q$. This is the part I struggle with. It appears to me that Do Carmo is asserting that the surface is in fact path connected, which is not true, since connected does not imply path connected in general subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ where all the surfaces live. I thought that maybe something in regularity might solve this problem, but here is the definition of regularity. A surface is regular if for every point $p$ in the surface, there is a neighborhood $V$ in $\mathbb R^3$ and a map $x:U\rightarrow V \cap S$ where $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb R^2$ so that $x$ is onto so that the following are satisfied: 1) $x$ is differentiable. 2) $x$ has a continuous inverse (that is to say, is a homeomorphism) 3) $x$ has a one-to-one differential. I don't see why this must get me path connectedness. I feel like the condition that $U$ is any open subset of $\mathbb R^2$ allows me to pick a sufficiently ugly set and define a surface as a function from that open set to $\mathbb R^3$ which will satisfy these properties, but I have not yet found an example. So in short the question is, what is the justification for saying connectedness $\implies$ path-connectedness in this proof?","['differential-geometry', 'general-topology']"

1253092,Asymptotic Behavior of Differential Equation,"physicist here. I'm studying some problems that involve the use of differential equations. The professor of the course has indicated that usually variable changes used to simplify the equations come from an asymptotic analysis: 
For example if I try to analize then a equation like $\frac{dx}{dt}+x=\frac{t}{x}$, I would start making  $x \rightarrow 0$, and then solving the equation $\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{t}{x}$. After that, I'll take dominant term $u(t)$ in the solution to make a variable change $x(t)=u(t)f(t)$ and then simplify (and solve) the equation. The problem that now I'm facing is the following differential equation, at  $ x \rightarrow 1$: $$ x^2 s \frac{d^2u(x)}{dx^2} + xs\frac{du(x)}{dx}+\frac{u(x)x}{c} \left ( \frac{p}{1-x} + \frac{q}{(1-x)^2}\right )=-K u(x)$$ My try: First I tried to change all that $x$ by 1 except the denominators, then solving the differential equation. It was completely impossible anyway. I've thought on power series, but that $1-x$ are very annoying. 
I've finally tried with Mathematica. I discovered that substituting the $x$ by 1 is NOT a good idea. Also now I'm pretty sure that the solution is an hypergeometric.

I do not have use derivatives , so I decided to apply the definition of being a strictly increasing function, which should be: If we pick 2 numbers $a$ and $b$ from the domain of a function $f$, where $a < b$, then $f(a) < f(b)$. Now (if that is a correct definition), I have tried to apply it to my case: Let $a$, $b \in [-1, 1]$ and $a < b$. We want to show that $f(a) < f(b)$ or that $f(b) - f(a) > 0$. We know that $x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x + 2)(x + 1)$, thus we have that $f(a) = (a + 2)(a + 1)$ and $f(b) = (b + 2)(b + 1)$ , therefore we need to show that: $$(b + 2)(b + 1) - (a + 2)(a + 1) > 0$$ We can see that $(b + 2)$ and $(a + 2)$ will always be positive, and that $(b + 2) > (a + 2)$ , since $b > a$ (by assumption). Since $b > a$, we know that $b > -1$ (otherwise $a \geq b$), thus $(b + 1) > 0$ (so we know that $(b + 2)(b + 1) > 0$ .  We also have at most $(a + 1) = 0$, and thus  we have that $(a + 2)(a + 1) \ge 0$. So, here is the proof that  $f(b) - f(a) > 0$ . Am I correct? If yes, what can I improve it? If not, where are the erros and possible solutions?","['proof-writing', 'calculus', 'proof-verification', 'functions']"

The gambler is \$200 in debt, but the gambler has a wealthy friend who lets the gambler bet using money he does not have to play a game. In this game, the gambler bets \$1, and a random number generator generates a number from 1 to 100. If the number roll over, or exactly 55, the gambler wins \$2. If the number rolls under 55 the gambler loses that \$1 he bet. From my understanding of statistics, over a certain expected period of time, the gambler should hit the unlikely scenario to get out of debt using this method. However using my computer simulations, it seems to take more time than I can allow my simulations to run. Is it possible to guess an expected number of times the gambler would have to play the game in order to get out of debt using some
mathematical model? I am also concerned that the nature of random-number generators may make it impossible for the gambler to get out of debt, as random number generators could be heavily biased to avoid situations such as randomized decks to be fully sorted, or getting out of debt with negative debt and unlikely odds. What I want to get out of this question is, how to explain why it's possible, how to calculate expected number of times the game has to be played to reach the goal, or why it's impossible, or some existing question I can try to study to better understand the problem.",['probability']

It's known that if the function that attains minumum or maximum to $y(x)$ does exists, then it can be got from the Euler-Lagrange equation. The problem occurs, when we are not sure enough in which class of the functions we are going to look for the solution. The typical example is the Dido's problem:  we are looking for a function $f: [-1, 1] \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+}$, graph of which encloses the maximum area between $x$ axis and itself under a fixed length. The right answer is $y=\sqrt{1-x^{2}} \in C[-1, 1]$ But we could not recieve this particular result, if we were considering the problem, for example, in class $C^{1}[-1, 1]$ of all continously differentiable functions. The question is: 1) Does the Euler-Lagrange equation requires twice differentiability from the solutions? 2) How to prove that the Dido's problem has a solution in $C[-1, 1]$ using  methods of the calculus of variations or functional analysis? I was told that it would be reasonable to consider the closure of $C^{1}[-1, 1]$, which should be compact in $C[-1, 1]$, but there are some troubles with proving this and it's not clear enough,  which result this fact may lead to.

1253650,Is the axiom of choice really all that important?,"According to this book : The Axiom of Choice is the most controversial axiom in the entire history of mathematics. Yet it remains a crucial assumption not only in set theory but equally in modern algebra, analysis, mathematical logic, and topology (often under the name Zorn's Lemma). I am not a set theorist, and I don't pretend to be, but I have heard of some weird things that can happen with choice, such as the Banach–Tarski paradox --paradoxes like these are presumably why the Axiom of Choice was so controversial at first, but I am interested in what would happen without choice. Question: What notable consequences would occur without the Axiom of Choice? I found one very interesting example here on an MO thread (reproduced here for ease): The universe can be very a strange place without choice. One consequence of the Axiom of Choice is that when you partition a set into disjoint nonempty parts, then the number of parts does not exceed the number of elements of the set being partitioned. This can fail without the Axiom of Choice. In fact, if all sets of reals are Lebesgue measurable, then it is possible to partition $2^{\omega}$ into more than $2^{\omega}$ many pairwise disjoint nonempty sets! What other weird things would result without this axiom? Would it really be a devastating blow to mathematics or is it really not that big of a deal? I'm hoping for examples/answers geared toward the undergrad level--suitable for someone with very little set theory background.","['elementary-set-theory', 'examples-counterexamples', 'axiom-of-choice']"

Some background : These structures are a generalization of Boolean algebras in which neither the absorption laws nor $p \vee \top = \top$ are guaranteed to hold. They are isomorphic to the class of structures $\langle P, \top, \neg, \wedge\rangle$ such that, for some Boolean algebra $A = \langle S_A,\top_A,\neg_A,\wedge_A\rangle$ and bounded meet-semilattice $B = \langle S_B,\wedge_B,\top_B\rangle$, $P\subseteq S_A\times S_B$; $\top = \langle\top_A,\top_B\rangle\in P$; $\neg: P\to P$ such that $\neg\langle a,b\rangle = \langle\neg_Aa,b\rangle$; $\wedge: (P\times P)\to P$ such that $\langle a,b\rangle\wedge\langle a',b'\rangle=\langle a\wedge_A a',b\wedge_B b'\rangle$. Intuitively, we might think of $\langle a,b\rangle\in P$ as a 'proposition' with 'logical content' $a$ and 'non-logical content' $b$, where the idea is that logical contents form a Boolean algebra, propositions' non-logical contents aggregate under conjunction and are unchanged by negation, and the tautology $\top$ has minimal non-logical content.

1254030,The moduli space of stable maps,"I am reading Katz' book Enumerative Geometry and String Theory . I have a few questions regarding the moduli space of degree $d$ genus $0$ stable maps into $\mathbb P^n$, denoted $\overline{M}(\mathbb{P}^n, d)$. First let me paraphrase some definitions in the book (given between p.32-37) to the best of my understanding (they're not very precise but neither are they in the book!): A tree of $\mathbb P^1$s is a union $C=\bigcup_{i=1}^r C_i$ where each $\phi_i:\mathbb P^1\xrightarrow{\cong}C_i$ is a curve, glued along a finite collection of pairs of points (called nodes ) $(p_j, q_j)\in C_{k(j)}\times C_{l(j)}$ for distinct indices $1\leq k(j), l(j) \leq r$ and avoiding cycles - finite sequences of distinct nodes $p_{j_1},p_{j_2}, \dots, p_{j_k} = p_{j_1}$ where a single component of $C$ contains both $p_{j_l}$ and $p_{j_{l+1}}$. A morphism $f:C\rightarrow\mathbb P^n$ is a map such that each $f_i :=f\circ\phi_i:\mathbb P^1 \rightarrow\mathbb P^n$ is a morphism of varieties. The degree of $f$ is the sum of the degrees of the $f_i$. A genus $0$ stable map to $\mathbb P^n$ is a tree morphism $f:C\rightarrow\mathbb P^n$ such that if $f$ is constant on a component $C_i$ of $C$, then $C_i$ contains at least $3$ nodes of the tree. The degree of the stable map is the same thing as its degree as a tree morphism. An isomorphism of stable maps $g:(f:C\rightarrow\mathbb P^n)\rightarrow(f':C'\rightarrow\mathbb P^n)$ is a morphism $g:C\rightarrow C'$ such that $f'\circ g = f$; For each $C_i$, $g(C_i) = C'_j$ and for any $j$, there is a unique $i$ with $g(C_i)=C'_j$; $(\phi_j)^{-1} \circ g\circ \phi_i:\mathbb P^1\rightarrow\mathbb P^1$ is a morphism (hence automorphism?) whenever $g(C_i)\subseteq C'_j$. The moduli space of genus $0$ stable maps of degree $d$ to $\mathbb P^n$ is then the set $$\overline{M}(\mathbb P^n, d)=\left\{\mbox{isomorphism classes of degree } d \mbox{ genus 0 stable maps into }\mathbb P^n \right\}$$ Here are my first two questions: Why do we care about trees and cycles? To me, it seems as if they are a convenient (if messy) simplification of something more natural (and apparently related to the concept of genus ) but perhaps too complicated to describe in this introductory book. In the definition of stable map, why three nodes? In the book, it is claimed that $\overline{M}(\mathbb P^n, d)$ is actually a stack . I don't know what a stack actually is but I know it is a category in some sense. So I'd like to try to make $\overline{M}(\mathbb P^n, d)$ into a category and see how close this is to a ""real"" stack. First, let's generalise the notion of an isomorphism between two stable maps to that of a morphism which seems to be well-behaved - a morphism $g:(f:C\rightarrow \mathbb P^n)\rightarrow(f':C'\rightarrow\mathbb P^n)$ of stable maps is a morphism $g:C\rightarrow C'$ such that $f'\circ g = f$; For each $C_i$, $g(C_i) = C'_j$ for some $j$; $(\phi_j)^{-1} \circ g\circ \phi_i:\mathbb P^1\rightarrow\mathbb P^1$ is a morphism (in the sense of algebraic varieties) whenever $g(C_i)\subseteq C'_j$. Two morphisms $g_1 :f_1\rightarrow f_1'$ and $g_2:f_2\rightarrow f_2'$ between stable maps are isomorphic if there exist isomorphisms $\theta:f_1\rightarrow f_2$ and $\theta':f_1'\rightarrow f_2'$ such that $\theta'\circ g_1 = g_2 \circ\theta$. Isomorphism between stable maps and between their morphisms are equivalence relations. Let's define a category called $\overline{M}(\mathbb P^n, d)$ whose objects are isomorphism classes $[f]=\left[f:C\rightarrow\mathbb P^n\right]$ of degree $d$ genus $0$ stable maps into $\mathbb P^n$ and whose morphisms are isomorphism classes $[g]:[f]\rightarrow [f']$ of morphisms between stable maps, with composition defined by $[h]\circ [g] = [h\circ g]$. This gives us a much richer structure than just the set of all isomorphism classes defined in the book as there are now ""asymmetric relations"" (described by the morphisms in this category) between the points of the set $\overline{M}(\mathbb P^n, d)$. My final question is: In what sense is the category that I have come up with related to the actual stack mentioned in the book?","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-stacks', 'moduli-space', 'category-theory']"

1254070,Proving that the delta function is the derivative of the step function.,"I want to prove $\frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} x}\Theta =\delta (x)$  using this representation of the delta function: $\delta(x)= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{ikx}dk $ This should be easy. I just need to integrate  $\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{ikx}dk $ with respect to x to get   $ \Theta(x) $ This is the first step: $$\Theta(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{-i}{2 \pi k} e^{ikx} \, dk $$ This doesn't look like the step function to me. So I already suspect that I'm going down the wrong road here. But, unless I'm being naïve, theoretically this should work. I tried to do integration by parts, but I think that I'm going down the wrong road because I just have a more complicated mess to deal with. Have I made an error?

I just substituted...I don't think this is right though $\frac{dx}{dt}=-1-y+x^2$

1254138,In which algebraic setting can I state (and prove) the binomial theorem?,"In a book on algebra I'm currently working with a proof that uses the binomial theorem for $(x+y)^m$ where $x,y$ are elements of some arbitrary field $k$. This looks strange to me, so I did some research on the Internet, but all pages which state (and prove) this theorem never specify what $x$ and $y$ are. A binomial coefficient is defined by faculties and fractions of integers. This is not evaluable in a general field that does not extend the integers like $\mathbb Q$. We can use the map $$\mathbb Z \to k,\quad n\mapsto \sum_1^n 1$$ to get a representation of the integers in $k$, but this is only a group, and it is not clear (to me), why the inverses of these internal representations in $k$ are internal integers as well (so that we could define the binomial coefficient via internal integers). A further question would be, whether we can weaken the requirements from general fields to (not necessarily general) rings. Except for the definition of binomial coefficients, we don't need inverses in the statement, so maybe this is possible as well in some cases (of course this works for all rings that we obtain via a forgetful functor from a field, but I mean rings that are not fields).","['binomial-theorem', 'abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory']"

It's easy to see that for all $x$, $f_n(x) \to 0$ on $(0, 1)$ which means that $f_n$ is pointwise convergent, but since $f_n$ converges pointwise to $0$ for all $x$, I don't see any counter-examples that we can take $x$ to be in order for $f_n$ to converge to any other limit besides $0$.

$$ 3\sin(x)^2 - 2\sin(x)\cos(x) - \cos(x)^2 = 0 $$ It's from the book Engineering Mathematics 7th edition by Stroud.
The book is giving the answer, but I can't seem to be able to find out how to factorize it. I can't figure it out. Consider the following solution: This equation can be written as $3\sin ^2x-\cos ^2x = 2\sin x \cos x.$ That is: $3\sin ^2x-2\sin x \cos x-\cos ^2 x = 0.$ That is: $(3\sin x + \cos x)(\sin x - \cos x) = 0.$ So that $3 \sin x \cos x = 0$ or $\sin x - \cos x = 0.$ If $3 \sin x + \cos x = 0,$ then $\tan x = \frac{-1}{3},$ and so $x = -0.3218 ± n \pi,$ and if $\sin x - \cos x = 0,$ then $\tan x = 1,$ and so $x = \frac{\pi}{4}.$ If anyone could help me understand how to factorize this equation to get the one shown in the image it would help me very much.
