3053941,Why doesn't L'hopitals Rule work for $\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \frac{x+ \sin x}{x+ 2 \sin x}$? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Why doesn't L'HÃ´pital's rule work in this case? (4 answers) Closed 5 years ago . This is how I would evaluate $\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \dfrac{x+ \sin x}{x+ 2 \sin x}$ $=\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \dfrac{x \left( 1+ \frac{\sin x}{x} \right)}{x \left(1+ 2 \cdot \frac{ \sin x}{x} \right)}$ $= \dfrac{1+0}{1+2 \cdot 0} = 1$ But now applying L'hopitals Rule, I get $\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \dfrac{1+ \cos x}{1+ 2 \cos x}$ Since $\cos x $ just oscillates between $[-1,1]$ I think we can  conclude the limit doesn't exist.

3053978,Prove that $\sin a + \sin b + \sin(a+b) = 4 \sin\frac12(a+b) \cos \frac12a \cos\frac12b$,"Helping my son with his trigonometry review. We know that $$\sin(a+b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b$$ We also know that $$\sin a \cos b = \frac12 \left(\sin(a-b) + \sin(a+b)\right)$$ And we have $$\sin a + \sin b = 2 \sin\frac12(a+b)\cos\frac12(a-b)$$ From there, we seem to be missing how to get to the right-hand side of the equation. We first expand $$\sin a + \sin b = 2 \sin\frac12(a+b) \cos\frac12(a-b)$$ Then we add $\sin(a+b)$ , which is $\sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b$ .
We now have: $$2 \sin\frac12(a+b) \cos\frac12(a-b) + \frac12 \left(\sin(a-b) + \sin (a+b)\right) + \frac12 \left( \sin(b-a) + \sin (a+b)\right)$$ From there, we can't see how to obtain the right-hand side of the equation which is $$4 \sin\frac12(a+b) \cos\frac12a \cos\frac12b$$",['trigonometry']

3054103,Numbers on blackboard,"All numbers $1$ to $155$ are written on a blackboard, one time each. We randomly choose two numbers and delete them, by replacing one of them with their product plus their sum. We repeat the process until there is only one number left.

I don't know how to approach it: For two numbers, $1$ and $2$ , the only number is $1\cdot 2+1+2=5$ For three numbers, $1, 2$ and $3$ , we can opt to replace $1$ and $2$ with $5$ and then $3$ and $5$ with $23$ , or $1$ and $3$ with $7$ and then $2$ , $7$ with $23$ or $2$ , $3$ with $11$ and $1$ , $11$ with $23$ so we see that no matter which two numbers we choose, the average number remains the same.

3054210,Free groups are residually of rank 2,"Let $F_X$ denote the free group on the set $X$ , and $F_n$ the free group of rank $n$ . I have read that any free group is residually $F_2$ , and I was trying to understand this. For any free group $F$ , it is residually free of finite rank : given $g \in F$ with $g \neq 1$ , let $S$ be a set of generators of $F$ that we can use to express $g$ , then $g$ is not sent to the identity under the projection $F \to F_S$ . So the question reduces to why $F_n$ is residually $F_2$ , for $n \geq 2$ . Edit: I realized that this is trivial from the embedding of $F_n$ in $F_2$ , for any $n \geq 1$ . So the interesting question is whether the morphism $F_n \to F_2$ can be chosen to be surjective. More explicitly: let $n \geq 2$ , and $1 \neq g \in F_n$ .

3054267,Finding unusually large empty regions in a field of coordinate points?,"I have a list of coordinates representing arbitrary points in space. [0.2, 0.55],
[1.23, 4.56],
[7, 8],
... I want to find two things: regions with no points that are especially large , and collated separately, large regions with especially few points . For example: In this image, Fig 1 shows a sample field of points. Fig 2 shows the same field of points, but denoted with red circles indicating large regions that have no points. I am looking for a function which, given the coordinates for Fig 1, returns coordinates one could use to produce Fig 2. (Not illustrated here: the large regions with few points result.) Here are a few constraints to work with. We can assume the space is flat. (It's not curved or circular.) But the space may have any number of dimensions >= 2 The space should be bounded by the outermost points. We should not highlight regions that clip outside that boundary. The preferred geometry for the highlighted regions is spherical, but that's not a hard requirement. I initially sought to solve this problem in the following two ways: By subdivision: Subdivide the space into equal regions (n-orthotopes). Then count the number of points in the subdivision volume. Take the average number of points-per-subdivision at this scale, then look for subdivisions that have lower than a standard devision of points, and add it to my list of candidates. The subdivide the subdivisions, and repeat down to a minimum scale. Sort the list of candidates to find the volumes that best meet my criteria. By random sampling: Choose a point at random within the space. Choose a random radius value so that we describe an n-sphere at that point. Count the number of points within the n-sphere volume. Keep doing this up to some maximum defined number of iterations , then sort the list to find the volumes that best meet my criteria. (I like this idea better than the subdivision one, for its relative simplicity.) But I thought I would ask Mathematics SE in case there is a known solution to this kind of problem. Is there an established/solved/common/conventional way to do this?","['geometry', 'algorithms']"
3054268,"Order statistics, what am I doing wrong","From SOA sample 138: A machine consists of two components, whose lifetimes have the joint density function $$f(x,y)=

  Calculate the expected operational time of the machine. I know there is a simpler way to solve this, but I would like to solve it using order statistics. This is what I have so far: If I am understanding correctly, I need to find probability $P(max(X,Y) \le  k)=P(X \le k)P(Y \le k)$ , and then differentiate to find the density of $k$ , and from there find the expected value of $k$ . So first I will find the marginal density of $X$ and $Y$ : $$f(x) = \int_0^{10-x}{1\over50}dy$$ $$f(x) = {{10-x}\over50} $$ Then $P(X \le k)$ is $$P(X \le k) = \int_0^{k}{{10-x}\over50}dx $$ $$ = \left({10x\over50}-{x^2\over100}\right)\bigg|_0^k$$ $$ = \left({10k\over50}-{k^2\over100}\right)$$ I can do the same thing for $y$ , so $P(X \le k)P(Y \le k)$ is $$\left({10k\over50}-{k^2\over100}\right)^2$$ $$={100k^2\over2500}-{20k^3\over5000}+{k^4\over10000}$$ I will now take the derivative to get $f(k)$ $${200k\over2500}-{60k^2\over5000}+{4k^3\over10000}$$ And now I can integrate to the limit of $k$ to get $E(K)$ $$E(K)=\int_0^{10} k\left({200k\over2500}-{60k^2\over5000}+{4k^3\over10000}\right)dk$$ $$=\int_0^{10} {200k^2\over2500}-{60k^3\over5000}+{4k^4\over10000}dk$$ $$=\left( {200k^3\over7500}-{60k^4\over20000}+{4k^5\over50000}\right)\bigg|_0^{10}$$ $$=4.666$$ However the true solution is $5$ , where did I go wrong?","['statistics', 'order-statistics', 'probability']"
3054272,Is there a simpler proof of this fact in analysis?,"Suppose that $f:(0,1)\to\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable, and that $f(x_1)=f(x_2)=0$ and $fâ(x_1)>0$ and $fâ(x_2)>0$ for some $0 <x_1<x_2<1$ . Then there must exist an $x_0\in(x_1,x_2)$ such that $f(x_0)=0$ and $fâ(x_0)\leq0$ , as follows:
Let $A=\{x\in(x_1,x_2):f(x)\geq0\}$ , and note that $A$ is nonempty, since the condition $fâ(x_1)>0$ guarantees that there exist points that exceed $x_1$ by arbitrarily small amounts, at which $f$ is strictly positive. Also note that $A$ is bounded above, by $x_2$ . Therefore, let $x_0=\sup A$ . Note that $x_0 > x_1$ . Since $fâ(x_2)>0$ , there exist points that $x_2$ exceeds by arbitrarily small positive amounts, at which $f$ is strictly negative. It follows that $x_1 < x_0 < x_2$ . By continuity of $f$ , we have that $f(x_0)=0$ . Since $f(x)<0$ for all $x\in(x_0,x_2)$ , it follows also that $fâ(x_0)\leq0$ , as required.

We know that a homography $H$ between two photos is induced by a plane in space if and only if $H^tF$ is anti-symmetric where $F$ is the fundamental matrix. I also know that $F$ can be parametrized as $F=[e]_{\times}M$ where $M$ is invertible. Now I want to find a general form for $H$ . Hence, this question.

I have tried a rectangle contour made up of $C:[0,R]\cup [R+i/2] \cup [R+i/2,i/2] \cup [i/2,0]$ but that didn't work out. Because my function is holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}\setminus [i,i\infty) \cap [-i,-i\infty)$ there also wouldn't be any residues to calculate, which doesn't necessarily have to be a problem as Cauchy's theorem could be used to try and compute the integral. If I'm not mistaken, I would then get somerhing like $\int_0^\infty f(x)-f(x+i/2)\,dx=0$ . One difficulty I ran into is simplify $f(z+i/2)$ (where $f(z)=\arctan(x) e^{-z^2}$ ) into some other form such as $\alpha f(z)+\beta g(z)$ for some $g(z)$ whose integral can be calculated on $[0,\infty)$ and $\alpha, \beta\in\mathbb{C}$ . This would let me then solve for $\int_0^\infty f(x)\,dx$ . I also thought that, if that makes it easier, we could extend the range of integration to $\mathbb{R}$ , as long as we found an odd function $q(a,x)$ , such that $q(0,x)=1$ and compute $$\lim_{a\to 0}  \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^\infty  q(a, x) \arctan(x)e^{-x^2}\,dx$$ We could either use Cauchy's/the Residue theorem depending on whether $q(z)$ has poles or not.

Illustrate the general method of deriving the square roots of such a messy complex number as $w_1.$ Context In ""An Introduction to Complex Function Theory"", 1991, by Bruce Palka, problem 4.14.(iii), p26 specifies : find all roots of $\;z^4 + (-4+2i)z^2 - 1 = 0.$ Preliminary to this problem, it is established that : (a) Arg( $z$ ) is the unique angle $\;\alpha \in (-\pi,\pi]\;$ such that $\;z = |z|\left[\cos(\alpha) + i\sin(\alpha)\right].$ (b) Taking $\;\beta = (\alpha/2), \;\sqrt{z} \;=\; 
\pm \sqrt{|z|}\left[\cos(\beta) + i\sin(\beta)\right].$ (c) $\displaystyle \cos(\beta) \;=\; \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos(\alpha)}{2}},
\;\;\sin(\beta) \;=\; \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos(\alpha)}{2}}.$ (d) $\;az^2 + bz + c = 0\;$ will have roots $\displaystyle\;\frac{1}{2a}\left(-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}\right).$ My Attack Of Problem (iii) My first approach was : 1. let $\;w = z^2,\;$ 2. interpret problem (iii) as a quadratic equation in $w$ . 3. use the preliminary concepts to derive the two solutions $w_1$ and $w_2.$ 4. take the two square roots of both $w_1$ and $w_2,\;$ to derive the 4 
roots $\;z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4.$ One of the roots to problem (iii) interpreted as a quadratic equation, $w_1,$ is as identified in the To Do section at the start
of this query. However, after identifying $w_1$ and assigning $\;\alpha \;=\; \text{Arg}(w_1), \;$ I was unable to compute $\;\cos(\alpha)\;$ or $\;\sin(\alpha).\;$ Since Palka's preliminary concepts didn't seem to help here, I 
temporarily abandoned this approach. My second approach, which succeeded, and was probably the intended approach ,
was : 1. factor $\;z^4 + (-4+2i)z^2 - 1 \;=\; (z^2 + 2z + i) \times (z^2 - 2z + i).$ 2. solve each of the two resulting quadratic equations. Solving both of these quadratic equations, I generated four roots, 
one of which was $\displaystyle z_2 \;=\; 
\left(-1 - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}\right)
\;+\; i \, \left(\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}\right).$ After manually verifying that $z_2$ did satisfy problem (iii), I noticed that $\;(z_2)^2 = w_1,\;$ which provided a separate verification of $z_2.$ However, I feel that I should not have had to abandon the first approach.  I
think that there should be a way of $\underline{\text{deriving}}$ that $z_2$ is one of the square roots of $w_1.$ My tangential approach My 2nd approach in the My Attack Of Problem (iii) section of this query may be re-interpreted as a tangential algorithm for identifying
the square roots of $w_1.$ This means that given any messy complex 
expression $w$ , one might identify the square roots of $w$ as follows: Identify (for example) a fourth degree equation of the form $\;[E]\;\;az^4 + bz^2 + c = 0.\;$ Interpret this as a quadratic equation in $z^2,$ one of whose roots is $w.$ As in my 2nd approach in the My Attack Of Problem (iii) section, $\;E,\;$ must be readily factorable into two
2nd degree polynomials. Further, each of the two polynomials must be readily solvable. This
means that for each polynomial, its resultant expression $\;\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac},\;$ must be readily computable. This means that the sine and cosine of the
corresponding principal Argument must be readily computable. Note:  Since there is flexibility in choosing any equation $\;E,\;$ one of whose
roots is $w,$ there needs to be guidelines for designing $\;E,\;$ so that is readily factorable into two 2nd degree polynomials, each of whom
is readily solvable. My Related Questions I am way out of my depth here, and request responses from professional
mathematicians. Ignoring my tangential approach, is there a standard method
of computing the square roots of such a messy complex number as $w_1.$ Is my tangential approach viable?  Is it a standard method?  Are there
guidelines for designing the corresponding helper equation $\;E$ ?",['complex-analysis']

Now, if we evaluate this, we get $0$ because $\int_{0}^{2\pi}sin(\theta)=0$ . So the result will simply be $0$ even if the original vector field could seem a bit intimidating.

Also, the integrals over the two ""surface circles"", where $z=0$ and $z=1$ , also yield $0$ because for the first one, we integrate over $0$ and for the second, we have $4y$ which is again odd over a symmetric interval.

Suppose that $X - (Z \cup H)$ is a local complete intersection.  Then $\pi_i((X-Z) \cap H) \to \pi_i(X-Z)$ is an isomorphism for $i<n-1$ . Here is a recipe for counter-examples: take $X$ to be a smooth variety (so the l.c.i condition is automatic) and $Z=H$ .  The claim seems to fail because $H$ was not generic, and indeed if we added the assumption that $H$ is generic then the claim would follow from the ""furthermore"" part of the theorem.

A student I'm tutoring came to me with this problem. I believe the limit is not one-sided, so that the expression approaches $-\infty$ as $x\to\alpha$ from either direction. I believe this would require $x=\alpha$ to be a zero of the denominator, so that $$x^3-2x+m=(x-\alpha)(x^2+\alpha x+\alpha^2-2)+\alpha^3-2\alpha+m$$ The remainder term should vanish, so $$\alpha^3-2\alpha+m=0$$ But in order for the limit to diverge to the ""same"" $-\infty$ from either side of $x=\alpha$ , I'm under the impression that $x=\alpha$ should actually be a zero of multiplicity $2$ . (I'm picturing the behavior of $-\dfrac1{x^2}$ around $x=0$ .) Then we'd have $$x^2+\alpha x+\alpha^2-2=(x-\alpha)(x+2\alpha)+3\alpha^2-2$$ Again the remainder should be $0$ , so that $$3\alpha^2-2=0\implies\alpha=\pm\sqrt{\frac23}\implies m=\pm\frac43\sqrt{\frac23}$$ When I check the limits for either pair of $(\alpha,m)$ , I find $$\lim_{x\to-\sqrt{\frac23}}\frac{x-2}{x^3-2x-\frac43\sqrt{\frac23}}=\color{red}+\infty$$ $$\lim_{x\to\sqrt{\frac23}}\frac{x-2}{x^3-2x+\frac43\sqrt{\frac23}}=-\infty$$ It seems that the sign of $\dfrac{x-2}{x+2\alpha}$ dictates whether the limit diverges to positive or negative infinity. This explanation seems a bit too hand-wavy and perhaps too verbose for a high-school-level calculus student.

I know the solutions $(p,q)=(3,5),(5,13),(11,61),(19,181),(29,421)$ but I don't know that these are the only ones (indeed, it seems likely there are many more). Some incomplete thoughts: I immediately made the factorisation $(p+1)(p-1)=2(q-1)$ , and because $p$ is obviously odd, let $p=2p_1+1$ . This leads us to the equation $2p_1(p_1+1)=q-1$ . If we substituted $q=2q_1+1$ we have $p_1(p_1+1)=q_1$ , so $q$ is twice of the product of two consecutive integers, plus one. It follows that $q$ is $1$ mod $4$ , and $p^2$ is $1$ mod $8$ . The same conclusion can be obtained simply by noting that $-1$ must be a quadratic residue mod $2q$ , hence $1$ is a $4$ th power residue mod $2q$ . By Lagrange's Theorem we have $4\mid\phi(2q)=q-1$ , so $q \equiv1$ mod $4$ . Any further thoughts are appreciated!","['number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'prime-numbers', 'diophantine-equations']"

3055784,Deriving Bayesian logistic regression,"I'm attempting to understand Bayesian logistic regression clearly, and I'm uncertain about (among other things) what is the most clear or most correct notation to use. Here is my current attempt at explaining Bayesian logistic regression: Suppose that we have a large population of objects (such as emails), each of which is described
by a feature vector $x \in \mathbb R^p$ and a class label $y \in \{0,1\}$ (spam or not spam, for example).
Consider the experiment of selecting an item at random from this population.
Let $X$ and $Y$ be the feature vector and the label of the selected item (so $X$ and $Y$ are random variables).
The goal of logistic regression is to find an approximation to the function $$
x \mapsto P(Y = 1 \mid X = x).
$$ To achieve this goal, logistic regression makes a modeling assumption that there exists a vector $a \in \mathbb R^p$ and a scalar $b \in \mathbb R$ such that $$
P(Y = 1 \mid X = x) = S(a^T x + b),
$$ where $S$ is the sigmoid function defined by $$
S(u) = \frac{e^u}{1 + e^{u}}.
$$ Logistic regression computes the parameters $a$ and $b$ using maximum likelihood estimation. However , we can also take a Bayesian approach to estimating $a$ and $b$ by incorporating prior beliefs about the values of $a$ and $b$ .
The parameters $a$ and $b$ are now viewed as being random variables.
To be concrete, let's make the assumption that $b$ and the components of $a$ are independent and normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $\sigma^2$ . The joint PDF of $a$ and $b$ will be denoted by $f_{a,b}$ . Consider the experiment of selecting $n$ objects at random (with replacement) from the population. Let $X_i$ and $Y_i$ be the feature vector and corresponding class label for the $i$ th object selected (so $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are random variables). Let $x_i$ and $y_i$ be the specific values of $X_i$ and $Y_i$ that we observe when we collect our training data. [ Here is where I think the notation gets difficult. ] Let $f$ be the PDF of the random variable $(X_1,Y_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_n)$ . Let $f_{X_i,Y_i}$ be the joint PDF of $X_i$ and $Y_i$ , and let $f_{X_i}$ be the PDF of $X_i$ .
According to Bayes' theorem, we have \begin{align*}
 &\quad f_{a,b}(\hat a, \hat b \mid (X_i,Y_i) = (x_i,y_i) \text{ for } i = 1,\ldots, n) \\
\propto &\quad    f(x_1,y_1,\ldots,x_n,y_n \mid a = \hat a, b = \hat b) f_{a,b}(\hat a, \hat b) \\
=&\quad  f_{a,b}(\hat a, \hat b) \Pi_{i=1}^n f_{X_i,Y_i}(x_i,y_i \mid a = \hat a, b = \hat b) \\
=&\quad  f_{a,b}(\hat a, \hat b) \Pi_{i=1}^n P(Y_i = y_i \mid X_i = x_i, a = \hat a, b = \hat b)  f_{X_i}(x_i \mid a = \hat a, b = \hat b) \\
=&\quad  f_{a,b}(\hat a, \hat b) \Pi_{i=1}^n P(Y_i = y_i \mid X_i = x_i, a = \hat a, b = \hat b)  f_{X_i}(x_i). \\
\end{align*} In the last step, we assumed that $X_i, a$ , and $b$ are independent. Now taking the natural log of the final expression and omitting terms that do not depend on $\hat a$ or $\hat b$ , we see that a maximum a posteriori estimate of $a$ and $b$ can be found by maximizing $$
\frac{-\| \hat a \|^2 - \hat b^2}{2 \sigma^2} + \sum_{i=1}^n \log(S(\hat a^T x_i + \hat b))
$$ with respect to $\hat a$ and $\hat b$ .
This is a convex optimization problem, which can be solved using a method such as gradient ascent. (Further simplifications to the objective function are possible, but I'm not concerned with how to explain the remaining steps.) Here are some questions: Is this derivation correct? Do you see any errors? How can the notation be improved, clarified, or simplified? I want the notation to be perfectly correct (by the standards of a mathematician) but also clear. I think the statement Let $f$ be the PDF of the random variable $(X_1,Y_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_n)$ is incorrect because the random variables $Y_i$ are not continuous, so the term ""PDF"" can't be used here. How should this statement be rephrased? I'd be interested in hearing any comments or opinions about how to clarify the above derivation, including comments about picky details or tangential comments.","['regression', 'statistics', 'probability']"

Wikipeida article that says the derivatives must be continuous: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative#Directional_derivatives Other places that don't: http://mathonline.wikidot.com/higher-order-directional-derivatives http://www.astrosen.unam.mx/~aceves/Metodos/ebooks/hildebrand.pdf (page 275-276) http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DirectionalDerivative.html","['partial-derivative', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus']"

S : A \to \mathcal P(B) \\
S(a) =  \{ \text{complicated expression here using $a$} \}
$$ Later, I prove that $\forall a,~\exists x, ~S(a) = \{ x \}$ . So, I want to now construct some notation for referring to the set with a single element $\{ x \} \subset B$ . Something like $$unset(S(a))$$ where $unset$ is some valid definition / notation.","['elementary-set-theory', 'notation']"
