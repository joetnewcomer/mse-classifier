126142,Uniform convergence of sequence of convex  functions,"Let $\{f_n\}$ converge point-wise to $f$, where each $f_n:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and each $f_n$ is a continuous convex function. Furthermore, assume that $f$ is continuous. Prove that the convergence is uniform. I was trying to do something like: Consider $a=a_0<a_i<...<a_k=b$, where $a_{i+1}-a_i<\delta$, where the $\delta $ is such that $|x-y|<\delta$ imply that $|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$. Then letting $N_i$ be such that $f_n(a_i)$ is $\epsilon$-close to $f(x_i)$, let $N$ be the max of $N_1,...,N_k$, and hence$$|f(x)-f_n(x)|\leq |f(x)-f(x_i)|+|f(x_i)-f_n(x_i)|+|f_n(x_i)-f_n(x)|$$I can make the first summand small since $f$ is continuos, and the second summand small by letting $n\geq N$.

126215,An equivalent definition of uniform integrability,"Let $(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ be a measure space and $\{f\}$ be a sequence of functions on $X$, each of which is integrable over $X$. Show that $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable if and only if for each $\varepsilon \gt 0$, there is a $\delta \gt 0$ such that for any natural number $n$ and measurable subset $E$ of $X$, if $\mu(E) \lt \delta$, $$ \left|\int_E f_n~d\mu\right| \lt \epsilon.$$ I think one direction $(\Rightarrow)$ is clear. Since $f_n$ being uniformly integrable imply that for every $\varepsilon\gt 0,~\exists \delta \gt 0$ such that for any $E\in \mathcal{M},~\mu(E)\lt \delta$, $\int_E |f_n|~d\mu$ for every natural $n$.

126250,Difference in probability distributions from two different kernels,"I wonder if the probability kernels of Markov processes on the same state space are close enough, does it also hold for the probabilities of the event that depend only on first $n$ values of the process. More formally, let $(E,\mathscr E)$ be a measurable  space and put $(E^n,\mathscr E^n)$, where $\mathscr E^n$ is the product $\sigma$-algebra. We say that $P$ is a stochastic kernel on $E$ if
$$
P:E\times\mathscr E\to [0,1]
$$ 
is such that $P(x,\cdot)$ is a probability measure on $(E,\mathscr E)$ for all $x\in E$ and $x\mapsto P(\cdot,A)$ is a measurable function for all $A\in \mathscr E$. On the space $b\mathscr E$ of real-valued bounded measurable functions with a sup-norm $\|f\| = \sup\limits_{x\in E}|f(x)|$ we define the operator
$$
Pf(x) = \int\limits_E f(y)P(x,dy).
$$
Its induced norm is given by $\|P\| = \sup\limits_{f\in b\mathscr E\setminus 0}\frac{\|Pf\|}{\|f\|}.$ Furthermore, for any stochastic kernel $P$ we can assign the family of probability measures $(\mathsf P_x)_{x\in E}$ on $(E^n,\mathscr E^n)$ which is defined uniquely by
$$
\mathsf P_x(A_0\times A_1\times \dots\times A_n) = 1_{A_0}(x)\int\limits_{A_n}\dots \int\limits_{A_1}P(x,dx_1)\dots P(x_{n-1},dx_n).
$$ Let us consider another kernel $\tilde P$ which as well defines the operator on $b\mathscr E$ and the family of probability measures $\tilde{\mathsf P}_x$ on $(E^n,\mathscr E^n)$. I wonder what is the upper-bound on 
$$
\sup\limits_{x\in E}\sup\limits_{F\in \mathscr E^n}|\tilde{\mathsf P}_x(F) - \mathsf P_x(F)|.
$$ By induction it is easy to prove that
$$
\sup\limits_{x\in E}|\tilde{\mathsf P}_x(A_0\times A_1\times \dots\times A_n)-\mathsf P_x(A_0\times A_1\times \dots\times A_n)|\leq n\cdot\|\tilde P - P\|

126269,Realizing $S_n$ as a Galois group,"My question is about the realization of the symmetric group $S_n$ as a galois group of a real and normal field extension $K/\mathbb Q$. As I read, such a field $K$ can be obtained as the splitting field of a polynomial $$f(x)=\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 x + ... + \alpha_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ x^n \in \mathbb Q[x] $$ in which all the coefficients $\alpha_i$ have to be integral for the prime numbers 2 and 3. Furthermore, the following properties have to be satisfied: (1)  $\ f \text{ mod }3$ is irreducible (2)  $\ f \equiv (x^2+x+1)\cdot f_1 \cdots  f_k \text{  mod }2$ where $f_i \in \mathbb Z / 2 \mathbb Z[x]$ are different and irreducible polynomials with odd degree. (3) $f$ have to be near at $(x-1)\cdot (x-2) \cdots (x-n) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + ... + \beta_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ x^n$, that does mean $|\alpha_i - \beta_i|< \varepsilon$ for all $i$ and $\varepsilon$ should be chosen so small, that there are $n$ real roots of $f$. Now, it is claimed, that because of (1) the galois group of $f$ over $\mathbb Q$ is a transitive subgroup of $\mathbb S_n$. I think, this is true, because of the fact, that $f$ is also irreducible in $\mathbb Q[x]$ and therefore the galois group acts transitively on the roots of $f$. Ok, now comes an assertion that I don't understand: Because of (2) the galois group of $f$ over $\mathbb Q$ contains a transposition. Please could you explain that to me? I think, (2) shows, that there is a permutation of the form $(ab)(...)...(...)$. But how to continue the argument? If the galois group contains a transposition, than it is $S_n$ (this is clear and well-known). And the second assertion I don't understand well: ""Because of (3) the splitting field $K$ of $f$ is real."" How to explain this in detail?

126322,how to prove that countably compact D-space is compact,"In the paper A survey of D-spaces by Gary Gruenhage it is written that it is easily seen that any countably compact D-space is compact. However I'm not able to show it. Here is my attempt to prove this claim: Let $(X, \tau)$ be a countably compact D-space with topology $\tau$. Consider a function $N: X \rightarrow \tau$ with $x \in N(x)$ for every $x \in X$ (neighborhood assignment function). I think that to prove compactness of $X$ it is enough to show that open cover $\{N(x):x \in X\}$ of $X$ has finite subcover. Because $X$ is a D-space, there is a closed discrete subset $D$ of $X$ such that $\{N(x):x \in D\}$ covers $X$. It seem to me that to complete the proof (using countable compactness of $X$) I need to use the fact that $D$ is countable. However it is not true in general that close discrete set is countable. 
Thank you for your help! Michal Čihák Note 1. The considered spaces are regular and $T_1$. Note 2.

126336,Is Mega Millions Positive Expected Value?,"Given the rapid rise of the Mega Millions jackpot in the US (now advertised at \$640 million and equivalent to a ""cash"" prize of about \$448 million), I was wondering if there was ever a point at which the lottery became positive expected value (EV), and, if so, what is that point or range? Also, a friend and I came up with two different ways of looking at the problem, and I'm curious if they are both valid. First, it is simple to calculate the expected value of the ""fixed"" prizes. The first five numbers are selected from a pool of 56, the final ""mega"" ball from a pool of 46. (Let us ignore taxes in all of our calculations... one can adjust later for one's own tax rate which will vary by state). The expected value of all these fixed prizes is \$0.183. So, then you are paying \$0.817 for the jackpot prize. My plan was then to calculate the expected number of winners of the jackpot (multiple winners split the prize) to get an expected jackpot amount and multiply by the probability of selecting the winning numbers (given by $\binom{56}{5} * 46 = 1 \text{ in } 175,711,536$). The number of tickets sold can be easily estimated since \$0.32 of each ticket is added to the prize, so: ( Current Cash Jackpot - Previous Cash Jackpot ) / 0.32 = Tickets Sold
$(448 - 252) / 0.32 = 612.5$ million tickets sold (!!). (The cash prizes are lower than the advertised jackpot. Currently, they are about 70% of the advertised jackpot.) Obviously, one expects multiple winners, but I can't figure out how to get a precise estimate, and various web sources seem to be getting different numbers. Alternative methodology: My friend's methodology, which is far simpler, is to say 50% of this drawing's sales will be paid out in prizes (\$0.18 to fixed prizes and \$0.32 to the jackpot). Add to that the carried over jackpot amount (\$250 million cash prize from the unwon previous jackpot) that will also be paid out. So, your expected value is $\$250$ million / 612.5 million tickets sold = \$0.40 from the previous drawing + \$0.50 from this drawing = \$0.90 total expected value for each \$1 ticket purchased (before taxes). Is this a valid approach or is it missing something? It's far simpler than anything I found while searching the web for this. Added: After considering the answer below, this is why I don't think my friend's methodology can be correct: it neglects the probability that no one will win. For instance, if a $1$ ticket was sold, the expected value of that ticket would not be $250 million + 0.50 since one has to consider the probability of the jackpot not being paid out at all. So, additional question: what is this probability and how do we find it? (Obviously it is quite small when $612.5$ million tickets are sold and the odds of each one winning is $1:175.7$ million.) Would this allow us to salvage this methodology? So, is there a point that the lottery will be positive EV?

Thanking you in advance. $Proof.$ I have tried to work it out using the defination that $\{e_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ is complete in $L^2(w)$ if $\langle f,e_n\rangle=0$ implies that $f=0$ a.e. Let $f\in L^2(w)$ and suppose that $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)x^nw(x)dx=0$  for all $n\ge0$, then 
\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{itx}w(x)dx=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(it)^n}{n!}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)x^nw(x)dx=0
\end{align}
Thus, since the fourier transform is zero, $f(x)=0$ a.e. and so $\{x^n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ is complete in $L^2(w)$ by definition. Could this be ok and how can i be sure that this fourier transform exists or is analytic so that even the interchange of sum and integral can be valid by beppo-levi lemma?","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

126473,Rudin: Real and Complex Analysis [Lusin's Theorem],"I checked the questions pertaining to Lusin's theorem on this site, but it didn't have the answer I was looking for. But as I am carefully going through Rudin Chapter 2, it's been a challenge for me. For any of you that has the book on hand, I would like to pose this question to you. I'm a bit confused on two parts in the theorem, but everything throughout the proof seems fine to me. On page 55 of Rudin, in the first paragraph of the proof section, he says to attach a sequence $\{s_n\}$ to $f$, as in the proof of Theorem $1.17$, and put $t_1 = s_1$ and $t_n = s_n - s_{n-1}$ for $n \geq 2$. He then concludes that $2^nt_n$ is the characteristic function of a set $T_n \subset A$. My question is that when he says attach $\{s_n\}$ to $f$ as in 1.17, does he mean $s_n = \phi_n \circ f$ as stated in 1.17? As I was trying to work out how $2^nt_n$ is the characteristic function of a set $T_n \subset A$, I was unable to. By $T_n$ does he mean the set of points that belong to the range of $t_n$? As far as I know from 1.17, $s_n$ is just the step function that approximates $f(x) = x$, but as I tried different examples of $t_n$, I don't really know how Rudin gets $2^nt_n$ as the char. function of $T_n$. If anyone can clarify this, I would appreciate this. One more thing. In the third paragraph of the proof section, he says ""Since $2^{-n}h_n(x) = t_n(x)$ except in $V_n - K_n$"", how did he come to conclude this? Thanks again.",['measure-theory']

126560,interesting series involving sin and nth roots of unity.,"I ran across an interesting series involving the square of sine.  It was solved in a clever manner I do not quite get. $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{1}{1+8\sin^{2}(\frac{k\pi}{n})}$$ The solution involved the nth roots of unity. $$\sin^{2}\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right)=\frac{2-L^{k}-L^{-k}}{4},$$ where $$L=\displaystyle e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n}}$$ Which becomes $$\frac{1}{1+8\sin^{2}(\frac{k\pi}{n})}=\frac{1}{3}\left[\frac{1}{2L^{k}-1}-\frac{2}{L^{k}-2}\right]$$ Noting that $$L^{k}, \;\ (0\leq k\leq n-1)$$ are the nth roots of unity, the following series are used: $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{1}{2L^{k}-1}=\frac{n}{2^{n}-1}$$ and $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{1}{L^{k}-2}=\frac{n2^{n-1}}{1-2^{n}}.$$ My question is, how are those last two closed form for the series evaluated? This much is explained: By noting that $$z^{n}=1$$ and using $$y=\frac{1}{2z-1}, \;\ z=\frac{y+1}{2y},$$ we can construct $$\left(\frac{y+1}{2y}\right)^{n}=1.$$ Then, $$(y+1)^{n}=2^{n}y^{n}.\tag1$$ Then, $$(1-2^{n})y^{n}+ny^{n-1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot +1=0.\tag2$$ So, from this last equation we get $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}y_{k}=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{1}{2L^{k}-1}=\frac{n}{2^{n}-1},$$ where $$y_{k}$$ are the roots of the equation in $(2).$ My problem is, I still do not quite understand that last line and how that closed form is found.

126583,Does $|n^2 \cos n|$ diverge to $+\infty$?,"I was recently exposed to the problem of deciding whether
$$ \lim_{n \to +\infty} |n \cos n| = +\infty$$
where the limit is taken over the integers. As $|\cos n|$ oscillates throughout the interval $[0,1]$, it seems plausible that every real number ought to be a limit point of this sequence. But to show the limit doesn't exist, it's enough to show the sequence is less than $2$ infinitely often, and this can be done with continued fractions: we can find arbitrarily large $p$ and $q$ with $q$ odd such that
$$ \left| \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{p}{q} \right| < \frac{1}{q^2} $$
which implies
$$ \left| \frac{q-1}{2} \pi + \frac{\pi}{2} - p \right| < \frac{1}{q} $$
making $p$ a good approximation of $\pi/2$ modulo $\pi$, and thus
$$ \left| p \cos p \right| < \frac{p}{q} < 2 $$ This method fails if we consider instead the sequence $n^{1+\epsilon} \cos n$, since the final inequality is an increasing function of $n$. In fact, a heuristic statistical argument suggests that
$$ \lim_{n \to +\infty} |n^{1 + \epsilon} \cos n| = +\infty $$
really does hold: imagine the $n$'s are actually uniformly randomly selected from $[0, \pi]$, there is a roughly $2p/\pi$ chance that $|\cos n| < p$. For any positive constant $B$, the expected number of terms of $n^{1 + \epsilon} |\cos n|$ which are less than $B$ is
$$ \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} \frac{2B}{\pi n^{1 + \epsilon}} $$
which, in particular, is finite. Of course, this is just heuristic. Does anyone know of a proof or disproof of the conjecture
$$ \lim_{n \to +\infty} |n^{1 + \epsilon} \cos n| = +\infty $$
for positive real numbers $\epsilon$, where the limit is taken only over integers? EDIT: Since there have been a few erroneous answers, I'll point out that observing $|\cos n|$ oscillates from 0 to 1 is not enough to show the limit does not exist. Consider the sequence $g(n)$ defined by $g(0) = 1$ $g(n) = \max\{ g(n-1), n / |\cos n| \} + 1$ Then $g(n)$ is an unbounded increasing sequence such that $|g(n) \cos n| > n$ for all $n$, and thus $$ \lim_{n \to +\infty} |g(n) \cos n| = +\infty $$ Roughly speaking, $g(n)$ diverges to $+\infty$ faster than $n \pmod \pi$ can approximate $\pi / 2$. The question of this post is whether $n^2$ (or $n^{1 + \epsilon}$) also diverges to $+\infty$ fast enough.","['conjectures', 'sequences-and-series']"

It asks to show that the cosine of an angle of a rational triangle can be written in one of the forms $f(\alpha,\beta)=\dfrac{\alpha^2-\beta^2}{\alpha^2+\beta^2}$ or $g(\alpha,\beta)=\dfrac{2\alpha\beta}{\alpha^2+\beta^2}$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are coprime positive integers. The first form I can get.  Following logic similar to previous examples, draw in the height of the triangle, making a right triangle. The hypoteneuse is one side of the rational triangle and the height is opposite one of the angles of the rational triangle (or $180^o$ minus it, the book doesn't seem to consider this case).  The book makes a quick reference that the length of the other leg must be rational since the cosine must be rational due to the law of cosines.

Then we have $$h^2=x^2-z^2=(x+z)(x-z)$$ Following the book's example, there exists a rational $m$ such that $$x+z=m,x-z=\frac {h^2}m$$ This system can be solved for $x$ and $z$.  Then we get our cosine is $\frac zx=\frac{m^2-h^2}{m^2+h^2}$.  (Of course if the angle of the rational triangle is obtuse,we found the cosine of the supplementary angle and the cosine of the angle we actually want is $\frac{h^2-m^2}{h^2+m^2}$.) Multiply top and bottom by the square of the lowest common denominator of $h$ and $m$ and divide by the square of the gcd of their numerators to get the first form. This seems to imply that the cosine of any angle of a rational triangle can be written in this form.  I have no idea how to obtain the $g(\alpha,\beta)$ form unless we deal with pythagorean triples, in which knowing the form makes it rather trivial.  So first of all, how do I obtain the form $g(\alpha,\beta)?$ It also seems that these forms are not mutually exclusive.  For example, $f(3,1)=g(2,1)=\frac45$.  If we ignore the requirement that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are positive, are there values that can be written in one form, but not the other?","['geometry', 'triangles', 'trigonometry', 'diophantine-equations']"

126803,Generating function for the factorial sequence,"As asked in the title, I am trying to arrive at the generating function $\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}k!x^k$ just by starting with the generating function with constant 1 sequence $f(x) = \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}x^k$ and using the operation of differentiating $f(x)$ and shifting the terms in the sequence by multiplying $f(x)$ by $x$. My attempt of the problem (which I believe is wrong). Start with the following: $f(x) = \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}x^k$ We differentiating it $k$ times and get $f^{(k)} = \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}k!x^0 = \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}k!$ Then we shift the terms in the sequence by multiplying $x^k$ to $f^{(k)}$ and we get $x^kf^{(k)} = \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}k!x^k$. This I believe is wrong because if we look at the $k^{\mathrm{th}}$ partial sum of $f(x)$, then differentiating the $k^{\mathrm{th}}$ partial term $k$ times gives us $k!$ and multiplying this by $x^k$ gives us $k!x^k$, not $\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{k}k!x^k$. I understand the example of how to get from $f(x)$ to getting a generating function of sequence of squares or cubes by differentiating $f(x)$ and multiplying the result by $x$ and repeating this process once more.

126810,A graded ring $R$ is graded-local iff $R_0$ is a local ring?,"Update: I've copied this question over to mathoverflow.net: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/100755/a-graded-ring-r-is-graded-local-iff-r-0-is-a-local-ring to see if I get any answers there. Let $R$ be a $\bf{Z}$-graded ring (with no commutativity assumptions whatsoever). Recall that $R$ is ""graded-local"" if the following equivalent conditions hold: $R$ has a unique homogeneous left ideal that is maximal among the proper homogeneous left ideals; $R$ has a unique homogeneous right ideal that is maximal among the proper homogeneous right ideals; $R\neq 0$ and the sum of two homogeneous non-units is again a non-unit. Note, in particular, that (3) tells us that $R_0$, the ring of degree 0 elements, is a local ring. But it seems to me that the converse is true. That is, it seems to me that a $\bf{Z}$-graded ring $R$ is ""graded-local"" if and only if $R_0$ is a local ring. Since this seems a bit suspicious, I have come here to find out if this is really the case. Here is my argument:
Let $J^g(R)$ denote the intersection of all the homogeneous left ideals that are maximal among the proper homogeneous left ideals. (This is the ""graded Jacobson radical"". Note that there should be at least one such ""maximal homogeneous left ideal"" because $R\neq 0$). As an intersection of proper homogeneous left ideals, $J^g(R$) is a proper homogeneous left ideal. I claim that it is maximal among the proper homogeneous left ideals, and hence is the unique such ""maximal homogeneous left ideal"". Consider a homogeneous left ideal $I$ with $J^g(R) \subsetneq I$. Since $I$ is homogeneous there exists a homogeneous element $a\in I$ with $a \not\in J^g(R)$. Since $a$ is not in $J^g(R)$ there exists a maximal homogeneous left ideal $\frak{m}$ with $a \not \in \frak{m}$. Well, $R a + \frak{m}$ is a homogeneous left ideal, so by maximality of $\frak{m}$, $1=ra + m$ for some $r\in R$ and $m \in \frak{m}$. Taking the degree 0 components we have $1=r_0a + m_0$ where $m_0$ is a degree zero element in $\frak{m}$ and $r_0a$ is also homogeneous of degree 0. Thus, since $R_0$ is local, either $m_0$ or $r_0a$ is a unit. But $m_0$ cannot be a unit (since it would contradict the properness of $\frak{m}$). Hence $r_0a$ is a unit. In particular, $r_0a$ is left invertible, and thus $a$ is also left invertible. Thus, $I=R$. We conclude that $J^g(R)$ is a ""maximal homogeneous left ideal"" and hence is the unique such. Can you see any problems with this? Is it really true that a $\bf{Z}$-graded ring $R$ is graded-local iff $R_0$ is local? Update: It is clear that an $\bf{N}$-graded ring $R$ is ""graded local"" iff $R_0$ is local. (If ${\frak m}_0$ is the unique maximal left ideal of $R_0$ then ${\frak m} := {\frak m}_0 \oplus \bigoplus_{d>0} R_d$ is the unique maximal left ideal of $R$.) But the (easy) argument for $\bf{N}$-graded rings doesn't work for $\bf{Z}$-graded rings.","['noncommutative-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Observation 1: If $n$ is odd and $n \geq 3$, then $\alpha$ and its conjugates are even permutations (since they all have the same cycle structure), so $\langle \operatorname{Cl}(\alpha) \rangle$ contains only even permutations, and thus is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n < S_n$.

127001,"Infinite nilpotent group, any normal subgroup intersects the center nontrivially","Having problems with the following statement: If $N$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of a nilpotent group $G$ then $N \cap Z(G) \neq \langle e \rangle$ Here $Z(G)$ denotes the center of $G$. I've solved the finite case, where I reduced the problem to proving that a p-$group$ has this property. The infinite case resists my attempts though. Since $G$ is nilpotent, the ascending central series ends with $G$ itself:
$\langle e\rangle \subseteq Z_1(G) \subseteq \ldots \subseteq Z_n(G) = G$ where $Z_1(G) = Z(G)$. Since $N \subseteq G$, there must be a smallest $i$ such that $N \cap Z_i(G) \neq \langle e \rangle$. I would like to show that $i = 1$ in this case, or perhaps just show that $N \cap Z_i(G)$ commutes with elements of $G$. Could somebody give me a tip in the right direction?",['group-theory']

  Find out whether it is positive or negative for all $x \in (0, \frac{\pi}{2})$, or whether it changes sign. Prove your answer.

The problem: I'd have to calculate the $\tan$ power series and show various properties of the Bernoulli numbers. Big hassle. Straight up approximation: I've spent most of the time on this method, but I always overestimate, causing me to lose the strict inequality. This was using various trig identities and just basic stuff like $\sin{x} < x < \tan{x}$ on $(0, \frac{\pi}{2})$. Integrating and more approximating.

127041,initial problem ODE solve with Laplace Transformation,"Consider the initial value problem: $$x''(t) +3x'(t)+2x(t)= t + (ae^{-(t-a)}-t) H(t-a)$$ $$x(0)=0$$ $$x'(0)=0$$ where $a>0$ is constant and $H$ is the Heaviside function. Let $f(t)=t + (ae^{-(t-a)}-t) H(t-a)$ . Applying the Laplace transformation with $ \mathcal{L \{x(t) \}}=X(s)$ and $\mathcal{L \{f(t) \} } =F(s)$ , and using the initial conditions, and after some calculation we get: $X(s) =\dfrac{F(s)}{(s+1)(s+2)}$ , from which we get $x(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{\dfrac{F(s)}{(s+1)(s+2)} \right\}$ . And so it is the case that: $$x(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{\frac{F(s)}{s+1} \right\}  -\mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{\frac{F(s)}{s+2} \right\}  = e^{-t}*f(t) - e^{-2t}*f(t)= e^{-t}(1-e^{-t})*f(t)$$ where $*$ is the operator of convolution.

So I got: $$2{\pi}i\biggl({f(a)\over a-b}+{f(b)\over b-a}\biggr)$$ Which equals
$$2{\pi}i\biggl({f(a)-f(b)\over a-b}\biggr)$$ and I got stuck here I don't quite see how I can get from this, plus $f(z)$ being bounded and analytic, that can tell me that $f(z)$ is a constant function.  Ugh, the more well known proof is so much simpler -.-

127112,Clever derivation of $\arcsin(x)$ Taylor series,"I was working the other day in the Math Help Centre, trying to help some first years with a calculus problem.  The problem involved investigating the Taylor series of $\arcsin(x)$.  Once the students had derived $$\arcsin(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(2n)!}{4^n(n!)^2(2n+1)}x^{2n+1}$$ they were asked to rederive it in a different way: Determine the sequence $\{c_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that $$x=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n \left(x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!}+\cdots\right)^n.$$ Here's what I got: I recognized that the object in parentheses is the Taylor series of $\sin(x)$, so the idea is to let $\arcsin(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_nx^n$ and note that $\arcsin(\sin(x))=x$.  After that it's just an issue of computing the $c_n$'s. There's an obvious brute-force way to do it, where for each $n$ you say ""indices larger than $n$ don't matter, so now it's a finite problem.""  Expand the relevant terms to get relations involving the $c_i$'s that you've already worked out.  The problem is that this will only work for finitely many values, and it was hard to determine a pattern. Is there and obvious pattern I'm missing?  It occurred to me that the ""relevant terms"" that contribute to $c_n$ depend on the divisors on $n$, is this intuition correct? Most importantly, what is the best way to solve the problem of computing $c_n$?","['calculus', 'taylor-expansion']"
