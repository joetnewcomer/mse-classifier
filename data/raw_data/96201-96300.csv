1323805,Why topology on a set is defined the way it is?,"Following is from Wolfram Mathworld ""A topological space, also called an abstract topological space, is a set X together with a collection of open subsets T that satisfies the four conditions: The empty set is in T. X is in T. The intersection of a finite number of sets in T is also in T. The union of an arbitrary number of sets in T is also in T. "" http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TopologicalSpace.html My question is why topology on a set is defined in this way? How these definition connect with our intuitive idea of different kind of topological space (i.e line, graphs, 3-sphere, torus etc). I am obviously new in topology and will be glad if you explain in basic term. I'd be specially interested to know how one differentiate between a straight line segment and a ""Y"" shaped graph using these definitions. I have convinced myself of one way, please let me know if it is correct. I can separate Y naturally in three segment let's name them a,b and c. Let X={a,b,c}. So the topology Y on X will be { {},{a,b,c},{a,b},{a,c},{b,c},{a},{b},{c}}. We can break a line segment on three part. Let's do likewise for line segment l. So the topology l on X will be { {},{a,b,c},{a,b},{b,c},{b}}. 
Topology Y and l are on X and obviously different. :)",['general-topology']
1323816,Formula for composition of formal power series with binomial coefficient,"Let $f=\sum\limits_{n\geq 0}{f_n x^n}$ and $g=\sum\limits_{n\geq 1}{g_n x^n}$ be formal power series. The $x^n$ coefficient of $f(g)$ is
$$
\sum\limits_{\mathbb{i} \in \mathcal{C}_{n}}
{f_k \,g_{i_1}\cdots g_{i_k}}
,
$$
where $\mathcal{C}_{n} = \{ (i_1, \ldots, i_k) : 1 \leq k \leq n, i_1 + \cdots + i_k = n \}$
is the set of compositions of $n$ into $k$ parts. Consider the power series $h=\sum\limits_{n\geq 0}{h_n x^n}$ with coefficient $$
	h_n =
\sum\limits_{\mathbb{i} \in \mathcal{C}_{n}}
{\binom{n}{k} f_k \,g_{i_1}\cdots g_{i_k}}

$$
Is there a ""nice"" way to express $h$ in terms of $f$ and $g$ or related generating series (eg. their e.g.f.s), where by ""nice"", I mean a formula that can be evaluated if $f$ and $g$ are at least rational functions with $g(0)=0$? UPDATE If we let $F=\sum\limits_{n\geq 0}{f_n \frac{x^n}{n!}}$ and $H=\sum\limits_{n\geq 0}{h_n \frac{x^n}{n!}}$ then, using the inverse Laplace transform $\mathcal{L}^{-1}$, we can write $$H = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{ F(s \,g(x/s))/s\}(1).$$ This is because $$\mathcal{L}^{-1}\{ s^{k-n}/s\}(1)=\frac{1}{(n-k)!}.$$ However this isn't what I want because I want $h$, not $H$, and; this formula is not ""nice"", as if $f=\frac{1}{1-x}$ (so $F=e^x$) and $g=\frac{x}{1-x}$, the expression for $H$ is an intractable integral, whereas $h=\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1-4x}}$.","['power-series', 'formal-power-series', 'generating-functions', 'combinatorics', 'binomial-coefficients']"

1323944,"Count permutations of $\{1,2,...,7\}$ without 4 consecutive numbers - is there a smart, elegant way to do this?","Here's a problem I've solved: Count permutations of $\{1,2,...,7\}$ without 4 consecutive numbers (e.g. 1,2,3,4). So I did it kinda brute-force way - let $A_i$ be the set of permutations of $[7]$, where $i,i+1,i+2,i+3$ are consecutive numbers. Only $A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4$ are non-empty, so we can use inclusion-exclusion principle.

Then the answer is $S_0-S_1+S_2-S_3+S_4$ by inclusion-exclusion principle. The question is - can the brute-force part of the solution be omitted?

1324111,Number of solutions to $z=\frac{1}{4}e^z$ inside the unit circle,"I'm trying to solve this using Rouche's theorem and I think I did. I'm completely winging this based on Wiki's article about it so please tell me if I'm off the ball. So the problem is actually finding the number of zeroes of $z-\frac{1}{4}e^z$ inside the unit circle. So I choose my $f$ function to be $z$ and my $g$ function to be $\frac{1}{4}e^z$. No I have to show that $|f(z)|>|g(z)|$ on the unit circle. $$|z|=1\Rightarrow z =\cos\phi+i\sin\phi\Rightarrow e^z=e^{\cos\phi}+e^{i\sin\phi}=e^{\cos\phi}+\cos\sin\phi+i\sin\sin\phi$$
Now the imaginary part of $-\frac{1}{4}e^z$ is in $[-\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4}]$ because $\sin$ is in $[-1,1]$, and the real part is in $[-\frac{e+1}{4},\frac{e+1}{4}]\approx[-0.93, 0.93]$. The point with the greatest absolute value in that rectangle is at $(0.93, 1/4)$ and it's absolute value is less than $1$. So I conclude that $|f(z)|$ is indeed greater than $|g(z)|$ on the unit circle, and since $f$ has one zero inside of it, $f+g$ which is the original function, also has one zero inside of the circle.",['complex-analysis']
1324114,When is a local contraction mapping globally contraction.,"Let $A$ be a complete metric space and $T:A\rightarrow A$ is an continuous operator.  There exists some $\Delta$ such that for $\forall x,y\in A$  and $d(x,y)<\Delta$, there's some $\epsilon <1$ s.t. $d(Tx,Ty)\le \epsilon d(x,y)$. This is what I mean by the ""local contraction"" property and I'm wondering when is $T$ is a global contraction. My conjecture is that when $T$ is an ""uniformly local contraction"", i.e. the $\Delta$ and $\epsilon$ are identical for all $x,y$. Then for arbitrarily chosen $x$ and $y$ we can always find some points between them in $A$, and the distance between each of those points are less than $\Delta$, then applying the triangle inequality gives the global contraction result. I'm not sure whether this is an established result or whether there are some traps to be aware of. Thank you! Specifically, I'm interested in the fixed point property about contraction mappings. I've read the paper Remarks on metric transforms and
fixed-point theorems that gives the result if any two points in $A$ can be joined by a rectifiable curve, then a local contraction acts like a global contraction in deriving fixed points. However the space $A$ I'm working on is a functional space and I'm fuzzy about the ""rectifiable curve"" concept and it seems I only need a weaker result than this.","['real-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"

1324206,The irrationality of rapidly converging series,"I recently saw a pretty elegant proof of the irrationality of $e$, namely: Let $s_n:=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{\frac{1}{k!}}$ such that $e=\lim_{n\to\infty} s_n$. We obviously have $s_n<e$ and furthermore $e=s_n+\frac{1}{(n+1)!}+\frac{1}{(n+2)!}+...=s_n+\frac{1}{n!}\left(\frac{1}{(n+1)}+\frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)}+...\right)<s_n+\frac{1}{n!}\left(\frac{1}{(n+1)}+\frac{1}{(n+1)^2}+...\right)=s_n+\frac{1}{n!n}$. Therefore, we have $n!s_n<n!e<n!s_n+\frac{1}{n}$. If $e$ was rational, then $e=\frac p q$ for $p,q\in\mathbb N$. But since we can choose $n$ arbitrarily high we can assume $n>q$. Then the numbers $n!s_n$ and $n!e$ are clearly integers and we get $n!s_n<n!e<n!s_n+\frac{1}{n}≤n!s_n+1$, contradiction. I adapted this proof to show the irrationality of numbers like $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^{n^2}}$ which for me raised the following question: This kind of proof seems to be working well with rapidly converging series.

1324460,Composition of 2 Lebesgue measurable functions is not lebesgue measurable: Are these two functions Borel Measurable?,"Background Let $(X,\mathcal{A})$ be a measure space and $\mathcal{B}$ the Borel $\sigma-$algebra. A function $f: (X,\mathbb{\mathcal{A}}) \rightarrow  (\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B})$ is $\mathcal{A}$ measurable if for all real $\alpha$, $\{x:f(x)>\alpha\}\in \mathcal{A}$. In particular, if $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lebesgue $\sigma-$ algebra, $f:(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{L}) \rightarrow (\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B})$ is Lebesgue measurable if it satisfies the above definition. Claim 1: If $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is Lebesgue measurable and
$g:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then $g \circ f$
is Lebesgue measurable. Proof: Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Since the inverse image under a continuous function of an open set is an open set,
$G=\{x:g(x)>\alpha\}$ is open and therefore a Borel set. Since
$\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{L}$, and $f$ is Lebesgue measurable, we
see that $f^{-1}(G) \in \mathcal{L}$. Therefore $g \circ f$ is
Lebesgue measurable. Claim 2: A slight modification of the above proof shows that the above result holds if $g$ is Borel measurable instead of continuous. Claim 3 If $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $g:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are both Lebesgue measurable,
then $g \circ f$ need not be Lebesgue measurable. Proof Let $C$ be the cantor set. Note that $C$ has Lebesgue measure $0$. Let $f: [0,1] \rightarrow C$ be the well known strictly
increasing function that maps the interval $[0,1]$ onto $C$. Then $f$
is Borel measurable and therefore Lebesgue measurable. Let $V \subset
   [0,1]$ be the vitali set. Since the Lebesgue measure is complete, we
find that $f(V) \subset C$ is lebesgue measurable (with measure
zero). Let $g:C \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be the indicator function for
$f(V)$, i.e, $g=\chi_{f(V)}$. Then $g$ is Lebesgue measurable by
direct verification.  However, $\{x:g\circ f>0\}=V$ which is not
Lebesgue measurable. Question Doesn't the counterexample in claim 3 contradict claim 2, due to $f$ and $g$ both being Borel measurable?",['measure-theory']

Call $\xi = (x_k)_{k \geq 0}$, naturally. I want to prove now that $\xi_n \stackrel{n \to +\infty}{\longrightarrow_{\rm d}} \xi$, but I'm unsure of how to bound each ${\rm d}_k(x_k^{(n)},x_k)$. And even if I could, I would have a special $n_0^{(k)}$ for each sequence, and nothing ensures that $\sup_{k \geq 0}n_0^{(k)} < +\infty$. Please help. Note: I looked around a bit in other questions here, such as this one and the related ones, but it wasn't helpful to me. With the comments, we can pick $k_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{2^k} < \epsilon$ for all $k  \geq k_0$.

The condition that a gradient of a surface at a point is zero means the point in consideration is an extremum. So the condition of the theorem excludes points that are ""completely flat"".

But what does a point on a surface look like if all the gradients vanish? and also: Why does this ""flatness"" prevent us from expressing one of the
  coordinates in terms of the other two?

1324628,Why can't epsilon depend on delta instead?,"When presented with $\lim_{x\to a}f(x) = L$, we are usually taught to intuitively think of $x$ approaching the value $a$ from both sides, with $f(x)$ getting closer and closer to the value $L$.

However, when rigorously proving that a limit exists, the notion of 'getting closer and closer to a value' is replaced with $\epsilon$-$\delta$ language. Intuitively, given $\epsilon>0$, no matter how small your 'strip' is around $L$, if I can always find a corresponding strip which ensures that the values of $f(x)$ will be within the strip around $L$, then I've proven that the limit exists. The rigorous definition requires that $\epsilon$ be given first. This makes sense. But if we challenge someone with $\delta$, and if our opponent fails to provide an $\epsilon$ so that $0<|x-a|<\delta$, wouldn't that prove that the limit doesn't exist? Why can't limits be defined this way instead of the other way round? I think this is more natural, because in the intuitive definition, we vary $x$ and observe what happens to $f(x)$. Suddenly, in the rigorous definition, we do the reverse: Pick values around $L$ and observe whether there are $x$'s which map to those values.

1324735,Sphere curvature as calculated from Liouville's equation,"Liouville's equation for Gauss curvature tells us, that when Riemannian metric has the form $f^2(du^2+dv^2)$, then its Gauss curvature $K$ is expressed by the following equation:
$$-Kf^2=\Delta_{0}log(f)$$
where $\Delta_{0}=\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial u^2}+\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial v^2}$. Consider a sphere with metric (due to stereographic projection):
$$\frac{du^2+dv^2}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}$$
Therefore we can apply Liouville's equation to find the curvature of the sphere with $f=\frac{1}{1+u^2+v^2}$.However, calculating the curvature of the sphere in this way I get $K=4$, which is not true. And I cann't spot my mistake. 
Here are some calculations:
$$log(f)=-log(1+u^2+v^2)$$
$$\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial u^2}log(f)=-\frac{2(1-u^2+v^2)}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}$$
$$\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial u^2}log(f)=-\frac{2(1+u^2-v^2)}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}$$
$$\Delta_{0}log(f)=-\frac{2(1-u^2+v^2)}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}-\frac{2(1+u^2-v^2)}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}=\frac{-4}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}$$
Therefore:
$$-K\frac{1}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}=\frac{-4}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}$$
Hence Gauss curvature of the sphere is (not):
$$K=4$$

1324763,(Non-Hopfian) groups that only have quotients that are themselves or the trivial group.,"A group is non-Hopfian provided it is isomorphic to a proper quotient. The classic, finitely presented, example of such a group is the Baumslag-Solitar group $$BS(2,3)= \langle x,t \mid t^{-1}x^2 t =x^3 \rangle \cong \langle x,t \mid t^{-1}x^2 t =x^3, x=(x^{-1}t^{-1}xt)^2 \rangle$$ and the projection map is not an isomorphism. Is there a non-Hopfian, non-Abelian, group with the property every quotient is either isomorphic to itself or the trivial group? (I figure there must be) This should probably be a separate question... How about (1) for finitely generated, without assuming the axiom of choice? Similarly, how about (1) for finitely presented, without choice? Note that $BS(2,3)$ is not such a group since we can quotient out $x$ and have a group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$ . Generally, if we have a finitely generated group, presented with minimal number of generators, with the above property, and quotient out by one of the generators, the new group can be generated by one less generator, so the quotient must be trivial. Relevant: This question asks for any example without the non-Abelian restriction, and is given an Abelian group, the Prüfer group $\mathbb{Z}[1/p]/\mathbb{Z}$ , and explains why, with the axiom of choice, there are no finitely generated examples.","['group-theory', 'hopfian', 'axiom-of-choice']"

More detailed: if we have some smooth manifold M and the cotangent space $T_{x}M^{*}$ I know that the momentum p is an element of $T_{x}M^{*}$, but I have no intuition why. In my theoretical mechanics lecture my professor told us that the generalized momentum with components $p_{a}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}^{a}}$ from Hamilton mechanics is a covector, but we never spoke about the ""regular"" momentum $p=mv$. Is it a covector too? Edit: I read that linked article before I wrote mine and I think mine is not a duplicate. The similarities are that we both want an intuitive explanation why the momentum is a covector. The only answer to his article is an explanation why the 1-form p acts linear on velocities. Indeed it is a good answer but it does not give any intuition why the momentum is a covector. Furthermore I asked if the ""regular"" momentum $p=mv$ is a covector too.

1324860,Conceptual Understanding behind a Limit,"Before I ask anything, let me first express my apologies for this question. 
$$$$When starting with Calculus, my Maths teacher had never felt the need to explain the conceptual understanding behind Limits, or when we take them and why we take them. All that we needed to know (according to him) was:$$$$ ""if a function $f(x)$ is not defined at $x=a$ and $f(x)$ seems to approach a certain value L as $x$ approaches $a$, then $L$ is the Limit of $f(x)$ $$$$ Immediately after taking this down, we had been asked to evaluate $\dfrac{1}{x}$ at $x=0$, and the answer we got (contrary to the standard 'Not Defined' answer we had learnt till now) was $\infty$. Without pausing to explain, he had then given us another problem: evaluate $\dfrac{\sin(x)}{x}$ at $x=0$. $$$$
Would somebody please explain what Limits truly are? Why do we need to take Limits? Wen would we use Limits? How can we actually evaluate a function at a point where it does not exist (for example: how is $\dfrac{1}{0}=\infty$?)? $$$$

Does there always exist some inner product $\<,\>$ on $V$ such that $\text{ISO}(|| \cdot ||)\subseteq \text{ISO}(\<,\>)$ ? Update: As pointed by Qiaochu Yuan the answer is positive. This raises the question of uniqueness of the inner product $\<,\>$ which satisfies $\text{ISO}(|| \cdot ||)\subseteq \text{ISO}(\<,\>)$. Is it unique (up to scalar multiple)? Remarks: 1) Determining $\<,\>$ (up to scalar multiple) is equivalent to determining $\text{ISO}(\<,\>)$. Clearly if we know the inner product we know all its isometries. The other direction follows as a corollary from an argument given here which shows which inner products are preserved by a given automorphism. 2) Since there are ""rigid"" norms (whose only isometries are $\pm Id$ ) the uniqueness certainly doesn't hold in general. One could hope for that in the case of ""rich enough norms"" ( norms with many isometries, see this question ) the subset $\text{ISO}(|| \cdot ||)\subseteq \text{ISO}(\<,\>)$ will be large enough to determine $\text{ISO}(\<,\>)$.

Here is my approach: If you let $M = \{\infty x_1, \infty x_2, \infty x_3, \infty x_4, \infty x_5, \infty x_6\}$, then a multisubset of $M$ of size $60$ will represent such a solution, for example $\{20x_1, 15x_2, 15x_3, 10x_4, 0x_5, 0x_6\}$. It can generally be proven that there are ${n+r-1\choose r}$ multisubsets of size $r$ of a multiset with $n$ types. Since we know that $x_1\geq 2, x_2\geq 5...$, we need to count the  multisubsets of size $60 - (2+5+2+1+3+2) = 45$,but there musnt be greater than 7 $x_3$'s, so we split it into cases. Case 1: $2$ $x_3$'s ,so there are $49\choose45$ such solutions . Case 2: $3$ $x_3$'s so $48\choose 45$ such solutions and so on to get a total of ${49\choose 45} + {48\choose 44} + {47\choose 43} + {46\choose 42} + {45\choose 41} = 897001$ solutions.

On the other hand, if $q(0) = a + bi$, then you can use the transformation $z \mapsto z - (a+bi)$ so that $q(0) =0$.

PPPS: In a triangle with a $135^\circ$ angle, if the tangent of one of the acute angles is $x$, then the tangent of the other acute angle is $\displaystyle\vphantom{\frac\int\int}\dfrac{1-x}{1+x}$.  That follows from the second identity above.  If there's a simple way to prove that result by geometry without the identity above, then that should do it.","['geometry', 'trigonometry']"

1325329,Suppose $F$ is a field and the irreducible polynomial over $F$ of $x$ is of odd degree.,"A question I recently encountered is: Let $F$ be a field. Let $x$ be algebraic over $F$. Suppose the minimal polynomial of $x$ is of odd degree. Show $F(x) = F(x^2)$. We know $F(x^2)$ is a subset of $F(x)$ because $x^2$ belongs to $F(x)$.
To show the other containment, do the following:
Suppose, for a contradiction, $x$ is not an element of $F(x^2)$. Then the minimal polynomial of $x$ over $F(x^2)$ is $f(y) = y^2 - x^2$. It follows that $[F(x):F(x^2)] = 2$. But $[F(x):F(x^2)][F(x^2):F] = 2[F(x^2):F]$ is odd, a contradiction. Is there any hole in my logic? For some reason I'm not quite sure if this is correct.",['abstract-algebra']

1325468,Nontrivial normed functional on the bounded functions from $\mathbb R^2$ into $\mathbb R$ invariant by isometries,"I am trying to show that there exists a nontrivial normed functional on $\mathbb R^2$ invariant by isometries. That is: If $A$ is any set, let $\mathcal B_{A}=\{f: \mathbb R^2 \rightarrow \mathbb R: f \text{ is bounded}\}$. Let $\|f\|=\sup\{|f(x)|: x \in  A\}$. Notice that we are dealing with a vector space. I am looking for a linear functional satisfying: $I$ is normed, that is, $|I(f)|\leq \|f\|$ $I$ is nontrivial, that is, $I(1)=1$ If $s \in \mathbb R^2$, let $f_s(x)=f(x+s)$ for every $x \in X$ and let $f^-(x)=f(\bar x)$ (complex conjugation). There are the translations and reflections. If $|t|=1$, let $f^t(x)=f(tx)$ (complex product). We want that $I(f)=I(f^-)=I(f_s)=I(f^t)$. These are the rotations. I have already proved that there exists $I_0$ satisfies everything but the rotation thing. Let $T=\{z: |z|=1\}$. I also know that there exists a nontrivial normed linear functional $I_1: \mathcal B_T \rightarrow \mathbb R$ satisfying $I_1(f^t)=I(f)$ for every $t \in \mathbb T$, $f \in \mathcal B_T$. The book I am following tells me to define $I(f)=I_1(G_f)$, where $G_f: \mathcal B_t \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is given by $G_f(t)=I_0(f^t)$. This is a bounded function since $\|f^t\|=\|f\|$. It's easy to see that $I$ is a nontrivial normed linear functional. I have verified that $I$ is invariant by rotations and by translations, but I'm stuck on showing $I$ is invariant by the reflection. My attempt to show it was: Notice that $(f^-)^t(x)=f(\bar t \bar x)=(f^{\bar t})^-(x)$. Therefore, $G_{\bar f}(t)=G_f(\bar t)$ since $I_0$ is invariant by $\,^-$.

Assume we have a collection of sets $\{U_i\}$ such that $|U|<\epsilon$ and the union of these sets provide a cover of $C$. $\mathcal{H}^s(E)$ is the Hausdorff $s$-dimensional measure. 1) The mass distribution principle that says if we have a mass distribution on $E$ and $\mu(U)<c|U|^s$ then we can claim that $\mathcal{H}^s(E)>0$, and hence claim $s$ is a lower estimate on Hdim$E$. Is it possible to apply this method when the intervals from a given level have varying lengths? If yes, how do we assign masses to the intervals? If this method does not apply here, what other methods are there for this class of sets? 2) I attended a talk where professor claimed that when establishing a lower estimate on Hdim of a Cantor set it is sufficient to show that we can find a special collection of intervals in our construction such that $\sum|I_k|<c|U|^s$ for an arbitrary $U$.
