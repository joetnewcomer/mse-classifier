Host paper 'Nombres, normaux entropie, translations'","I was reading this paper and I got stuck in a detail left for the reader that I couldn't figure out: Let $X = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$, $p > 1$ a integer, $D_n = \{kp^{-n}\colon 0 \leq k < p^n \}$ and $\mu$ a measure on $X$ that is $T \colon X \ni x \to (px\mod 1)$ invariant. We define the measure 
$$\omega_n = \sum_{\alpha \in D_n} \mu * \delta_\alpha =
\sum_{\alpha \in D_n} \mu(\cdot + \alpha ) $$ Notice that $\mu = \omega_0 \ll \cdots \ll \omega_n \ll \omega_{n+1}$ then the Radon Nikodym derivative $\phi_n = \frac{d\mu}{d\omega_n}$ exists and the paper said that is easy to see that $$\phi_n = \prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\phi_1 \circ T^k$$
but I could not do it, although I reduced it to the following: If we proove this $$\frac{d\omega_{n}}{d\omega_{n+1}} = \frac{d\omega_{n-1}}{d\omega_n} \circ T$$ we can use the chain rule for Radon Nikodym derivatives to conclude. Any help will be appreciated.","['measure-theory', 'ergodic-theory']"

937168,Measures: Sequential Continuity,"Disclaimer: This thread is meant as record and written in Q&A style. Let $\Omega$ be a measure space. It is well known that a measure is continuous from below as well as from above:
$$E_n\uparrow E\implies\mu(E_n)\uparrow\mu(E)$$
$$E_n\downarrow E\implies\mu(E_n)\downarrow\mu(E)\quad(\mu(E_n)<\infty)$$
On the other hand this fails in general if one replaces sequences by nets:
$$E_M\uparrow[0,1],\lambda(E_M)\equiv 0\quad(E_{M\subseteq[0,1]:\lambda(M)=0}:=M)$$
$$E_N\downarrow\varnothing,\lambda(E_N)\equiv 1\quad(E_{N\subseteq[0,1]:\lambda(N)=1}:=N)$$
with the ordering being given by inclusion respectively containement. What about sequential continuity:
$$E_n\to E\implies \mu(E_n)\to\mu(E)$$ Here convergence of sets is meant as:
$$A_\lambda\to A:\iff\forall\omega\in\Omega\exists \lambda_\omega\in\Lambda\forall\lambda\geq\lambda_\omega:\omega\in A_\lambda\text{ if }\omega\in A\text{ and }\omega\notin A_\lambda\text{ if }\omega\notin A$$","['measure-theory', 'convergence-divergence', 'elementary-set-theory']"
937231,Eigenvalues of Differential Equation with Boundary Condition,"Here is a problem from my homework assignment that I am struggling with: Consider the differential equation $\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2}+\lambda\phi=0 $. Determine the eigenvalues $\lambda$ if $\phi$ satisfies the following boundary conditions: $\phi(a)=0$ $\phi(b)=0$ I have been able to successfully complete this problem with 6 other sets of boundary conditions, but this one is giving me trouble.  The question also states we only need to consider $\lambda>1$.  Here is what I have done so far: Because $\lambda>1$, we get our general solution of:
$\phi = C_1cos(\sqrt\lambda x)+C_2sin(\sqrt\lambda x)$. We can plug in our first boundary condition and get: $\phi(a) = C_1cos(\sqrt\lambda a)+C_2sin(\sqrt\lambda a)=0$ Usually I would solve for $C_1$ or $C_2$ to plug into the second equation, so here I solve for $C_1$: $C_1=\frac{-C_2 sin(\sqrt\lambda a)}{cos\sqrt\lambda a)}$ Now I substitute $C_1$ in and plug in the $b$ value to get: $\phi(a) = \frac{-C_2 sin(\sqrt\lambda a)}{cos\sqrt\lambda a)}cos(\sqrt\lambda b)+C_2sin(\sqrt\lambda b)=0$ Now I will factor our $C_2$ to get: $\phi(a) = C_2[\frac{sin(\sqrt\lambda a)}{cos\sqrt\lambda a)}cos(\sqrt\lambda b)+sin(\sqrt\lambda b)]=0$ Here we assume that $C_2$ cannot equal zero, or we would also get $C_1$ equal to zero, which would give us the trivial solution.  Thus we conclude that: $\frac{sin(\sqrt\lambda a)}{cos\sqrt\lambda a)}cos(\sqrt\lambda b)+sin(\sqrt\lambda b)=0$ And that is as far as I can get.... The back of the book says the answer is:
$\lambda = (\frac{n \pi}{b-a})^2$ Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.","['boundary-value-problem', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"

937306,How to prove that $b^{x+y} = b^x b^y$ using this approach?,"Fix $b>1$. If $m$, $n$, $p$, $q$ are integers, $n > 0$, $q > 0$, $r = m/n = p/q$, then I can prove that $(b^m)^{1/n} = (b^p)^{1/q}$. Hence it makes sense to define $b^r = (b^m)^{1/n}$. I can also show that $b^{r+s} = b^r b^s$ if $r$ and $s$ are rational. If $x$ is real, let us define $B(x)$ to be the set of all numbers $b^t$, where $t$ is rational and $t \leq x$. Then we can also show that $b^r = \sup B(r)$, where $r$ is rational. Hence it makes sense to define $b^x = \sup B(x)$ for every real $x$. Now here is my question: How to prove, using the above scheme, that $b^{x+y} = b^x b^y$ for all real $x$ and $y$? My effort: It can be shown that if $A$ and $B$ are two non-empty sets of positive real numbers, if $A$ and $B$ are both bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$, and if the set $C$ is defined as $$C \colon= \{ab \colon a \in A, b \in B \}, $$ then we have $$\sup C = \sup A \cdot \sup B.$$ So using this result, we obtain
$$ b^x b^y = \sup B(x) \cdot \sup B(y) = \sup \{ b^r \colon r \in \mathbb{Q}, r \leq x \} \cdot \sup \{ b^s \colon s \in \mathbb{Q}, s \leq y \} = \sup \{ b^{r+s} \colon r \in \mathbb{Q}, s \in \mathbb{Q}, r \leq x, s \leq y \} \leq \sup \{ b^t \colon t\in \mathbb{Q}, t \leq x+y \} = \sup B(x+y) = b^{x+y}. $$ Now how to prove the reverse inequality?","['foundations', 'calculus', 'real-analysis', 'analysis', 'exponentiation']"

937564,Proving Archimedes Sequences Equal $\pi$.,"I encountered the following problem in my text An Introduction to Analysis by William Wade. It was the last problem in the section and has an * next to it. I'm not sure if this indicates a challenge problem or that this problem is of some significance. The sequences, I  believe, are suppose to equal $\pi$, so that is suggesting to me it's more of a significance. I tried searching for the problem, as I figured anything that equals $\pi$ is no coincidence and must be a famous example. But, 'Archimedes Pi Sequence' and other variants yield much different results than this problem. I was hoping someone could either provide a link to the proof (assuming it is indeed famous) or provide a relative outline so I could try to follow along/work through it. The problem is: [Archimedes] Suppose that $x_0=2\sqrt{3}, \quad y_0=3$,
$$x_n=\frac{2x_{n-1}y_{n-1}}{x_{n-1}+y_{n-1}},$$
and

(This is why I believe $x=y=\pi$) Edit: I understand that if we can show $x_n$ is decreasing and converging to $x$, and $y_n$ is increasing and converging to $y$, we can recognize the Monotone Convergence Theorem. After which, apply the limit to both equations to get $x$ and $y$. The problem I am having is understanding how we get there, and after we are there, how we show it equals $\pi$.

There is an example that I've been struggled for a long time. For those who have access to the book, it's the Example 1.2.1 (iii) on p.11. From my understanding, the author is trying to derive a surface area measure on $S^2$ by a pushforward map. It starts with the fact that every compact group has a unique probability Haar measure on it. So is $\operatorname{SO}(3)=\{U\in M_3(\mathbb{R}):U^TU=I, \det U=1 \}$ . It then says that the map $\varphi:SO(3)\rightarrow S^2$ given by $\varphi(U)=Ue_3$ , where $e_3=(0,0,1)^T$ is the third canonical basis, induces a measure $\sigma_2$ on $S^2$ , normalized to be a probability measure, from the Haar measure on $\operatorname{SO}(3)$ . Also, it mentions that since $\varphi$ is not bijective: $Ve_3=Ue_3$ i.f.f. $V^{-1}U\in\operatorname{SO}(2)\subset\operatorname{SO}(3)$ . Thus we have that $\operatorname{SO}(3)/\operatorname{SO}(2)\cong S^2$ . Anyway, it gives the formula for the measure in terms of colatitude $\theta$ and longtitude $\phi$ : $\mathrm{d}\sigma_2=\frac{1}{4\pi}\sin\theta\mathrm{d}\theta\mathrm{d}\phi$ , which coincides with what I learned from advanced calculus course.

So you have a natural map of cotangent spaces $m_{f(x)}/{m_{f(x)}}² \to m_x/(m_x)²$, that is $k(f(x))$ linear. Now if the residue field is the same, i dualize the map on it and i have a map of tangent space. But if the residue field is different, i can see both space as vector space on $k(f(x))$ and dualize in this way. Or i can see that one extend the scalars to the second and induce a map on the field $k(x)$. What is the conventional map that one take in consideration? It seems to me that only the second one gives a nice formula between the tangent space(via a tensor product for the tangent space on $f(x)$ with $k(x)$), so should this advice that is the second a more ""canonical"" choice?",['algebraic-geometry']

E + F = \{x + y : x \in E, x \in F\}

  contains an interval. If $E = F$, this exercise reduces to exercise 29 (see below), which I am able to prove according to the hint. But I cant figure out how to modify exercise 29's proof to prove exercise 30's more general claim. Any help will be appreciated. 29 Suppose $E$ is a measurable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ with $m(E) > 0$. Prove that the difference set of $E$, which is defined by
  $$
\{z \in \mathbb{R} : z = x - y \mbox{ for some } x, y \in E\}

  contains an open interval centered at the origin. If $E$ contains an interval, then the conclusion is straightforward. In general, one may rely on Exercise 28. [Hint: Indeed, by Exercise 28, there exists an open interval $I$ so that $m(E \cap I) \geq (9/10)m(I)$. If we denote $E \cap I$ by $E_0$, and suppose that the difference set of $E_0$ does not contain an open interval around the origin, then for arbitrarily small $a$ the sets $E_0$ and $E_0 + a$ are disjoint. From the fact that $(E_0 \cup (E_0 + a)) \subseteq (I \cup (I + a))$ we get a contradiction, since the lift-hand side has measure $2m(E_0)$, while the right-hand side has measure only slightly larger than $m(I)$.] For completeness, here's exercise 28 mentioned in exercise 29: 28 Let $E$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ with $m_*(E) > 0$. Prove that for each $0 < \alpha < 1$, there exists an open interval $I$ so that
  $$
m_*(E\cap I) \geq \alpha m_*(I).
$$
  Loosely speaking, this estimate shows that $E$ contains almost a whole interval. [Hint: Choose an open set $\mathcal{O}$ that contains $E$, and such that $m_*(E) \geq \alpha m_*(\mathcal{O})$. Write $\mathcal{O}$ as the countable union of disjoint open intervals, and show that one of these intervals must satisfy the desired property.] References [1] Stein, Elias M. and Shakarchi, Rami.

938976,$\text{Prove that}$ $\frac{\sin(\frac{n+1}2)*\cos(\frac n2)}{\sin\frac 12} \ge\frac n2$,Prove that$$\frac{\sin\left(\frac{n+1}2\right)\times\cos\left(\frac n2\right)}{\sin\left(\frac 12\right)} \ge\frac n2$$ So far I've switched up the problem and gotten it down to all sin functions. I have $$\frac {\sin\left(\frac{2n+1}2\right)+\sin\left(\frac {1}2\right)}{2\sin\left(\frac {1}2\right)}\ge\frac n2$$ So far this is the farthest I've got that seems to make sense. I graph the function each time I do it to make sure that the move I made was a legal move. From the graph I can see that the graph has a maximum at 1.5429 So am I going to have to use induction to prove this statement? or am I going about this all the wrong way?,"['trigonometry', 'summation', 'sequences-and-series']"
938986,Application of the Riemann-Roch theorem,"If C is a quadric hyperelliptic curve ($g(C)=3$ and the canonical line bundle is very ample)  contained in the two dimensional complex projective space and $K_C$ is the canonical line bundle of $\mathbb{P}^2$ restrected to my curve. I take four distinct points on $C$ named $p_1,\ p_2,\ p_3,\ p_4 $ so $p_1+ p_2+p_3+p_4 \in K_C= |\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P^2}}(1)| $. Than i take another points different from the previous, named $q$ and the divisor on $C$ $\ D=p_1+ p_2+p_3+q$. I want to compute $h^o(D)$. So using Riemann Roch theorem i can write: $h^o(D)=h^1(D)+deg(D)-g+1=h^1(D)+4-3+1=h^1(D)+2$. Now i've used Serre Duality and i get: $h^1(D)=h^0(K_C-D)$. Is there a way to say that $h^0(K_C-D)=0$ for example using some vanishing theorem?",['algebraic-geometry']

939020,A knights and knave problem involving a native with a speech disorder,"On an island, every native is either a knight, who always tells the truth, or a knave, who always lies. You meet 4 natives, A, B, C, and D. This is what they say: A: ""C is a knight iff D is a knight"" B: ""A and C are not both knights"" C: [This person has a speech disorder. You can tell from his gestures
that he is saying something about B and D, and that he is trying to use
1 of 4 logical connectives: and, or, if...then, iff. You can't tell
if he is identifying B or D as knights or knaves. In other words, C
said one of the things in this set: $\{B,\neg B\} \times \{\wedge, \vee,
   \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow\} \times \{D,\neg D\}$ .] D: [Says nothing] Question : What is D? My attempt at answering this question: Let $A$ be ""A is a knight"" and $\neg A$ be ""A is knave"". Same pattern for the other three. $A \leftrightarrow (C \leftrightarrow D)$ $B \leftrightarrow (\neg (A \wedge C))$ Now I'm stuck. There are 16 possibilities for what C could have said. Do I need to try every single one of them until something works?","['logic', 'discrete-mathematics']"

939103,How often are Galois groups equal to $S_n$?,"Let $\mathbb{Z}[x]_n$ be the set of polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree at most $n$ . Then, consider some sensible increasing filtration $$A_0 \subset A_1 \subset A_2 \subset \cdots$$ of $\mathbb{Z}[x]_n$ by finite sets, i.e., a sequence of nested, finite sets $A_k$ such that $\bigcup_k A_k = \mathbb{Z}[x]_n$ . (One possible sensible option is to take $A_k$ to be the set of polynomials whose coefficients are all in $\{-k, \ldots, k\}$ .) For each $A_k$ and each subgroup $H \leq S_n$ (up to isomorphism), we can ask for the proportion $p_k(H)$ of polynomials in $A_k$ whose Galois group has isomorphism type $H$ . What can be said about the limiting behavior of $p_k(H)$ as $k \to \infty$ that doesn't depend too severely on the filtration $(A_k)$ ? In particular, is the Galois group of a randomly selected polynomial of degree $< n$ almost surely $S_n$ , or more precisely, is $$\lim_{k \to \infty} p_k(S_n) = 1?$$ If not, what is this probability? If it is $0$ or $1$ , what can be said about the limiting behavior of $p_k(S_n)$ ? What about these questions for other subgroups of $S_n$ ?","['galois-theory', 'group-theory']"
939110,How do I read this definition of injective in English?,"This is a different but related question to one I asked earlier. I link to it here: ""To show that f is injective"" - I don't get this statement I am pretty new to ""functions"" having just went through a quick primer on ""propositional logic"". So the $\rightarrow$ symbol which represents a conditional statement looks very similar in the definition of injective below. Suppose that $f: A \to B$ (Is this to be read in English as ""If $A$ is true then $B$ is true""?) To show that $f$ is injective - Show that if $f(x) = f(y)$ for arbitrary $x, y \in A$ with $x \neq  y$, then $x = y$. How do I read this in English, specifically the part where there is a comma. I am not sure if this is stating that the ordered pair $x,y$ is an element of set $A$ or just the $y$ element itself. If the author of the text (Rosen) is talking about $x, y$ as an ordered pair then it would help to use parentheses.","['notation', 'functions']"
