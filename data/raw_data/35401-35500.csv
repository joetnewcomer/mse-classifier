338422,Counting 6 seats 3 couples,"There are 3 married couples should sit in a straight row of 6 seats. If couples sit random, what is the chance that at least one man sits next to his wife? And, what is the chance that exactly $3$ ( $2$ , and $1$ also) couples are thogether? Attempt Total number of combinations: $6!=720$ I want to counting $3$ disjoints sets. $A_1$ : the number of combinations in which there are exactly 3 men next to his wifes, denoting each couple by $P_i$ we have $3!$ possible combinations $P_1 P_2 P_3, P_2P_3P_1,$ etc.. But each couple can order in $2!$ forms then: $A_1=3!2!2!2!=48$ $A_2$ : the number of combinations in which there are exactly 2 men next to his wife, denoting each couple by $P_i$ we have $4!-3$ possible combinations if we fix $2$ couples $P_1, P_2$ , since there are $2!3$ of $4!$ combinations in which the third couple is not togheter namely $P_1 a P_2 b$ , $a P_1 b P_2$ and $a P_1 P_2 b$ and changing $P_1$ with $P_2$ . And since each couple can ordered in $2!$ forms we need to add factors $2!2!2!$ like previous case. Then $A_2=2!2!2!3(4!-2!3)=432$ But im not sure!!! There is an error in $A_2=2!2!2!3(4!-2!3)=432$ , since $2!2!3$ of $4!$ was favorable cases. Then: $A_2=2!2!3(2!2!3)=2!^43^2=144$ as noted Brian. $A_3$ : the number of combinations in which there are exactly 1 man next to his wife.

338453,When does a modular form satisfy a differential equation with rational coefficients?,"Given a modular form $f$ of weight $k$ for a congruence subgroup $\Gamma$, and a modular function $t$ for $\Gamma$ with $t(i\infty)=0$, we can form a function $F$ such that $F(t(z))=f(z)$ (at least locally), and we know that this $F$ must now satisfy a linear ordinary differential equation
$$P_{k+1}(T)F^{(k+1)} + P_{k}(T)F^{(k)} + ... + P_{0}(T)F = 0$$ Where $F^{(i)}$ is the i-th derivative, and the $P_i$ are algebraic functions of $T$, and are rational functions of $T$ if $t$ is a Hauptmodul for $X(\Gamma)$. My question is the following: given a modular form $f$, what are necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a modular function $t$ such that the $P_i(T)$ are rational functions? For example, the easiest sufficient condition is that $X(\Gamma)$ has genus 0, by letting $t$ be a Hauptmodul.
But, this is not necessary, as the next condition will show. Another sufficient condition is that $f$ is a rational weight 2 eigenform. I can show this using Shimura's construction* of an associated elliptic curve, and a computation of a logarithm for the formal group in some coordinates (*any choice in the isogeny class will work). Trying to generalise, I have thought of the following: if $f$ is associated to a motive $h^i(V)$ of a variety $V$, with Artin-Mazur formal group $\Phi^i(V)$ of dimension 1, then we can construct formal group law a-la Stienstra style, and get a logarithm using the coefficients of powers of certain polynomials. Since the dimension is 1, there will actually be a single polynomial that we take powers of, making the coefficients have a rather simple recurrence relation, forcing our $P_i$ to be rational. Now, some people, without naming names, believe that rational eigenforms should correspond to the middle cohomology of certain rational Calabi-Yai varieties. I'm not entirely certain that such people exist. Probably.
If this is true, then this should answer my question for rational eigenforms. Putting non-eigenforms aside, since I'm not interested as much in them, we are left with non-rational eigenforms. We can try to perform the same Stienstra construction, but this time we get that the galois orbit of $f$ is associated to a ""formal group law"" of a motive with dimension greater than one. This will make for an interesting recurrence for the vector of the galois orbit, but not necessarily for each form individually, as the isomorphism of formal groups laws (between Stienstra's and those with the modular forms as logarithm) will scramble them together.
I realise this last paragraph might be difficult to understand, for the wording is clumsy, and the mathematical notions are even worse. If you're really interested in this, I'd be happy to elaborate.","['algebraic-geometry', 'modular-forms', 'complex-analysis', 'number-theory']"
338454,Is there a hierarchy of countable limit ordinals that cannot be reached by repeated successor operations over limit ordinals of the previous level?,"I am trying to get an intuition on the structure of the countable ordinals (actually, of how they become uncountable), and these kind of questions, which might be trivial for set theorists, can help a lot to the limited mind of a physicist. Let us limit here to countable ordinals.
If I am not wrong, the first limit ordinal that cannot be reached by repeated successor operations over limit ordinals is $\omega^2$. I would call it a limit ordinal of the second level. There are many limit ordinals of the second level(I am not sure what would be the correct definition, but I guess the next one is $\omega^2$.2, then $\omega^2$.3, and so on. (But I am not sure, perhaps after $\omega^2$ comes $\omega^3$?). Then, we can define the limit ordinals of the third level as the limit ordinals that cannot be reached by repeated successor operations over limit ordinals of the second level. And so on. Can then limit ordinals of any level n be defined? or of a transfinite level? Is this a trivial issue?","['ordinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"

338509,Minimize the coefficient of asymptotic normality,"I need to minimize this complicated function: $$\dfrac{\Gamma(2x+1)-\Gamma(x+1)^2}{x^2 \Gamma(x+1)^2}$$ (For people wondering where this function came from — it's the (multiple of) coefficient of asymptotic normality of the estimator $\widehat{\alpha}$ for parameter $\alpha$ of exponential distribution obtained by method of moments using the sample function $t^x$ ($x$ is parameter here)). Since the coefficient of asymptotic normality must be positive, I need to find the minimum only for $x > -\dfrac{1}{2}$. Simple analysis shows that minimum exists, because function tends to infinity both at $x \rightarrow -\dfrac{1}{2}$ and $x \rightarrow \infty$. Consideration of only discrete arguments indicates that $\dfrac{(2k)! - (k!)^2}{k^2 (k!)^2}$ attains its minimum at $k = 1$. The graph also shows that $1$ has to be a minimum of this function.

338682,A Combinatorial Proof of Dixon's Identity,"Dixon's Identity states:
$$ \sum_{k} (-1)^k\binom {a+b}{b+k}\binom{b+c}{c+k}\binom{c+a}{a+k} = \binom{a+b+c}
{a,b,c}$$ A bit of history: 
The case $a=b=c$ was proved by Dixon in 1891 using trigonometric integrals. He proved the general case 11 years later using other analytical methods.  In 1916, MacMahon proved his master theorem which gives another short analytical proof for the identity. Using the WZ-method, Zeilberger gave a short proof in 1990 (with the aid of his computer).
In 2003, Victor Guo gave a short proof using polynomials. But what really interests me are the combinatorial interpretations. Zeilberger gives a proof using sign-reversing involutions in this lecture (starting from 39:30). Does it exist in some paper? I believe he credits it to Foata in this opinion . In this monograph by Foata , there seems to be a combinatorial proof of Dixon's identity and other related identities (pages 37 to 40). I wasn't able to understand the part in pages 37-38, where the following is derived combinatorially: 
$$\binom{b+c}{c+k}\binom{c+a}{a+k}\binom{a+b}{b+k}=\sum_{n\ge |k|} \binom{a+b+c-n}{a-n,b-n,c-n,n+k,n-k}$$
Where both sides seem to count directed graphs with the following adjacency matrix:
$$\begin{bmatrix} 0 & c+k & b-k \\ c-k & 0 & a+k\\ b+k & a-k & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
The LHS counts it directly, and the RHS counts it by decomposing by using 5 basic cycles: $1\to 2 \to 1$ (appearing $a-n$ times), $1\to 3 \to 1$ ($b-n$ times), $2\to 3 \to 2$ ($c-n$ times), $1\to 2 \to 3 \to 1$ ($n+k$ times), $1\to 3 \to 2 \to 1$ ($n-k$ times). But I don't really understand how they actually count it.

Extra Information: When $y_l\rightarrow -\infty$ and $y_u\rightarrow \infty$, the first $4$ equations above simplifies considerably.

In terms of the finite intersection property, we can define compactness as follows. Definition. A topological space $X$ is compact iff any collection of closed
  subsets of $X$ with the finite intersection property has nonempty
  intersection. Now personally, my intuition about this definition is pretty mediocre, so lets deduce a more intuitive theorem from the above definition. First, some terminology.

Furthermore, lets say that $\mathcal{A}$ is ungrounded iff $\emptyset \notin \mathcal{A}$. Then every nested ungrounded collection necessarily satisfies the finite intersection property. Proof . Let $\mathcal{A}$ denote a nested ungrounded collection and suppose $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{A}$ has finite cardinality. Then $\mathcal{B}$ inherits nested and ungroundedness. Thus $\mathcal{B}$ is nested and finite, so $\bigcap \mathcal{B}$ equals the least element of $\mathcal{B}$. Thus $\bigcap \mathcal{B} \in \mathcal{B}$. But since $\mathcal{B}$ is ungrounded, it follows that $\bigcap \mathcal{B} \neq \emptyset$. Thus we obtain the following theorem. Theorem. If a topological space $X$ is compact, then any nested ungrounded collection of closed subsets of $X$ has nonempty intersection. My question is, does the converse of the above statement hold?","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

338854,Do complex eigenvalues of a real matrix imply a rotation-dilation?,"This is part of a bigger proof that if there is a compact set, $K \subset \mathbb R^n$ such that the linear transformation $L$ maps $K$ into its interior, the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ are all of absolute value less than 1. Clearly, if $L(K)\subset \operatorname{int}(K)$ then $L^n(K)\subset \operatorname{int}(K)$. The easiest case seems to be: If the eigenvalue were an $n$th root of unity, then $L^n$ must have some fixed point on the boundary, a contradiction. I can't even seem to prove it for complex eigenvalues of absolute value greater than $1$ or for eigenvalues of absolute value $1$ which are not roots of unity. My attempts:
1) Say $|\lambda|>1$ then it seems like $L$ would take the vectors off to infinity. However, I am worried there is a case where $L$ takes some vector, lengthens it, and maps it to some other vector, and on the next iteration it undoes, or something like that. 2) Say $|\lambda|=1$. If a linear transformation on $\mathbb R^n$ has a pair of complex eigenvalues of absolute value 1 (but not roots of unity), is it true that this always corresponds to a rotation on a two dimensional subspace? If so, then it seems like this is an irrational rotation. So start with some point on the boundary of $K$ that is on the subspace of rotation, then look at the infinite union of $L^i(K)$ for $i>1$. The original point is a limit point of this union, and since $K$ was compact and since $L$ is continuous since it is a finite dimensional linear operator, $L^i(K)$ are all compact....but this isn't good because now the point is the limit point of an infinite union of compact sets which may not be compact and thus don't need to contain their limit points. But if it did contain this point this would be a contradiction. Please and thank you for helping :D",['linear-algebra']

In order to treat bodies defined by general quadrics I have to do two things: 1.) Determine which kind of surface has been defined 2.) Obtain the transformation matrix which will transform the respective surface to the position/orientation which is implicitly included in the quadrics coefficients. After doing a bit of algebra I came up with the following idea for 2.) I thought to tackle the issue via principal axis transformation. So I would first try to determine the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors for the coefficient matrix $Q.$ The matrix which is represented by the eigenvectors in its columns should transform my coefficient matrix into the canonical system. If I take the inverse of this eigenmatrix then this should be my transformation matrix, or am I wrong here? The eigenvalues would eventually determine the magnitude of parameters like the radius for spheres & cylinders, the major or minor halfaxes for ellipsoids etc. I'd appreciate to hear your thoughts on this or if somebody has a simpler solution I'd be happy to discuss this as well.

Here's a graph where each point represents a random distribution of particles: Taking the mean $\tilde{d}$ for each value of $\rho$ produces a nice graph which aligns with this function: $\tilde{d} = \frac{k_1}{\rho}+\frac{k_2}{\sqrt{\rho}}$ The constants are estimated here to be: $k_1 \approx 0.1705$ $k_2 \approx 0.4649$ These constants have been calculated empirically (interpolating the empirical points to a function); is there a way to calculate them theoretically? In other words, is there a purely mathematical proof of a relationship between $\rho$ and $\tilde{d}$?

339124,Convergence in probability of the product of two random variables,"Suppose $\{X_n\}$ and $\{Y_n\}$ converge in probability to $X$ and $Y$, respectively.
Will $X_n Y_n$ converge in probability to $X Y$? I know the answer is yes.
If we treat $(X_n,Y_n)$ as a random vector, and it converges in probability to $(X,Y)$ by the assumption. Then $g(x,y) = xy$ is a continuous function and according to the continuous mapping theorem, $g(X_n,Y_n)$ converges in probability to $g(X,Y)$. My question is how to go from the definition without using the continuous mapping theorem.
My attempt is as follows. $$P(|X_nY_n-XY|>\epsilon)=P(|X_nY_n-X_nY+X_nY-XY|>\epsilon)$$
$$\leq P(|X_n(Y_n-Y)|+|Y(X_n-X)|>\epsilon)$$ It seems tempting to conclude that the last term goes to zero as $n$ goes to infinity.
But I am not sure about it.
Am I right or did I miss something?","['probability-theory', 'convergence-divergence', 'random-variables']"

339165,Zariski Tangent Space and $k[\varepsilon]/\varepsilon^2$,"Let $X$ be a scheme over a field $k$, and let $x\in X$ be a rational point, that is, we have $k(x):=\mathcal{O}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x\cong k$.  Let $\alpha:\mathfrak{m}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^2\rightarrow k$ be an element of $T_x=(\mathfrak{m}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^2)^*$, the Zariski tangent space to $X$ at $x$.  Using $x$ and $\alpha$, I'd like to define a $k$-morphism of schemes Spec $k[\varepsilon]/\varepsilon^2\rightarrow X$. In the course of the construction, I need to define a local map of local rings $\mathcal{O}_x\rightarrow k[\varepsilon]/\varepsilon^2$.  Using $\alpha$, what is a natural way to define such a map? It might be helpful to note that I have an injection $k\hookrightarrow\mathcal{O}_x$ arising from the $k$-scheme structure on $X$.  I think this leads to a decomposition $\mathcal{O}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^2=k\oplus(\mathfrak{m}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^2)$ as $k$ vector spaces, from which the desired map would follow, but I can't seem to explicitly see what this decomposition is inside of $\mathcal{O}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^2$.

339172,"Under what conditions does the n-dimensional, infinite, unit-square-grid graph contain a Hamiltonian ray?","I am no graph-theory expert, but I've been thinking about this problem for a long time. Let $G_n$ be the $n$-dimensional, infinite, unit-square-grid graph, i.e. the graph whose vertices are the points of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and that has one edge between each couple of vertices separated by a Euclidean distance of 1. I know that, for any $d$ in $\mathbb{N}$, the set $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is countably infinite, i.e. one can find a bijection between $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^d$. That is not the issue here. My question is: what are the conditions under which that graph contains a Hamiltonian ray? In other words, under what conditions does a path starting at some vertex of the graph and visiting each vertex of $G_n$ exactly once (by jumping from one vertex to an adjacent vertex) exists? Because of invariance of $G$ by translation by any basis unit vector, we can consider, without loss of generality, that such a ray starts at the origin. It's easy to see that: in the $n=1$ case, no such ray exists: whichever direction you set off on the number line, you can not doubleback to collect the integers located on the other side from the origin; in the $n=2$ case, there is an infinite number of such rays: an easy example is some ""square spiral"" starting from the origin. However, the answer for $n\geq3$ eludes me. As an attempt to solve the $n=3$ case, I set out to answer a related question: whether the subgraph (let's call it $G_3'$) of $G_3$ whose coordinates are in $\{-1,0,1\}^3$ contains a Hamiltonian ray starting at the origin. Not knowing any better, I settled the issue by brute force in Matlab (see the code below, in which you can change the starting point). Result: $G_3'$ does not contain a Hamiltonian ray starting at the origin. My intuition leads me to conjecture that such a path exists in $G_n$ if and only if $n$ is even . What do YOU think?

Now onto the interesting bit. Some translation of variables that may help in no particular order as well as some useful information about the system. (r,0,0) on $\sum_{1}$ corresponds to the homo-clinic orbit.
The surface $\sum_{1}$ is defined in such a way that each ode will only intersect this surface once and that it must intersect this surface at least once. $\nu_{n+1}/\nu_{n} = -e^{-np/w}$ An Aproximation of the flow between the 2 surfaces $\sum_{1} \to \sum_{0}$ is governed by the following differential equations. $x^{'}=-px+wy$ $y^{'}=-py-wx$ $z^{'}=\lambda z$ $\theta^{'}=w$ $r^{'}=-p$ The basic idea was to fiddle with some parameters $\sum_{0} \to \sum_{1}$ an look at bifurcations. $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\\  \end{pmatrix}^{'}= A \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\\  \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} r \\ 0\\  \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} a\nu \\ b\nu\\  \end{pmatrix}$ Where $\nu$ is our bifurcation parameter. First we wanted to build a mapping matrix A. Staring by setting out intial conditions we have $\theta_{0}=0$
and $r_{0}=x_{0}$
and $z_{0}=z_{0}$ $z(t)=z_{0} e^{\lambda t}$
$r(t)=x_{0} e^{-p t}$
$\theta(t)=wt$ $z(T)=h$ $ T= 1/(\lambda) \log (h/z_{0})$ $x=x_{0}e^{-p \log(h/z_{0})/ \lambda} \cos(w \log(h/z_{0})/ \lambda)$ $y=x_{0}e^{-p \log(h/z_{0})/ \lambda} \sin(w \log(h/z_{0})/ \lambda)$ $x=x_{0}(z_{0}/h)^{p/ \lambda} \cos(w T)$
$y=x_{0}(z_{0}/h)^{p/ \lambda} \sin(w T)$ $z_{new}=F(z_{old})$ $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ z\\  \end{pmatrix}_{new} = C_{1} \begin{pmatrix} a&b \\ c&d\\  \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \cos(w T) \\ \sin(w T)\\  \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} r \\ 0\\  \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} a\nu \\ b\nu\\  \end{pmatrix}$
Where $C_{1}=x_{0}(z_{0}/h)^{\delta}$ and $\delta=(p/\lambda)$ This step im a bit lost on i believe that  the K is just some correctional value for the c,d and coupled with the phase shift identity to put this as all one equation which is fine but i need to know exactly what it is to run iterations. $z_{new} = K z_{0}^{\delta} \cos(wT- \alpha) +b \nu$
i dont think i expanded this right but... $z_{new}=x_{0}(z_{0}/h)^{p/\lambda} (c(\cos((wlog(h/z_{0})/\lambda)) +d(\sin((wlog(h/z_{0})/\lambda) +b\nu$ but i dont know what c and d are so i moved back to
$z_{new} = x_{0}(z_{0}/h)^{p/\lambda} z_{0}^{p/\lambda} \cos(wT- \alpha) +b \nu$
i think i am looking at (p/\lamda) >1 which if we assume from here it was very easy to understand the periodic values when this equaled 0 I have never seen anything in 3d and only one example of a bifurcation in 2-Dimensions but my intuition tells me that the important value of this bifurcation in the way its setup are going to be when $b\nu=0$ i believe without proof of course that this will be where all the fun happens  im not sure where i defined it but in case i hadn't but ill look at $b>0$ and where $nu \in R$
 Intuition tells me that when $\nu>0$ we will get many fp in fact as this appear to be like a 1 dimensional analog i think we will get 2 bifurcation points generated on certain values of $n\pi/2$ and that each of these will be saddle and node bifurcations. again i also believe that when $\nu<0$ we will have only 1 fp in the system ( anything starting at z=0 will end up at (0,0,0) ) this will be the most boring case when the unstable manifold on the z axis has too much strength and will merely tangent all solutions off to +/- infinity  depending on whether u have + or - z values of course. As shown in the picture below. i believe the homo clinic orbit corresponds to $z_{new}=0 $ clearly if we pick $x_{0}=0$ ( $y_{0}=0$ already ) any flow of the solution $z_{new}=x_{0}(z_{0}/h)^{p/\lambda} (c(\cos((wlog(h/z_{0})/\lambda)) +d(\sin((wlog(h/z_{0})/\lambda) +b\nu$ when  yields
$z_{new}= 0 +b\nu$ and this is true for all initial values $z_{0}$ remove $\lambda=0$ i believe that when $\nu=0$ as well we will have our homo clinic orbit. i) My question is Can someone help verify that this is whats going on? ii) help me translate where im at to the point that i can put this mapping into a computer and run some iterations. I would like to find a stable and unstable fp in the $b>0$ and $\nu>0$ case  and verify the homo-clinical orbit and lastly if possible find a closed orbit inside of this region. I have very little understanding of computers so not only do i need a means of solving for the ode but i would also like to know what software i should put it into that's as simple as possible to use. much of this could be completely wrong my prof explained it to me in about 30 minutes.
 Any comments or confusion on the notation is welcome but please be as specific and obvious as possible i am physics undergrad and am liable to not understand anything you say at any time. EDIT: For those that are looking at this with 2 heads its kind of something like $x^{'}= y $ $y^{'}=-x -(y/3)$ $z^{'}=z - (x^{2}+y^{2})$ This Matrix A would be the linearization of our non linear system and would corresponding to a spiral sink in the x-y plane and an unstable manifold on the z axis you then add some parameter on z so that as z gets large all of a sudden z gets overwhelmed by the spiral sink. $A=\begin{pmatrix} 0&1&0 \\ -1&-(1/3)&0\\ 0&0&1\\ \end{pmatrix}$ this may attain an orbit like the one described below the one used and explained is toy system with several assumptions to make it easier to work with.","['dynamical-systems', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
339289,Continuous function proof by definition,"Prove that if $f$ is defined for $x\ge 0$ by $f(x)=\sqrt x$, then $f$
  is continuous at every point of its domain. Definition of a continuous function is: Let $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ and let $f:A\to\mathbb{R}$. Denote $c\in A$. Then $f(x)$ is continuous at $c$ iff for every $\varepsilon>0$, $\exists$ $\delta>0$ such that $|x-c|<\delta\implies |f(x)-f(c)|<\varepsilon.$ My attempt: We know that the function $f: x\to \mathbb{R}$, where $x\in [0,\infty)$ is defined to be $f(x)=\sqrt x$. So, for $0\le x<\infty$, then 
$|f(x)-f(c)|=|\sqrt x - f(c)|$ and I can't continue since I don't necessarily know what $c$ is in this case.","['functions', 'continuity', 'real-analysis']"

Geometry has been almost squeezed out of school and university syllabuses and what little remains is rarely of any use to people who wish to apply geometric ideas in their work[...] I kinda felt that when I was in high school, and once I've seen the proof which states that an exterior angle of a triangle is greater than either remote interior angle in euclidean geometry and I felt it was kind magic, it was another way of thinking, I don't know how to explain but this experience made me get interested in geometry. So I'm curious on what I should start studying/reading for learning geometry and what way I should follow, I know that euclidean geometry is one of the first geometries arround, but I've read somewhere that there's a discrepancy between euclidean geometry and the modern way of looking at geometry, so I'm not sure on where to start. My question is a little extense, I'm trying to figure out where to start studying geometry and I'm trying to find a reasonable way to follow and also books and video lectures for it, I want to use this question as a reference for the next years and it also would be useful to MSE members to find a guide into the study of geometry.

339401,Closed unit interval is connected proof,"The closed unit interval $\mathbb{I}=[0,1]$ is a connected subset of
  $\mathbb{R}$. I am having difficulty understanding the proof in my book, which goes: Suppose that $A,B$ are open sets forming a disconnection of
  $\mathbb{I}$. Thus $A\cap \mathbb{I}$ and $B\cap \mathbb{I}$ are
  non-empty bounded disjoint sets whose union is $\mathbb{I}$. Since $A$
  and $B$ are open, the sets $A\cap \mathbb{I}$ and $B\cap \mathbb{I}$
  cannot consist of only one point. (Why?) For the sake of definiteness,
  we suppose that there exist points $a\in A$, $b\in B$ such that
  $0<a<b<1$. Applying the supremum property, we let $c=\sup\{x\in
 A:x<b\}$ so that $0<c<1$; hence $c\in A\cup B$. If $c\in A$ then $c\ne
 b$ and since $A$ is open there is a point $a_1\in A$, $c<a_1$, such
  that the interval $[c,a_1]$ is contained in $\{x\in A: x<b\}$ contrary
  to the definition of $c$. Why is $0<c<1$? They define $c=\sup\{x\in A:x<b\}$ so it is the supremum of $A$ which is less than $b$ so doesn't that mean $c$ must be less than $b$ ? Also, why is $c\in A\cup B$ ? Lastly, since $c$ is the supremum of $A$ how is there a point in $A$ such that $c<a_1$ and why is it contrary that it is contained in $\{x\in A: x<b\}$ ?","['general-topology', 'connectedness', 'real-analysis']"

339429,Looking for an analysis book which uses linear maps notation for multivariable differentiation,"I'm taking an analysis course and I find it quite hard to follow what the professor is saying. So far we've been following elementary real analysis by bruckner^2 and Thompson but for the topic on multivariable differentiation, my professor opted not to follow the textbook. He mentioned that the mentioned book's approach is rather painful and introduced the following  approach in class via a lemma by Hadamard. Everything else we discuss is built on this lemma which places emphasis on linear maps, space of linear maps, etc. The Lemma is as follows: Let $U \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be open and $f:U\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ then $f$ is differentiable at $a \Leftrightarrow \exists \,\,\,\gamma_a:U\rightarrow L(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathbb{R^n})$ continuous at $a$ such that $$f(x)=f(a)+\gamma_a(x-a)$$ Here, $L$ is the space of linear maps. I am wondering if anyone here knows of a book which follows such an approach in the study of multivariable differentiation. Honestly, I understand what the professor is saying but the notation he has presented so far is what I find confusing. I'd prefer to be able to read a book as I don't catch everything during the lecture. Thanks for the help/suggestions!","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
