906283,"When is a vector space of polynomials dense in $C([0,1])$?","Weierstrass' theorem states, in particular, that the set of polynomials with real coefficients is dense (with the supremum norm) in the set of continuous function on $[0,1]$. Using the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, one can specialize further: the set of polynomials in which each monomial is of even degree (e.g., $x^6+3x^4+7$ is one, but $x^2+x$ is not) satisfied the conditions, and is once again dense in $C([0,1])$. Moving further, the algebra generated by $x^n$ and $1$ is again dense for the same reasons. But how sparse can the dense sets be? How important is the algebra condition? Given a subset $S \subset \Bbb N$, when is the vector space $P_S$ generated by $\{x^n : n \in S\}$ dense in $C([0,1])$? In particular, what if $S$ is the odd positive integers (and 0)? Of course, if S contains all the multiples of some $n$, $P_S$ is dense by the argument above; and if it's finite, $P_S$ is not dense.

  only, the number of ways of changing $n$ cents is exactly the integer nearest to $ \frac{(n+3)^2}{12} $. Of course, the solution provided was one that makes use of a generating function.

One may verify this has a family of trivial solutions given by $a_n=\delta_{nm}$ for some nonzero integer $m$. Assuming $a_0=0$, are there any other solutions? This problem is inspired by (unsuccessful) attempts to find a tractable solution to an earlier question of mine. What I wanted was a closed curve $z(s)\in\mathbb{C}$ whose Fourier series was arc-length parametrized i.e.
$z(s)=\sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^\infty c_n e^{i n s}$ with $|z'(s)|^2=\sum\limits_{nm}(n\overline{c_n})(m c_m)e^{i (m-n)s}=1$ for all $s\in\mathbb{R}$. This requires $\sum\limits_{-\infty}^\infty nm\overline{c_n}c_{m}=\delta_{nm}$ for all $m$, which upon identifying $m=n+k$ and $a_n=n c_n$ yields the system of equations above. Unfortunately, the only solutions which are obvious to me are the trivial ones given above (i.e. a single mode $e^{i m s}$). Any nontrivial solutions appear to involve all frequencies; a construction of such would clarify my questions greatly.","['fourier-series', 'linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis', 'plane-curves']"

If $X$ were Hausdorff, then consider $u,v \in X$ with disjoint neighbourhoods $U, V$ that separates the points.

906647,Motivation for the proof of the associativity of multiplication of equivalence classes of paths,"After having defined the equivalence classes of paths in a topological space in chapter two of the book A Basic Course in Algebraic Topology , William S. Massey proves the lemma The multiplication of equivalence classes of paths is associative. That is, if $f,g,h$ are paths in $X$ with the terminal point of $f$ being the initial point of $g$, and the terminal point of $g$ being the initial point of $h$ (such that multiplication is defined), then $(f \cdot g) \cdot h = f \cdot (g \cdot h)$. He defines the function $F(t,s) = \begin{cases} f \left( \frac{4t}{1+s}  \right),  & 0 \leq t \leq \frac{s+1}{4} \\ g(4t-1-s), & \frac{s+1}{4} \leq t \leq \frac{s+2}{4} \\ h \left( 1 - \frac{4(1-t)}{2-s} \right), & \frac{2+s}{4} \leq t \leq 1. \end{cases}$ This function is continuous and satisfies $F(t,0)=[(f \cdot g) \cdot h]t$ and $F(t,1) =[f \cdot (g \cdot h)]t$ so the lemma is proved. However, he includes the following diagram: He claims this to be the motivation behind defining $F(t,s)$. Can somebody explain how this is the motivation behind defining $F(t,s)$? The way I see it, we have to continuously go from the first case of $[(f \cdot g) \cdot h]$ to $[f \cdot (g \cdot h)]$. The $s=1$ represents the latter, and $s=0$ the former. The two sloped lines connecting points from $s=0$ with $s=1$ is what ensures the continuity of the function when $s \in (0,1)$.

If no, what is the largest known even number which is the sum of only one pair of prime numbers? The general motivation behind this question is this: Among all even numbers, some can be represented by only $1$ pair of prime numbers, some can be represented by $2$ different pairs of prime numbers, and so forth. So we can split the infinite set of even numbers into disjoint subsets. There are three options with regards to the cardinality of these subsets: All of them are finite All of them are infinite Some are finite and some are infinite My intuition tells me that either one of the first two options is correct.","['goldbachs-conjecture', 'number-theory']"

In our problem, the elements of each vector are integer numbers. The linear span space of $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^mV_{i}$ contains each vector in $V$.

There may exist a reduction to our problem from SET COVER, which is NP-complete. I try to find an approximate algorithm to solve this problem with a provable approximation ratio . One prossible algorithm is that at each step, we can remove one subset $V_i$ from $\{V_1,V_2,...,V_m\}$ under the condition that the span space of union of remainning subsets contains V. For this algorithm, the key issue is how to select a ""good"" $V_i$ at each step to make the final result is near to the optimal result. This approach may have no provable approximation ratio. The worst case that can be used to verify the approximiation ratio of the approximation algorithm is shown as following: $V_1=\{[1,0,\cdots,0]\}$, $V_2=\{[0,1,0,\cdots,0]\}$,...,$V_m=\{[0,0,\cdots,0,1]\}$, in which each set contains one row vector of a $m\times m$ identity matrix. $V={[0,0,\cdots,0,1,1]}$. Therefore, the optimal solution is $\{V_{m-1},V_{m}\}$ and the minimum number is 2. If you have ideas and suggestions, it's pleasure if you can share with me.

Of course, T/n is the sample mean $\bar{x}$ .

906980,"If the generating function summation and zeta regularized sum of a divergent series exist, do they always coincide?","One could assign a value to divergent series by means of several summation methods. One summation method we could consider is the generating function method. Let's sum, for example, the fibonacci series  by means of this method. We consider the generating function of the fibonacci series: $$ g(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_{n} x^{n},  $$ in which the $n$ 'th Fibonacci number is defined as: $f_{n} = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} $ and $f_{0} = 0 $ and $f_{1} = 1$ . In the following wikipedia article it is explained (amongst many other things) that it is possible to find a closed-form for $g$ : $$g(x) = \frac{x}{1-x-x^2} . $$ Therefore, we could state that the divergent series summation by means of the generating function summation method $G$ amounts to taking the following limit: $$ G \Big{(} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f_{n} \Big{)} = \lim_{x \to 1} g(x) = -1 .  $$ We could, also try to assign a value to the sum of all Fibonacci numbers by means of zeta function regularisation. A closed form of the function $$ z(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_{n}^{-x} $$ can be found in equation $(5)$ of the following paper by Navas. (Who mistakenly asserts that he is finding the analytic continuation of the Fibonacci Dirichlet series. He is actually doing zeta function regularization of the Fibonacci series. The two methods are confused quite often, though.) He finds that $$ z(x) = 5^{x/2} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \binom{-x}{k} \frac{1}{\phi^{x+2k} + (-1)^{k+1} } . $$ The zeta regularized sum $R$ of the Fibonacci series is therefore $$ R \Big{(} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_{n} \Big{)} = \lim_{x \to -1} z(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \Big{(} \frac{1}{\phi^{-1} -1} + \frac{1}{\phi + 1} \Big{)} = -1 .$$ We have thus found that the generating function summation and the zeta regularized sum of the Fibonacci series coincide (define $F := \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_{n} )$ : $$ G(F) = -1 = R(F) .$$ This does not always happen, though. If we define the sum of natural numbers $ N = \sum_{n =1}^{\infty} n $ , then $G (N) $ does not exist. This is because the corresponding generating function amounts to $$ p(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n x^{n} = \frac{1}{ (1-x)^{2} } , $$ for which $\lim_{x \to 1 } p(x) $ does not exist. The zeta regularized sum does exist, however. We have the notorious equation $R(N) = - \frac{1}{12} $ (see this page). Question (1) is now: Do the $G$ and $R$ summation methods of a divergent series always coincide, if both methods lead to a finite number that can be assigned to the divergent series at hand? Question (2) : Is there a closed form of the actual analytic continuation of the Fibonacci dirichlet series $ d(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{ f_{n} }{ n^{x} } $ ? Bonus question: are there any references for collections of generating function expansion, zeta function analytic continuations and analytic continuations of dirichlet series?

(Edit:  Feb 2021  I have found out the formula to create the shape...I do not know if it matches the equation given) If we create a face-centered cubic arrangement of these objects, the ridges will ""settle into"" one another. If we now think of them as physical objects, so that they are never allowed to intersect, is it possible to rotate them? (For example, if we have infinitely many gears in a line, they can be rotated. But if we have three arranged in a triangle, it is not possible to rotate them.)
Yes.  The question I seek to answer, is... In a friction-free environment, what might naturally emerge when each of the components is rotating... And how to calculate it.

Hello mathematicians of advanced skills and intuition. I'm a visual guy, who needs a little help describing what I see. I see the ball presented below, as a sort of ""2-sided"" sphere. But also a a 12 sided sphere, because I think that two overlapped tetrahedrons inside of it, could spin and rotate in a toroidal pattern, about a common fixed barycenter, to create this shaped sphere.  But my visual math exceeds my written math abilities, I think. Maybe has something to do with two paired equally overlapped tetrahedrons, of different size, by a factor of 12/13, with their different volumes, describing a common empty barycenter for all of the enclosed space, with the two paired tetrahedrons rotating in toroidal and counter toroidal directions, until their tips have painted the patterns seen with red for the larger, and blue for the smaller, and purple where they balance.  Or something like that?? Could this shape infinitely co-exist in a pattern of balanced counter-rotation, in which gaps accumulate, and dissipate in a balanced fashion where there are changes in speed in any of three paired intersecting coil like balances, patterns of energy transfer, and creation of balance points in the accumulation of matter, from a mathematical perspective. Is this shape stackable and expandable ""geodesically""? Please help me decipher what I see.

907146,Proposed proof of analysis result,"Hi please advise on my proof of the following result: Assume that $I \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is convex, bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary and let $u_{m},u$ be such that $$u_{m} \rightharpoonup^{*} u \text{ in } W^{1,\infty}(I)$$ and $$\Vert \nabla u_{m} \Vert_{L^{\infty}(I)} \leq \alpha$$ for some fixed $\alpha > 0$. Show that $u_{m}$ and $u$ are Lipschitz continuous on $I$ with Lipschitz constant $\alpha$. Proposed Proof: I will first do the proof for the case of $u$. Note that since $u_{m} \rightharpoonup^{*} u$ in $W^{1,\infty}(I)$ it follows that $\nabla u_{m} \rightharpoonup^{*} \nabla u$ in $L^{\infty}(I)$, therefore $\Vert \nabla u \Vert_{L^{\infty}(I)} \leq \liminf\limits_{m \rightarrow \infty}\Vert \nabla u_{m} \Vert_{L^{\infty}(I)} \leq \alpha$. We can write $u(x) = u(a) + \int_{a}^{x}\nabla u(tx+(1-t)y)\cdot(x-y) dt$(Since $u$ is a Sobolev function, it is absolutely continuous on almost every line). We now use the following argument: Consider $$\psi(t) := u(tx + (1-t)y) ~~~ \text{ for } t \in [0,1]$$ Then $$\psi(1) - \psi(0) = \int_{0}^{1}\psi^{'}(t)dt = \int_{0}^{1}\nabla u(tx+(1-t)y)\cdot (x-y)dt$$  therefore $$|u(x)-u(y)| \leq \int_{0}^{1}|\nabla u(tx+(1-t)y)||x-y|dt \leq \Vert \nabla u \Vert_{L^{\infty}}|x-y| \leq \alpha |x-y|$$ This shows $u$ is Lipschitz on $I$ with Lipschitz constant $\alpha$. The same process can be carried out for the case involving $u_{m}$ by using the assumed condition $\Vert u_{m} \Vert_{L^{\infty}} \leq \alpha$. $\square$ Let me know if this proof is fine?

907315,Does every group have a 'cyclization'?,"Here's the question: Does every group have a 'cyclization'? That is, let $G$ be a group. Does there necessarily exist a cyclic group $C$ and a surjective homomorphism $\varphi:G\rightarrow C$ such that for every other cyclic group $H$ such that there is a surjective homomorphism $\psi:G\rightarrow H$ then there is a unique homomorphism $\phi:C\rightarrow H$ such that $\psi=\phi\circ \varphi$? This question is inspired by the existence of the abelianization of a group. Here's what I have done: Let $G$ be a group and $C$ a cyclic group such that $\varphi:G\rightarrow C$ is a surjective homomorphism. Since $C$ is cyclic, $C=\langle c\rangle$ for some $c\in C$. Let $c^m$ and $c^n$ be two other elements of $C$. Since $\varphi$ is surjective, there are elements $g$ and $h\in G$ such that $\varphi(g)=c^m$ and $\varphi(h)=c^n$ (assume $m$ and $n$ are non-zero). Thus $$\varphi(h)^{\text{lcm}(m,n)/n}=c^{\text{lcm}(m,n)}=\varphi(g)^{\text{lcm}(m,n)/m}$$ This implies that 
$$\varphi\left(g^{\text{lcm}(m,n)/m}h^{-\text{lcm}(m,n)/n}\right)=1_C$$ We can conclude then that 
$$N=\langle\;g^{\text{lcm}(m,n)/m}h^{-\text{lcm}(m,n)/n}\;|\;g,h\in G\text{ and }\;m,n\in\Bbb Z-\{0\}\rangle\subseteq\ker\varphi$$ In addition, since
$$xg^{\text{lcm}(m,n)/m}h^{-\text{lcm}(m,n)/n} x^{-1}=(xgx^{-1})^{\text{lcm}(m,n)/m}(xhx^{-1})^{-\text{lcm}(m,n)/n}$$
for any $x\in G$, we get that $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Further, we see that $[G,G]\subseteq N$ since 
$$xyx^{-1}y^{-1}=(xy)^{\text{lcm}(-1,1)/1}(x^{-1}y^{-1})^{-\text{lcm}(-1,1)/-1}\in N$$ So, I seem to be on the right track. Perhaps $G/N$ is itself cyclic. However, even though I know that $G/N$ is abelian, I have no idea on how to show it is cyclic (if it necessarily is). Stepping back from the problem, it would suffice to show that every abelian group has a cyclization since every map onto a cyclic quotient would have to factor through the abelianization of a group. This seems to be obvious. If $G$ is an abelian group which is finitely generated then the Structure Theorem for Finitely-generated Abelian Groups tells us that $G$ is isomorphic to a group that looks like $$C_{d_1}\times C_{d_2}\times\cdots\times C_{d_n}\times FA_m$$ where $d_1\mid d_2\mid \cdots\mid d_n$, each $C_{d_i}$ represents a cyclic group of order $d_i$, and $FA_m$ represents a free abelian group on $m$ generators. In the absence of a $FA_m$ term, the cyclization would be $C_{d_n}$. In the presence of a $FA_m$ term, the cyclization would be $FA_1$. For an abelian group that is not finitely generated, I believe the cyclization would be the trivial group. But I'm having difficulty with this claim. Maybe there's a counter-example here.","['cyclic-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Then since $\{f_n\}$ is a sequence such that every subsequence $\{f_{n_k}\}$ has a further subsubsequence $\{f_{n_{k_j}}\}$ that converges pointwise to $f$, $f_n$ converges pointwise to $f$ as well.

907376,Is there an infinite-dimensional Jordan decomposition?,"I just noticed this embarrassing gap in my understanding of linear algebra. This question seems to be asking something similar, although the questioner doesn't quite say it explicitly. And this question asks a version of the question which I think is a little more naive than what I'd like to say. In finite dimensions, the Jordan decomposition of a linear endomorphism $T$ is the unique way to express $T = T_{ss} + T_n$ where $T_{ss}$ is semisimple, $T_n$ is nilpotent, and $T_{ss}$ commutes with $T_n$. I'm wondering whether something similar holds in infinite dimensions. For a complex Banach space $X$, I think a semisimple operator $T_{ss}$ should be one which commutes with a set of projection operators $P_i$ with $P_i P_j = \delta_{ij} P_i$ with $\oplus_i P_i(X)$ dense in $X$, such that the restriction of $T_{ss}$ to each $P_i(X)$ is a scalar $\lambda_i$. Please let me know if this is the wrong definition. Instead of a nilpotent operator $T_n$, we'll consider a quasinilpotent operator $T_{qn}$, i.e. an operator whose spectrum is $\{0\}$, or equivalently $\lim_{k \to \infty} \|T_{qn}^k\|^{1/k} = 0$. Again let me know if there's a better notion to use here. So then the question is: for an arbitrary bounded operator $T$ on a complex Banach space $X$, do there exist commuting bounded operators $T_{ss}, T_{qn}$ such that $T_{ss}$ is semisimple, $T_{qn}$ is quasinilpotent, and $T=T_{ss}+T_{qn}$? If the answer is no, I'd like a counterexample, and also any results establishing a positive answer on special classes of Banach spaces. It does worry my that a positive answer to my question would immediately imply that any counterexample to the invariant subspace problem differs by a scalar from a quasinilpotent operator. Is this true/known? EDIT As Mariano implicitly points out, the shift operator seems to scuttle this idea since it has no obvious ""diagonal part"" and it is not itself quasinilpotent. But here's a modification to the question that just might be worth making. The quasinilpotent operators are exactly the limits of nilpotent operators in the norm topology. Instead we could take limits of nilpotent operators in the strong topology. Note that the shift operator is of this type. I haven't thought through the ramifications of this defintion -- If there's anything interesting to know about this class of operators, or if they have a name, I'd like to hear it. So: does every operator $T$ on a Banach space decompose as $T = T_{ss} + T'$ where $T_{ss}$ is diagonal, $T'$ is a limit of nilpotent operators in the strong topology, and everything commutes? EDIT As Ivan points out in his answer, although the ""backward shift"" operator on $\ell_p(\mathbb{N})$, say, is ""strong-quasinilpotent"", the ""forward shift"" operator is not. In fact, on $\ell_\infty(\mathbb{N})$, even the backward shift operator is not strong-quasinilpotent. Since the whole point of widening the definition is to accommodate various types of shift operators, the idea really doesn't work. A last-ditch effort would be to restrict to Hilbert spaces and consider ""weak-quasinilpotent"" operators $T$, i.e. those such that $T^n \to 0$ in the weak topology. At least the usual shift operators on $\ell_2(\mathbb{N})$ and $\ell_2(\mathbb{Z})$ are weak-quasinilpotent. Or maybe there's some other approach entirely to characterizing ""shift-type"" operators? In the case where there is no topology, as Ivan points out, it's possible that simply specifying the matrix similarity class of a ""shift operator"" on a space with a countable algebraic basis might yield a sufficiently robust notion.

907517,Behaviour of the function $\ln(1+ x^2)$,"Thus function has derivative equal to: $\frac{2x}{1+x^2}$. This indicates that it will flatten out while approaching infinity, ie, should have an asymptote. Yet, the function does not have any real limiting value at infinity. To imvestigate further, I plotted the graph, which showed the asymptote/limiting value as 14.25 (you may check youtself if this is right) What can the reason be for not getting a real limit from the function itself? Please explain keeping in mind that I am in the last year of high school.","['calculus', 'logarithms', 'graphing-functions', 'functions', 'limits']"

907563,Why the whole theory about differentiable manifolds is based on open sets?,"I only have studied basic topology, which means i haven't studied any about differentiable manifolds. I just skimmed pages on wikipedia. Here is a simple illustration on a basic situation. Let $E$ be a subset of $\mathbb{K}$ and $(V,\| \cdot \|)$ be a normed space over $\mathbb{K}$ and $f:E\rightarrow V$ be a function. It is only neccessary to check whether a point $x$ of $E$ is a limit point of $E$ to make a sense to say that ""$f$ is differentiable at $x$. So that we can define the differentiation of a function whose domain is such as a closed disk in $\mathbb{C}$ or the Cantor set. For this reason, i guess the concept of differentiable manifold does not capture all the properties from which the concept of differentiation comes (i.e. $\mathbb{K}$), since the theory of differentiable manifolds only consider open sets . I guess that if we consider all these cases together, then may the theory look messy. So i think all the concepts of differentiable manifolds are indeed substitutes to this broad consideration. Am i thinking correctly or am i actually not capturing the intrinsic concept of differentiation? While I feel the generalization of  integration to a locally compact Hausdorff space is very natural, i kind of feel that the theory of abstract differentiation is a bit artificial.","['general-topology', 'soft-question', 'real-analysis', 'differential-topology', 'smooth-manifolds']"

907604,Topological spaces vs. metric spaces,"Are there any ""realistic"" examples of topological spaces that are not metric spaces. You are free to invent your own definition of ""realistic"". But, at a minimum, a realistic example is one that occurs naturally as part of some other problem, not something that is fabricated to provide a counterexample or a topology homework exercise. One good example is the topological vector space of all functions $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ under pointwise convergence. Any others? If such examples are difficult to find, maybe there are results in the opposite direction: are there results that say something like ""every topology that satisfies conditions X, Y, Z can be generated from a metric""? One example: a compact Hausdorff space is metrizable if and only if it is second-countable. Any other theorems like that? Edit I found this page , which does a pretty good job of answering my second question. So, that just leaves the first one.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"
