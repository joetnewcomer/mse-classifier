I have noticed that since $1-\cos(ax)$ is analytic in $\mathbb C$, the integral $$\int _{C}  \frac{1-\cos(az)}{z^2}dz$$where $C$ is a simple closed contour around the point $z_0=0$, is by Cauchy's integral formula: $$(1-\cos(az_0))'=a\sin(az_0)=0$$which might hint that the solution lays within integration of half a circle in the positive (or negative) imaginary plane. I also think that since the function inside the integral is even, it is tempting to try and evaluate the real integral from $-\infty$ to $\infty$, and correspondingly evaluate the complex integral for bigger contours.","['complex-analysis', 'integration', 'contour-integration']"

1677183,Taking the topological dual in terms of category theory,"Consider the categories $\mathbf{Vect}$ of vector spaces $X$ with linear maps and $\mathbf{TopVect}$ of topological vector spaces $(X, \tau)$ with continuous linear maps both over $\mathbb{R}$. Taking the algebraic dual is a contravariant functor $* : \mathbf{Vect} \to \mathbf{Vect}$ with $X \mapsto X^*$ and $(f : X \to Y) \mapsto (f^* : Y^* \to X^*)$ (the transpose of $f$) with $(f^*(y^*))(x) := y^*(f(x))$. Similarly, it is also clear that taking the topological dual leads to a contravariant functor $' : \mathbf{TopVect} \to \mathbf{Vect}$ with $X \mapsto X'$ and $(f : X \to Y) \mapsto (f' : Y' \to X')$ with $(f'(y'))(x) := y'(f(x))$. In order to see that this is indeed a functor it is enough to observe that $f'$ is just $f^*$ restricted to $Y' \subseteq Y^*$ and is well-defined, i.e. $f^*|_{Y'} \subseteq X'$ due to continuity of $f$. We can also consider the ""taking the weak* topological dual"" as the contravariant functor $'_\sigma : \mathbf{TopVect} \to \mathbf{TopVect}$ with $X \mapsto X'_\sigma$ and $(f : X \to Y) \mapsto (f' : Y' \to X')$ with $(f'(y'))(x) := y'(f(x))$. Clearly, $'_\sigma$ is well-defined, i.e. $X'_\sigma$ is an object in $\mathbf{TopVect}$ and $f'$ is a morphism in $\mathbf{TopVect}$ since $f'$ is continuous (and linear) by the choice of the weak-* topology on both $X'$ and $Y'$. Similarly, one can also consider more general functors equipping $X'$ with some vector space topology type $\tau_{\text{source}}$ and $Y'$ with a topology type $\tau_{\text{target}}$ such that all the $f'$ are continuous. Questions: Is it possible to decompose the $'_\sigma$-functor into $'_\sigma = E_\sigma \circ \, '$ where $E_\sigma$ is some kind of ""equip with the weak* topology"" functor? The problem is, that we loose information about the space $X$ when performing $'$, but we need $X$ in order to define $E_\sigma$. One plausible solution is to redefine $'$ to $\bar{'} := (', id) : \mathbf{TopVect} \to \mathbf{TopVect} \times \mathbf{Vect}$, $X \mapsto (X', X)$ and set $E_\sigma : im(\bar{'}) \to \mathbf{TopVect}$ that sends the pair $(X', X)$ to the topological vector space $(X', \sigma(X', X))$
where $im(\bar{'})$ is the particular subcategory of $\mathbf{TopVect} \times \mathbf{Vect}$ that we can reach by $\bar{'}$. This construction seems to be rather ugly and artificial. Maybe there is a better description for such a decomposition. All these ""take some top. dual functors"" seem to be special instances of the ""take the algebraic dual"" functor. Is there a better more abstract point of view for such a relation?","['functional-analysis', 'category-theory']"

After that I'm lost. Is the square root to go back to the difference but without the negatives? Also, why do we divide by $n-1$ on sample, and by $n$ on the population?

1677258,Proving (without using complex numbers) that a real polynomial has a quadratic factor,"The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra tells us that any polynomial with real coefficients can be written as a product of linear factors over $\mathbb{C}$. If we don't want to use $\mathbb{C}$, the best we can say is: If $p(x)$ is a polynomial with real coefficients, $\deg p > 2$, then
  there exists some quadratic polynomial $q(x)$ such that $q(x)$ is a
  factor of  $p(x)$.  (There are then two cases: either $q(x)$ is
  irreducible over $\mathbb{R}$, or it can be further factored as a
  product of linear factors.) This is easily proven as a corollary of the FTA:  If we work over $\mathbb{C}$, $p(x)$ can be written as a product of linear factors, and since a complex number $z$ is a root of $p(x)$ if and only if its conjugate $\bar{z}$ is, we can pair up linear factors so as to get a real quadratic. (In fact, the theorem above -- which seems at first glance like a weaker form of the FTA -- is equivalent to it, since every real quadratic can be factored over $\mathbb{C}$.) Is there a way to prove the above theorem without invoking complex numbers?  It seems to have a certain value on its own as a property of the reals.  For example, the fact that any even-degree real polynomial of $\deg 2n$ can be factored into $n$ (real) quadratics seems like something one should be able to prove without needing to change fields. A version of this question was asked at Factorize real polynomials to quadratic factors. Proof without fundamental theorem of algebra. , but the accepted (and only) answer there just concluded that such a proof would be equivalent to the FTA.  I already know that; I'm wondering how one could write such a proof without passing to the algebraic closure. Or, to put it another way:  The statement of the theorem would make sense (and would be true) even if complex numbers had never been invented (or discovered, if you are a Platonist).  So it seems like it ought to be provable without using complex numbers.  Is it?","['abstract-algebra', 'real-numbers', 'polynomials', 'alternative-proof']"
1677269,Certain symmetrized product of cosines - can it be transformed into more manageable form,"I am interested in the following expression:
$$
F_{k_1,\ldots,k_n}(t):=\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\cos(\sigma(1)k_1t)\cos(\sigma(2)k_2t)\cdots\cos(\sigma(n)k_nt)
$$
where $k_1, \ldots, k_n$ are natural numbers (can be assumed all different) and $\sigma$ runs over the full permutation group on $\{1,...,n\}$. Does this resemble anything simpler? I want any kind of additional information. To ask something slightly more concrete: expanding this into powers of $t$, coefficients are obviously symmetric functions of $k_1,\ldots,k_n$; they look quite impenetrable. For example,
$$
F_{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4}(t) = 24-90s_1t^2 + \left(\frac{177}2s_1^2+96s_2\right)t^4 - \left(\frac{163}4s_1^3 + \frac{233}2s_1s_2 + 21s_3 \right)t^6 + \text{(more and more horrible fractions)},

1677306,How to simplify this equation regarding pronic numbers for integer solutions,"A pronic number is a number that can be expressed as the product of two consecutive positive integers. For instance, $42 = 6 \cdot 7$ is a pronic number. I've become interested in solving for the sequence of all pronic numbers $x_{n}$ such that $2x_{n}$ is also a pronic number. This is essentially then solving the equation $\dfrac{m(m+1)}{n(n+1)} = \dfrac{1}{2}$ for positive integer solutions, I think. My first thought was to take a purely computational approach, and generate a list of all pronic numbers to some limit and them check as to whether each pronic number $\times 2$ was in my list, but this is far too costly and it seems to me there should me some mathematics to simplify my problem. I took a look at the generating function for pronic numbers, and found it to be $\dfrac{2x}{(1-x)^{3}}$.

$$\int {\frac{1}{(-(3+2\tan u-3)^{2}+4)^{1/2}}}\,\,\,(2\sec^{2}u) du$$ which yields:$$\int {\frac{1}{(-(2\tan u)^{2}+4)^{1/2}}}\,\,(2\sec^{2}u) du$$ which is the same as saying: $$\int {\frac{1}{(-4\tan^{2}u+4)^{1/2}}}\,\,\,(2\sec^{2}u) du$$ which can be rearranged to give: $$\int {\frac{1}{(4-4\tan^{2}u)^{1/2}}}\,\,\,(2\sec^{2}u) du$$ Applying the constant multiple rule to the integral yields:
$$\frac 12\int {\frac{1}{(1-\tan^{2}u)^{1/2}}}\,\,\,(\sec^{2}u) du$$ Now we know that pythagorean identity: $$\tan^{2}u=\sec^{2}u-1$$ so substituting I end up with an indefinite integral that looks like this:
$$\frac 12\int {\frac{1}{(1-\sec^{2}u+1)^{1/2}}}\,\,\,(\sec^{2}u) du$$ which gives:
$$\frac 12\int {\frac{1}{(2-\sec^{2}u)^{1/2}}}\,\,\,(\sec^{2}u) du$$ However this is obviously wrong because I think it is unsolvable. So where did I veer from the right path?","['indefinite-integrals', 'integration', 'trigonometry', 'calculus']"
1677351,Example 19.6 in van der Vaart: show that the class of indicator functions is P-Glivenko-Cantelli and P-Donsker,"I have some doubts related to example 19.6 in van der Vaart ""Asymptotic Statistics"" which applies Theorem 19.4 (Glivenko-Cantelli) and Theorem 19.5 (Donsker) to the distribution function. Definitions: Consider a random variable $X:\Omega \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ defined on the probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P})$ with probability distribution $P$. All functions mentioned from now on will be random functions from $\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathbb{R}$. Consider two functions $l,u$. A bracket $[l,u]$ is the set of all functions $f$ with $l\leq f\leq u$. A $\epsilon$-bracket in $L_r(P)$ is a bracket with $\int_{\mathcal{X}}(u-x)^rdP<\epsilon^r$ with $0<\epsilon<\infty$ and $r>0$.  The $L_r(P)$ norm of a function $f$ is $(\int_{\mathcal{X}}|f|^rdP)^{\frac{1}{r}}$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a class of functions $f$. The bracketing number $N_{[\text{ }\text{ }]}(\epsilon, \mathcal{F}, L_r(P))$ is the minimum number of $\epsilon$-brackets in $L_r(P)$ to cover $\mathcal{F}$. The entropy is $\log(N_{[\text{ }\text{ }]}(\epsilon, \mathcal{F}, L_r(P)))$. The bracketing integral $J_{[\text{ }\text{ }]}(1, \mathcal{F}, L_2(P)):=\int_{0}^1 \sqrt{log(N_{[\text{ }\text{ }]}(\epsilon, \mathcal{F}, L_2(P)))d\epsilon}$. Setting: (1) $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^N$ i.i.d. defined on the probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P})$; $X_i:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$; $P$ is the probability distribution function of $X_i$; $F$ is the cdf of $X_i$ (2) Take the the class of functions $\mathcal{F}:=\{f_t \text{ s.t. } f_t=1(X_i\leq t) \text{ and } t \in \mathbb{R}\}$, where $1(\cdot)$ is the indicator function taking value $1$ if the condition inside is satisfied and $0$ otherwise. I want to show that (1)  $N_{[ \text{ }]}(\epsilon, \mathcal{F}, L_1(P))<\infty$ $\forall \epsilon>0$ (2) $J_{[ \text{ }]} (1, \mathcal{F}, L_2(P))<\infty$  $\leftrightarrow$ $\log N_{[ \text{ }]}(\epsilon, \mathcal{F}, L_1(P))=O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$ Here a summary of the proof in the book with my questions: (a) I believe that (2) implies (1). Hence the proof is focused on showing (2) (b) Consider a finite partition of the extended real line in $-\infty=t_0<t_1<...<t_k=\infty$ such that $\lim_{t\rightarrow t_j^{-}} F(t)-F(t_{j-1})<\epsilon$ for $j=1,...,k$ [it can be shown that it exists]. Consider the brackets $[1(X_i \leq t_{j-1}), 1(X_i \leq t_j)]$ $j=1,...,k$ (c) These brackets have $L_1(F)$-size equal to $\epsilon$, i.e. $\int_{\mathbb{R}}1(x\leq  t_{j})- 1(x \leq t_{j-1})dF=F(t_j)-F(t_{j-1})<\epsilon$. Where does this come from ? The condition $\lim_{t\rightarrow t_j^{-}} F(t)-F(t_{j-1})<\epsilon$ does not imply $F(t_j)-F(t_{j-1})<\epsilon$ unless $t_{j}$ is a continuity point of $F$ (d) Choose $k<\frac{2}{\epsilon}$. How do I know that this is possible? (e) For any function $g(X_i)$ such that $0\leq g\leq 1$ (and hence in one of the brackets) $\int_{\mathbb{R}}g^2 dF\leq \int_{\mathbb{R}}gdF$ (f) Hence, the  $L_2(F)$-size of the brackets is bounded by $\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Why? (g) Hence, $N_{[ \text{ }]}(\sqrt{\epsilon}, \mathcal{F}, L_2(P))\leq \frac{2}{\epsilon}$. Why? (h) Hence, $N_{[ \text{ }]}(\epsilon, \mathcal{F}, L_2(P))\in O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$. Just by taking the square of (f) (i) Hence $\log (N_{[ \text{ }]}(\epsilon, \mathcal{F}, L_2(P)))$ is of order smaller than the order of $\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$. Why not $O(\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}))$ [just by taking the log of the square of (g)]? (l) This implies $\log (N_{[ \text{ }]}(\epsilon, \mathcal{F}, L_2(P)))\in  O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$. Why? Is that because $O(\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})) \in O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$?

Essentially, all non-constant solutions must either lie on a limit cycle (which is unique) or converge to this limit cycle. However, in the form given above, there are stationary points at $x = \pm 1$ that are stable if $\lambda < 1$, there is a Hopf bifurcation as $\lambda$ increases past $1$, and numerical evidence suggests that there are unstable limit cycles coexisting with stable large amplitude limit cycles for some $\lambda < 1$.

1677497,Parallel curve to a sine wave,"I've been trying to find the formula for the offset/parallel to a sine wave.  Not just the parametric equation, but the y = f(x) form. Here's what I've done so far:
Read up on the parametric form and plugged in the x(t) and y(t) formulas. What I get is of course a parametric equation in terms of t. If $$ y =  \sin x $$ then the parameterization would be $$ x = t $$ $$ y = \sin  t $$ Plugging in the offset formula: $$ x_d(t)  = t + \frac{d\cdot\cos t}{\sqrt{1 + \cos^2 t}} $$ $$ y_d(t)  = \sin t  - \frac{d}{\sqrt {1 + \cos^2 t}} $$ Now, that's all accurate, but it doesn't put it into a function form.  According to my calculus book, the next step is to solve each of these for t and then set them equal to one another.  The problem is that they are kind of a mess, with those sinusoidal functions involved. My question is:  What's the y =  f(x) form for an offset curve of a sine wave?

I can draw it no problem in C#:
The intersection point was found using trial and error and is approximately 0.63. There are two blue lines, two red lines and two green lines, because I used +0.63 offset and -0.63 offset from the sine wave. Thank you in advance for any help.","['derivatives', 'calculus']"

3x + y - z+u^2=0 \\

Proof: Let $\mathbf{f}:\mathbb{R}^4\to \mathbb{R}^3$ defined by $$\mathbf{f}(x,y,z,u)=(3x + y - z+u^2, x - y + 2z+u, 2x + 2y - 3z+2u).$$ Also we see that $\mathbf{f}(0,0,0,0)=(0,0,0)$ and $\mathbf{f}'(0,0,0,0)=A$ where $[A]$ has the following form (relative to the standard basis) $$[A]=\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\
1 & -1 & 2 & 1 \\
2 & 2 & -3 & 2

Our linear operator $A\in L(\mathbb{R}^4,\mathbb{R}^3)$ can be written as: $A(x,y,z,u)=A_1(x,y,u)+A_2(z)$ where $A_1(x,y,u)=A(x,y,0,u)$ and $A_2(z)=A(0,0,z,0)$. And $$[A_1]=\begin{bmatrix}

Since $\det[A_1]=-12\neq 0$ then $A_1$ is invertible. Then by implicit function theorem exists open neighborhood $W\in \mathbb{R}$ and $U\in \mathbb{R}^4$ of $0$ and $(0,0,0,0)$ respectively. Also to every $z\in W$ exists a unique $(x(z),y(z), u(z))$ such that $$(x(z),y(z), u(z),z)\in U \quad\text{and}\quad \mathbf{f}(x(z),y(z), u(z),z)=0.$$ Hence the system of equations can be solved for $x,y,u$ in terms of $z$.

There might be something similar in the quiz... Statistical decision theory: a decision-theoretic approach to the estimation of an unknown parameter $\theta$ introduces the loss function $L(\theta, a)$ which, loosely speaking, gives the cost of deciding that the parameter has the value $a$, when it is in fact equal to $\theta$. The estimate $a$ can be chosen to minimize the posterior expected loss,
$$E(L(a|y))=  \int L(\theta,a)p(\theta|y)d\theta$$
This optimal choice of $a$ is called a Bayes estimate for the loss function $L$. Show that: (a) If $L(\theta, a) = (\theta − a)^2$ (squared error loss), then the posterior mean, $E(\theta|y)$, if it exists, is the unique Bayes estimate of $\theta$. (b) If $L(\theta, a) = |\theta − a|$, then any posterior median of $\theta$ is a Bayes estimate of $\theta$. (c) If $k_0$ and $k_1$ are non negative numbers, not both zero, and $L(\theta,a)= k_0(\theta−a)$ if $\theta\geq a$,  $k_1(a−\theta)$ if $\theta<a$, then any $k_0$ quantile of the posterior distribution $p(\theta|y)$ is a Bayes estimate of $\theta$.","['bayesian', 'statistics', 'statistical-inference']"

1677628,A nice way to do Euler's method on a calculator?,"As part of the calculator paper for IB (International Baccalaureate), we may be asked to do Euler's method, for say, 10 iterations. While it is feasible to do with a calculator (slightly easier if you have 2 calculators), it is quite a nuisance, and it is quite easy to make a mistake when I have to retype the numbers back into the calculator. The problem here is that calculators can only store 1 answer ( Ans ) at a time, and that any attempt to store your answer into a memory slot would delete your calculation line which you would have to type in again. On the other hand, you can easily use the calculator to execute recursive functions which only rely on 1 variable. For example, I can calculate the $n$th term of the following recursive sequence by repeatedly pressing the = button: $$T_{n+1}=T_n^3+\sqrt{T_n}-\frac{1}{T_n},\, T_0=5$$ In this example, I would first press 5 = and then type in ${Ans}^3+\sqrt{Ans}-\frac{1}{Ans}$ and press = $n$ times to get $T_n$. However, this is not possible with Euler's method which has recursive formulas: $$x_{n+1}=x_n+h$$
$$y_{n+1}=y_n+h\frac{dy_n}{dx_n}$$ where $h$ is the step (which can be pre-stored in a memory slot) and $\frac{dy_n}{dx_n}=f(x_n, y_n)$. We are allowed to use a graphical calculator (GDC) which has several functions. I have found a way to do this using the spreadsheet function which is quite fiddly, but at least avoids copying mistakes when retyping numbers into my calculator. I was wondering if there were yet easier methods to do this, so I shall ask for the following methods, if possible: Method A I would prefer it if a method with the following restrictions could be used to execute Euler's method: You have a calculator which is an ordinary scientific calculator which has the ability to store the previous answer (Ans). You have the ability to type in a whole function in terms of (Ans) as shown in the first example. Is it possible to type in a one-liner which would do Euler's method by repeatedly pressing = ? *Note: I am aware that this method is probably possible but may be quite complicated to type in/learn. Therefore I would prefer Method B if it is simpler, as I would be under the time pressure of an exam. Nevertheless, I would still be interested in a method A which can do Euler's method for me as I personally prefer my ordinary scientific calculator to my GDC. Method B In addition to the Ans tool given in Method A, you also have the ability to type in $m\times n$ matrices in your calculator. The calculator can take in matrices in its input, and can output matrices which will be stored to Ans. Matrix multiplication (and raising to a power) can be carried out along with transpose, determinant and inverse functions (where possible) on matrices. Note that I cannot ""get"" cell $(i,j)$ of a matrix - I have to use the matrix as a whole. However, I can still do something like the following: $$\pi\begin{bmatrix}\sqrt{\det\left({Ans}^{T} \times \begin{bmatrix}3 & 4\\12 & \det(Ans)\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\right)} & 4\\\det(Ans)^2 & -\det({Ans}^2)\end{bmatrix}^3$$ Similarly, is there a one-liner which would be able to do Euler's method? EDIT: Method C Unfortunately, it turns out that my calculator cannot accept matrices within matrices which is a real shame - my mistake that I thought it could. It can only manipulate matrix answers, and I can only type in constant matrices. Nevertheless, I'm sure there is a way to circumvent this problem with some matrix multiplication. So ny calculator can only do something like: $$\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\ 8 & 2\end{bmatrix}^{-2}\times {Ans}^T \times {(Mat\, A)}^{-1}$$ (Where Mat A is previously stored in the memory. Note that Ans can still be a matrix) Note that my calculators can store values (and matrices in the case of method B) into their memory, but that would only be initial values for variables (like $h$, $x_0$ and $y_0$), as the one-liner must be deleted before I can type in the line which can store memory. In addition to these methods, if there is some function/tool I am completely missing on these calculators which I could use to simplify my task, I would be glad to hear it.","['eulers-method', 'calculator', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

But for it to be a monomorphism, I need $\phi(1)=1$(right?). Then I first have the map $\phi(p)=p+0i=p$ Now if I try to come up with a different monomorphism, namely a non-identity map, so if I have any $t \in \mathbb{Q}$, $t=\frac{p}{q}$ then $\phi'(t=\frac{p}{q})=\frac{\phi'(p)}{\phi'(q)}$. But even for this map, I must have the rule $\phi'(1)=1$. Then, $\phi'(p)=\phi'(1+...+1)=p\phi'(1)=p$ and in a similar manner we end up $\phi'$ mapping it to the same element in $\mathbb{C}$.

Let $\overline A$ be the unique self-adjoint extension of $A$. Question: Is it true that $\ker(A) = \ker(\overline A)$? I don't really see any reason for this to be true, so I tried constructing a counterexample... but somehow this is not so easy to do! For instance, I tried starting with the negative Laplacian $\Delta = - \frac{d^2}{dx^2}$ on $L^2(S^1)$ with domain $\mathrm{dom}(\Delta) = C^\infty(S^1)$. This is an essentially self-adjoint operator and the closure $\overline \Delta$ is easily understood if we look to the frequency domain. On $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$, we find $\overline \Delta$ is conjugate to the diagonal operator $D$ on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$ given by $D(a_n) = (n^2a_n)$ and with domain $\{ (a_n) \in \ell^2(\mathbb{Z}) : (na_n) \in \ell^2(\mathbb{Z})\}$. From this, we conclude that $\Delta$ and $\overline \Delta$ have the same one-dimensional kernel. 
$$\ker(\Delta) = \ker(\overline \Delta) = \{\text{constant functions}\} \subset L^2(S^1).$$
Next I tried to replace $\Delta$ by its restriction $\Delta_S$ to some smaller subspace $S \subset C^\infty(S^1)$ such that $S$ intersects trivially with the constant functions, but still manages to be a core for $\Delta$, i.e. has $\overline \Delta_S = \overline \Delta$. However, every subspace $S$ like this I try turns out to give a non essentially self-adjoint $\Delta_S$. For instance, taking $S = \{f \in C^\infty(S^1) : f(p) = 0\}$ for some point $p$ fails. So does taking $S$ to be the smooth functions vanishing on a whole neighbourhood of some point $p$.

Or perhaps just a way of look at the classic result as more than a computational tool would be nice already. There is a part of Neukirch's book where he discusses the quadratic reciprocity (way before CFT), and he says that ""the law of decomposition in the cyclotomic field provides the proper explanation to Gauss' Reciprocity Law"".

In this case, $ z=\frac1{2a}(x^2+y^2), D: x^2+y^2 \le 3a^2 $ , so
$$z_x = \frac1ax,\ z_y= \frac1ay$$ $$ A=\iint\limits_D \sqrt{1 + \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{a^2}} dxdy= \frac1a \iint\limits_D \sqrt{a^2+x^2+y^2} dxdy $$ using polar coordinates to do the remain steps:
$$\frac1a \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\sqrt3a} \sqrt{a^2+r^2}r dr=\frac\pi a\frac23 ({a^2+r^2})^\frac32\bigg|_0^{\sqrt3a}=\frac{14} 3\pi a^2$$","['multivariable-calculus', 'surface-integrals', 'integration']"

1678763,Resolution of the $E_8$ singularity with a weighted blowup,"I am reading Miles Reid's notes on weighted projective spaces, and I'm a little confused about a particular paragraph (notes here , page 8): A famous case is the $E_8$ singularity $X: (x^2+y^3+z^5=0)$, which is
  naturally weighted homogeneous with weights 15,10,6. The
  $\mathbb{G}_m$ quotient morphism $X \to \mathbb{P}^1$ defined by the
  ratio $x^2:y^3:z^5$ has stabiliser of order 2, 3, and 5. The weighted
  blowup $Y \to X$ (the graph of the quotient morphism $X \to
\mathbb{P}^1$) is a surface having cyclic quotient singularities of
  order 2,3,5 at the 3 points, giving rise to the Dynkin diagram of
  $E_8$. I'd like to see this very explicitly. I agree that $\mathbb{P}(15,10,6) \cong \mathbb{P}^2$, and I can see that the equation $x^2 + y^3 + z^5$ becomes $u+v+w$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$, with coordinates $(u,v,w)$, so I agree that $X \to \mathbb{P}^1$. However, I am having trouble writing the equations for the graph and observing the singularities Reid describes. Here is what I can do:
The map $\mathbb{A}^3 \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{P}(15,10,6)$ is given by $(x,y,z) \mapsto [x:y:z]$, and the isomorphism $\mathbb{P}(15,10,6) \to \mathbb{P}^2$ is $[x:y:z] \mapsto [x^2:y^3:z^5]$. The graph of this map is
$$
\Gamma = \{(x,y,z) \times [u:v:w] \,|\, uy^3=vx^2, uz^5=wx^2,wy^3=vz^5\}
$$
Restricting to $w=-u-v$ I get the equations $(uy^3=vx^2, uz^5=(-u-v)x^2,(-u-v)y^3=vz^5)$. Taking partial derivatives, this appears to be singular everywhere. What have I done wrong?","['projective-space', 'algebraic-geometry', 'blowup']"

But the problem is most arguments are given in the form of exercises, which means I am always stuck. The typical situation is after $2$ hours work, maybe I am still in the same page. But the book has almost $800$ pages! Hartshorne has some proof, the exercises also have some explanation. So maybe I should try to work Hartshorne? Another question is about exercises. How long should I spend for an exercise that stick me. Should I look up a solution after maybe struggling for half hour? There are solutions for Hartshorne, so maybe study Hartshorne is more convenient since it is easier to look up solution? Also, what is the right pace to learn the stuff?

1678858,Universal property of topology of uniform convergence,"What kind of universal property does the strong dual topology on $X'$ have, for $X$ being a locally convex space.

What kind of universal property does the uniform norm have? EDIT: What I actually want to know is, in which sense the (bounded) uniform convergence topologies are categorical EDIT: It is known that there is an adjoint pair of functors $(F,G)$ between the symmetric monoidal categories of locally convex spaces and convex bornological spaces. The latter is closed, i.e. for $X,Y \in \mathsf{cbs}$ there is an internal hom object $[X,Y] \in \mathsf{cbs}$, which is just the set of bounded maps together with the bornology of equibounded sets of linear maps. For $A,B \in \mathsf{lcs}$ we obtain a topological space $G(F(A),F(B))$ and since the adjoint pair is the identity on set level, we have $G(F(A),F(B))=B(A,B)$. Moreover, we know that $\mathcal{L}(A,B) \subseteq B(A,B)$. Thus, we can endow $\mathcal{L}(A,B)$ with the initial topology with respect to this inclusion. My guess is, that this coincides with the bounded uniform convergence topology.","['functional-analysis', 'locally-convex-spaces', 'topological-vector-spaces', 'universal-property']"
1678871,Two ways of inducing a metric/topology on a manifold.,"Consider $\Bbb R^3$ equipped with the usual euclidean metric and topology. And consider the subset $S^2 := \{ x\in\Bbb R^3\,|\,d(x,0)=1\}\subset\Bbb R^3$ . Suppose we wanted to make $S^2$ in to a metric space on its own, it seems to me that there are two distinct ways of doing so. The first way would be to define a metric $\,\overline d:\, S^2\times S^2 \rightarrow \Bbb R\,,\;  \overline d(x,y):=d(x,y)\;$ (it is easy to show that this forms a metric on $S^2$). The problem I have with this definition is that it does not really resemble the distance we intuitivly think of when thinking of the sphere (for example the distance between north-and south-pole is 2 instead of $\pi$). The other obvious way would be to define the metric $\widehat d $ by considering all paths on the sphere between to points and defining the distance as the infimum of the lenghts of those paths. This also defines a metric on $S^2$ and seems to be the more intuitive way of doing so (distance between north-and south-pole is $\pi$) . Since the two metrics are not equal, my question is: Do $\overline d$ and $\widehat d$ induce the same topology on $S^2$ ? And if so, is this generally true for manifolds that are embedded in $\Bbb R^n$ ?","['manifolds', 'general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"
1678883,Conditional distribution of random variable X given itself,"I'm stuck with something that might seem trivial but gives me headache.
What is the distribution of $X|X$, i.e. the conditional distribution of $X$ given $X$? I'm pretty confident that: $$\mathbb P(X\le t|X\le s)=\frac{\mathbb P(X\le t  \cap X\le s)}{\mathbb P(X\le s)}=\frac{\mathbb P(X\le t)}{\mathbb P(X\le s)}$$
if $t\le s$ and
$$\mathbb P(X\le t|X\le s)=1$$ otherwise, $t>s$.
However from this point onwards, I am confused.
My intuitive answer would be that the conditional distribution $X|X$ is either the distribution of $X$ or $1$ (but a distribution equal to $1$ doesn't make any sense). P.S. I believe this is related to the question what is the joint distribution of X with itself, $f_{XX}(x,x)$, by
$$f_{XX}(x,x)=f_{X|X}(x|x)\cdot f_{X}(x)$$

I tried to substitute $l = (h+2p)(x+2y)$ and $k= 3py$ and this takes care of the expressions at the two ends, but the expressions in the middle are stumping me. Alternatively, one may try expressing it in the form $(l+2k)^2 - 3lk$, but I am unable to do this as well. However, I suspect that there is some relationship as $-3lk$ bears resemblance to $- 3p^2(x+2y)^2-3y^2(h+2p)^2$ if you factor out the $-3$. Is it possible to use Fibonnacci Identity in this endeavor? EDIT: The original expression is $(h^2 + 4ph + p^2)(x^2 + 4xy + y^2)$ 
I converted this to $$((h+2p)^2-3p^2)((x+2y)^2-3y^2)$$ EDIT: I tried an alternative approach. I multiplied out this expression:
$$(h^2 + 4ph + p^2)(x^2 + 4xy + y^2)$$ and got the following:
$$h^2x^2 + p^2x^2 + h^2y^2 + p^2y^2 + 4hpx^2 + 4xyh^2 + 4xyp^2 +4hpy^2 + 16hpxy$$ (I'm leaving out some steps) This can be factored into :

Can we use this method to find more complicated integrals (assuming the derivatives exist of course)?

1678979,Concrete Mathematics - Understanding the generalization in chapter 1 (Josephus),"A couple of months ago, I asked this question, and received a solid answer which provided a thorough level of detail and analysis on the logic behind the initial proof for $A(n) = f(n)$. To clarify, his goal is to show that this recurrence: $$f(1) = \alpha;$$
$$f(2n) = 2f(n) + \beta;$$
$$f(2n + 1) = 2f(n) + \gamma;$$ is equivalent to the following closed form: $$f(n) = A(n)\alpha + B(n)\beta + C(n)\gamma;$$ Deducing that, $$A(n) = 2^m;$$
$$B(n) = 2^m - l - 1;$$
$$C(n) = l$$ However, this requires a proof to be certain. In order to do this, he first proves that $A(n) = 2^m$ through the following recurrence: $$A(1) = 1;$$ 
$$A(2n) = 2A(n) + \beta$$
$$A(2n + 1) = 2A(n) + \gamma$$ for $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = (1, 0, 0)$ Then, using $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = (1, 0, 1)$ he provides: $$1 = \alpha;$$
$$2n = 2 \times 1 + \beta$$
$$2n + 1 = 2 \times 1 + \gamma$$ Which satisfies $f(n) = n$. For $f(n) = 1$, he provides: $$1 = \alpha;$$
$$1 = 2\times1 + \beta$$
$$1 = 2\times1 + \gamma$$ Which gives us $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = (1, -1, -1)$ What I'm trying to figure out is the big picture behind all of this. My understanding is that this technique of generalization for $f$ can be used as a framework for solving different kinds of problems using the fact that we can essentially represent any value $n$ as $2^m + l$, and then derive a recurrence of the given form, using arbitrary constants $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ for some arbitrary purpose. What I don't understand is... how exactly is it that these proofs actually  show this is true? I understand, given the question I provided and its corresponding answer, that they're designed to fill gaps in areas where representing $f(n)$ through some form of these constants requires that $f(n)$ be defined for all n, and that this is a means of providing such proof. How is it that these statements show this fact when they require that $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ be defined to specific values for each case?","['algebra-precalculus', 'discrete-mathematics']"
