2366022,Peter Weyl theorem in $SU(2)$ : basis of $L_2[SU(2)]$,"I have a very basic question about the Peter Weyl theorem in $SU(2)$. I don't want any generalisation, I just want to basically understand what the book precisely mean here. First some explanations. The Peter Weyl theorem says that the entries of Wigner matrices form an ortogonal basis of $L_2[SU(2)]$. So this ensemble form an orthogonal basis of $L_2[SU(2)]$ : $$ \{ U \mapsto D^j_{mm'}(U) \} $$ with $U \in SU(2)$, $j$ is the spin, $m$ and $m'$ are the line and columns entries of the Wigner Matrix $D(U),$ ($-j \leq m \leq j$ and  $-j \leq m' \leq j$) . In my book it is written : What I don't totally understand is in red. I agree that $D^j(U)$ is a map from $H_j$ to $H_j$ but : Why can we say it is an element of $H_j \otimes H_j$ ? And if we admit it, we are talking about the matrices element $D_{mm'}^j(U)$ and not the map  $U \mapsto D^j_{mm'}(U)$ . In other words, on the lhs of 5.17 we have maps from $SU(2)$ to $\mathbb{C}$ and on the rhs we have linear map in a vector space (so at fixed $j$ it is map from $H_j$ to $H_j$). So, it is not the same ""kind"" of quantities and I don't understand","['representation-theory', 'group-theory', 'linear-algebra']"
2366032,convergent or divergent $\int_{-4}^{1} \frac{dz}{(z + 3)^3}$,"Question Determine whether convergent or divergent. $$
\int_{-4}^{1} \frac{dz}{(z + 3)^3}
$$ Thinking I'm not sure how best to go about this, whether I'm justified in my result. Basically I'm saying that as I can't find the first limit, the integral is divergent. I'm not sure if I should be, in some way, trying to combine the two limits (and using L'Hopitals), or if as soon as I've established that one doesn't exist the whole thing can be determined to be divergent (I think this is correct). If of one of the two limits is divergent, can I conclude that the integral is divergent? Definition If $f$ is continuous at all $x$ in the interval $[a, b]$, except maybe at $c$ ,
where $a < c < b$ , and if $\lim_{x \to c} |f(x)| = + \infty$ , then $$
  \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathop{dx} =
  \lim_{t \to c^- }  \int_{a}^{t}  f(x) \mathop{dx}
  + 
  \lim_{s \to c^+ }  \int_{s}^{b}  f(x) \mathop{dx}
$$ if this limit exists, otherwise it is divergent. Working The improper integral is $$
\int \frac{dz}{(z + 3)^3} = - \frac{1}{2(z + 3)^2} + C
$$ There's a discontinuity at $z = -3$ , so splitting the integral up as \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \int_{-4}^{1} \frac{dz}{(z + 3)^3}
    &    =
    \lim_{a \to -3^-}

    &=
    - \frac{1}{2}

      \left[
        \frac{1}{(z + 3)^2}

    \right)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*} The first limit, $\lim_{a \to -3^-} \left[\frac{1}{(z + 3)^2} \right]_{-4}^{a}$,
is found as \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \lim_{a \to -3^-} \left[\frac{1}{(z + 3)^2} \right]_{-4}^{a} &=

2366036,Probability puzzle about crossing lights â€“ what is wrong with my reasoning?,"Calvin has to cross several signals when he walks from his home to
  school. Each of these signals operate independently. They alternate
  every 80 seconds between green light and red light.At each signal,
  there is a counter display that tells him how long it will be before
  the current signal light changes. Calvin has a magic wand which lets
  him turn a signal from red to green instantaneously. However, this
  wand comes with limited battery life, so he can use it only for a
  specified number of times. If the total number of signals is 2 and Calvin can use his magic
  wand only once, then what is the expected waiting time at the signals
  when Calvin optimally walks from his home to school? I was convinced that I had the right solution, but apparently I didn't but I cannot see what is wrong with my reasoning. My solution is as follows: Each light, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ have uniformly distributed waiting times in $[0, 80]$. Basically, he has to make a decision at the first light. At the second light, he always uses the wand if it is available. I assume that he has to pick some optimal waiting time $x \in [0, 80]$ at the first light such that if $Y_1 > x$, he uses the wand. In that case, the waiting time at the first light becomes $0$. Using this reasoning, the total expected time is
$$
\mathbb E[Y_1 1_{\lbrace Y_1 \leq x \rbrace} + Y_2 1_{\lbrace Y_1 > x \rbrace}]  = \\ 
\mathbb E[Y_1 1_{\lbrace Y_1 \leq x \rbrace}] + \mathbb E[Y_2]\mathbb P(Y_1 > x )
$$
This becomes
$$
\int^x_0 \frac{1}{80}u du + 40 \frac{80-x}{80} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x^2}{80} + 80 -x \right)

Then differentiating, setting to $0$, solving for $x$ and plugging it back into the expectation gives me $30$ as the answer. I have been told that this is incorrect. Where is the mistake?",['probability']
2366108,Baire Category Theorem without Completeness,"Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. We say that $Y \subseteq X$ is dense in $X$ if for any non-empty open set $U\subseteq X,$ we have $U \cap Y \neq \emptyset.$ Baire Category Theorem states that If $(X,d)$ is a complete metric space with $(U_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ being a sequence of open dense sets in $X,$ then their intersection $\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}}U_n$ is dense in $X.$ If we remove openness in the condition, then the theorem will not hold anymore, simply let $X = \mathbb{R},$ $U_1 = \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}.$
Clearly $X$ is complete and $U_1$ and $U_2$ are dense in $X,$ but $U_1 \cap U_2 = \emptyset$ is not dense in $X.$ Question : Give an example such that $X$ is not complete with $(U_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ a sequence of open dense sets but their intersection $\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}}U_n$ is not dense in $X.$ I have been trying to come out with an example that satisfies the question above.
Since finite dimensional space is always complete, I have to let $X$ be infinite dimensional. 
One example that comes to my mind is $C[0,1],$ the set of continuous functions on $[0,1].$ However, I do not know which set is dense in $C[0,1].$ Any hint would be appreciated.","['real-analysis', 'examples-counterexamples', 'functional-analysis', 'baire-category', 'metric-spaces']"
2366158,Locally Analytic Nullstellensatz,"On pg. 13 of Milnor's Singular Points of Complex Hypersurfaces , the author seems to be using the following statement without proof: Let $V\subseteq \mathbf C^m$ be a complex variety (that is, an irreducible algebraic set), and $f_1, \ldots, f_k\in \mathbf C[z_1,\ldots, z_m]$ be polynomials which generate the prime ideal $I(V)$. Let $h:\mathbf C^m\to \mathbf C$ be a complex analytic function which vanishes on a neighborhood of a point $p\in V$. ( Here our neighborhood is NOT taken in the Zariski topology, but in the topology induced on $V$ from the Euclidean topology on $\mathbf C^m$ ). Then some power $h^s$ of $h$ can be written as $a_1 f_1+ \cdots + a_k f_k$, where $a_1, \ldots, a_k$ are germs of analytic functions (at the point $p$). Milnor refers to this as the Locally Analytic Nullstellensatz and mentioned a book by Gunning and Rossi (pg. 90) for a proof.

For each of the following sets decide whether it is linearly independent.

Commenters verified that this was the case for the first few million values in the sequence, but no one has been able to prove that it is the case as of yet.  I looked for literature, but because I made the sequence up and it has no OEIS entry I did not get very far. What I have proven so far is that there can be no loops of size $3$, (that is $f\circ f\circ f(x)\neq x$).  To prove this let us assume we have $3$ values $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a < b < c$.  In order to have a 3 loop we need either: \begin{equation}f(a) = b, f(b) = c, f(c) = a \end{equation} or \begin{equation}f(a) = c, f(c) = b, f(b) = a \end{equation} The first cannot be the case because for $f(b)$, $a$ must satisfy all of the requirements, because $f(a)=c$ they are coprime and differ by more than 1 and because $f(b)=a$ we know that $a$ cannot have already appeared in the sequence.  Thus $f(b)=a$ contradicting our earlier statement.  The same reasoning can be applied to the other case. I think this reasoning may be extensible to larger loops but I am not very sure that this is the case, and even if we prove that loops of size larger than $2$ are impossible we still have to prove that every number does loop , in order to get the result we want.","['functions', 'inverse']"

2366405,Variable Dimensionality Manifolds,"I am curious about different notions of dimensionality, particularly as it relates to manifolds. For instance, there is the standard fixed dimensionality of a pure smooth manifold , the Hausdorff dimension , various different notions of Fractal dimension , and other notions of dimension (e.g. [1] , [2] ). Some allow for fractional dimensionality ; my question is whether this is possible somehow for manifolds (or rather for some manifold-like objects). One interesting note in the manifold wiki article mentions the notion of manifolds where the dimensionality changes, by e.g. disjoint unioning of a sphere and line. However, the connected components must have the same dimension, I believe. But is there a notion of generalized manifold with dimensionality that can be ""smoothly varying"", in some sense? My question is partly motivated by the idea that one can easily ""imagine"" such a construct (e.g. a surface that forms a long cone that thins out into a line).
Of course, this would not be a manifold
(indeed, in computer science, discrete ""manifolds"", e.g. meshes or point sets, that do this are called ""non-manifold""), but perhaps there is a generalized notion that admits this and analysis? The most obvious issue is local coordinates are obviously integral in nature. But is there no way to parameterize fractals locally (which are of fractional dimension)?

2366483,Computing the first variation of volume: all around confusion,"$\DeclareMathOperator{\vol}{vol}$I've been working through the computation of the first variation of volume presented in Jost's Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis (page 196 in the sixth edition, section titled: Minimal Submanifolds ), and I've been getting caught up in all the notation, and I've been having a lot of trouble exactly understanding how to interpret the partial derivatives in this context. I'll start with the setup: let $M$ be a smooth submanifold of $N$ and let $F:M\times(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\to N$ be a local variation with compact support. For small enough $t$ we have that $\Phi_t(\cdot):=F(\cdot,t)$ is a diffeomorphism from $M\to M_t\subseteq N$. Now let $\{e_1,\dots,e_m\}$ be an orthonormal frame on $M$. Using this diffeomorphism we can write
$$\vol(M_t)=\int_{M}\left\langle\Phi_{t*}e_1\wedge\cdots\wedge\Phi_{t*}e_m,\Phi_{t*}e_1\wedge\cdots\wedge\Phi_{t*}e_m\right\rangle^{\frac{1}{2}}\eta_{M},$$
where $\langle{\cdot,\cdot}\rangle$ is the induced inner product on $\bigwedge^m(TN)$, that is $\langle{v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_m,w_1\wedge\cdots\wedge w_m}\rangle=\det(\langle{v_i,w_j}\rangle)$, and $\eta_M$ denotes the Riemannian volume form on $M$. Then we differentiate this with respect to $t$ to find that

Should I interpret this as follows: Let $\gamma:(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\to TN$ be given by $\gamma(t)=\Phi_{t*}e_i\in T_{\Phi_{t}(p)}M$. Then  does $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{t*}e_i$ simply mean $d\gamma\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)$, where we naturally identify $T(T_qN)\cong T_qN$? He goes on consider the vector field $X:=\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{t}\right|_{t=0}$. I'm assuming the interpretation of this vector field is the same as before. My main confusion is with this next part: To compute $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{t*}e_i$ at $t=0$ we consider a curve $c_i(s)$ in $M$ with $c_i(0)=p$ and $c_i'(0)=e_i$ and let $c_i(s,t):=\Phi_t(c_i(s))$. Then 
$$\left.\Phi_{t*}e_i=\frac{\partial}{\partial s}c_i(s,t)\right|_{s=0}.$$ How do I justify this? It definitely lives in the right tangent space since $c_i(0,t)=\Phi_t(p)$, but why does this coincide with the pushforward $d\Phi_t(e_i)$. I'm probably missing something pretty fundamental. Carrying on with the computations we have
$$\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{t*}e_i\right|_{t=0}=\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{\partial}{\partial s}c_i(s,t)\right|_{s=t=0}=\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}c_i(s,t)\right|_{s=t=0}=\left.\nabla^N_{\frac{\partial}{\partial s}}X\right|_{s=0} =\nabla^N_{e_i}X, $$
where $\nabla^N$ is the Levi-Civita connection on $N$. My question is why do the partial derivatives commute in this case? Again, how should these mixed partials be understood, and what justifies this computation? Even intuitively, it doesn't make sense to me that they should.","['minimal-surfaces', 'calculus-of-variations', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

Let $(X, \|\cdot \|_1)$ be a separable normed space endowed with the $\sigma$-algebra $B$ generated by the norm $\|\cdot \|_{1}$. Therefore, since the measurable space $(X, B)$ is separable, then $\sigma$-algebra $B$ is equal to the one generated by the open balls in $(X, \|\cdot \|_1)$. Therefore, two measures are equal if and only if they agree on the finite intersections of open balls, since the finite intersections of the balls in $(X, \|\cdot \|_1)$ constitute a $\pi$-system. Next, consider the norm $\|\cdot \|_2$ on $X$, which is equivalent to $\|\cdot \|_1$. Since $||\cdot ||_2$ is equivalent to $\|\cdot \|_1$, then they define the same topologies and, therefore, the same $\sigma$-algebras. Then I conclude the following: in order to prove that two measures on $(X, B)$ are equivalent, one has to show that they agree on the the finite intersections of open balls, balls in ANY norm equivalent to $\|\cdot \|_1$.","['real-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'probability', 'measure-theory', 'general-topology']"

2367625,"Finding a quadruplet of ""cow-equivalent"" integers","This a follow up question/puzzle from an earlier question here How does rounding affect Fibonacci-ish sequences? Explanation For this new question, one needs only to understand a particular transformation $$
f\big(
\begin{bmatrix}
a\\b\\c\\d
\end{bmatrix}\big)
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a+\text{floor}(\frac{d}{2})\\a\\b\\c
\end{bmatrix}
$$
So for example, this sequence is generated by repeatedly applying the transformation
$$
\begin{bmatrix}5\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}5\\5\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}5\\5\\5\\0\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow

\begin{bmatrix}13\\11\\9\\7\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}16\\13\\11\\9\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow
\ ...
$$
Because the function rounds down $d$, it's very hard to predict the exact values after many iterations. Interestingly though -- certain initial values eventually converge to the same sequence For example if we continue the sequence above
$$
\cdots\ 
\rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}16\\13\\11\\9\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}20\\16\\13\\11\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow

\begin{bmatrix}39\\31\\25\\20\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}49\\39\\31\\25\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow
\ \cdots
$$
And compare it to the sequence of another initial value
$$
\begin{bmatrix}9\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}9\\9\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow
\ \cdots \ \rightarrow

$$
The sequences hit the same point. More specifically, we will say that
$$
f^{13}\big(\begin{bmatrix}5\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}\big)
=
f^{10}\big(\begin{bmatrix}9\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}\big)

This means the sequence for $5$ and the sequence for $9$ will be the same as each other if continued further. I've been calling numbers like this ""cow-equivalent"" because this iteration models the population growth of animals in Minecraft â€“Â when bred every 5 minutes by the player.

$$f^m(a\cdot\vec{e_1})=f^n(b\cdot\vec{e_1})$$ Questions A quick computer search shows that there are triplets of cow-equivalent numbers like
$$34\equiv 259\equiv 406$$
because
$$f^{35}(\begin{bmatrix}34\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix})=
f^{26}(\begin{bmatrix}259\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix})=

I am doing Exercise 1.22 from Hartshorne. It is the classic gluing of of sheaves on a cover given the cocycle condition question. In particular, we have a space $X$ and a cover for this space $\{ U_{i} \}_{i \in I}$. Further, we are given a family of sheaves indexed by the same set $I$, $\{ \mathcal{F}_{i} \}_{i \in I}$ on each of the $U_{i}$. We are given isomorphisms

$$
\phi_{ik} = \phi_{ik} \circ \phi_{ij} \quad \text{on} \quad U_{i} \cap U_{j} \cap U_{k}.
$$
The task is to construct a sheaf on $X$ compatible with these local sheaves. I have gone ahead and done the obvious steps of defining a base by taking all open sets contained in one of the $U_{i}$ etc. I then defined a sheaf $\mathcal{G}$ on this base and this is well defined since if there is some $V$ in $U_{i}$ and $U_{j}$ with $i \neq j$, then via the isomorphism $\phi_{ij}$, we have
$$ \mathcal{F}_{i}(V) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{F}_{j}(V) $$
My understanding is that to make the restriction maps work, you need to invoke the cocycle condition. My issue is that I can't see exactly where. It seems that the isomorphism alone is enough. The frustrating part is that every resource I look at (and there are a lot since this is a common exercise) simply says ""the restrictions are compatible because of the cocycle condition"" or ""this is well defined because of the cocycle condition"" or something similar. Nowhere seems to explicitly lay out where the cocyle condition is invoked, and what breaks when it is not. Is someone able to shed some light on this?

In general we have $D(A) \subseteq \hat{D}(A) \subseteq \overline{D(A)} $. If $X$ is reflexive and $A: D(A) \rightarrow X$ is linear, we have $D(A) = \hat{D}(A)$. Sketch of proof: Since $A$ is $m$-accretive, $A$ is closed. Therefore its graph is closed, moreover $A$ is linear, so we get that its graph is convex. Because closed and convex subsets of a Banach space are weakly closed, the graph of $A$ is also weakly closed. So we now have that $A$ is weakly closed. Now let $x \in \hat{D}(A)$ and $(x_n)_{n} \subseteq D(A)$, such that $x_n \rightarrow x$ and 
$\sup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \|y_n\| < \infty$. Because $X$ is reflexive we can assume that $Ax_n \rightharpoonup y$ for some $y \in X$ after extraction of a subsequence because of the Eberlein-Shmulyan theorem. Since $A$ is weakly closed we get $x \in D(A)$ and $Ax = y$ and therefore $D(A) = \hat{D}(A)$. Now assume $A$ is a nonlinear and $m$-accretive operator in the reflexive space $X$.

If $S < G$ then for any proper subgroup $H$ of $G$ , s.t. $S \le H$ we have $S = S \cap H \lhd \lhd G \cap H = H$ , so by the inductive hypothesis $S \subseteq \text{Soc}(H)$ But I can't do the inductive step, i.e. $S \subseteq \text{Soc}(G)$ . We know that $S \cap \text{Soc}(G) \unlhd S$ , so from the simplicity of $S$ we have that $S \cap \text{Soc}(G) = \{e\}$ or $S \cap \text{Soc}(G) = S$ . It's easy to deal with the second case, as it immediately follows that $S \subseteq \text{Soc}(G)$ . But I can't do anything about the first case. It seems that we need to use the fact that $S$ is nonabelian, as if $S$ is a noncentral involution in $G=D_8$ we get that $S$ is subnormal in $G$ and simple, but $S \not \subseteq \text{Soc}(G) = Z(G)$ . The only way I can see how to use the fact that $S$ is nonabelian is by proving that $S$ is contained in a center of a subgroup and hence derive a contradiction, but I couldn't achieve any progress in this direction. Also I don't see how we can use the inductive hypothesis for this part, as $\text{Soc}(H) \subseteq \text{Soc}(G)$ is not necessarily true in general. Much of the problem seems to revolve around the mentioned previous problem, which I have proven. The claim is that if $X$ is a collection of minimal normal subgroups of $G$ , then $N = \Pi \ X$ is a direct product of some members of $X$ and moreover a direct product of simple groups. Further more it says that any normal and nonabelian subgroup of $G$ contained in $N$ contains a member of $X$ . Unfortunately I don't see how we can use this problem until the last stage of the proof.","['socle', 'finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'normal-subgroups', 'group-theory']"

As the answer in the link suggests, this evidently implies that $(x_n)$ cannot have a convergent subsequence, which contradicts sequential compactness.

Find a function $f$ which is continuous on $[0,1]$ and which satisfies $ f(0) = f(1) $, but which does not satisfy $f(x) = f(x+a)$ for any $x$. The solution from Spivak's solutions book is as follows: In general if $ {1 \over n+1} <a< {1 \over n} $ then define $f$ arbitrarily on $[0,a]$, subject only to $f(0)=0 , f(a)>0$ and  $f(1-na)=-nf(a).$  Then define $f$ on $[ka,(k+1)a]$ by $ f(ka+x)=f(x)+ ka.$  In particular we have, we have $f(1) = f(na + (1-na))= na+f(1-na)=0$ but $f(x+a)-f(a)=f(a)>0$ for all $x$.

2368238,Distance of satellite from tracking station given angles of elevation,"In my 10th grade precalculus class, we are learning trigonometry. One of the problems we had to solve was the following: A satellite passes over two tracking stations, A and B, 100 km apart. When the satellite is between the two stations the angles of elevation at the stations are measured as 89Â°  and 87Â° respectively. What is the distance a, between the satellite and station B. 'a' is the side opposite of the angle A. I've made the following image to help visualize the problem: Note: this image was not included with the original problem. Using the law of sines, I arrived at an answer of 1433 km. This was marked as the correct answer. (My class is virtual so I do not have any interaction with the teacher other than the online assignments unless I email her). I'm quite certain this is the way the problem was intended to be solved. Then I remembered that the Earth is not flat and at that scale, the Earth's curvature should have some kind of noticeable effect on the answer. Here's a summary of what I tried: using a value of 6371 km as the radius of the Earth. I assumed the angles of elevation of the stations were relative to the tangent of their location on the surface of the earth as I have hopefully demonstrated in this image: (The angles are exaggerated to show what I mean). I placed the origin at the center of the earth and gave station A a location of (6371, 0). I found the location of station B using a bit more trigonometry. Then, I calculated what the slope of the line of sight passing from each station to the satellite should be. I then found the equation of each line of sight using the point-slope formula for each station. After that, I found the location of the satellite by finding the intersection of the two lines. Then I used the distance formula to find the distance between the location of the satellite and station B.
I arrived at an answer of around 1842 km. However, I'm not sure if this is actually the right answer and don't know of any way to confirm it other than posting here. Is my answer actually correct? Although the curvature of the Earth should not be ignored, an extra 400 km does not quite seem right. Then again, the lines were almost parallel to begin with so any change could affect the answer more than I might expect. How would you go about calculating the actual answer to this problem?

Then one can show that $S_f^n(x) =\displaystyle \frac1n\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}f(T^k(x))$ is a bounded linear functional on $C(X)$, which has a convergent subsequence for all $g\in C(X)$. Denote the limit to be $S_g^\infty(x)$. This gives rise to the linear functional $L_x(g) = S_g^\infty(x)$, which is positive, so by Riesz Representation Theorem, we have $L_x(g) = \int_X gd\mu$ for some Borel probability measure. Now we are basically at my question. The author of the book I'm using (Dynamical Systems by Brin & Stuck) next shows that $S_g^\infty (x) = S_g^\infty (Tx)$ to conclude that $\mu$ is $T$-invariant. However, I don't know why this is.

I am thinking that the inter integral creates a line from $r=4$ to $r=7$, and then the outer integral sweeps this line from $\pi$ to $2\pi$ to create an area. I do not understand what the purpose of this would be, when we could essentially use single variable calculus to find the areas of two half circles and subtract the smaller one. What is the purpose and conceptual background of double integrals like the one above?","['multivariable-calculus', 'polar-coordinates']"
2368417,$\Bbb{R}^\omega$ is not Locally Compact,"Here is example 2 in chapter 3.29 in Munkres: The space $\Bbb{R}^\omega$ [defined as $\Bbb{R} \times \Bbb{R} \times \Bbb{R} \times ...$ endowed with the product topology] is not locally compact...For if $B = (a_1,b_1) \times ... \times (a_n,b_n) \times \Bbb{R} \times ...$ were contained in a compact subspace, then its closure $\overline{B}$ would be compact, which it is not. Would the following be a sufficient way of filling in the details? Recall that every compact subspace of a Hausdorff space ($\Bbb{R}^\omega$ is in fact metrizable) is necessarily closed. Thus this compact space containing $B$ must be closed. Now since the closure of $B$ is the smallest closed set containing $B$, the closure of $B$ must be contained in this compact set also. Again, recall that every closed subspace of a compact subspace is itself compact, making $\overline{B}$ compact too. However, if it were compact, then its image under the continuous map $\pi_{n+1}$, the projection of the $(n+1)$-th factor, would also be compact, but this is a contradiction since the image is $\Bbb{R}$, which is known not to be compact.","['general-topology', 'proof-verification']"

Give an example of an operator on $\mathbb{C}^4$ whose characteristic and minimal polynomials both equal $z(z-1)^2(z-3)$ .

However, I don't quite see how to come up with examples of operators in questions 4 and 5 - I don't have any intuition between how the structure of an operator/matrix relates to its characteristic and minimal polynomials. Can someone please explain the reasoning one can use to find answers to the questions?

Prove that $v_1, . . . , v_{n+1}$ are linearly dependent
over the rationals. I was reading an ingenious proof of this result, an outline of which I present here: ""by passing to a subspace"", we may assume that $v_1,...,v_n$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb{R}$ since $v_1,...,v_{n+1}$ is a family of $n+1$ vectors in the $n$- dimmensional space $\mathbb{R}^n$ (considered over the field $\mathbb{R}$), they are linearly dependent over $\mathbb{R}$. Hence write $v_{n+1}=\sum_{k=1}^n\lambda_kv_k$. The goal is to show that $\lambda_k$ is rational. by the parrallelogram inequality, all the scalar products $<v_i,v_j>$ are rational. Hence the Grammian matrix $G$ of $v_1,..,v_n$ has all entries rational. Furthermore, since $v_1,...,v_n$ are linearly independent $G$ is invertible (well-known property of the Grammian) Let $w$ denote the column vector of size $n$ with coordinate $k$ given by $<v_{n+1},v_k>$. Let $\lambda$ denote the column vector of size $n$ with coordinate $k$ given by $\lambda_k$. Then we have $w=G\lambda$. From the above, $\lambda=G^{-1}w$ which is a product of matrices with rational entries, thus a rational matrix. done. The only step I don't understand is step 1.

Proof : Consider forming a new permutation with $n$ objects from a permutation of $n - 1$ objects by adding a distinguished object. There are exactly two ways in which this can be accomplished. First, we could form a singleton cycle, leaving the extra object fixed. This increases the number of cycles by $1$ and so accounts for the $s(n - 1, k - 1)$ term in the recurrence. Second, we could insert the object into one of the existing cycles. Consider an arbitrary permutation of $n - 1$ objects with $k$ cycles. To form the new permutation, we insert the new object before any of the $n - 1$ objects already present. This explains the $(n - 1)s(n - 1, k)$ term of the recurrence. These two cases include all of the possibilities, so the recurrence relation follows with the given initial conditions. QED Here, I cannot understand the second part of the proof.

For this, Hartshorne defines a graded $A[X_0,\dots,X_n]$-module \begin{align*}
 M = \bigoplus_{m\geq m_0}	H^0(X, \mathscr{F}(m)),
 \end{align*} where $m_0$ is choosen large enough, so that the $H^0(X, \mathscr{F}(m))$ are all free for $m \geq m_0$. (By the way: Don't we need the finiteness condition on the rank?) Then he claims that $\mathscr{F}=M^{\sim}$ by a Proposition (Prop. 5.15 in II.5), which states that there is a natural isomorphism $(\Gamma_*(\mathscr{F}))^{\sim} \cong \mathscr{F}$. But I don't see why this gives what he claims. He says ""Note that $M$ is the same as $\Gamma_*(\mathscr{F})$ in degrees $m \geq m_0$.""  On this I agree with him, since by definition \begin{align*}
 \Gamma_*(\mathscr{F}) = \bigoplus_{m \in \mathbb{Z}} \Gamma(X, \mathscr{F}(m)),
 \end{align*} and $\Gamma(X, \mathscr{F}(m)) \cong H^0(X, \mathscr{F}(m))$. But what has happened to the parts of degree less than $m_0$ in the tilde-construction, so that he gets $M^{\sim}=(\Gamma_*(\mathscr{F}))^{\sim}$, which now would imply $M^{\sim} \cong \mathscr{F}$ by the Proposition mentioned above?","['hilbert-polynomial', 'sheaf-cohomology', 'algebraic-geometry', 'flatness']"
2368988,Reflection inside spherical mirror,"Suppose you are inside a perfectly spherical mirror. You shoot one beam of light and it reflects on the walls of the mirror. Considering the intensity is constant will the beam of light hit you again? I can shoot it from anywhere inside the sphere and I am a point. One answer mentions that the beam will always come arbitrarily close. How to prove this? I thought of this question while sleeping. But even after a day of thinking about this problem I couldn't solve it. Note The only answer is brief and does not explain or prove what is says. Looking for detailed answers preferably using illustration and valid mathematical proofs for the statements they make. Would like to read about possible generalizations and variations of this question. Please don;t restrict yourself to this specific situation and do not hesitate to write long answers which give a wide overview of these type problems. Bounty-awarded answer is likely to be long, detailed and self-sufficient mathematically in terms of proving the facts it states.","['physics', 'proof-explanation', 'geometry']"
