543216,Proving that a ring is not a Principal Ideal Domain,"This is my first question on StackExchange. I'm taking a second semester course of Abstract Algebra.

543250,Differential equation with infinitely many solutions,"The problem is to solve for $-1<x<1$ $$y'(x)=\frac{4x^3y(x)}{x^2+y(x)^2}$$ with $y(0)=0$.

543297,Geometric intuition behind the Hasse principle,"Let $f(X,Y) \in \mathbb{Q}[X,Y]$ be a quadratic polynomial.

Is there a nice, simple geometric way to think about this? Edit: More specifically, what does it ""look like"" when you piece together local solutions into a global solution?

Using this information I simplified the inequality to: $\cos (\alpha ) = \frac{1}{3}$, $\alpha < \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{1}{3}$ Now I believe the answer will have something to do with the monotonicity of cos between 0 and $\frac{\pi}{2}$, but I don't know how to show this.

For every $x_i \in X$, there exists $b_i \in B$ such that $f(x_i)=b_i$. But since $g$ is surjective, there exists $a_i \in A$ such that $g(a_i)=b_i$. So I was planning to define the funtion $\bar{f} : M \rightarrow A$ by $\bar{f}(x_i) = a_i$ such that $f(x_i)=b_i$ and $g(a_i)=b_i$. But then I remembered that $g$ was not necessarily injective...so one element in $M$ can be sent to more than one element in $A$, right? And that would mean that $\bar{f}$ is not well-defined.

543446,Proving a Property of a Set of Positive Integers,"I have a question as such: A set $\{a_1, \ldots , a_n \}$ of positive integers is nice iff
  there are no non-trivial (i.e. those in which at least one component
  is different from $0$) solutions to the equation $$a_1x_1 + \ldots +
> a_nx_n = 0$$ with $x_1 \ldots x_n \in \{ -1, 0, 1 \}$. Prove that any
  nice set with $n$ elements necessarily contains at least one element
  that is $\geq \frac{2^n}{n}$. Here's my work so far: Let $A = \{a_1, \ldots, a_n \}$. Let $P = a_1x_1 + \ldots + a_nx_n$.  $A$ is nice iff there are only trivial solutions to $P$. There is a nontrivial solution to $P$ iff $\exists B,C \subset A$ s.t. $sum(B)=sum(C)$. Note that $B\cap C = \emptyset$, but $B\cup C$ does not necessarily equal $A$, as once there are such subsets,
the other elements of $A$ can be set to multiply with $x_i = 0$ s.t. Moreover, either $B$ or $C$ has to be multiplied by $x_i = -1$ s.t. $B+C = 0$. The contrapositive of the initial statement is that if $\forall a \in A, a < \frac{2^n}{n}$, then $A$ is not nice. We note that a non-nice set can contain $x \geq \frac{2^n}{n}$. It is only that if a set is nice that it necessarily contains $x \geq \frac{2^n}{n}$. Just the fact that a set contains such an element doesn't actually tell us whether the set is nice or not. The question that I arrived at is this: why is that if $\forall a\in A, a < \frac{2^n}{n}$, then $A$ has a non-trivial solution? If I can show why this is true, it would constitute proof of the contrapositive, and I would be done.

543563,Geometrical objects whose volumes are fractional powers of their sizes,"While studying properties of foams (imagine bubbly soap or microscopical grids/networks), I started wondering on the relationship between the volume occupied by the matter $V_s$ itself and the overall volume $V_a$ of a given foam sample (matter+voids). Two lengths characterize these objects: the size of each pore $l_a$ and the thickness $l_s$ of the matter that encloses such a pore. You can picture a foam like a stack of cubes (the pores). When you suppose that each pore is fully closed by walls of matter, you obtain $V_s/V_a\propto l_s/l_a$. When you suppose that each pore is fully open, such that filaments are joined to each other and forming a sort of network, you obtain $V_s/V_a\propto (l_s/l_a)^2$. This is easy to picture, and comes naturally from the fact that basic geometrical shapes have a volume proportional to the powers of typical distances. Now, many foams exhibit $V_s/V_a\propto (l_s/l_a)^k$, where $k$ is fractional, between 1 and 2. This means that the volumes are not proportional to integer powers of the characteristic sizes in the problem. How is that possible? Is there a visual example of this situation? It seems related to fractals however I cannot pinpoint how. I am looking for a non-technical answer as I am not a mathematician. I have basic knowledge on fractals. UPDATE
Following some answers that have already been proposed, I find it difficult to imagine a fractal object that does not introduce another length (than $l_a$ and $l_s$). Iterating the fractal keeps producing more lenghts somewhat related to each other. Then, how is it possible to define only one $l_s$ in these conditions?","['geometry', 'fractals']"

\int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{d\phi}{\sqrt{1+b^2 -2b \cos \phi}}

into another integral near the branch cuts for the principal branch. Here $0<b<1$. I got so far as to show that if I introduce $z= e^{i\phi}$, then I have the integral
$$
-i\int_C \frac{dz}{z\sqrt{1+ b^2 - b(z +1/z)}}

$C$ is the unit circle ran counterclockwise.
I showed also that the function (taking the principal branch of the square root) $\sqrt{z(z-b)(1-bz)}$ is continuous on $C$. The thing to do seems to substitute this as the denominator above and work it out (I know what the final answer should look like), I have no problems doing that. My problem is that I do not see why is it possible to substitute this for the denominator, it seems to me that one would have to prove that these functions agree on $C$: $$
z\sqrt{1+ b^2 - b(z +1/z)}|_C = \sqrt{z(z-b)(1-bz)}|_C  \quad .....(1)

This might be a very stupid question, but I haven't found a way to do it. Is there a simple way to see that this is the case indeed? I strongly suspect there is, but I am sure I am missing something.

Proposition 3.1. Let $G$ be a finite group. An abelian tower of $G$ admits a cyclic refinement. Let $G$ be a finite solvable group. Then $G$ admits a cyclic tower, whose last element is $\{e\}$ . Proof. The second assertion is an immediate consequence of the first, and it clearly suffices to prove that if $G$ is finite, abelian, then $G$ admits a cyclic tower. We use induction on the order of $G$ . Let $x$ be an element of $G$ . We may assume that $x \neq e$ . Let $X$ be the cyclic group generated by $x$ . Let $G' = G/X$ . By induction, we can find a cyclic tower in $G'$ , and its inverse image is a cyclic tower in $G$ whose last element is $X$ . If we refine this tower by inserting $\{e\}$ at the end, we obtain the desired cyclic tower. I don't understand why it suffices to prove that if $G$ is finite, abelian, then $G$ admits a cyclic tower. In the statement of the proposition $G$ is not assumed to be an abelian group.

544157,Family of geometric shapes closed under division,"The family of rectangles has the following nice properties: Every rectangle $R$ can be divided to two disjoint parts, $R_1 \cup  R_2 = R$, such that both $R_1$ and $R_2$ are rectangles (i.e. belong to the same family). Moreover, for every number $p > 0$, it is possible to cut $R$ to two disjoint rectangles $R_1 \cup  R_2 = R$, such that the ratio of their areas is $p$. What other non-trivial families of geometric shapes have one or two of these properties? Triangles have properties 1 and 2 - a triangle can always be divided to two triangles using a ray from one of its vertices. Right-angled triangles have property 1, because they can be divided using a ray from the 90-degree vertex that is perpendicular to the opposite side, and the result will be two right-angled triangles. However, they don't have property 2 because the ratio between the two parts cannot be changed. Squares have none of these properties, as a square cannot be divided to two squares. Ditto for circles. L-shapes seem to have properties 1 and 2, as well as rings. This raises several questions: Is it possible to give a complete characterization of such families (i.e. find all families with the above properties)? Given a family of shapes, how can we find a minimal containing family that has the above properties? (e.g. for squares, a possible extension is the rectangles; another extension is the L-shapes). (terminology) Is there a formal term for these two properties? If not, what could be a good term? Maybe ""closed under division"" / ""closed under arbitrary proportion division""? MOTIVATION: When designing algorithms for geometric shapes, if the shapes have property 1 (and possibly property 2), then it is possible to design a recursive algorithm. Otherwise, a recursive algorithm is not possible and we must think of other algorithms. EDIT: A concept closely related to my property #1 is rep-tile . A rep-tile is a shape that can be divided to two or more smaller copies of itself. This concept was recently generalized to a rep-tile set by Sallows .  Specifically, all rep-2 shapes and all rep-tile sets with 2 elements have property #1. But property #1 is more general, as it does not require that the parts will be copies of the original (for example, a rectangle can be divided into two rectangles that are rectangles, although they are not smaller copies of the original). Property #2 is still open - I haven't found anything similar.","['geometry', 'rectangles']"

Can anyone help? By the way, I've been able to prove $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}=\frac{{\pi}^2}{6}$ by using $(\star)$. Proof : Let 
$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sin^2x}-\frac{1}{x^2}=\frac{(x-\sin x)(x+\sin x)}{x^2\sin^2 x}.$$
We know that $f(x)\gt0$ if $0\lt x\le {\pi}/{2}$, and that $\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)=1/3$. Hence, letting $f(0)=1/3$, we know that $f(x)$ is continuous and positive at $x=0$. Hence, since $f(x)\ (0\le x\le {\pi}/2)$ is bounded, there exists a constant $C$ such that $0\lt f(x)\lt C$. Hence, substituting $x={(k\pi)}/{(2n+1)}$ for this, we get
$$0\lt \frac{1}{\frac{2n+1}{{\pi}^2}\sin^2\frac{k\pi}{2n+1}}-\frac{1}{k^2}\lt\frac{{\pi}^2C}{(2n+1)^2}.$$
Then, the sum of these from $1$ to $n$ satisfies 
$$0\lt\frac{{\pi}^2\cdot 2n(n+1)}{(2n+1)^2\cdot 3}-\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k^2}\lt\frac{{\pi}^2Cn}{(2n+1)^2}.$$

the expected value then is:

The integration is over all real space. Additional info The $B$ matrix actually depends on lots of real scalar parameters $\lambda_1 \ldots \lambda_N$ that will later be integrated over as well (over all space). These are Lagrange multipliers to force some constraint on $X$, hence the $i$. I guess that for the vast majority of these parameters, the complete matrix $C \equiv A + iB$ will be diagonalizable (expect for a few pathological cases, of measure zero(?)). In that case, it can be written as $C = Z^t D Z$ with some diagonal matrix $D$ and $Z$ a complex matrix with $Z^tZ=1$ ($C$ is symmetric). If $Z$ were real, then a change of variables to $X' = ZX$ would turn the integration into a product of simple 1D gaussians over the diagonal entries of D. However, $Z$ is complex-valued (and D isn't necessarily real either(?)), so I guess that this won't quite work.

544335,"If a Radon measure is a tempered distribution, does it integrate all Schwartz functions?","The question might at first sight sound like the answer is trivially ""yes"", so let me clarify the question a bit. Consider given a nonnegative Radon measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ denote the space of real test functions, that is, the space of infinitely differentiable functions with compact support from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}$. We may then define the operator $T:\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)\to\mathbb{R}$ by
$$
T(\varphi) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \varphi(x) d\mu(x).
$$
This is then a distribution, in the sense of being a continuous linear functional $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)\to\mathbb{R}$, when $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is given its usual topology based on a family of norms as in Rudin's ""Functional analysis"". Now let $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ denote the space of real Schwartz functions, meaning the space of rapidly decreasing functions, endowed with its usual topology, again see Rudin's book for details. $\textbf{Assume the following:}$ That $T$ can be extended to a linear functional on $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ which is continuous in the topology of $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. $\textbf{My question is this:}$ Does it holds that
$$
T(\varphi) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \varphi(x) d\mu(x).
$$
for all $\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$? $\textbf{Some remarks:}$ The problem is that while we know that $T$ extends from $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, we do not know that the integral form of the operator carries over from $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. In fact, we do not even know that all functions in $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ are integrable with respect to $\mu$. A natural first approach to the problem would be to consider some kind of approximation argument. For example, take $\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Assume that $\varphi\ge0$. Using convolutions, we may then construct a sequence $(\varphi_n)$ in $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ which converges monotonely and in $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to $\varphi$. This then yields $$
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \varphi(x) d\mu(x)
           = \lim_n \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \varphi_n(x) d\mu(x)
           = \lim_n T(\varphi_n),
$$
where the limit a priori may be infinite. However, as we have assumed that $T$ extends to $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the limit of $T(\varphi_n)$ is finite, and so $\varphi$ is integrable with respect to $\mu$. This should show that the integral form of the operator is preserved for all nonnegative Schwartz functions. For a general Schwartz function $\varphi$, the natural thing would be to write $\varphi = \varphi^+-\varphi^-$, where $\varphi^+$ and $\varphi^-$ are the positive and negative parts of $\varphi$, respectively. However, while these two functions are nonnegative, they are not Schwartz functions, nor test functions for that matter, and so we cannot apply $T$ to them.","['distribution-theory', 'measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

544355,flaw in the proof of Cantor's theorem? does the set of all sets exist?,"I decided to improve my question since there were mistakes pointed out (THANK YOU!) and I realized that I did not mention if I put any kind of axiomatic conditions on the sets which I consider. I have a good math background (numerical analysis/mathematical statistics/linear algebra), but I am a biologist, so mathematicians please consider that, try defining what you are talking about. First of all, I operate under the assumption that my sets (any definable collections) do not obey any kind of axioms, except that they (collections) should be logically defined. For example set X=[{x∈R:0>x>1} and X ≠∅] is not defined logically for me, because it leads to a paradox: 0>1. Any set whose definition leads to a paradox is not logically defined, because we are doing mathematics, there should be no paradoxes. Thus, for me, ""the set of all sets which do not contain themselves"" is not a set, because its definition leads to a paradox. This set does not exist. Note: I do not operate under naive set theory. Naive set theory assumes as an axiom, to be more precise a principle, called comprehension principle: ""Given any property, there is a set which consists of all objects having that property."" This principle leads to paradoxes, thus it is not logical for me. For me a set is logically defined when it is clear what it is from definition and definition does not lead to paradoxes or any kind of illogical things. Lets call it ""logical set theory"". Second, here is my question. Many books prove that the set of all sets does not exist using Cantor's theorem: for any set X its Cardinality is strictly less than the Cardinality of a set consisting of all subsets of X. I am here to say that I think that one can not use this theorem as a proof of this point: the set of all sets does not exist. Actually one member of the forum already asked this question : can we use this theorem to prove this fact? ""Is this prove correct?"" Note: nobody answered yes or no. My answer is solid NO. But I am not 100% sure. Thus, I am providing my explanation for my ""NO"" and I am asking members of this forum whether they think that I am wrong. And if I am wrong, I would like to know why. If one assumes that all valid sets have to obey ZFC axioms, then one need not prove the point using Cantor's theorem, because ""the set of all sets"" is not a valid set in ZFC theory, because it does not obey the Axiom of Regularity, for example.
If one assumes that all valid sets have to obey ""naive"" theory comprehension principle: then we are not talking about something logical, we are are not doing math. So forget about it.
If one assumes that all valid sets have to obey New Foundation axioms, then, as member of this forum pointed out - the set of all sets does exist, it is ok-set, thus we do not need to prove that it does not exist.
If one assumes that all valid sets have to obey Cantor's rules, then actually as a person on this forum pointed out, Cantor's conception of sets rules out the set of all sets. Thus, we do not need to prove the point, because the set of all sets does not exist under Cantor's conception.
If one assumes that all valid sets have to obey ""logical theory of sets"", then it is easy to find one to one correspondence between the elements of set of all sets and elements of its power set: s=f(x)=x. So these sets are equinumerous, and one can not prove the opposite. Finally, it is clear to see that the point (the sets of all sets does not exist) is easily proven from Cantor's theorem. Thus, if we proved that the point is not true (under the ""logical set theory""), and I do think that it is not true (under the ""logical set theory""), when we have to find a mistake in the prove given by Cantor, using logical set theory. Here I am providing a proof by Cantor and point out the mistake later on: The mistake leads to the conclusion that this theorem is true for any set X except for ""a set of all sets"" in the universe. Thus one can not derive that the ""set of all sets does not exist"" based on Cantor's theorem. Here is the proof of Cantor's theorem: Definitions:
a)sets are called equinumerous if there exists one-to-one correspondence between its elements. b)cardinality of set X is considered less than cardinality of set Y if a subset of Y is equinumerous to X, but no subset of X is equinumerous to Y. Lemma: let S be a set of subsets of X such that S is equinumerous to X. Then there exists a subset of X (call it A), such that it is not contained in S (A ∉ S). (PS, it is easy to see that the theorem automatically follows from the Lemma: lets assume that the theorem is not true, than there exists a set X such that it is equinumerous to the set consisting of all its subsets (call it S). But such a set S satisfies the conditions of the Lemma. Thus there exists a subset of X that is not contained in S. But this is absurd, thus we have a contradiction and S can not be equinumerous to X.) Proof of Lemma:
All we have to do is to define A and prove that is satisfies the conditions of lemma:
it should be a subset of X, such that it is not contained in S (A ∉ S). Lets take any S, that satisfies the conditions of lemma (a set of subsets of X such that S is equinumerous to X). Let f(x)=s is the one-to-one function that images the elements of X (x) into elements of S(s). Then, A is defined as: A={x ∈ X: x ∉ f(x)}. That is A is a subset of X, such that for every element x of A: x is not contained in s=f(x). Then we assume that A∈S and find a contradiction (explained below). Thus A∉S and the Lemma is proven. The contradiction is the following: If A∈S, then exists element of X (call it e), such that A=f(e). If e∉A than e∉f(e)=A - contradiction (because from the definition of A follows that if e ∉ f(e): e should be contained in A). If e∈A than e∈f(e)=A, that is not possible by the definition of A, thus there is also a contradiction.
Lemma (and the theorem) is proven. I saw other proofs on the internet and in books, but all of them define a set A={x ∈ X: x ∉ f(x)}. I highlighted the mistake in bold.
Indeed, lets ask, is A logically defined for a set X=set of all sets?
Let X=""set of all sets in the universe"". Let S be a set that contains all subsets of X. Let s=f(x)=x (that is possible only for a ""set of all sets in the universe"").
Now look at the definition of A: the set A is not logically defined: there is no such a set with elements of X, such that x ∉ f(x), because x ∉ f(x) for all x. In fact A can not be even an empty set: because even for empty set: f(empty set)=empty set, thus
empty set ≠ A. Thus A is still undefined. I saw another proof of the fact that the ""set of all sets"" does not exist: they use Russell's paradox. But I already told that I am not operating under the comprehension principle, because it is nonsense. Any mathematicians here? please let me know if there is a flaw in my arguments. Does the set of all sets exist? Is it still debated? Thank you!",['elementary-set-theory']

where $|\dots|$ denotes the absolute value . We are concerned only with positive values of $x$ (i.e. let the domain of the function be $\mathbb{R}^+$). The graph of this function looks roughly as follows (modulo possible errors in numeric algorithms used to plot it): The function values at rational points can be evaluated in a closed form, e.g.
$$f\left(\frac32\right)=\frac2{145}\left(24+\frac{27\,\sqrt3\,\left(e^{\frac\pi3}+e^{-\frac\pi3}\right)-24\,\left(e^{\frac\pi3}-e^{-\frac\pi3}\right)-4}{e^\pi-e^{-\pi}}\right).$$ Questions: Is the function $f(x)$ continuous? Is it smooth? Is it analytic ? How many local extrema does it have? What is the $\lim\limits_{x\,\to\,\infty}f(x)$, if it exists? Can we find a closed-form value of $f(x)$ at an explicit irrational point (given by a closed-form expression)? Is there a general formula for values of $f(x)$ at rational points?","['calculus', 'definite-integrals', 'continuity', 'real-analysis', 'analyticity']"
544486,Finding meaningful differences in a set of time measures,"An individual is presented with a list of words, one at a time, and asked to answer the first thing to comes to her mind. The delay of all answers is recorded. So I have a list of words, each paired with the time it took for the individual to find an answer (response delay). Some psychological studies indicate that words with a longer or shorter than average response delay have some special meaning in the subject's psychological profile. Despite the fact that this statement could be right or wrong, I'm interested in the best mathematical approach to find such words that exhibit a ""longer than average"" or ""shorter than average"" response time. So far we've been just taking the average response time, and setting some fixed percentage of delay we consider long or short enough. This is of course a very simplistic approach. I think I could apply some standard hypothesis tests to answer the question: what are the odds that this response delay is equal to the average? and keep those results with a low p-value, but I'm not very versed on statistics, so I don't know the exact test I would need here. Also, I'm interested in a slightly more complicated version, where the subject is presented with two list of words intermingled. The words from the first list are considered neutral, and are expected to have more or less the same response delay. However, the words from the second list are loaded, which means we expect they to hit something in the subject's subconscious part, and so he might have longer or shorter response delays. I would like to take the times from the first list to make a baseline for what are considered average response delays, and then check the times in the second list, looking for longer or shorter than expected response delays. What kind of test would I need here?","['statistics', 'probability']"

544520,"what is the meaning of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},i)$","I have learnt so far that: $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})=\{a+b\sqrt{2}|a,b\in\mathbb{Q}\}$ Also $\mathbb{Q}[i]=\{a+bi|a,b\in\mathbb{Q}\}$ What is  $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},i)$ ? Is it $\mathbb{Q}+\mathbb{Q}\sqrt{2}+\mathbb{Q}[i]$ but then we include $\mathbb{Q}$ twice as $\mathbb{Q}[i]=\mathbb{Q}+\mathbb{Q}i$ so should $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},i)$ mean $\mathbb{Q}\sqrt{2}+\mathbb{Q}[i]$? and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},i)=\{a+b\sqrt{2}+ci|a,b,c\in\mathbb{Q}\}?$ Thanks in advance","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"
