26680,The uniqueness of the Gamma Function,"It is a theorem that any function $f$ defined for positive real numbers satisfying $f(1)=1$ $f(x+1)=x\cdot f(x)$ $f$ is log convex is identically equal to the gamma function. (Condition 2 means that this function interpolates a shifted factorial function.) Now, a beginner (such as myself) might ask: What if we weaken condition 2 by instead requiring $f$ to be merely convex, not log convex? I would imagine that such functions would look not too different, since intuitively, I can't wildly deviate the graph of the gamma function if I want to maintain condition 2 and stay convex. Just a follow-up musing---What if instead of condition 3, we require convexity and infinite differentiability? Do we still uniquely determine the gamma function?","['gamma-function', 'special-functions', 'real-analysis']"
26683,A problem regarding regular measure,"This problem comes from page 99 in Folland's ""real analysis: modern techniques and their applications"", 2nd edition, as the image below shows. I tried to prove condition (ii) for n =1 under condition (i), The author says it follows from Theorems 1.16 and 1.18, but I can not see any relation between condition (ii) and the two Theorems mentioned. What $\inf\{...\}$ defines is an outer measure. But, since the collection of all open set, i.e., the topology of $\mathbb R^n$, is not a ring, I can not prove that the outer measure restricted to $\mathbb R^n$ is a measure. In consequence, I can not use subtractivity property of measure to prove condition (ii) using the method similar to that of Theorem 1.14. Could you please help me with this problem? Thanks! PS: Since this is a specific problem in Folland's book, in addition to the good will to answer, I have to assume the answerer have at hand a copy of Folland's book and, as a must have for owners of this book, its two versions of erratas.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

26691,Questions on Möbius function,"I was reading a paper, related to group theory. I came across two doubts (may be simple, but puzzling me): Let $G$ be a finite group and consider the lattice of subgroups of $G$. On this lattice, we define a Möbius function $\mu$ by $\sum_{H\geq K} {\mu(H)=\delta_{K,G}}$. I want two verifications: 1) If $G=C_n$ is cyclic group of order $n$, and $H=C_m$ is any subgroup of order $m$, then $\mu(C_m)=\mu(n/m)$, the Möbius function in number theory. 2) If $G=D_n$, the dihedral group of order $2n$, then for each $m$, $m|n$, consider the subgroups $C_m$ (cyclic group of order $m$), and $D_m$, the dihedral group of order $m$. The valules of $\mu(H)$ for these subgroups are given as: $\mu(C_m)=-\frac{n}{m}\mu(\frac{n}{m})$. $\mu(D_m)=\mu(n/m)$ (for both cases of $m$ -odd or even) (Here the $\mu$ on R.H.S. denotes the Möbius function of number theory).

26733,When do the measure-theoretic and elementary definitions of conditional probability/expectation coincide?,"Suppose $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, P)$ is the sample space and $X: (\Omega, \mathcal{A}) \rightarrow (\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$ is a random variable. Using language of measure theory,
$P(A \mid X)$, the conditional
probability of an event given a
random variable, is defined from
conditional expectation as $E(I_A
    \mid X)$. So $P(\cdot \mid X)$ is in
fact a mapping $\mathcal{A} \times
    \Omega \rightarrow [0,1]$. In elementary probability, we
learned that $$P(A \mid X \in B): =
    \frac{P(A \cap \{X \in B\})}{P(X \in
    B)}.$$ If I understand correctly,
this requires and implies $P(X \in B) \neq 0$. So 
$P(\cdot \mid X \in \cdot)$ is in
fact a mapping $\mathcal{A} \times
    \mathcal{B} \rightarrow [0,1]$. My questions are: When will $P(\cdot \mid X)$ in the
first definition and $P(\cdot \mid X
    \in \cdot)$ in the second coincide/become consistent
with each other and how? Is there some case when they can
both apply but do not agree with
other? Is the first definition a more
general one that include the second
as a special case? Similar questions for conditional
expectation. In elementary probability, $E(Y \mid    X \in B)$ is defined as
expectation    of $Y$ w.r.t. the
p.m. $P(\cdot \mid    X \in B)$. So
$E(Y \mid X \in \cdot)$    is a
mapping $\mathcal{B} \rightarrow   
    \mathbb{R}$. In measure theory,  $E(Y \mid X )$ is    a random variable $\Omega
    \rightarrow    \mathbb{R}$. I was also wondering how $E(Y \mid X
    \in \cdot)$ in elementary
probability and $E(Y \mid X )$ in
measure theory can coincide/become

definition which includs the former
as a special case? Thanks and regards!",['probability-theory']

26785,Is there a sufficiency criterion for Cantor pairing functions?,"I was working through Pugh's Real Mathematical Analysis when I came across this proof: Theorem $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is denumerable. Proof Think of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ as an $\infty \times \infty$ matrix and walk along the successive counter-diagonals.  This gives a list $$(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1) (3, 2) (2, 3) (1, 4) (5, 1)...$$ of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ and proves that $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is denumerable. The proof is accompanied by a visual diagram showing successive diagonals crossed out where for each $a_{ij} \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ , $i + j = d$ , $d$ fixed. Now from the diagram, it is visually easy to see that the graph of the function given is surjective.  And I understand ""intuitively"" why the graph is injective; we can just list the ordered pairs out as ""1, 2, 3..."", where each one is different.  However, it was quite frustrating to explicitly come up with a function and check it was injective to my satisfaction.  The book gives hints in the exercises so you can eventually come up with the function $2^{i}(2j + 1)$ , which I verified was injective.   Since primes seem to be ""fundamental"" when discussing the natural numbers, I thought all Cantor pairing functions might be of the form $p^{i}(pj + k)$ where $0 < k < p$ , and $p$ is prime. Looking it up, however, Wikipedia informs me that this is not so as, $$n = f(i, j) = \dfrac{(i + j)(i + j + 1)}{2} + j$$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ , which I again verified.
So my question is, what do these Cantor pairing functions generally look like?  Is there a sufficiency criterion? EDIT : Zev's answer below convinces me that the general question I asked above is very uninteresting.  Can something more interesting be said if one requires the function to be continuous on $\mathbb{R^2}$ , and still send $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ ?

26804,Question about base cases in induction,"So when first developing the natural numbers in basic set theory, most properties are proven by induction. This is very convenient since $\omega$ is the smallest inductive set. I saw a proof of the following proposition. For all $n\in\omega$ and $n\neq 0$, $n\times\omega\sim\omega$. The induction goes as let 
$$
K=\{n\in\omega\ |\ (n=0)\lor (n\times\omega\sim\omega)\}.
$$
Base case, $0\in K$. Suppose $n\in K$. Then 
$$
\sigma(n)\times \omega=(n\cup\{n\})\times\omega=n\times\omega\cup\{n\}\times\omega\sim\omega
$$
since $n\times\omega\sim\omega$ and $\{n\}\times\omega\sim\omega$, and the union of two countable sets is countable. What puts me off is that since the proposition is not true for $n=0$, we just throw it into the set to conclude that $K=\omega$, not $K=\omega\setminus\{0\}$. Shouldn't we start the base case at $n=1$ instead? Why is it still acceptable to begin at $0$ if the proposition is not actually true for $0$?","['induction', 'elementary-set-theory']"

26824,"Determinants: multiply a row by a scalar, all is good; multiply a row by a square matrix?","When calculating determinants it can be nice to multiply a row by a number or to add one row to another (your basic row operations).  Each has an easy to understand effect on the determinant.  Today I ran across a type of row operation whose effect on the determinant is a lot less clear to me. Take an $n \times n$ matrix $M$ and an $n \times n$ matrix $A$.  While calculating the determinant of $M$, I might mess around with the rows of $M$.   Every time I mess with the first row of $M$, I would like to be able to change my mind and mess with the second row of $M$ instead. If I multiply the first row of $M$ by $2$ to get $M'$, or if I multiply the second row of $M$ by $2$ to get $M″$, I get the same determinants, $\det(M') = \det(M″)$.  This does not depend on the matrix $M$; I always have that $2$ times the first row is equivalent to $2$ times the second row. For instance, if $M = \left(\begin{smallmatrix}a& b \\ c& d \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ then $M' = \left(\begin{smallmatrix}2a& 2b \\ c& d \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and $M'' = \left(\begin{smallmatrix}a& b \\ 2c& 2d \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and $$\det(M') = \det(M″) = 2\det(M) = 2ad−2bc.$$ Can I do something similar with ""$A$"" instead of ""$2$""? If I multiply the first row of $M$ by $A$ to get $M'$, then what matrix $B$ do I need to multiply the second row of $M$ by to get $M''$ so that $\det(M')=\det(M'')$ have the same determinant? I would like the answer to be depend only on $A$, not on $M$.  I calculated an answer for $2×2$ matrices, but I'm not happy with it. For instance, if $A = \left(\begin{smallmatrix}2& 0 \\ 0& 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$, and $M = \left(\begin{smallmatrix}a& b \\ c& d \end{smallmatrix}\right)$, then $M' = \left(\begin{smallmatrix}2a& b \\ c& d \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and $\det(M') = 2ad−bc$.  I can choose $B = \left(\begin{smallmatrix}1& 0 \\ 0& 2 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ so that $M'' = \left(\begin{smallmatrix}a& b \\ c& 2d \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and $\det(M'') = 2ad−bc = \det(M')$. However, I'd like to understand more clearly the relationship between $A$ and $B$.  Perhaps there is a fair amount of freedom in choosing $B$ and I have chosen a bad one in my work.

$$
K=\{k\in\omega\ |\ k^m<k^n\}.
$$ Since $m<n$ there exists a $p^+\in\omega$ such that $m+p^+=n$. Consider $2$. I claim $2^{p^+}>1$. Now $p^+\neq 0$, since $0$ is not in the range of the successor. If $p^+=1$, then from the work above, $2^1=2>1$. Suppose then that $2^{p^+}>1$. Then $2^{p^{++}}=2^{p^+}\cdot 2>1$. This follows by transitivity since $1<2^{p^+}$, and $1<2$ implies $2^{p^+}\cdot 1<2^{p^+}\cdot 2$, that is $2^{p^+}<2^{p^{++}}$. Then from $1<2^{p^+}$ we have $2^m=2^m\cdot 1<2^m\cdot 2^{p^+}=2^{m+p^+}=2^n$, so $2\in K$. By the same reasoning we can show that any $k\neq 0,1$ is in $K$. If $k\neq 0,1$, then $1<k$. Again, I claim $k^{p^+}>1$. If $p^+=1$, we are done. So suppose $k^{p^+}>1$. Then since $1<k$, we have $k^{p^+}=k^{p^+}\cdot 1<k^{p^+}\cdot k=k^{p^{++}}$, so $1<k^{p^{++}}$ by transitivity, and so $k^{p^+}>1$ for all $p$, since $p^+\neq 0$. Then from $1<k^{p^+}$ we have $k^m\cdot 1<k^m\cdot k^{p^+}=k^{m+p^+}=k^n$, so $k\in K$, and the result follows. All in all, this approach seems very ugly. Is there a way to clean it up?

As a result I know the basics of how the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DH from here on) works, but I don't know why it does. I know that by two similar algorithms with two private numbers, both parties come to the same conclusion. Why? (I have used the wikipedia article to gain my understanding of the formulae and reproduce them in a Ruby script for my own learning.) My primary curiosity is over the two primary steps of deriving the public keys (which are exchanged) and then deriving the same, final encryption key. How do Alice and Bob actually get the same key without the sharing of their two private keys? I'm probably missing an obvious ""solve for ..."" or a simple rule, somewhere. Given: G: a small prime P: a very large prime (EG, 1024 bits) Secret Keys (just a random number): $X_a$ Alice's secret key $X_b$ Bob's secret key Temporary (shared) Keys: Alice: $Y_a = G^{X_a} \mod P$ Bob: $Y_b = G^{X_b} \mod P$ Final Key: Alice: ${Y_b}^{X_a} \mod P$ Bob: ${Y_a}^{X_b} \mod P$ Edit: Assume: $G = 7$ $P = 11$ $X_a = 6$ $X_b = 9$ Should be: $Y_a = 4$ $Y_b = 8$ By lhf's answer and a proper application of simplifying exponents, $G^{a \centerdot b} \mod P = 3$ should be correct. However, it is nowhere close. Manipulating it to $G^{a + b} \mod P = 3$ is still incorrect, but closer. Why is $(G^{a + b} \mod P) \mod P = 3$ correct? Edit 2: The calculator that I use on my computer incorrectly handles % as modulo, and therefore does not emit the correct answer. If you have a Mac, you can use Spotlight (cmd+space) and (7^(6*9)) % 11 (even if you use ""modulo"") becomes 8 —and no, I have no idea why. So... chalk one problem up to trusting calculators.

27023,Defining sets and union as a group,"I came across an exercise in this book where the question was to define a collection of sets and the union operator as a group. The two parts of the question were to (1) find the identity element and (2) find the inverse element. Assuming some collection of sets that's closed over set union $\mathcal{X}$ and some element $A \in \mathcal{X}$, my answer to the first question was that any set $A' \subseteq A$ and $\emptyset$ could be the identity element. But I run into trouble if I try to build an inverse out of this. For example, there's no way to obtain $\emptyset$ from a non-empty $A$ using union. And it's obvious that if uniqueness of identity and inverse is a requirement for defining groups, then for any $A$, $A$ is also its own identity and inverse. My question is Is it valid to have multiple non-unique identity elements in a group for each item in the collection? Is it valid to have a unique inverse element for each item in the collection even if the identity elements are not unique? Judging by what I read on wikipedia, uniqueness doesn't seem to be a criterion.","['elementary-set-theory', 'group-theory']"

I get why this works from a sum-of-series perspective and from an integration perspective, as in I can evaluate the integrals and find this result. However, I don't understand it intuitively. Intuitively, what this means to me is that if you rotate pi radians around a unit circle, you will end up exactly opposite of where you started. Expanding upon this, for any theta, $e^{i\theta}$ is equivalent to rotating $\theta$ radians around a unit circle. So it's obvious (if not intuitive) to me that $e^{(\pi/2)i} = i$ and $e^{2\pi i} = 1$ and so on. What I'm wondering is, intuitively, how is the natural logarithm related so closely to circles? My understanding of $e$ stems from exponential growth, and I don't see how that ties to rotation around a unit circle. I know the formulas, but I'm looking for an intuitive explanation. For example, when I used to ask how sin and cos related to circles, people would show me taylor series or tables with a bunch of values or tell me to use a calculator, but it didn't click until somebody told me that sin is just a measure of the height of a point as you travel around the unit circle.

27080,Two basic complex analysis homework questions,"I have some homework problems from Greene and Krantz' Function Theory of One Complex Variable .  They come from Chapter 5.  I definitely do not want answers, just light prodding in the right direction. Let $f_j: D(0, 1)\to\mathbb C$ be
  holomorphic and suppose that each
  $f_j$ has at least $k$ roots in $D(0,1)$, counting multiplicities.  Suppose
  that $f_j\to f$ uniformly on compact
  sets.  Show by example that it does not follow that $f$ has at least $k$ roots counting multiplicities.  In
  particular, construct examples, for
  each fixed $k$ and each $\ell$,
  $0\le\ell\le k$, where $f$ has exactly
  $\ell$ roots.  What simple hypothesis
  can you add that will guarantee that
  $f$ does have at least $k$ roots? I know we require continuity of the $f_j$ on the boundary for the number of zeroes to be the same in the limit, but I'm not clear on why this is.  Presumably, that's the purpose of the question.  In another question, the goal is to prove this when the disk and its boundary are in the region of holomorticity of the $f_j$. I'm tempted to think that the problem we run in to is when the zeroes move to the boundary in the limit, but maybe I'm just not familiar enough to construct an actual example of this.  I'm also confused by their use of at least $k$ roots.  It seems simplest to start with a sequence of functions that all have exactly $k$ roots, but I'm afraid I'm missing something, and that it will only work if the functions have different numbers of zeroes, for some reason. Basically, I would like some intuition about how things can go wrong when we only have holomorticity on the interior of the disk, and maybe a (small) clue about the form the sequence will take. Prove: If $f$ is a polynomial on $\mathbb C$, then the zeroes of $f^\prime$ are contained in the closed convex hull of the zeroes of $f$.  (Here the closed convex hull of a set $S$ is the intersection of all closed convex sets that contain $S$.) [ Hint: If the zeroes of $f$ are contained in a halfplane $V$, then so are the zeroes of $f^\prime$. I would really like to use the maximum modulus theorem to say that the zeroes of $f^\prime$ occur at maxima (minima) of $f$, and therefore that these only happen on the boundary of some set $U$ (where $f$ is continuous on $\overline U$ and holomorphic on $U$), but I can't see a way to relate this statement about general bounded domains and convex hulls. I could be looking at these entirely wrong.  If I need to clarify my thoughts or say more, please let me know, and again, I definitely don't want more than little hints.

The necessary tools for this are class field theory and Chebotarev's density theorem. On the other hand I'm not asking for infinitely many primes, only for one.

27309,Understanding a proof by descent [Fibonacci's Lost Theorem],"I am trying to understand the proof in Carmichaels book Diophantine Analysis but I have got stuck at one point in the proof where $w_1$ and $w_2$ are introduced. The theorem it is proving is that the system of diophantine equations: $$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$$ $$y^2 + z^2 = t^2$$ cannot simultaneously be satisfied. The system is algebraically seen equivalent to $$t^2 + x^2 = 2z^2$$ $$t^2 - x^2 = 2y^2$$ and this is what will be worked on. We are just considering the case where the numbers are pairwise relatively prime. That implies that $t,x$ are both odd (they cannot be both even). Furthermore $t > x$ so define $t = x + 2 \alpha$. Clearly the first equation $(x + 2\alpha)^2 + x^2 = 2 z^2$ is equivalent to $(x + \alpha)^2 + \alpha^2 = z^2$ so by the characterization of primitive Pythagorean triples there exist relatively prime $m,n$ such that $$\{x+\alpha,\alpha\} = \{2mn,m^2-n^2\}.$$ Now the second equation $t^2 - x^2 = 4 \alpha (x + \alpha) = 8 m n (m^2 - n^2) = 2 y^2$ tells us that $y^2 = 2^2 m n (m^2 - n^2)$ by coprimality and unique factorization it follows that each of those terms are squares so define $u^2 = m$, $v^2 = n$ and $w^2 = m^2 - n^2 = (u^2 - v^2)(u^2 + v^2)$. It is now said that from the previous equation either $u^2 + v^2 = 2 {w_1}^2$,  $u^2 - v^2 = 2 {w_2}^2$ or $u^2 + v^2 = w_1^2$,  $u^2 - v^2 = w_2^2$ but $w_1$ and $w_2$ have not been defined and I cannot figure out what they are supposed to be. Any ideas what this last part could mean? For completeness, if the first case occurs we have our descent and if the second case occurs $w_1^2 + w_2^2 = 2 u^2$, $w_1^2 - w_2^2 = 2 v^2$ gives the descent. Which finishes the proof.",['number-theory']

27373,Find eigenvalues of a projection and explain what they mean,"Suppose B represents the matrix of orthogonal (perpendicular) projection of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ onto the plane $x_{2} = x_{1}$. Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of B and explain their geometric meaning. What I have I come up so far as an attempt to deduce this question down is, for instance. If we pick an arbitrary point in space ($\mathbb{R}^{3}$), then we must project this point onto a plane (in particular $x_{2} = x_{1}$) which I imagine on a three dimensional axis of ($x,y,z$), if we choose $x_{1}$ to represent the $x$-axis, $x_{2}$ to represent the $y$-axis, and $x_{3}$ to represent the $z$-axis then we would have a plane of the equation that looks like $y=z$ or conversely ($x_{2}=x_{1}$) which is its equivalent. Once you project this point onto the plane, I see that it is true to be perpendicular and its vector is coming out of the plane. My troubles are finding the new coordinates of the new point that is projected onto the plane. Here is a skeleton sketch of what I had in math-ese. $\left[\begin{array}{c}
