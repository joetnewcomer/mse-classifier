482063,Parabolas through three points,"We can draw an infinite number of parabolas that pass through three given points $A$, $B$, $C$ (in that order). For each such parabola, we take the tangent lines at $A$ and $C$, and intersect them to get a point, $P$, which is called the ""apex"" of the parabola segment, in my business. What is the locus of this apex point $P$? I think it's a hyperbola that has the lines $AB$ and $BC$ as asymptotes. Here's a picture. The pink curve is the locus that interests me. I believe the point $P$ is called the ""polar point"" of the chord $AC$, sometimes. The answers to this question have some basic computations that might be useful. The locus of the parabola vertex seems to be much more complicated. It is studied in this question . Given the complexity of the vertex locus, I think it's remarkable that the apex locus is so simple. A parabola is, of course, a quadratic Bezier curve, and the apex point is its ""middle"" control point (if this helps). Can we generalize to rational quadratic Bezier curves (i.e. to conic section curves that are not necessarily parabolas)? Edit: The generalization to rational quadratic Bezier curves probably doesn't make sense. You can (often) pick any two additional points, say $D$ and $E$, and you'll be able to draw a conic through all five points $A, B, C, D, E$. So, the locus of the apex point is some region of the plane, not a curve.","['geometry', 'conic-sections', 'bezier-curve']"
482070,Matrices Intuition,"I am currently studying matrix algebra. The axioms and theorems of this form of algebra are a bit different from the high school algebra I did. However one knows that one is dealing with real numbers in that form of algebra and one can always associate a physical object with a number to see if a particular theorems makes sense. For example, x-2=0 , find x. Now one can associate 2 and x with apples and see the operation '-' as eating apples and then having 2 apples and eaten x apples you get 0 apples, hence x must be 2 (apples) in this case. Similarly is there anything physical that I can associate with a matrix so that I can call upon my intuition whenever confronted with a new theorem/result instead of blindly following algebra rules and axioms associated with a matrix. Any help in this regard will be appreciated. In short: Please associate a common physical object that obeys all the rules of algebra of a matrix.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'algebra-precalculus', 'intuition']"

482150,Sum of prime factors,"If $x$ is an odd prime, is it true that the sum of the prime factors of $x + 1$ is less than $x$?

$n=4k$ and $n=4k+1$;
solutions exist and were exhibited for
$n=4k+2$ and $n=4k+3$. My challenge now is to count the number of solutions. I do not have a complete answer, but, in the work below, 
I show that there are at least an exponential number of solutions 
- at least $O(2^{n/4})$. What has been done so far: There are two types of solutions
stated. In the first,
the fact that
$n+(n+3)=(n+1)+(n+2)$
was used to construct solutions
with the sign pattern
""+ - - +"" (or ""- + + -""). In the second,
the fact that
$1+3+5+...+(2m-1) = m^2$
was used to construct solutions with the sign pattern
""- + - +"" (or ""+ - + -"")
with minor modifications. Generating an exponential number of solutions. Once a single solution has been generated,
another can be generated by
taking any  four 
equally spaced elements
with corresponding signs
""+ - - +"" or ""- + + -""
and reversing their signs.
To show this,
the elements values are
$\pm m, \mp (m+d), \mp (m+2d),\pm (m+3d)$.
Since the sum of these is $0$,
so is the sum of the sign-reversed values
$\mp m, \pm (m+d), \pm (m+2d),\mp (m+3d)$. If we use the
""- + + -"" solution mentioned above,
there are about
$n/4$ blocks of four elements
with a ""- + + -"" or ""+ - - +"" sign pattern.
By changing the signs of each of these blocks independently,
we get about
$2^{n/4}$ different arrangements,
all summing as desired. We can get more patterns by starting at $2, 3, $ or $4$,
or by using the ""- + - +"" pattern.","['combinatorial-designs', 'arithmetic', 'summation', 'combinatorics']"

Now I was wondering about the following: If our potential $V(q,\dot{q})$ also depends in some weird way of the velocities, this could mean that our Lagrangian is no longer convex with respect to the velocity, so the Legendre Trafo would be no longer necessarily unique, right? has this any consequences on classical mechanics? If the Lagrangian would be convex with respect to $q$, could we also substitute this variable by using the Legendre Transformation and keep $\dot{q}$, just out of curiosity?

I will expose the problem and I will be grateful to accept hints, solutions and bibliographic sources on tensor derivations. Problem 2.10 (p.53) Prove that a tensor derivation $\mathfrak{D}$ has $\mathfrak{D}_0 ^0 = 0$ if and only if $\mathfrak{D}_0^1$  is $\mathfrak{F}(M)$- 
  linear (here, $\mathfrak{F}(M)$ stands for all smooth real-valued functions on $M$).  Then by interpretation, $\mathfrak{D}_0 ^1  = B \in \mathfrak{T}_1^1(M)$ (where $\mathfrak{T}_s^r(M)$ stands for all (r,s)-tensors on $M$), and we write $\mathfrak{D} = \mathfrak{D}_B$. Here is the definition of a tensor derivation according to the book: Definition (Tensor derivation). A tensor derivation $\mathfrak{D}$ is a set of $\mathbb{R}$-linear functions on a smooth manifold $M$
  $$ \mathfrak{D} = \mathfrak{D}^r_s:\mathfrak{T}_s^r \to \mathfrak{T}_s^r \quad\quad (r\geq 0, s\geq 0) $$
  such that for any tensors $A$ and $B$: (1) $\quad \mathfrak{D}(A \otimes  B)= \mathfrak{D}A \otimes B+ A \otimes \mathfrak{D}B $ (2) $\quad \mathfrak{D}(\mathbf{C} A) = \mathbf{C}(\mathfrak{D} A )$ for any contraction $\mathbf{C}$. My first problem is that I cannot see the intuition behind the definition whose notation is already cumbersome and I cannot find additional literature on the subject. Anyway, I believe a solution to the problem is given by the identity (1), for if $\theta$ is a $(1,0)$-tensor and $f$ a smooth real-valued function then $\mathfrak{D}(f)=\mathfrak{D}_0^0(f)=0$ by hypothesis and (1) becomes (hope this makes some sense):
$$ \mathfrak{D}(f \theta) = \mathfrak{D}(f) \otimes \theta + f \mathfrak{D}(\theta) = f \mathfrak{D}(\theta)$$
which I hope is enough to prove the necessity and sufficiency of $\mathfrak{F}(M)$-linearity. Yet I cannot derive how it can be interpreted that $\mathfrak{D}_0^1$ is a (1,1)-tensor!

I have read that if this conjecture is true, the biggest gap between two consecutive primes is $O(\sqrt{p})$; the Riemann Hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that this gap is $O(\sqrt{p}\log{p})$, which is a wider gap for sufficiently large inputs. This leaves me asking the following question, which I am aware may be a bit naive, but I want to be sure: Would a proof of Legendre's conjecture also be considered a proof of Riemann's hypothesis ? EDIT: I am aware that the way the asymptotic above were expressed was in terms of prime numbers, and that the Riemann Hypothesis is concerned about everything in between as well; would a proof of this sort need to show this upper bound for all inputs, or would the prime numbers be sufficient? EDIT 2: It seems to me that, if a proof of Legendre's conjecture could result in a proof of the Riemann hypothesis, that this would come from the $\log{x}$ term of the asymptotic, showing that this term is never smaller than what results from the distance between primes. In other words, this would have to be an inductive proof, showing an initial case and, as a result of that initial case and the fact that the gap is $O(\sqrt{p})$ for that case, all future cases must therefore be $O(\sqrt{p} \log{p})$.

482798,Entire extension of a function on a set with an accumulation point,"While thinking about the identity theorem the following question came in my mind: Let $A\subset \mathbb{C}$ be a set with an accumulation point in $\mathbb{C}$. 
  What properties does a function $f:A\to \mathbb{C}$ need, such that we can find an extension $\tilde{f}:\mathbb{C}
\to \mathbb{C}$ with $\tilde{f}(z)=f(z)$ for all $z\in A$ and $\tilde{f}$ is an entire function ? My actual thoughts are: $f$ must be local lipschitz continuous We could try to calculate the coefficients of the Taylor Series, (my first thought is doing something like a limit of polnoymial interpolation, so taking a converging sequence $(b_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ with values in $A$ and solving $V_{(b_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}}\cdot (a_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}= (f(b_n))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$, where
$V$ is an $\infty \times \infty$  Vandermonde-matrix). If this work we have the only possible canditate for $\tilde{f}$ namely $$\tilde{f}(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n \cdot z^n$$ because of the identity theorem. So we just need to check whether $f(z)=\tilde{f}(z)$ for all elements of $A$, and wheter the radius of convergence of $\tilde{f}$ is infinity. From my very naive point of view this should  work iff $f$ admits such an extension, because the sums in the linear equation are unconditional convergent. So what are conditions for the equation to have a solution?",['complex-analysis']

I'm not particularly satisfied with the end of my proof though, and worse, I'm sure it's a rather stupid question! Here's what I did; Let $T$ be a connected topological space. Take $f: T \mapsto S^0$, and suppose $f$ is continuous and surjective. For $f$ to be continuous, we must ensure the preimages of any open subset of the image are themselves always open. Since $f$ continuous, we shall call the open sets $f^{-1}(\{+1\}) = U$ and $f^{-1}(\{-1\}) = V$, where $U \cap V = \emptyset$, and $U,V \not= \emptyset$ so as to satisfy the definition of $f$. Now since $T$ is connected, we cannot have $U \cup V = T$, [dodge part I'm not happy with:] so there are points in $T$ for which $f$ is not defined, contradicting the fact that $f$ is surjective*, therefore if $f$ is to be continuous it cannot be surjective. *does it?

Suppose $H\neq (1)$ is another normal subgroup of $S_n$ then, $H\cap A_n$ would also be a normal subgroup. As $H\cap A_n \subseteq A_n$ we see that $H\cap A_n \unlhd A_n$. But for $n\geq 5$, $A_n$ is a simple group so does not have proper normal subgroups. Thus, $H\cap A_n =(1)$. So, we should have $A_n\leq H \leq S_n$ with  $|A_n|=\frac{n!}{2}$ and $|S_n|=n!$ As there is no number in between $\frac{n!}{2}$ and $n!$ which is divisible by $\frac{n!}{2}$ and divides $n!$ we should end up with the case when $H=A_n$ or $H=S_n$.
