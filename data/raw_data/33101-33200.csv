315170,Understanding Complete Metric Spaces and Cauchy Sequences,"From my own definition, I have concluded that a complete metric space is a set and a metric where the set consists of no holes in it.  Book definitions describe that ""A complete metric space is a metric space in which every Cauchy sequence is convergent."" I understand that a metric is a distance measuring device defined on an arbitrary set, and when speaking of a ""metric space"" they are talking about a set and a metric defined on that set (X,d).  However, I have yet to get an understanding of a ""Cauchy sequence"" when speaking of a Complete Metric Space.  I am seeking an example of a complete metric space, relatively one that I can interpret.","['general-topology', 'sequences-and-series', 'functional-analysis', 'metric-spaces']"
315181,example of a finite coloring without infinite monochromatic set closed under addition,"I am studying some theorems on combinatorial set theory, especially Ramsey theorem and Hindman's theorem. I think I am going to ask a silly question, but I am too much involved in the subject to think clear about it. As in the title, I am searching for a finite colouring $c: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{1, \ldots, k\}$ such that there is no monochromatic set which is closed under addition. I am convinced one can do this using only two colours. I have thought about this for too long now, but I found some necessary conditions. The set of all even numbers can't be colored with the same colour, otherwise, it would be an infinite monochromatic set closed under addition. The same thing with every natural number k, the set $k\mathbb{N} = \{kn \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ is closed under addition so you have to colour it with both colours. (every 'tail' has to contain two elements with different colours) I have thought about defining a function $h: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, where $h(n)$ is the highest power of two in $n$, and by this function defining  a colouring $c: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{1,2\}$  where $c(n) = 1$ iff $h(n)$ is even. 
But when I have to give a rigorous proof, I get stuck. Hopefully someone can help me out.","['ramsey-theory', 'coloring', 'examples-counterexamples', 'combinatorics']"

315219,show that Joukowski transform is one-to-one in the upper half outside the unit disk,"I have a problem on showing how the Joukowski transform $w=J(z) = .5(z + 1/z)$ takes the upper half plane, $|z| \gt 1$, one-to-one into the w upper half plane.

Solving $J(z)=w$ for $z = w±\sqrt{w^2-1}$ and I have a rather larger formula for w in terms of $z = x + iy$, which seems like maybe more what I should be concerned with since after all the other condition is that $Im(z) \gt 0$, but also maybe I should be looking at the branch cuts except I'm not quite sure how to deal with that either.

It would seem silly to restrict a matrix down to limited uses such as only for numbers, but I get the impression that I cant multiply two matrices whose elements are the planets in our solar system. So we only allow numbers in matrices. Does this also mean that I cannot have a matrix of matrices? I feel like I should be able to since if I wanted to multiply two matrices of matrices, then although tedious by hand it can be done since I can add/subtract and multiply normal matrices.

315273,How should I think about very ample sheaves?,"Definition.

My question is: what is the right way (interpret ""right way"" as you wish) to think about very ample sheaves? In particular, why is the word ""ample"" being used? What is it that I have an ample amount of? Degree 1 elements? In the simple case when $Y=\text{Spec}(A)$ is affine then $i^\ast(\mathcal{O}(1))$ is just $\mathcal{O}(1)$ as defined on $\text{Proj} A[x_0,\ldots x_r]$ , that is, it's the sheafification of the degree 1 part of the polynomial ring $A[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ .  So it seems like the more general definition is just meant to generalize this phenomenon. Is this true? If so, why is it worth generalizing? What's special about degree 1 elements? The only thing I can think of is that the polynomial ring is generated as an $A$ -algebra by its degree 1 elements.

The way to do this, I would guess, would be to consider some sort of sequence of coordinates that converges to something that is clearly not in $U(x,\epsilon)$, but does not necessarily violate the restriction on distance in regards to the uniform metric. I know that the box topology that $U(x,\epsilon)$ pertains to is as fine as it gets, so given any $\epsilon$ I should be able to carry out this idea, but I have not been able to come up with a point or, equivalently, a sequence, that actually works. Show that $B_{\epsilon}(x)=\bigcup_{\delta<\epsilon} U(x,\delta)$ I do not have any work for this and am unsure where to start.","['general-topology', 'uniform-spaces']"

315544,"""Anti-Gray codes"" that maximize the number of bits that change at each step","Let $N$ be a non-negative integer and let $S$ be some ordering of the $2^N$ distinct $N$-tuples of binary digits.  We can look at the number of bits that change from each element to the next, and add this up for each element and its successor: $$T(S) = \sum_{i=1}^{2^N} H(S_{i-1}, S_i)$$ where $H(x,y)$ is the Hamming distance between tuples $x$ and $y$, the number of positions in which they differ.  It's well known that this quantity $T(S)$ is minimized for certain  sequences ("" Gray codes "") in which each element of $S$ differs from its successor in exactly one bit.  So we have $$m(N) = \min_{\text{all }S} T(S) = 2^N - 1$$ My question is: What is the corresponding maximum value $$M(N) = \max_{\text{all }S} T(S)?$$ Small cases for $N\le3$ are easily seen to be 0, 1, 5, 18.  I did not see anything evident in OEIS about this. A sequence $S$ contains $2^N-1$ transitions between elements, and it's tempting to conjecture that when $N>0$, half of these (rounded up) can change all $N$ bits and the other half (rounded down) can change all but one bit.

Since the genus of the Fermat curve $x^{n} + y^{n} = 1$ is $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ by the degree formula, Faltings' Theorem implies that it can only have finitely many rational solutions for $n > 2$, which proves a weak form of FLT. Are there other topological invariants of curves or surfaces which bound the genus or (more directly) the number of rational points that can exist on them, e.g., arithmetic/geometric genus, (Zariski) multiplicity, Milnor number, Hirzebruch signature, Casson Invariant, Rohklin Invariant, etc.? For example, if $f = \sum_{i=0}^{n} z_{i}^{a_{i}}$ with positive integers $a_0, \dots, a_n$, then one defines a Brieskorn-Pham manifold $\Sigma(a_0, \dots, a_n)$ as the intersection of the corresponding hypersurface of $f$ with a sufficiently small sphere, namely, $f^{-1}(0) \cap S^{2n+1}_{\epsilon}$. Brieskorn-Pham manifolds give examples of exotic spheres in certain odd dimensions for certain exponents. Is there a connection between certain topological attributes of $\Sigma(a_0, \dots, a_n)$, including topological invariants, and the number of rational points on the curve $f = 1$?",['algebraic-geometry']

The question I am working on is: Can you conclude that $A=B$ if $A$ and $B$ are two sets with the same power set? At first, I thought of doing a proof by contraposition; however, that didn't appear (ostensibly, at least) it would prove effective. Although, you of more experience, if you happen to know a way of using that proof method, I would doubtlessly be interested. So, I then thought of doing a proof by contradiction. Here is my attempt, if you'd be so kind as to look it over and evaluate it, I would appreciate it: PS I'll have a few questions in bold, sprinkled throughout the proof. If $A$ and $B$ are two sets with the same power-set, then $A=B$. Let's assume the opposite is true, that if $A$ and $B$ are two sets with the same power-set, then $A$ and $B$ must be different sets ($A \ne B$). If $A \ne B$, then either $A$ or $B$ will have at least one element that isn't in the other set. Say $A$ has the extra element, denoted by $e$. (Although you could have $B$ contain the extra element, the argument will work either way, it is independent of the choice). Let $A= \{a_1,a_2, a_3, ...,e,...\}$, and $B=\{b_1,b_2,b_3,...\}$, such that $B$ doesn't contain $e$ (How would I write that little bit in set notation? Also, do I have to explicitly write that $a_1 =b_1$, $a_2=b_2$, and so on?) So, $\mathcal P(A)=\biggr \{ \{a_1\},\{a_2\},\{a_3\},...\{e\},...\{a_1,a_2,a_3,...,e,...\} \biggr \}$ and $\mathcal P(A)=\biggr \{ \{b_1\},\{b_2\},\{b_3\},...\biggr \}$ As you can see, the power-set of $A$ contains at least one element that the power-set of $B$ doesn't have (although, the differ by more than just one).
