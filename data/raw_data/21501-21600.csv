182540,Use Chebychev's Inequality to find a lower bound.,"Let $X$ be the number of heads one would obtain in $140$ flips of a fair coin. Use Chebychev's Inequality to find a lower bound on the probability $P(60 < X < 80)$. Okay so Chebychev's Inequality is $P(|X - E(X)| > kσ) \le 1/k^2$ for $ k > 0$, where $σ^2$ is the variance of $X$. I'm not sure how to fill this in or anything.

182559,Fibres in algebraic geometry: multiplicity,"Currently I am studying varieties over $\mathbb{C}$ and I know some scheme theory. My professor mentioned the other day that given a morphism of varieties over an alg. closed field $k$: $f: X \rightarrow Y$, one should count fibres ""with multiplicity"". I have been trying to make sense of this. It is especially important for me if $Y$ is a curve and the fibres are divisors of $X$. So I looked in Hartshorne, dusted off my scheme knowledge, and rediscovered the scheme theoretic fibre $X_y := X \times_Y \text{Spec}(k(y))$ for some $y \in Y$. I worked out an example: $f: \mathbb{A}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{A}^2$, $(a,b) \mapsto (a^2,b)$. A calculation shows that the fibre over a point $(p,q)$ is the spectrum of $k[x,y]/(x^2-p,y-q) \cong k[x]/(x^2-p)$, which is reduced and consists of two different points if $p \neq 0$, and a nonreduced one point scheme if $p=0$. Really similarly $g: \mathbb{A}^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{A}^1$, $a \mapsto a^2$, then the fibre is the spectrum of $k[x]/(x^2-p)$. I mention these two examples since in one case, the points and fibres are divisors, in the other they are not. This is all no problem at all, however i am trying to translate this back into varieties, trying to make sense of what ""counting with multiplicities"" should mean. Now the questions. How does one translate this into the language of varieties? It seems obvious from the above that the fibre of $(0,q)$ should be $2(0,q)$, since this ""doubling"" is hidden in the structure sheaf. This would be especially important if the points were divisors, since then 2 times a point makes a lot of sense. But how to make this mathematically precise? As in, what is the actual mathematical procedure? I guess if we can factor the ideal by which we are modding out into prime ideals, we can count the prime factors (i.e. varieties) with multiplicity, BUT: is this factoring always possible? And is this the right method? I did a course on Riemann surfaces, there multiplicity was also defined: a holomorphic map is locally at a point always of the form $z \mapsto z^n$, then $n$ is the multiplicity of the map at that point. I'm quite sure the definitions agree, of course assuming $k=\mathbb{C}$ and the varieties to be smooth. Can anyone give an argument why? An ideal answer could include a reference to the two examples, point out differences if there are any (coming from the fact that fibres are/are not divisors) and a general method for writing down a fibre in the language of varieties. If this is only possible in the case of fibres being divisors, i'd still be really happy. Thanks a lot! Edit: Thanks a lot for your answers, Andrew and Froggie! There is a small question left. I should give you a motivation for my question: somewhere in Beauville there is a map $f: S \rightarrow C$ where $C$ is a curve, then the inverse image of a point turns out to be the divisor $nE$, where $E$ is a curve on $S$ and $n>1$. So this is why i expected that there at least would be a notion of ""multiplicity"" in the language of varieties if the fibres were divisors. But as i realize now, there is also the notion of $f^*: \text{Div}(C) \rightarrow \text{Div}(S)$, which is most probably what Beauville used (i havent checked this). So new question: does this $n$ always agree with the multiplicity that you defined Froggie? Is there any other way to relate the scheme theoretic multiplicity and the multiplicity of divisors?","['riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'complex-geometry']"

182665,Getting Students to Not Fear Confusion,"I'm a fifth year grad student, and I've taught several classes for freshmen and sophomores. This summer, as an ""advanced"" (whatever that means) grad student I got to teach an upper level class: Intro to Real Analysis. Since this was essentially these student's first ""real"" math class, they haven't really learned how to study for or learn this type of thing. I've continually emphasized throughout the summer that they need to put in more work than just doing a few homework problems a week. Getting a feel for the definitions and concepts involved takes time and effort of going through proofs of theorems and figuring out why things were needed. You need to build up an arsenal of examples so some general picture of the ideas are in your head. Most importantly, in my opinion, is that you wallow in your confusion for a bit when struggling with problems. Spending time with your confusion and trying to pull yourself out of it (even if it doesn't work!) is a huge part of the learning process. Of course asking for help after a point is important too. Question: What is a good way to convince students that spending time lost and confused is a reasonable thing and how do you actually motivate them to do it? Anecdote: Despite trying all quarter to explain this in various ways, I would consistently have people come in to office hours who had barely touched the homework because ""they were confused"". But they hadn't tried anything. Then when I talk around an answer to try to get them to do certain key parts on their own or get them to understand the concept involved, they would get frustrated and ask ""so does it converge or not?!"" It is incredibly hard to shake their firm belief that the answer is the important thing. Those that do get out of this belief seem to get stuck at writing down a correct proof is the important thing. None seem to make it to wanting to understand it as the important thing. (Probably a good community wiki question?

182752,Invariance of Topological Manifold Dimension: $1$ Dimensional Case,"I am currently practicing with a few problems in Lee's Introduction to Topological Manifold, and I decided the complete the following problem: Prove that a nonempty topological space cannot be both a $1$-manifold and an $n$-manifold for $n>1$. The idea of proof seems pretty obvious: Assume $X$ is both a $1$-manifold and an $n$-manifold for $n>1$. Given some $p \in X$, let $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\tau)$ be coordinate charts around $p$ where $\varphi:U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $\tau:V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$. Note that both $U$ and $V$ are connected. Since $U$ and $V$ are both open, $W=U\cap V$ is an open, connected and nonempty subset of $X$. The restriction of $\varphi$ and $\tau$ to $W$ is a continuous map into $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$, respectively. In particular, $\varphi(W)$ is a connected, open subspace of $\mathbb{R}$, hence $\varphi(W)=(a,b)$ for some $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$. As such, there exists some homeomorphism $f:(a,b)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Using this we can construct the homeomorphism $f \circ \varphi|_W: W \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Similarly, we can construct a homeomorphism $g \circ \tau|_W: W \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$. Composing both of these maps in the right way gives a homeomorphism between $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$, which is impossible since $\mathbb{R}$ minus a point is disconnected while $\mathbb{R}^n$ minus a point is connected for $n>1$. My question is: Is this line of reasoning correct?","['general-topology', 'manifolds']"

A number $d$ is called a limit point if, given $\epsilon > 0$ and an integer $N$, there exists $\color{red}{\mathrm{ an }} \ n \ge N$ so that $|a_n - d| \le \epsilon$.

Assuming $CX$ is locally path connected means there exists a basis $\mathcal{B}$ such that every element of $\mathcal{B}$ is path connected. It's easy to see that $\mathcal{B}\cap X=\{X \cap B \: | \; B \in \mathcal{B}\}$ is a basis for $X$. I cannot quite see why the elements of $\mathcal{B}\cap X$ should be path connected. Let $\hat{B} \in\mathcal{B}\cap X$ and let $p,q \in \hat{B}$. $p$ and $q$ correspond with $(p,1)$ and $(q,1)$, respectively, in $B$ since $X\approx X\times\{1\}$. In $B$ there is a path $\alpha(t):[0,1] \rightarrow B$ such that $\alpha(0)=(p,1)$ and $\alpha(1)=(q,1)$. Perhaps the solution is obvious, but I cannot see how to turn a path in $B$ into a path in $\hat{B}$ or even if that should be possible. If $\alpha(t)$ was not entirely in $X \times \{1\}$, is projecting it onto $X\times \{1\}$ the solution? I have also hit a wall in assuming $X$ is locally path connected.

Attempt We assume that $T$ is as above, and we shall prove that it has closed range. If $y_n = T x_n$ and $y_n\rightarrow y$, we want to show that $y=Tx$ for some $x\in X$. First, suppose $\{x_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ is unbounded. Then $$\lim_n\, T(x_n/\|x_n\|) = \lim_n\, y_n/\|x_n\| = 0.$$ But the set $B=\{ x\in X: \| x\|=1\}$ is closed and norm-bounded, so its image under $T$ is closed. In particular, we must have $Tz=0$ for some $z\in B$. This contradicts the fact that $T$ is injective. So the sequence $\{x_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ is bounded in $X$. Since $\{x_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ is bounded, the set
$$ A=\mathrm{cl} \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, \ldots \}$$
is closed and norm bounded. Hence $T(A)$ is closed in $Y$. In particular, $y=\lim_n\, Tx_n = Tx$ for some $x\in A \subset X$. So the range of $T$ is closed. Thanks in advance!","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"
183150,What is the average length of all integral curves of a vector field?,"Considering a vector field with a source and a sink in a finite comact space, are there any bounds on the length of the integral curves? Specifically, I am interested in the average length of all the integral curves. To make it easier, we could restrict ourselfs to everything being smooth and two dimensions. Here a more physical motivation, so one can picture the problem better: Say you have a finite volume with one inlet and one outlet. I have some physical gas in mind and the flow $\phi(t)$ through any fixed point is determined by the velocity field $X$ . The average length would be associated with an average residence time of a particle in the volume. The geometry of that volume can be as you wish. I'd be interested in cylinders, but any sharp corners can be smoothed out and there are no loops. My routh idea is (and all the following equations are merely intuitive verbalizations of my thoughts) that the integral lines $\phi_s(t)$ parameterized in $t$ are a familay in $s$ (or more parameters in a higher dimensional space) and once the governing equation, say $\dot \phi_s(t)=X(x_{t,s},y_{t,s})$ is given the deviation from on integral curve $\phi_{s_0}(t)$ to the next $\phi_{s_0+\text ds}(t)$ must be determined by the field $X$ . If $L_s=\int\phi_s(t)\text d t$ is the length of the flow line/integral curve with parameter $s$ , then I assume the average length is $\langle L_s\rangle=\frac{\int\int\phi_s(t)\text d t\text d s}{\int\text d s}$ . What I can see, and what agrees with this are curves, which effectly don't depend on $s$ . For example, if we consider a sphere or radius $R$ and a source at one point, a sink at its antipode and the flow lines along the longitude, then $\langle L_s\rangle=\frac{\int\int\phi_s(t)\text d t\text d s}{\int\text d s}=\frac{\int\text d s\int\phi_s(t)\text d t}{\int\text d s}=\int\phi_s(t)\text d t=\pi R$ . The step $\frac{\int\int\phi_s(t)\text d t\text d s}{\int\text d s}=\frac{\int\text d s\int\phi_s(t)\text d t}{\int\text d s}$ should generalize to all curve for which the Lie-derivative along $s$ vanishes.","['vector-analysis', 'integration', 'differential-geometry']"

183183,Quadratic sieve algorithm,"I am stuck with the sieving stage of Quadratic Sieve algorithm. I've read lots of papers to this point but I can't find any guidlines how to choose sieving interval or how sieving is actually done because what I've seen so far is 'we pick a sieving interval' or 'then sieve around this'. This is what I've understood and have done (following Contini's paper): Say, for N = 90283, I compute bound $B = e^{(\frac{1}{2} + o(1))(\sqrt{\ln n \ln \ln n})} = 44$, where I take $o(1) = 0.22$ (just a random guess, I assume). What is the best way to pick good $o(1)$? Then I take $C = \lceil \sqrt{N}\rceil = 301$ Then using Atkin Sieve I get a list of primes $<B$: $\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43\}$ Then by computing Jabobi (Legendre) symbol for each value in the primes list I pick the first quadratic nonresidues to get factor base: $\{2, 3, 7, 17, 23, 29, 37, 41\}$ Then using Tonelli-Shanks algorithm I compute modular roots $\pm t$, where $t$ is a solution to $t^2 \equiv N \mod{p}$ with $p$ a prime from factor base. Then I get two arrays of solutions $sol1 = t - C \mod p$ and $sol2 = - t - C \mod p$, with p's from factor base. and also get one arrays of logarithms for p's $l_p = \ln p$ rounded up to some precision, say two decimal digits. What is a good precision? sol1 $= \{0, 0, 2, 13, 11, 26, 10, 28\}  $ sol2 $= \{0, 1, 5, 14, 8, 10, 17, 26\}  $ $l_p$ $= \{0.69, 1.1, 1.95, 2.83, 3.14, 3.37, 3.61, 3.71\}$ Now as far as I understand I have to initialize 'sieving_array' initialized to 0's, say, to size $ = 60$ elements. Also, how should I choose size of the sieving interval? Is there any formula similar to the bound? Then I have to add values from $l_p$ to sieving array to positions $sol1[j] + i * $factor_base[j] and $sol1[j] + i *$ factor_base[j], where $ 0 \le i \le $ size and $ 0 \le j \le |$factor_base$|$. And for prime $p=2$ add $l_p$ only to positions with sol1. So I get this list (rounded to two decimal digits): $\{1.79, 1.1, 2.64, 1.1, 1.79, 1.95, 1.79, 1.1, 3.83, 3.05, 8.77, 3.14, 3.74, 3.93, 3.52, 1.1, 3.74, 3.61, 1.79, 3.05, 0.69, 1.1, 1.79, 1.95, 1.79, 1.1, 9.72, 1.1, 5.5, 0.0, 6.57, 7.07, 0.69, 3.05, 4.93, 0.0, 1.79, 3.05, 0.69, 4.47, 3.74, 0.0, 1.79, 1.1, 2.64, 1.1, 1.79, 8.39, 4.62, 1.1, 0.69, 3.05, 1.79, 0.0, 10.49, 4.47, 0.69, 4.24, 3.74, 0.0\}$ Now, I have to look through values in the list, and if some of them are at least $\log(2x \sqrt N)$ this means polynomial $g(x)$ can be factored over factor base. My main question is: where does this $x$ come from? I have this list of values, but what do I do with it? If I have an element in this list, for example,  $1.79$ - with what $x$ do I have to compare it? How can I pick a good error term? Is $x$ position of $1.79$?

I can see that metric implies Hausdorff. But I find it impossible to remember all the conditions, namely, those about $X$ (just locally compact or $\sigma$-compact as well?) and those about the measure (surely every measure is positive by definition but requiring it to be Borel and regular seems to be stronger than locally finite).

For the sake of identification, I label the different copies of $D^2$ in $D^2\amalg D^2$ by $a$ and $b$, so from now on I will write $D^2 _a\amalg D^2 _b$.

Using the gluing lemma, there exists a continous function $q:D^2 _a\amalg D^2 _b \rightarrow S^2$ that restricts to $q_a$ and $q_b$ on their domain and agrees on their areas of intersection, which is empty. To see that $q$ is a quotient map note that it is surjective, $D^2 _a\amalg D^2 _b$ is compact and $S^2$ is Hausdorff. This map makes the same identifications as the adjunction, hence by the uniqueness of the quotient they must be homeomorphic. My question is: Have I used the gluing lemma in the correct way?

$$\phi(x) = \int_0 ^x \frac{dt}{\sqrt{1 - t^2}}$$
In order to define it on all of $\mathbb C$, you have to use a branch cut; they glue two copies of $\mathbb C$ together along $[-1,1]$, in the same crossing-over manner as you do when dealing with $\sqrt z$ (at least, I think).  They then claim that this surface $C$ is homeomorphic to a cylinder.  However, I'm having trouble seeing a way to explicitly bend $C$ into a cylinder.  I think I might be missing some intuition on what a complex cylinder looks like. I think I understand why $C$ would be homotopically equivalent (not sure if that's the best term) to a cylinder, because there's one set of loops from going around the branch cut, and if you avoid integrating across the branch cut the other ones are all null-homotopic.  But why glue two copies of $\mathbb C$ together at all if you're going to avoid integration across the branch cut? I also don't quite get they say that $C$ can also be defined as $\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb C ^2 : x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}$; is it just that we can integrate $dx/y$ on $C$, because that differential on $C$ looks like the differential in $\phi$?

183443,Show the existence of a polynomial $f$ such that $T^{-1} = f(T)$ for an invertible linear operator $T.$,Came across this question and have had difficulty approaching it so any help is greatly appreciated. Let $T$ be an invertible linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space $V$ over a field $F$. Prove that there exists a polynomial $f$ over $F$ such that $T^{-1} = f(T)$.,"['linear-algebra', 'polynomials']"
183446,Is this function injective and surjective?,"Let $f(x)=x^2$. Is this function injective and surjective if the function is defined as: $f: \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow [0,\infty)$. $f: \mathbb{C} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$. $f: \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$. $f: \mathbb{R} \cup \{x \in \mathbb{C} : \mathrm{Re}(x) = 0\} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$. $f: \{z=x+iy: i^2=-1, y>0\} \cup \{z=x+iy: i^2=-1, y=0 \text{ and } x \ge 0\} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$.

183460,What does the degree of a matrix minimal polynomial encode?,"Let $\mathsf{F}$ be any field. Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathsf{F},$ whose rank is $r \le n.$ Let $\mu \in \mathsf{F}[x]$ be the minimal polynomial of $A.$ What does $\deg(\mu)$ tell about $A$? Is it related to the rank of $A$? Edit : As noted by Qiaochu, $\deg(\mu)$ is not equal to rank. Are there known cases (or conditions) where $\deg(\mu)$ is actually equal to the rank of $A$?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'polynomials']"
