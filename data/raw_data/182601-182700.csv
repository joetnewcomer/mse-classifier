3334616,Understand a proof of general derivative test with Taylor-Formula.,"I'm trying to understand a proof of the general derivative test which states: Let $f:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function that is differenciable $n$ times, and let $x_0 \in]a,b[$ be point with $f^{\prime}(x_0)=0, f^{\prime\prime}(x_0)=0, ..., f^{(n-1)}(x_0)=0$ but $f^{(n)}(x_0)\neq 0$ . It follows, that: If n is uneven, $f$ does not have a local extremum in $x_0$ . If n is even, $f$ has a local extremum in $x_0$ (maximum if $f^{(n)}(x_0)<0$ and minimum if $f^{(n)}(x_0)<0$ ). $\underline{\text{Proof}}$ (From the Taylor-Formula): $f(x)=f(x_0)+\frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^n+R_n(x,x_0)$ with $\lim_{x\to x_0 }\frac{R_n(x,x_0)}{(x-x_0)^n}=0$ . (Which we can assume to have been proven). It follows, that for sufficiently small differences between $x$ and $x_0$ : $|\frac{R_n(x,x_0)}{(x-x_0)^n}|<\frac{1}{2}|\frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}|$ (This is the first argument I can't understand). That's why $\frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^n+R_n(x,x_0)$ has the same (negative/positive) sign as $\frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^n$ (Now I get completely lost). With uneven n, $\frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^n+R_n(x,x_0)$ changes its sing in $x_0$ , which is why we have no local extremum. With even n, we have $(x-x_0)^n \geq 0$ and therefore $f(x) \geq f(x_0)$ if $f^{(n)}(x_0)>0$ and therefore a minimum, or $f(x) \leq f(x_0)$ if $f^{(n)}(x_0)<0$ and therefore a maximum. Now, I'm really not sure if theres an error in the script I'm reading or if it's just me missing something, but since I can't find that proof anywhere else, I wanted to ask whether anyone has any hints or suggestions on where I could look or a direct explanation.","['derivatives', 'taylor-expansion', 'real-analysis']"

Therefore, $$\int_0^{\dot{x}}\dot{x}d\dot{x}=-\frac km\int_b^x\frac{dx}{x^2}$$ $$\frac12\dot{x}^2=\frac km\left(\frac1x-\frac1b\right)$$ Solving for $\dot x$ , I get $$\dot{x}=\sqrt{\frac{2k}{mb}\left(\frac{b-x}{x}\right)}\tag3$$ $$\frac{dx}{dt}=\sqrt{\frac{2k}{mb}\left(\frac{b-x}{x}\right)}$$ $$dt=\sqrt{\frac{mb}{2k}\left(\frac{x}{b-x}\right)}dx$$ When the particle has reached the source at time $t$ , the distance to the source is $0$ . Thus, $$\int_0^tdt=\sqrt{\frac{mb}{2k}}\int_b^0\left(\frac{x}{b-x}\right)^\frac12dx\tag4$$ Applying partial fraction decomposition, I get $$t=\sqrt{\frac{mb}{2k}}\left(b\int_b^0\frac{dx}{b-x}-\int_b^0dx\right)$$ Intergrating $\int_b^0\frac{dx}{b-x}$ , I get $-\infty$ . I don't know where to go from there. From the solution given to us, Eq. (4) was rewritten as $$\int_0^tdt=\sqrt{\frac{mb^3}{2k}}\int_b^0\left(\frac{\frac xb}{1-\frac xb}\right)^\frac12d\left(\frac xb\right)\tag5$$ Since $x\leq b$ , say $\frac xb=\sin^2\theta$ $$t=\sqrt{\frac{mb^3}{2k}}\int_{-\pi/2}^0\frac{\sin\theta\left(2\sin\theta\cos\theta\right)}{\cos\theta}d\theta\tag6$$ $$t=\sqrt{\frac{2mb^3}{k}}\int_{-\pi/2}^0\sin^2\theta d\theta$$ $$t=\pi\sqrt{\frac{mb^3}{8k}}$$ What I don't understand from the given solution is how could $dx$ be rewritten as $d\left(\frac xb\right)$ and how the limits for Eq. (6) were obtained. I'm also confused as to why trigonometric functions were used and by what reason was $\frac xb=\sin^2\theta$ . From my solution, I know I'm wrong, but I'd like to know if there are other integration methods that could be used for Eq. (6) without using trigonometric functions.","['classical-mechanics', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

$$ Using the definition, compute the directional derivative $\partial_uf(0,0) $ for
  all directions $u=(u_1, u_2)\ne (0, 0)$ . [Hint: Consider the cases $u_2 \ne 0$ and $u_2 = 0$ separately, and use that $\partial _uf(0, 0) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(hu_1,hu_2)−f(0,0)}{h}$ .] Here is my solution: We know that $f(0,0)=0$ , we can rewrite the formula for the directional derivative as $$\partial _uf(0, 0) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(hu_1,hu_2)}{h}$$ We have that in the function, $x$ is denoted by $hu_1$ and $y$ is denoted by $hu_2$ . We now look at each case, in terms of the original function. Case 1: We have that $u_2=0$ , $$\lim_{h\to0}\left(\frac{((hu_1)^2(h\cdot 0))}{h ((hu_1)^4+(hu_2)^2)}\right) = 0$$ Case 2: We have that $u_2\ne0$ , $$\lim_{h\to0}\left(\frac{((hu_1)^2(hu_2))}{h ((hu_1)^4+(hu_2)^2)}\right) = \lim_{h\to0}\left(\frac{h^3(u_1^2u_2)}{h^3(h^2 u_1^4+u_2^2)}\right) = \lim_{h\to0}\left(\frac{u_1^2u_2}{h^2 u_1^4+u_2^2}\right)$$ Solving as $h\to0$ we see that the $\lim\to \frac{u_1^2}{u_2}$ . Therefore the directional derivatives for $\partial_uf(0,0)$ in the direction $u=(u_1,0)$ is $0$ . The directional derivative in the direction $u=(u_1,u_2)$ is $\frac{u_1^2}{u_2}$ .

The point is we have no business using the notation $\lim_{z\to a}f(z)$ until after we've proved uniqueness, because the notation, especially if read "" the limit..."" presupposes uniqueness. To do it right we should instead  define "" $f(z)\to w$ as $z\to a$ "", prove uniqueness, and then introduce the notation $\lim$ .

3335146,"Stalk of structure sheaf is a local ring, where $\mathcal{O}_X$ is the sheaf of real valued functions","I come across this proof: Suppose $X$ is a manifold and let $\mathcal{O}_X$ be the sheaf of real valued functions. We check that $(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ forms a locally ringed space. Given $x \in X$ , let $m_{X,x}$ be the ideal of $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ consisting of germs of functions taking the value $0$ at $x$ . This is clearly an ideal, and the quotient $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}/m_{X,x}$ is certainly contained in $\mathbb{R}$ . Since $X$ is a manifold, the quotient is nonzero, so $m_{X,x}$ is indeed a maximal ideal of $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ . To check that it is the
unique maximal ideal, it suffices to check that any $f\in \mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ not contained in $m_{X,x}$ is a unit in $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ . For such an $f$ , $f(x)$ is some nonzero real number, so we can find an open subinterval $I\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)$ belongs to $I$ but $0$ does not. Represent $f$ by a continuous function on some open subset $U$ of $X$ containing $x$ , which I’ll also call $f$ . The key point is that by continuity, $V = f^{-1}(I)$ is again an open subset of $X$ containing $x$ , and $f$ takes nonzero values everywhere on $V$ . Hence there exists a multiplicative inverse $g$ of f on $V$ , which is necessarily continuous. I am confused why quotient $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}/m_{X,x}$ is certainly contained in $\mathbb{R}$ ? Also, I can't see why since $X$ is a manifold, the quotient is nonzero, $m_{X,x}$ is indeed a maximal ideal of $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ ? How is that related to the manifold and why the quotient is nonzero implies that the the ideal is maximal?","['algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-theory']"
3335163,"Showing that $X= \left\{ u \in C\bigl([0, \infty);E\bigr) \mid \sup_{t \geq 0} e^{-kt} \|u(t)\| < \infty \right\}$ is Banach.","I am working on my degree thesis studying the Hille Yosida Theorem and as a motive to it, I want to present the Cauchy-Lipschitz-Picard Theorem. Haim Brezis highlights the path for a very interesting proof. A part of it, relies on showing that the space $$X= \left\lbrace u \in C\bigl([0, \infty);E\bigr) \mid \sup_{t \geq 0} e^{-kt} \|u(t)\| < \infty \right\rbrace$$ equipped with the norm $\|\cdot\|_X = \sup_{t \geq 0} e^{-kt} \|\cdot\|$ is a Banach space. Note that $E$ is a Banach space too. I've made an attempt but I am not sure if it's properly stated. Let $u_n \in X$ be a Cauchy sequence. Then, $\forall \varepsilon >0$ there exists $n_0 \in \mathbb N$ such that : $$\|u_n-u_m\|_X < \varepsilon, \quad \forall n,m \geq n_0$$ $$\Leftrightarrow$$ $$\sup_{t \geq 0}e^{-kt}\|u_n(t)-u_m(t)\| < \varepsilon$$ Essentialy, I would like to show that $\|u_n(t)-u_m(t)\|< \varepsilon$ and then by letting $m\to \infty$ I get what I need. But, that exponential is causing issues since it's decreasing $t$ grows. I thought about fixing a $t_0 \in [0,\infty)$ which would then mean $$\sup_{t\geq 0} e^{-kt_0} \|u_n(t_0)-u_m(t_0)\| < \varepsilon$$ $$\implies$$ $$\|u_n(t_0)-u_m(t_0)\| < \varepsilon'$$ where $\varepsilon' = \varepsilon e^{kt_0}$ . That yields that $\{u_n(t_0)\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X$ for any $t_0$ fixed. Letting $m \to \infty$ now, leads us to $\|u_n(t_0) - u(t_0)\| < \varepsilon'$ . Now, since $u \in C\left( [0,\infty);E\right)$ then of course $u$ is continuous at every point $t \in [0,\infty)$ then it should be $\|u(t) - u(t_0)\| < \varepsilon''$ for every such $t_0$ fixed with $\varepsilon''$ depending on $t_0$ , thus generalising the result. I am afraid that my elaboration, especially at the end, isn't totally correct. Since this is a part of my Thesis, I am trying to find a perfect way around it. I hope some of my intuition is of use or even makes sense. I would highly appreciate any help or tips.","['cauchy-sequences', 'banach-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
3335175,A difficult logarithmic integral and its relation to alternating Euler Sums,"The following integral was recently brought up in this thread on AoPS. $$\mathfrak I~=~\int_0^1\frac{\log(1-x)\log^2(x)\log(1+x)}{1+x}\mathrm dx\tag1$$ It is reasonable to ask for a closed-form of $(1)$ as similar (namely taking $x$ instead of $1+x$ as numerator) have known closed-form representations. The crux here appears to be the inherent alternating structure induced by both, the $1+x$ within the numerator as well as in the logarithm. Let me elaborate on this by converting this integral into a sum. Using the generating function for the harmonic numbers combined with various well-known results we may obtain $$\small\begin{align*}
\int_0^1\frac{\log(1-x)\log^2(x)\log(1+x)}{1+x}\mathrm dx&=\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^{n+1}H_n\int_0^1x^n\log^2(x)\log(1-x)\mathrm dx\\
&=\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^{n+1}H_n\left(\frac{\mathrm d^2}{\mathrm dn^2}\left[-\frac{\psi^{(0)}(n+2)+\gamma}{n+1}\right]\right)\\
&=\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^nH_n\left(2\frac{\psi^{(0)}(n+2)+\gamma}{(n+1)^3}-2\frac{\psi^{(1)}(n+2)}{(n+1)^2}+\frac{\psi^{(2)}(n+2)}{n+1}\right)\\
&=2\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^nH_n\left(\frac{H_{n+1}}{(n+1)^3}-\frac{\zeta(2)-H_{n+1}^{(2)}}{(n+1)^2}-\frac{\zeta(3)-H_{n+1}^{(3)}}{n+1}\right)\\
&=2\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^{n+1}\left(H_n-\frac1n\right)\left(\frac{H_n}{n^3}-\frac{\zeta(2)-H_n^{(2)}}{n^2}-\frac{\zeta(3)-H_n^{(3)}}n\right)
\end{align*}$$ So, basically we are left with alternating sums of the form $\sum\limits_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n a_n$ where $a_n$ is a coefficient up to a weight of $5$ (by the usual definition of weight). Expanding the parenthesis (!) we are left with the following (ordered by weight and complexity) $$\small\frac12\mathfrak I-\frac54\zeta(2)\zeta(3)=\zeta(3)\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n}n+\zeta(2)\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n}{n^2}+\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n}{n^4}-\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n^2}{n^3}\\\small-\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_nH_n^{(2)}}{n^2}-\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_nH_n^{(3)}}n+\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n^{(2)}}{n^3}+\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n^{(3)}}{n^2}$$ I am not entirely sure about splitting the sum as the first series is only conditionally convergent instead of absolutely convergent as the rest. However, the first two series fall rather easily by using the generating function again and integrating once and twice, respectively, giving us the following results. \begin{align*}
\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n}n&=\frac12\zeta(2)-\frac12\log^2(2)\tag2\\
\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n}{n^2}&=-\frac58\zeta(3)\tag3
\end{align*} While this approach essentially works for the third sum too the calculations are nearly impossible by hand and WolframAlpha already returns this monstrosity for a denominator of only $n^3$ . But, let's put this aside as ""in-fact-doable"" (even though the result may not admit a closed-form in terms of known constants alone). For the remaining series - except the sixth - I have a vague idea. Making use of more generating functions, namely the following, one can get these sums. Anyway, I do not know if the so-occurring integrals are easier than $(1)$ or in the worst case not even harder. $$\small\begin{align*}
\sum_{n\geqslant1}H_n^{(p)}x^n&=\frac{\operatorname{Li}_p(x)}{1-x}\tag4\\
\sum_{n\geqslant1}H_n^2x^n&=\frac1{1-x}(\log^2(1-x)+\operatorname{Li}_2(x))\tag5\\
\sum_{n\geqslant1}H_nH_n^{(2)}x^n&=\frac1{1-x}\left(\frac12\log(x)\log^2(1-x)+\operatorname{Li}_3(x)+\operatorname{Li}_3(1-x)\tag6\\
-\zeta(2)\log(1-x)-\zeta(3)\right)
\end{align*}$$ However, there is no similar formula I am aware of to generate $H_nH_n^{(3)}$ , so this part remains unknown. It might be possible to shorten things up by considering linear combinations of some of the occuring series but honestly speaking I am not longer able to keep track of all what is going on. I have a few questions, but I would be glad for answers referring to only one of them too. $\textbf{Q. 1}$ What is the current state of art concerning regular alternating Euler Sums? Is there a similar formula available as there is for non-alternating (I recall to have seen a post dealing with this issue on MSE, but I am unable to find it again)? $\textbf{Q. 2}$ Are the given generating functions $(4)$ - $(6)$ of any use? To put it in other words: are the occurring integrals easier to handle than $(1)$ (e.g. avoiding alternating sums at all)? I played a little bit with them but soon I ran into problems concerning convergence and I was not able to resolve them. $\textbf{Q. 3}$ How can we deal with $H_nH_n^{(3)}$ at all? Is there a generating function known for solely this coefficient or is it necessary to use harmonic series containing this coefficient among other (actually I know some of them)? $\textbf{Q. 4}$ Is there a closed-form for $(1)$ , possibly including non-expressible constants immanent to the field of polylogarithms? Thanks in advance! EDIT: As pointed out by user97357329 the series having the $H_nH_n^{(3)}$ can be found in Cornel I.

I was curious about knowing what happens if I try to decompose an improper fraction, So I tried to do one: $\frac{x^2 - 4}{(x + 5)(x - 3)}$ I got the equation: $\frac{(Ax + B)(x - 3) + (Cx + D)(x + 5)}{(x + 5)(x - 3)} = \frac{x^2 - 4}{(x + 5)(x - 3)}$ . I have 4 unknowns: A, B, C and D. $\therefore (Ax + B)(x - 3) + (Cx + D)(x + 5) = x^2 - 4$ After expanding and regrouping the coefficients: $(A + C) x^2 + (-3A + B + 5C + D)x + (-3B + 5D) = x^2 - 4$ Here the coefficient of the term $x^2$ is 1 therefore: $(A+C) = 1$ similarly: $(-3A + B + 5C + D) = 0$ $(-3B + 5D) = -4$ I still have to get one more equation to be able to solve this system so I substituted 1 for x and I got this equation: $-2A - 2B + 6C + 6D = -3$ After getting four equations I used this site to solve the system of equations. Unfortinetly I got no soultion. Tried another site and also the same result. I've tried to use different values for x and got another equaitons like: for x =  2 : $-2A - B + 24C + 7D$ for x = -1 : $4A - 4B - 4C + 4D$ for x = -2 : $10A - 5B - 6C + 3D$ But also that didn't work. Always the system of equations have an infinite solutions. After tring to figure out why this is happening, I've managed to prove logically that this equation: $(Ax + B)(x - 3) + (Cx + D)(x + 5) = x^2 - 4$ has an infinite solutions and my approach was as follows: After doing polynomial long division and decomposing the fraction using the traditional way, the result should be: $\frac{5}{8(x - 3)} - \frac{21}{8(x - 5)} + 1$ Now I can add the last term (the one) to the first term and get the follows: $\frac{8x-19}{8(x-3)} - \frac{21}{8(x+5)}$ From that solution I can see that $A = 0, B = \frac{-21}{8}, C = 1, D = \frac{-19}{8}$ . After all these are just the coefficients of the terms. and this solution worked fine. Alternatively I can add the one to the second term instead and get: $\frac{5}{8(x-3)} + \frac{8x + 19}{8(x+5)}$ Now $A = 1, B = \frac{19}{8}, C = 0, D = \frac{5}{8}$ Generally, after adding the one to any of the terms, I can add any number to one of the terms and add its negative to the other term and the equation will remain the same, But the value of the 4 constants (A, B, C, and D) will change. And from that I got convinced that there are an infinite solutions to this equation. But Algebraically? I'm not able to prove that it has an infinite solutions algebraically. And my questions is how to prove algebraically that this equation has an infinite solutions?

3335481,Synthetic measure theory with quasi-borel spaces,"I'm trying to understand this paper ""A Convenient Category for Higher-Order Probability Theory"" which is a new way to formulate probability theory by making random variables primary and deriving the rest (as far as I can tell). They say a random variable is a quasi-Borel space, which consists of a sample space $\Omega$ , which can be interpreted as a set of random seeds, a set of outcomes $X$ , and a subset of functions $M\subseteq[\Omega\rightarrow X]$ . This structure has to satisfy a few constraints. They say in practice $\Omega$ should be set to be the reals $\mathbb{R}$ since it is isomorphic to most structures that we care about in probability theory, so more specifically $M\subseteq[\mathbb{R}\rightarrow X]$ . The functions $M$ are the random elements of the space. I'm trying to see how this works exactly. Let's say I want to create a boolean random variable with $X={heads,tails}$ an underlying probability for each outcome of $P(heads)=0.25,P(tails)=0.75$ , I think this means my quasi-Borel space would need to essentially partition $\mathbb{R}$ into two where one partition would represent random seeds that map onto ""heads"" and the other set would map onto ""tails"" such that the size (measure) of the heads subset of random seeds would be 0.25 proportionally.

3335490,Restriction and extension of scalars for cohomology groups on a projective scheme,"I am going over the proof of Serre duality for a coherent sheaf on a projective k-scheme. First, I am trying to understand it for the case where $X = \mathbb{P}_{k}^{n}$ . I am following Hartshorne III Proposition 7.1. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a coherent sheaf on $X$ and let $\omega_{X} = \mathcal{O}(-n-1) $ . I want to exhibit an isomorphism, $$
\text{Hom}(\mathcal{F}, \omega_{X}) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} H^{n}(X, \mathcal{F})^{*}
$$ where $*$ denotes the vector space dual. Fixing a particular isomorphism $H^{n}(X,\omega_{X}) \simeq k$ , this is equivalent to finding an isomorphism, $$
\text{Hom}(\mathcal{F}, \omega_{X}) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} H^{n}(X, \mathcal{F})^{*}.
$$ The problem is that it is not completely clear to me what these $\text{Hom}$ sets even are. Indeed we can view the cohomology object $H^{n}(X, \mathcal{F})$ in three ways: An abelian group (module over $\mathbb{Z}$ ), a $\Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_{X})$ -module, or a $k$ -vector space. Now in my particular case, $\Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) = k$ , but for a general projective scheme my understanding is that this could be a finite extension of $k$ ? In any case, if I proceed as follows, $$
\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_{X}}(\mathcal{F}, \omega_{X}) \longrightarrow \text{Hom}(H^{n}(X, \mathcal{F}), H^{n}(X, \omega_{X}))
$$ where a morphism of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ -modules induces a morphism of cohomology groups . So the Hom set on the right is of abelian groups. But we want it as a morphism of vector spaces. But there is no reason to think the extension of scalars $\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow k$ will be fully faithful. This problem is worse when we are dealing with a projective scheme, since we also have modules over $\Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_{X})$ . So my question can really be summarised as: What is the correct subscript on each of the Hom sets involved here? Hartshorne just seems to gloss over all this.","['sheaf-cohomology', 'coherent-sheaves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'adjoint-functors', 'schemes']"

Of course, if $r\in \mathbb{Z}$ then $\mathscr{P}_r $ is finite. We can prove, for example, that for all non-constant $f\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ the set $\{p \text{ prime}:\ (\exists n\in\mathbb{N})(p\mid f(n))\}$ is infinite (refer to this question ). Actually this works somewhat more generally. Proposition. Let $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ s.t. $(\forall k\in \mathbb{N})(\exists n\in\mathbb{N})(n>\log_2 (\max_{x\leq n}f(x))^k)$ and $f$ is uniformly quasi-injective, that is $(\exists M)(\forall n\in\Bbb{N})(|f^{-1}(n)|\leq M)$ . Then $\mathscr{P}=\{p \text{ prime}:\ (\exists n\in\mathbb{N})(p\mid f(n))\}$ is infinite. Proof. Let $f$ be such a function, and let's assume, for simplicity, that $f$ is injective.  Let's suppose by contradiction that $\mathscr{P}=\{p_1,...,p_k\}$ .
  Let $F_n=\{f(x):\ x\leq n\}$ . Let's define $\phi :F_n\rightarrow S$ where S is the set of strings of natural numbers of length k such that every entry is less or equal to $\log_2 (\max_{x\leq n}f(x))$ , and $x=p_1^{\phi(x)_1}...p_k^{\phi(x)_k}$ . By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and the fact that $2$ is the smallest positive prime, we conclude that $\phi$ is injective and well-defined. So $\phi \circ f$ is also injective.
  Thus, $n\leq|S|\leq \log_2 (\max_{x\leq n}f(x))^k$ , a contradiction. However, we are not in the hypothesis of the above proposition.
The natural conjecture would  be that Conjecture. $\mathscr{P}_r$ is infinite $\iff r\in \mathbb{R}\setminus \mathbb{Z}$ There is some empirical evidence that supports this conjecture. Indeed, by implementing the following code on Octave we can check what the elements of $\mathscr{P}_{r,m}=\{p\in\mathbb{P}:\ (\exists n\in\mathbb{N})(n\leq m)(p\mid\lfloor{r^n} \rfloor)\}$ are. function p=weirdcount(r,m)
p=[];
v=[];
for k=1:m
  p=union(p,factor(floor((r)^k)));
  v(k)=length(p);
  endfor
plot(v,'*');
  end The function also plots $|\mathscr{P}_{r,k}|$ against $k$ .
The following are four examples of graphs with $r=1.5,e,\pi, \sqrt{2}$ and $m=30,30,30,60$ These graphs seem to suggest that Conjecture. $r\in \mathbb{R}\setminus \mathbb{Z} \iff |\mathscr{P}_{r,k}|=\mathcal{O}(k)$ A preliminary result toward the proof of these conjectures may be that Proposition. Let $r\in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}, n\geq 2$ , such that $\lfloor {r^a} \rfloor$ is a power of $n$ for all $a\in \mathbb{N}$ . Then $r$ is a power of $n$ . Proof. Lengthy but easy. Moreover, we can prove that Proposition. $2\in \mathscr{P}_r$ almost always for $|r|>1$ Proof. Let $\mathscr{R}_p=\{r\in \mathbb{R}:p\in \mathscr{P}_r\}$ . We have to prove that $\forall 1<a<b~~b-a=|\mathscr{R}_2\cap (a,b)|$ . 
  If we prove that, given an interval $(a,b)$ like above $\forall \epsilon >0$ , there is always a plurinterval (a finite union of intervals) $I\subset \mathscr{R}_2\cap (a,b)$ such that $|I|\geq \frac{b-a}{2}-\epsilon$ we are finished.
  That, however, is implied by $\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{a}^{b}(-1)^{\lfloor x^n\rfloor}dx=0$ .
  We observe that (with a slight abuse of notation) $$\int_{a}^{b}(-1)^{\lfloor x^n\rfloor}dx \sim \sum_{k=a^n}^{b^n}(-1)^n((k+1)^{\frac{1}{n}}-k^{\frac{1}{n}})$$ $$\sim \sum_{k=\frac{a^n}{2}}^{\frac{b^n}{2}}2(2k+1)^{\frac{1}{n}}-(2k)^{\frac{1}{n}}-(2k+2)^{\frac{1}{n}}$$ By applying Lagrange's Theorem twice, we obtain $$0<2(2k+1)^{\frac{1}{n}}-(2k)^{\frac{1}{n}}-(2k+2)^{\frac{1}{n}}<2(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n^2})(2k+2)^{\frac{1}{n}-2}$$ So the last summation is asymptotically limited from above by $$h(n)\int_{\frac{a^n}{2}+1}^{\frac{b^n}{2}+1}x^{\frac{1}{n}-2}dx$$ (where $h(n)$ is a function s.t. $\lim_{n\to\infty}h(n)=0$ ) which equals. setting $m=\frac{1}{n}-1$ $$h(\frac{1}{m+1})\frac{(\frac{b^{\frac{1}{m+1}}}{2}+1)^m-(\frac{a^{\frac{1}{m+1}}}{2}+1)^m}{m}$$ which, as $n$ goes to $\infty$ (and so $m$ goes to $-1$ ), has limit equal to $0$ .

Of course, if we were able to prove that $\forall p\in\mathbb{P}~p\in \mathscr{P}_r$ almost always for $|r|>1$ , this would imply a nice corollary, ie, that $\mathscr{P}_r$ is almost always infinite, for |r|>1.","['number-theory', 'real-analysis']"

3336051,Divisors on cone variety not passing through cone point are principal,"We work over an algebraically closed field $k$ , and we use ""divisor"" to mean Weil divisor. Let $V$ be a projective algebraic variety of dimension $\geq 1$ which is nonsingular in codimension one. Let $X$ be the affine cone over $V$ (the affine variety whose coordinate ring is the homogeneous coordinate ring of $V$ ). Claim: Any divisor on $X$ not passing through the cone point must be principal. This question comes from Exercise II.6.3(d) in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry . I can see that the above claim is equivalent to injectivity of the map of divisor class groups $\mathrm{Cl}~X\rightarrow\mathrm{Cl}(\mathrm{Spec}~\mathcal{O}_P)$ where $\mathcal{O}_P$ is the local ring of the cone point $P$ . (The exercise in Hartshorne asks us to show $\mathrm{Cl}~X\rightarrow\mathrm{Cl}(\mathrm{Spec}~\mathcal{O}_P)$ is an isomorphism; surjectivity is clear.) The corresponding algebraic statement is the following: if $A=k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]/I$ is the homogeneous coordinate ring of $V$ , any height one prime $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq A$ not contained in $\mathfrak{m}=(x_0,\ldots,x_n)$ is principal. Here, $\mathfrak{m}$ corresponds to the cone point. Note that such a prime $\mathfrak{p}$ is necessarily non-homogeneous. How should one see this?

3336135,Successive records in mathematical sequences: surprising result,"I was looking at sequences $x_n=\{n\alpha\}$ with $n=1,2,\cdots$ and $\alpha\in [0, 1]$ an irrational number. Such sequences are known to be equidistributed, so they get arbitrarily close to any number $x\in[0, 1]$ , time and over. The brackets represent the fractional part function. There is a subsequence $t_n$ of indices such that $x_{t_n}$ is the $n$ -th record: it corresponds to the largest value observed sequentially, that is, $t_n$ is the smallest index such that $x_{t_n} > x_{t_{n-1}}$ . Here $x_{t_{n-1}}$ is the previous record. In short, $t_n$ is the arrival time (index) of the $n$ -th record. The sequence $t_n$ is strictly increasing and never ends. For $\alpha = \sqrt{2}/2$ (our focus in this question) we have: I did not expect to see such a pattern. What's more, $$t_{2n+1} = \Big\lfloor \frac{\sqrt{3+2\sqrt{2}}}{2}\Big(3+2\sqrt{2}\Big)^{n}\Big\rfloor,$$ $$t_{2n} = \Big\lfloor \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\Big(3+2\sqrt{2}\Big)^{n}\Big\rfloor.$$ Let us denote as $u_{2n+1}$ and $u_{2n}$ the expression inside the brackets $\lfloor \rfloor$ in the above twin formulas for $t_{2n+1}$ and $t_{2n}$ . We have: $u_n - t_n \rightarrow 0$ (whether $n$ is even or odd) and the convergence is very fast. Anyone interested in proving this result? It is based solely on empirical evidence. A similar result seems achievable for $\sqrt{3}/2$ . Now for non-algebraic number, the kind of periodicity observed here is lost, but we get very intriguing results, with more mysterious patterns. Below is the data for $\alpha = \log_2 3$ : The nice pattern seems to end abruptly beyond the data being displayed here, and indeed the next maximum take places at index 190,537 and 10,781,274. I could not find the next one, maybe due to machine precision or due to a massive gap. I am very interested in some asymptotic value for $t_n$ especially when $\alpha$ is not an algebraic number. I am surprised that the arrival times $t_n$ of the successive records behave so much differently than if the underlying sequence $\{n \alpha\}$ was truly random (I studied the random case here .) Update If $\alpha = \pi$ , we get the following: $(t_5,t_6,t_7,t_8,t_9)=$ $(7,113,$ $33215,99532,364913)$ . Define $\Delta t_n = t_n-t_{n-1}$ . Then $(\Delta t_6, \Delta t_7,\Delta t_8,\Delta t_9)=(106, 33102, 66317,265381)$ . Now look at $\pi$ convergents (skipping the first ones): $22/7$ , $333/106$ , $355/113$ , $103993/33102$ , $104348/33215$ , $208341/66317$ , $312689/99532$ , $833719/265381$ , $11464108/364913$ . The denominators in odd positions corresponds to the successive $\Delta t_n$ . The denominators in even positions corresponds to the successive $t_n$ . This works for all irrationals (need to check) and it gives an alternate way to compute the convergents. For instance, take $t_8=99532$ . Then the fraction $m/99532$ closest to $\pi$ , with $m$ an integer, is a convergent. Using this fact, you can easily obtain $m=312689$ . Background My interest in this problem stems from the following. The sequence $z_n =2^{\{-n \log_2 3\}}$ consists of rational numbers, all having a period (in their binary expansion) equal to $2\cdot 3^{n-1}$ . All have exactly 50% zeros, 50% ones in their binary expansion. The median, which is one of them if $n$ is odd, tends to $\sqrt{2}/2$ . Does it mean that $\sqrt{2}/2$ has 50% zeros too? No, you need to remove ""extreme"" numbers from this sequence. For instance all numbers $z_{t_n}$ with $t_n$ listed in the above table for $\alpha = \log_2 3$ . What other numbers should I remove? I don't know yet, but this is a starting point. It depends on how fast/slowly the ""extreme"" numbers are building up as $n$ increases. See discussion on this topic here , look at the section entitled A different approach . Potential machine learning applications of continued fractions We found a connection between records (maxima) of some sequences, and continued fractions. Doing the same thing with minima will complete this analysis. Extreme events in business or economics settings are typically modeled using statistical distributions (Gumbel and so on), which did not live to their expectations in many instances. The theory outlined here provides an alternative, with each number $\alpha$ serving as a particular model, with its own features distinct from all other numbers. In particular, the numerators and denominators of convergents of $\alpha$ can be used to model the arrival times of extreme events. While the records here are getting closer either to zero or to one, using a logarithm transformation allows you to model phenomena that are not bounded. Note that the sequence $\{n\alpha\}$ has strong, long-range auto-correlations that are well studied (see appendix B in this book ). One could try with the sequence $\{b^n \alpha\}$ instead ( $b > 1$ ) as it exhibits exponentially decaying auto-correlations, also studied in the same book. Even cross-correlations between two sequences have been studied (say $\{\alpha n\}$ and $\{\beta n\}$ ), allowing you to model multivariate time series and their cross-dependencies. Other sequences are also being investigated.","['number-theory', 'irrational-numbers', 'sequences-and-series', 'continued-fractions', 'probability-theory']"
3336162,Netflix profile and user probability.,"So we have 4 netflix profiles in a single subscription, say 5 People have access to the account such that 1 of the person is actually piggybacking on other people's profiles. Assuming that a single show lasts about 2 hours and nobody watches more than 3 shows a day at a maximum. Also everyone sleeps at the same time for 8 hours a day. What is the probability that all 5 users will log into their account so that the timing of people watching shows clash. how does this probability be affected as more people get access to the account. Edit : I am pursuing my undergrad in Microbiology. With almost no clue of mathematics and applied mathematics whatsoever.  These days I've been inclined to learn a little more about math because of my master's preparation. 
This question came to me when me and some of my friends pooled in money to get the premium Netflix account. My thoughts on this problem: initially I thought that 24-8 = 16 so there are just 8 timings for one person to open the account (assuming they watch one show) so if we multipled it (1/8)^4 would be the probability. Now I know that this answer is wrong because 
Firstly it only accounts timing in segments. It takes log in at 2 pm and then straight up at 4 pm while completely ignoring 2:01 log in. Secondly it only takes into account 1 person watching 1 show. Lastly that is outrageously low probability for the number of times the timings clash for us  irl :p",['probability']

This question looks like Mihăilescu's theorem, which proves that the only solution to $3^x-2^y=1$ is $x=2$ and $y=3$ , but of course we have the extra multiplicand m in there, and what I want to prove is in fact that there are (or aren't) solutions for all positive odd numbers m . I've been looking into an unrelated problem and it would be helpful to prove or disprove this but I really don't know where to start. My inclination is to say that there must be solutions $x,y$ for all $m$ , because with an infinite number of powers of two and an infinite number of powers of three to work with there will always be a pair somewhere that will have the necessary relation to one another. But I'm lost as to how to translate that into proof, if indeed the statement is even true. Any help - even partial help - would be greatly appreciated.

For (3), the Lagrangian density has no wedge products, yet the same terms are used $\sqrt{-|g|}$ and the differential terms. Are they all equal in some subtle way, or if they are different, how do they connect to one another?

(e_0\wedge ... e_n)dx^1 ... dx^n \to \sqrt{|g|}dx^1...dx^n

\sqrt{|g|} (\gamma_0 \wedge ... \wedge \gamma_n)=I\sqrt{|g|}
$$ Thus, the connection is $I$ , as follows: $$
\int_M (e_1 \wedge ... \wedge e_n) dx^1...dx^n = I \int_M \sqrt{|g|} dx^1...dx^n
$$ or even absorbing $I$ into the square root: $$
\int_M (e_1 \wedge ... \wedge e_n) dx^1...dx^n =    \int_M \sqrt{-|g|} dx^1...dx^n

3336519,Confusing Limit With Logarithms,"So I am probably below the knowledge level of the average mathematician here- computer science student here studying algorithms at the graduate level and came across this peculiarity that I would appreciate some context to. Hopefully this is a softball question for you folks. Why is $$\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{(\ln (\ln x))^{(\ln (\ln (x) )}}{x^2} = 0$$ But, $$\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{(\ln (\ln x))^{\ln (x) }}{x^2} = \infty$$ I have tried to apply L'Hopital's rule to this case which may be correct, but gives some annoying derivatives to decipher. Would appreciate a bit more reasoning as to why $x^2$ dominates the first case but not the second. To my intuition, since $ln(ln(x))$ approaches infinity similar to $ln(x)$ (albeit incredibly slowly), $x^2$ should be dominated in both cases. Wolfram seems to disagree.","['limits', 'logarithms']"
3336562,"Axler's Measure Theory $|[a,b]| = b-a$ proof?","In Chapter 2 of Axler's Measure Theory book, found here: http://measure.axler.net/MIRA.pdf , he defines ""length of an open set"", ""outer measure"" (denoted $|\cdot |$ ), and proves some basic theorems about them, mainly that In $\mathbb R$ , if $A\subset B$ , then $|A|\leq |B|$ ; and In $\mathbb R$ for a sequence of sets $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ the following holds: $$\left|\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^\infty A_k\right|\leq\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty |A_k|$$ He then goes into a huge spiel about the Heine-Borel Theorem and more, for the sake of proving that $|[a,b]| = b-a$ . Now my question is this: why couldn't he prove that using the above two theorems like so? $$(a,b)\subset [a,b] \implies b-a=|(b,a)|\leq |[a,b]|$$ and $$[a,b]\subset (a-\epsilon, b+\epsilon) \implies |[a,b]|\leq (b-a+2\epsilon) \to (b-a)$$ (I'm not sure where the second theorem comes in; he seems to have used it to prove $|[a,b]|\leq b-a$ though).

3336592,How to generalize this version of Tarski’s Fixed Point Theorem?,"I could prove the following result from my Real Analysis course: Let $f:[0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]$ be an increasing mapping. Then it has a fixed point. I understand that this is a very baby version of Tarski’s Fixed Point Theorem. Now, I wish to generalize this a little bit and get the following: Let $f:[0,1]^n \rightarrow [0,1]^n$ in which $f$ is increasing in the sense that if $y \geq x$ coordinate wise then $f(y) \geq f(x)$ coordinate wise. Then, f has a fixed point. From my point of view, we could just pick a point $x_0 \in [0,1]^n$ , fix all coordinates but one and apply the above lemma to that coordinate. Then, when the first coordinate of the fixed point is found, we do the same for the second and so on. However, I am not sure this route would be successful and even if it is, I can’t write the extension formally. Any ideas?

3336596,"If $\pi:X\to Y$ is a surjective local homeomorphism and $X$ is a smooth manifold, then does $Y$ become a smooth manifold?","Update: Thanks to some comments below, I realized that the properties of $M$ and $\Gamma$ are also important, taking which into consideration I have obtained a new similar proposition below. I'll provide my proof as an answer. Welcome to point out any mistake or comment on other aspects! Some notations: Let $M$ be a manifold with a certain structure. Let $G$ be a group of transformations that preserves this structure (for example, if $M$ is a topological manifold, then $G$ consists of homeomorphisms; if $M$ is a smooth manifold, then $G$ consists of diffeomorphisms; if $M$ has a metric, then $G$ consists of isometries). $G$ is said to act on $M$ properly discontinuously if for all $x\in M$ there is a neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that $\{g\in G:gU_x\cap U_x=\varnothing\}$ is a finite set. Proposition: Let $M$ be as above. Let $G$ be a group of transformations that preserves the structure of $G$ . If $G$ acts properly discontinuous and without fixed points, then the natural projection ( $\bar x\in M/G$ is the equivalence class of $x\in M$ ) $$\pi:M\to M/G$$ $$x\mapsto\bar x$$ is a local homeomorphism. In particular, for every $x\in M$ , there is a coordinate neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that $\pi|_{U_x}:U_x\to\pi(U_x)$ is a homeomorphism. Moreover, if we denote the corresponding chart of $U_x$ by $\varphi_x$ , then the maps $\varphi_x(\pi|_{U_x})^{-1}$ constitute an atlas of $M/G$ that assigns to $M/G$ the same type of structure of $M$ . Original question: I am trying to determine whether this proposition is true. Let $X$ be an $n$ -dimensional smooth manifold, $Y$ a topological space and $\pi:X\to Y$ a local homeomorphism. Then we can assign to $Y$ a differentiable structure such that $\pi$ is a smooth map. My idea is to define an atlas on $Y$ as follows. For any $y\in Y$ , take any $x\in \pi^{-1}(y)$ . Since $\pi$ is a local homeomorphism, there is a neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that $$\pi|_{U_x}:U_x\to\pi(U_x)$$ is a homeomorphism. By taking an intersection if necessary, we can assume $U_x$ is a coordinate chart $\varphi_x$ . Apparently $\pi(U_x)$ is a neighborhood of $y$ , hence we can define a chart near $y$ as $$\psi_y=\varphi_x(\pi|_{U_x})^{-1}$$ The problem is, I cannot verify that transition maps are smooth. Suppose for the same $y$ , we have two different $x_1,x_2\in \pi^{-1}(y)$ . Then by the reasoning above there are two coordinate neighborhoods $U_{x_1},U_{x_2}$ . By the Hausdorff property of $X$ we may assume $U_{x_1}$ and $U_{x_2}$ are disjoint, then there is at least one transition map of the form $$\varphi_{x_1}(\pi|_{U_{x_1}})^{-1}(\pi|_{U_{x_2}})\varphi_{x_2}^{-1}$$ However, since $U_{x_1}$ and $U_{x_2}$ are disjoint, the middle part $(\pi|_{U_{x_1}})^{-1}(\pi|_{U_{x_2}})$ does not cancel, and I cannot conclude that the transition map is smooth. Questions: (1) Can I fix this by removing some charts of the form above? (2) If not, can I impose some more conditions to make the proposition true? In particular, I want to apply this to quotients like $\mathbb C/M$ and $\mathbb H/\Gamma$ and conclude that they are Riemann surfaces. Is there anything special about $\mathbb C$ , $\mathbb H$ , $M$ or $\Gamma$ that I fail to include in the assumptions of the suggested proposition? Some clarification: $M$ is a lattice of rank 2 in $\mathbb C$ and $\Gamma$ is a discrete subgroup of $PSL(2,\mathbb R)$ . What I am interested in is, are the properties of $M$ and $\Gamma$ necessary for $\mathbb C/M$ and $\mathbb H/\Gamma$ to become a Riemann surface? In a textbook, the argument is made by showing the natural projection is a local homeomorphism, so I was wondering whether a (surjective) local homeomorphism is enough.","['manifolds', 'riemann-surfaces', 'differential-geometry']"

3336679,Why should I care about the symmetric equation of a line?,"I'm currently TAing for a multivariable calculus course. When I think of a line, I think of the span of a single vector, potentially shifted away from the origin. In this way, the most natural representation of a line (to me) is its vector form : $$P + tv$$ where I first move to a point $P$ on my line, and then move in the direction of some vector $v$ . And if I'm in $\mathbb{R}^3$ where $P = \langle x_0,y_0,z_0\rangle$ and $v = \langle v_1, v_2,v_3\rangle$ , I can understand writing the line in parametric form : $$\begin{cases}x = x_0 + tv_1 \\ y = y_0 + tv_2 \\ z = z_0 + tv_3\end{cases}$$ because we're just being explicit about components. However, if each $v_i$ is nonzero, there's the symmetric equation of a line $$\frac{x-x_0}{v_1} = \frac{y-y_0}{v_2} = \frac{z-z_0}{v_3}.$$ Why would I (or my students) ever use this format to describe a line?
