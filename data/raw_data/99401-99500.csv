1376224,Departure from uniformity in a continuous (time) distribution,"I know how to quantify the departure from uniformity ( or a uniform distribution) for discrete distributions. Assume you have a distribution set of P: P={P1, P2, P3, ....., PN} The departure from uniformity for this discrete distribution is defined as follow: D= SUM(Pi * log (Pi / (1/N))) Now my question is how to quantify the departure from uniformity in a time distribution which is actually a continuous distribution. I have a family of time distribution functions in the form of: (B is a parameter ) P(t;B) = - (t)^(B) Clearly, the linear distribution is resulted once B=1.
How can I quantify the departure from uniformity for this family of time distributions.

1376249,A covering space of CW complex has an induced CW complex structure.,"Let $X$ be a $CW$ complex, and let $q : E \rightarrow X$ be a covering map. Prove that $E$ has a $CW$ decomposition for which each cell is mapped homeomorphically by $q$ onto a cell of $X$. Hint: If $A \subseteq X$ is a locally path-connected subset, then the restriction of $q$ to each component of $q^{-1}(A)$ is a covering map onto its image. This problem is in Lee's Toplogical Manifolds on pages 303. We can define characteristic maps $\tilde \Phi$ of $E$ as follows. Let $\Phi : D \rightarrow X$ be a characteristic map for a cell $e$ of $X$. Since $D$ is simply connected, for each fiber of an element in $e$ there exist a unique lifting $\tilde \Phi : D \rightarrow E$. I have checked that the set of $\tilde \Phi (Int D)$ form a cell decomposition. And this cell decomposition has Weak topology. But I am unable to show that this has the property of closure finiteness. Let $\Phi(Int D) = \tilde e$. $q (\bar {\tilde e}) = \bar e$ intersects finitely many cells of $X$ since $X$ is a $CW$ complex. But I cannot prove that $\bar {\tilde e}$ intersects finitely many cells of $E$. I'd like to have some hints.","['covering-spaces', 'general-topology', 'cw-complexes']"
1376261,Is there an infinite topological meadow with non-trivial topology?,"For reference meadows are a generalization of fields that were designed to be compatible with the requirements of universal algebra. Specifically a meadow is a commutative ring equiped with an involution $x\mapsto x^{-1}$ which obeys $$x\cdot x\cdot x^{-1}=x$$ for all $x$. (A field can be turned into a meadow by letting $x^{-1}$ be the multiplicative inverse when $x\neq0$ and $0^{-1}=0$.) A topological meadow would be a commutative topological ring with such a $x\mapsto x^{-1}$ such that $x\mapsto x^{-1}$ is a continuous function. It was established in a previous question that none of the standard fields can be thought of as topological meadows with their standard topologies. (I'm also fairly certain the $p$-adics aren't topological meadows under their standard topologies either.) So my question is: Does there exist an infinite topological meadow with non-trivial topology? Non-trivial is somewhat vague, but I think essentially what I'm looking for is the space being Hausdorff and connected (if you take the topology of a topological field and make 0 an isolated point I believe you get a topological meadow, but it's disconnected), although failing these I would like to know 'how close' you can get. And if there is an infinite Hausdorff, connected topological meadow I would like to know how much more geoemtric structure you can have. Is there a topological meadow that is a connected (smooth) manifold (that isn't the zero meadow)?","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory', 'topological-rings', 'general-topology']"

But I'm having trouble showing $(b)\to (a)$, actually I'm not even sure if this direction is true. My initial thought was that I can prove this by the contrapositive. For some $\epsilon \gt 0$, suppose the limit does not exist at $a$. Then there are some sequences $x_n$, $y_n$ such that they both tend to $a$, but are never $a$, however, $\lim f(x_n)\neq \lim f(y_n)$. Then since $\lim x_n=\lim y_n=a$, we can choose a large enough $N$ such that if $n\ge N$, then $|x_n-a|\lt \delta, |y_n-a|\lt \delta$. Then we get $|f(x_n)-f(y_n)|\gt 0$. However, I realized that I cannot prove that such $x_n$ and $y_n$ exist in the first place. From definition, the function $f$ does not have a limit at $a$ if and only if there exists a sequence $x_n$ with $x_n\neq a$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that the sequence $x_n$ converges to $a$ but the sequence $f(x_n)$ does not converge in $\mathbb{R}$.

1376526,rationality of $\ell$-adic representation attached to an elliptic curves,"Let $E$ be an elliptic curves defined over a number field $K$. Consider the $\ell$-adic representation attached to $E$ $$ \rho_{\ell}:\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{K}/K) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Aut}(V_{\ell})$$ With $\overline{K}$ an algebraic closure of $K$ and $V_{\ell}=T_{\ell} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}} \mathbb{Q}_{\ell}$ with $T_{\ell}$ the Tate module of $E$. My question is: why the representation $\rho_{\ell}$ is rational? By criterion of Néron-Ogg-Shafarevich I understand that for all finite place $v$ such that $v$ not divides $\ell$ and $E$ has a good reduction at $v$, then $\rho_{\ell}$ is unramified. In particular the set of finite place of $K$ where $E$ has a bad reduction is finite and we denote it with $S_{\mathrm{bad}}$. So, if $S_{\ell}$ denote the set of finite place that not divide $\ell$, then for all finite place $v\notin S_{\mathrm{bad}}\cup S_{\ell}$ we have $\rho_{\ell}$ is unramified and $S_{\mathrm{bad}} \cup S_{\ell}$ is finite. But I don't understand why the coefficients of the polynomial $\mathrm{det}(1-F_{v,\rho_{\ell}}T)$ are rationals, where $T$ is an indeterminate and $F_{v,\rho_{\ell}}$ is the conjugacy class in $\mathrm{Aut}(V_{\ell})$ of $\rho_{\ell}(F_{w})$, $F_w$ the Frobenius element corresponding to a place $w$ of $\overline{K}$ extending $v$. I write a reasoning that I have done: If E has a good reduction at $v$ and $v \nmid \ell$ ,then I have the isomorphism $E[\ell](K) \simeq \widetilde{E}[\ell](k_v)$ where $k_v$ is the residue field of the completion of $K$ with respect to $v$. So the action of $\rho_{\ell}(F_w)$ on $E[\ell](K)$ correspond to the Frobenius endomorphism $\phi$ on $\widetilde{E}[\ell](k_v)$. Since $\mathrm{det}(1-F_{v,\rho_{\ell}})=\mathrm{det}(1-\rho_{\ell}(F_{w}))= 1-\mathrm{Tr}(\rho_{\ell}(F_{w}))T + \mathrm{det}(\rho_{\ell}(F_{w}))T^2$, can I deduce from my reasoning that $\mathrm{Tr}(\rho_{\ell}(F_{w}))=\mathrm{Tr}(\phi)$ and $\mathrm{det}(\rho_{\ell}(F_w))=\mathrm{det}(\phi)$? If it is true then we are done because the characteristic polynomial would be $1-\mathrm{Tr}(\phi)T+\mathrm{det}(\phi)T^2$ so would be independent from $\ell$ and it is known that $\mathrm{Tr}(\phi),\mathrm{det}(\phi)$ are integers (cf.

1376712,How to prove the limit exists for function of two variables?,"Problem: Evaluate the indicated limit or explain why it does not exist: \begin{align*} \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^2 y^2}{x^2 + y^4} \end{align*} The definition of limit my calculus textbook gives is: We say that $\lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} f(x,y) = L$, provided that: 1) Every neighbourhood of $(a,b)$ contains points of the domain of $f$
  different from $(a,b)$, and 2) For every positive number $\epsilon$ there exists a positive number
  $\delta = \delta (\epsilon)$ such that $|f(x,y) - L| < \epsilon$ holds
  whenever $(x,y)$ is in the domain of $f$ and satisfies $0 < \sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2} < \delta$. So in this specific problem I first checked the limiting behaviour when $(x,y)$ approaches $(0,0)$ from different directions: When $y =0$ or $x = 0$ then $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} f(x,y) = 0$. When $y = x^2$, we also have that $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} f(x,x^2) = 0$. So I believe the limit exists and is zero, and I want to prove it now by using the definition. So let $\epsilon > 0$. Then we need to find a $\delta > 0$ such that if $0 < \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \delta$, then $| \frac{x^2 y^2}{x^2 + y^4} - 0 | < \epsilon$. Now, since $x^2 \leq x^2 + y^4$, it follows that $\frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^4} \leq 1$. Let $\delta = \sqrt{\epsilon}$. If $0 \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \delta$, then it follows that $x^2 + y^2 < \epsilon$. Thus we also have that $y^2 < \epsilon$. Since we already had that $\frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^4} \leq 1$ we can multiply this with $y^2$ and get $\frac{x^2 y^2}{x^2 + y^4} \leq y^2$, from which it follows that $\frac{x^2 y^2}{x^2 + y^4} < \epsilon$. Can someone tell me if my reasoning is correct? Also, is this the right method to proof the existence of limits of functions of two variables? I mean, if you suspect that the limit exists, you have to use the delta-epsilon notation to prove it? Also, I found an alternative solution: Since $0 \leq \frac{x^2 y^2}{x^2 + y^4} \leq \frac{x^2 y^2}{x^2}$, and since $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^2 y^2}{x^2} = 0$, we have also $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^2 y^2}{x^2 + y^4} = 0$ by the Squeeze Theorem.","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'limits', 'multivariable-calculus']"

Option 1: Consider the measure space $(S, \mathcal{F}', P')$ where $\mathcal{F}' := \{ A \cap S \mid A \in \mathcal{F} \}$ and $P' := P|_{\mathcal{F}'}$. Then define the above property as $P'(\{ \omega \in S \mid \phi(\omega) \}) = P'(S)$, i.e. $P(\phi \cap S) = P(S)$. Note that $P'$ is not necessarily a probability measure. In the extreme case, it can also be the zero measure, if $S$ is a $P$-nullset. Option 2: Consider the conditional probability $P(A \mid S)$ and define the property above as $P(\phi \mid S) = 1$. The problem in option 1 is that $S$ is not necessarily an event of full outer measure which makes it a little bit strange to speak of ""almost surely on $S$"". (Of course, it would be even worse to say ""with probability $1$ on $S$.) In this case one should rather say ""almost everywhere"" instead of ""almost surely"". The problem in option 2 is that the conditional distribution is not unique in particular on nullsets. Of course, if we have a regular conditional probability distribution then it makes sense to speak of ""almost surely on $S$"" or even ""with probability $1$ on $S$"" (where ""on $S$"" should be rather read as ""given $S$""). However, if there is no regular version of the conditional probability distribution then there are some troubles in particular when conditioning on nullsets. So is it maybe better to introduce say option 3 (which is closer to option 1) and states: Option 3: ""$\phi$ almost surely on $S$"" $:\Leftrightarrow$ $P(S \setminus \phi) = 0$. Of course, option 1 and option 3 are equivalent and also equivalent with option 2 when we have a regular conditional probability distribution (such that we can integrate in order to get $P(\phi | S)$). Here is a related post which did not receive an answer to the last comment of OP which highlights the problem better.",['probability-theory']

For example, one can take the kernel of the $i$-th projection map $\pi_i\colon G\to \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. More generally, by forming linear combinations of these projection maps we get other surjective homomorphisms $G\to \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. But still, there are many more index 2 subgroups which do not appear as kernels of the maps described above. One easy argument to see this is to equip $G$ with the product ring structure so that the group structure is the underlying additive group of this ring. Then the direct sum $I = \bigoplus_{i\in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ is a proper ideal of $G$, so by Krull's theorem we can find a prime ideal $\mathfrak p$ of $G$ containing $I$. Since $G$ is Boolean every prime ideal is maximal and of index 2. But $\mathfrak p$ cannot be obtained as the kernel of one of the projection maps given before. I am aware of the fact that $\text{Spec}(G)$ can be described using ultrafilters. So now we also have these subgroups of index 2. But are there still more of them?

1376883,Possible proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for prime exponents greater than 2,"I would appreciate if someone could check my attempt in proving the Fermat's Last Theorem for prime exponents greater than $2$. Firstly, let's prove a couple of lemmas which state that sum or difference of two non-equal odd $p$-th powers cannot be a $p$-th power for prime $p>2$. Lemma 1: The difference of two $p$-th powers of non-equal odd positive integers is not a $p$-th power of an integer for prime $p>2$. Take prime $p>2$, and odd $z,x \in\Bbb Z^+, \; z>x$. Let $a=z-x$. Obviously $a$ is even.
$$z=a+x$$
$$z^{\ p}=\sum_{i=0}^p \binom{p}{i}a^{\ p-i}x^{\ i}=x^{\ p}+a\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} \binom{p}{i}a^{\ p-1-i}x^{\ i}$$
$$z^{\ p}-x^{\ p}=a\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} \binom{p}{i}a^{\ p-1-i}x^{\ i}$$
Assume that the right side is a $p$-th power of an integer. **** And here comes my erroneous logic: **** :( Then, since $x$ is not divisible by $a$ (because $x$ is odd, and $a$ is even), it must be:
$$\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} \binom{p}{i}a^{\ p-1-i}x^{\ i} \equiv 0\;(mod\;a^{\ p-1})$$ $$\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} \binom{p}{i}a^{\ p-1-i}x^{\ i} \equiv 0\;(mod\;a)$$
$$px^{\ p-1}+\sum_{i=0}^{p-2} \binom{p}{i}a^{\ p-1-i}x^{\ i} \equiv 0\;(mod\;a)$$
$$px^{\ p-1}+a\sum_{i=0}^{p-2} \binom{p}{i}a^{\ p-2-i}x^{\ i} \equiv 0\;(mod\;a)$$
$$px^{\ p-1} \equiv 0\;(mod\;a)$$
However, since both $p>2$ and $x$ are odd, then $px^{\ p-1}$ is also odd, so it cannot be divisible by $a$ which is even. We reached a contradiction so Lemma 1 is proven. Lemma 2: The sum of two $p$-th powers of non-equal odd positive integers is not a $p$-th power of an integer for prime $p>2$. Proof for the sum of two odd $p$-th powers not being a $p$-th power is almost the same. Start with odd $x,y \in\Bbb Z^+$, set $b=x+y$, and raise $x=b-y$ to the p-th power. If the sum $x^{\ p}+y^{\ p}$ were the p-th power, then $py^{\ p-1}$ would have to be divisible by $b$, which cannot be because $py^{\ p-1}$ is odd, while $b$ is even. Fermat's Last Theorem: (from Wikipedia) No three positive integers $x, y$, and $z$ can satisfy the equation $x^n+y^n=z^n$ for any integer value of $n$ greater than two. Proof of the Fermat's Last Theorem for prime exponents greater than 2: To prove the Fermat's Last Theorem for prime exponents greater than $2$, we assume that there are such $x,y,z$ and then rewrite all $3$ possible types of sums of odd and even $p$-th powers in such a way to get to a contradiction with the one of the above Lemmas. Assume that for prime $p>2$ there exist $x,y,z \in\Bbb Z^+$, all three different, for which
$$x^{\ p}+y^{\ p}=z^{\ p}$$ A) Assume that $x$ is even and $y$ is odd, both positive integers. First note that then $z$ must be odd too. We can rewrite it as
$$z^{\ p}-y^{\ p}=x^{\ p}$$
however, since both $z$ and $y$ are odd then this is in contradiction with Lemma 1. Therefore, combinations where one of $x,y$ is even and the other is odd are not possible. B) Assume that both $x$ and $y$ are odd positive integers, then $x^{\ p}+y^{\ p}=z^{\ p}$ is in direct contradiction with Lemma 2. Therefore, combinations where both $x$ and $y$ are odd are not possible. C) Assume both $x$ and $y$ are even, then we can repeatedly divide them with $2$, until one, or both of them gets odd, which reduce this case to A) or B) . Therefore, combinations where both $x,y$ are even are also not possible. Since neither of A) , B) , or C) hold, then there are no such $x,y,z \in Z^+$ to satisfy the equation $x^{\ p}+y^{\ p}=z^{\ p}$ for prime $p>2$ and $x,y,z$ all different.","['number-theory', 'proof-verification']"
1376886,Approximation to a compounded Binomial distribution,"I need to find an approximation, from which I can easily sample, to the following compounded Binomial distribution:
$X \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(e^{-\epsilon}, \ n)$ where $\epsilon \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta)$ I know that if $e^{-\epsilon}$ were a Beta then $X$ would be a Beta-Binomial. Moreover, I know that $N\ \mathrm{Beta(\alpha, N)} \rightarrow \mathrm{Gamma}(\alpha, 1)$ in distribution. However $e^{-\epsilon}$ is not a Gamma and I cannot use this nice approximation. $\epsilon$ has parameters such that its mode is around 0.1 so I thought I could use a Taylor expansion of $e^{-\epsilon}$, but it does not help in making my compound Binomial tractable. Since I want to sample from this in a particle filter, I don't want to use any importance sampling (or related) because I need something quite fast, so I'm looking for a known distribution which could be a good approximation. EDIT 1: I think I've found an answer to my problem.
Notice that $e^{-\epsilon} \in ]0, 1]$. So it's the support of a Beta. Natural idea is to minimize the KL divergence between the distribution of $e^{-\epsilon}$ (we know its density its just an easy change of variable) and a Beta. 
If we denote $P=e^{-\epsilon}$ and $q_P(p)=\frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}(-\log p)^{\alpha-1}p^{\beta-1}$ its density and if we denote $q(\ \cdot \ ; a, b)$ the density of a $\mathrm{Beta}(a,b)$ we have: \begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
D_{KL}(a,b) & = \int_{0}^{1}q_P(p)\frac{q_P(p)}{q(p; a, b)}\mathrm{d}p \\
& \propto - \int_{0}^{1}q_P(p)\log(q(p; a, b))\mathrm{d}p \\
& \propto - \int_{0}^{1}q_P(p)\log(\frac{\Gamma(a+b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}p^{a-1}(1-p)^{b-1})\mathrm{d}p \\
& \propto -\log\Gamma(a+b) + \log\Gamma(a) + \log\Gamma(b) \\ & \qquad  + (a-1)\int_{0}^{1}(-\log p)\frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}(-\log p)^{\alpha-1}p^{\beta-1}\mathrm{d}p \\ & \qquad - (b-1)\int_{0}^{1}\log (1-p)\frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}(-\log p)^{\alpha-1}p^{\beta-1}\mathrm{d}p
\end{split}
\end{equation*} Now notice that $-\log p(-\log p)^{\alpha-1}p^{\beta-1}= (-\log p)^{\alpha}p^{\beta-1}$ is proportional to the density of $e^{-X}$ where $X \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(\alpha+1, \beta)$ and if we denote $K=\int_{0}^{1}\log(1-p)\frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}(-\log p)^{\alpha-1}p^{\beta-1}\mathrm{d}p$ we have: \begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
D_{KL}(a,b) & = \propto -\log\Gamma(a+b) + \log\Gamma(a) + \log\Gamma(b) \\ 
& \qquad  + (a-1)\frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+1)}{\beta^{\alpha+1}} - (b-1)K \\
& \propto -\log\Gamma(a+b) + \log\Gamma(a) + \log\Gamma(b) + (a-1)\frac{\alpha}{\beta} - (b-1)K
\end{split}
\end{equation*} Now we minimize by finding a critical point:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial }{\partial a}D_{KL} = -\psi^{(0)}(a+b) + \psi^{(0)}(a) + \frac{\alpha}{\beta} = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial }{\partial b}D_{KL} = -\psi^{(0)}(a+b) + \psi^{(0)}(b) - K = 0
\end{equation}
where $\psi^{(0)}$ is the digamma function.
$K$ is easily calculated numerically and so is the system of two equations above I did a numerical example with  $\alpha = \beta = 10$ and found $a = 6.739281$ and $b=10.736471$. I sampled 10000 times from $e^{-\epsilon}$ and the Beta with coefficient $a$ and $b$ and drew the following QQ-plot which seems to indicate that the approximation is accurate and I can use a Beta-Binomial to sample from instead of from $\mathrm{Binomial}(e^{-\epsilon}, n)$:","['monte-carlo', 'statistics', 'gamma-distribution', 'probability', 'binomial-distribution']"

Applying this on $su(2)$ was no problem, but I don't understand the meaning of $e^{\rho}$ and $e^{w(\lambda+\rho)}$. I was told once, that this is defined by $e^\rho:=e^{\rho_1}\cdot e^{\rho_2}$. Is this correct?
Also this should still make sence if $e^{\beta\cdot\rho}$, where $\beta$ is a non-integral number. Also I am confused by the fact, that the irreducible representation does only appear in $\lambda$, the highest weight in the fundamental Weyl-Chamber (Humphreys' Definition) which in turn is part of the Root-Lattice. Is that correct? As I said, I just started learning about this, so please keep it as simple as possible. Thanks for any help!

1377096,Asymptotic Behavior of a Sum with Binomial Coefficients,"The Problem : Find the asymptotic behavior (with respect to $n$) of the following sum $$\sum\limits_{j = 3}^n \binom{n}{j} \frac{(j - 1)!}{2\cdot n^j}. $$ Where the Problem Comes From :  If we consider the random graph $G(n,p)$, i.e. the graph on $n$ vertices where each possible edge is added independently with probability $p$, then the expected number of cycles is $$ \sum\limits_{j = 3}^n \binom{n}{j} \frac{(j - 1)!}{2} p^j. $$ If we take $p = 1/n$, then we get the sum mentioned above. What I've Done So Far :  We can get a quick-and-not-so-great bound as follows: \begin{align*} 
\sum\limits_{j = 3}^n \binom{n}{j} \frac{(j - 1)!}{2\cdot n^j} &= \sum\limits_{j = 3}^n \frac{n!}{j\cdot(n - j)!} \frac{1}{2\cdot n^j} \\
&\leq \sum\limits_{j = 3}^n \frac{n^j}{j} \frac{1}{2\cdot n^j} \\
&= \sum\limits_{j = 3}^n \frac{1}{2\cdot j} \\
&=O(\log(n)).
\end{align*} However, based on a quick program I wrote, it seems that maybe this should actually be $O(1)$, as this sum appears to stay below $1$, even when $n = 130$ (about as large as Python will allow me before hitting an overflow error). Using Stirling's formula (in various different ways) yielded no result.  I also tried: \begin{align} \sum \binom{n}{j}\frac{(j-1)!}{2 n^j} &\leq \sum \left( \frac{e n}{j}\right)^j \frac{(j-1)!}{2 \cdot n^j} \\
&= \sum \frac{e^j (j - 1)!}{2\cdot j^j}
\end{align}
which diverges as $n \to \infty$.  However, the sum $$ \sum \frac{\alpha^j (j - 1)!}{j^j}$$ converges for all $|\alpha| < e$.  This suggests that maybe one could bound $$\binom{n}{j} \leq \left(\frac{\alpha n}{j}\right)^j $$ for some $\alpha < e$ (not depending on $n$) for all but $\log(n)$ terms; then we could break the terms up into those bounded with the constant $\alpha$ (which would converge) and the $\log(n)$ terms bounded with the constant $e$, which would also work.  I haven't been able to figure out how to make that estimate work, though. So, is this $O(1)$?  Is it $O(\log(n))$?

And if the functional equation does not help can you please give your reasoning on why so?

1377830,Prove that $E \cap E^{c} = \varnothing$.,"This is a 'simple' question on elementary set theory. I said 'simple' because statement like this is presented all over introductory sections in advanced math books, but they are not really proved in most texts that I read. Here is my proof for $E \cap E^{c} = \varnothing$, where $E$ is a subset of some universe set $U$. For the $\subset$ part, we want to show that if $x \in E \cap E^{c}$, then $x \in \varnothing$. Let $x \in E \cap E^{c}$. It follows that $x$ is in both $E$ and $E^{c}$. However, if $x \in E$, $x \notin E^{c}$. Therefore the first part of the implication is false. Obviously the second part of the implication is false also (i.e. $x \in \varnothing$ is false). This implies that the statement if $x \in E \cap E^{c}$, then $x \in \varnothing$ is actually true vacuously . For the $\supset$ part, well again we can say that the statement is true vacuously. Therefore, we conclude that $E \cap E^{c} = \varnothing$. Q.E.D I feel uneasy because of all these vacuously true statements. So does this proof really hold?",['elementary-set-theory']
1377855,Cylinder and Möbius strip as fiber bundles: trivializations and cocycles,"I know that this question has already been asked, but I couldn't find a clear answer. I have to show that the cylinder and the Möbius strip are fiber bundles over $S^1$ with fiber an open interval and I have to write down explicitly the transition functions and the cocycles. Cylinder . The cylinder is $E:=I\times S^1$ where $I$ is our open interval. Let's consider
$$
\pi : I \times S^1 \to S^1
$$
the projection on the second factor (by definition it's continuous and surjective). Let's take $S^1$ as basis of the fiber bundle and let $\{U_\alpha\}_\alpha$ be an open covering of $S^1$. $\pi_1:U_\alpha\times I\to U_\alpha$
is the projection on the first factor. The trivialization is
$$
\phi_\alpha:\pi^{-1}(U_\alpha)\to U_\alpha\times I\\
\phi_\alpha:=id|_{U_\alpha\times I}
$$
In this case the transition functions are such that for all $\alpha,\beta$
$$
\phi_{\alpha\beta}=\phi_\alpha\circ\phi_\beta^{-1}=id|_{(U_\alpha\cap U_\beta)\times I}.
$$
Hence the cocycles are just
$$
g_{\alpha\beta}:U_\alpha\cap U_\beta\to Aut(I)\\
p\mapsto id|_I
$$ Möbius band Let's start with the closed interval $[0,1]$ and the map
$$
p:[0,1]\to S^1\\
x\mapsto e^{i2\pi x}
$$
which identifies the point $0$ with the point $1$. Let's consider $[0,1]\times I$, where $I$ is an open interval, let's say $(0,1)$.
Let's define an equivalence relation on $[0,1]\times I$:
$$
(0,y)\sim (1,1-y)
$$
and we obtain the Möbius band $E$. Let's consider an open covering $\{U_\alpha\}_\alpha$ of sphere $S^1$ and let
$$
\pi:E\to S^1\\
[(x,y)]\mapsto p(x)
$$
be continuous and surjective and
$$
\pi_1:U_\alpha\times I\to U_\alpha
$$
be continuous and surjective. I can't find a trivialization. I just know that I have to choose a proper open covering of $S^1$ like two open interval overlapped.","['fibration', 'differential-geometry', 'fiber-bundles', 'general-topology']"

1377898,Prime Numbers and a Two-Player Game,"In this question, $\mathbb{N}_0$ is the set of all nonnegative integers.  The notation $\mathbb{N}$ is reserved for the set of all positive integers. Alex and Beth are playing the following game.  Initially, there are $n\in\mathbb{N}_0$ marbles on a table.  Alex and Beth alternatively pick out some marbles out of the table, with Alex going first.  The number of removed marbles per turn must be a prime number (i.e., $2$ , $3$ , $5$ , $7$ , $11$ , etc.).  The first person who cannot make a move loses the game.  If $W$ is the set of all nonnegative integers such that Alex can always win if $n\in W$ , whereas $L$ is the set of all nonnegative integers such that Beth has a winning strategy if $n\in L$ . Is it true that $L$ is an infinite subset of $\mathbb{N}_0$ (clearly, $W$ is infinite, since it contains all the primes)? We now know that both $W$ and $L$ are infinite subsets of $\mathbb{N}_0$ .  What are natural densities of $W$ and $L$ ?  What are logarithmic densities of $W$ and $L$ ?  Does $L$ contain an infinite number of pairs of consecutive integers?  Does $L$ contain only finitely many even integers?  For a positive integer $k$ , does each of $W$ and $L$ always have infinitely many subsets of consecutive integers of size $k$ ?  Does $L$ contain an infinitely number of semiprimes?  Is the sum $\sum_{n\in L\setminus\{0\}}\,\frac{1}{n}$ finite (clearly, $\sum_{n\in W}\,\frac{1}{n}$ is infinite)? For a start, $W=\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,11,12,13,14,15,\ldots\}$ and $L=\{0,1,9,10,25,34,35,\ldots\}$ .  I conjecture that $L$ is an infinite subset of $\mathbb{N}_0$ containing infinitely many semiprimes such that $\sum_{n\in L\setminus\{0\}}\,\frac{1}{n}$ is finite . Furthermore, I expect that the natural density and the logarithmic density of $W$ are both $1$ , whereas the natural density and the logarithmic density of $L$ are both $0$ . References are very welcome. According to the OEIS link given by Michael Lugo in a comment below, it seems that $\{0,1\}$ , $\{9,10\}$ , $\{34,35\}$ , and $\{309,310\}$ are the only subsets of $L$ consisting of consecutive integers (I could be wrong to assume that these are the only ones), and $W$ has at least three subsets of size $29$ which are composed by consecutive integers.  Also, this set of data suggests that the natural density and the logarithmic density of $L$ exist and are equal, with the value somewhere between $0.1$ and $0.2$ .  In addition, $\sum_{n\in L\setminus\{0\}}\,\frac{1}{n}>2.2$ , and of course, if the logarithmic density of $L$ exists and is positive, then this sum is infinite. An interesting remark by Michael ( $\neq$ Michael Lugo) is that the set $L$ contains very few even numbers.  Among the smallest $10000$ elements of $L$ , only $5$ of them are even.  This leads to my speculation that $L$ has only finitely many even numbers.  Michael also verifies that $L$ has a positive natural density of at least $0.1$ and at most $0.25$ , if $L$ has only $5$ even elements. If, instead, the number of removed marbles per turn must belong in nonempty set $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $\mathbb{N}\setminus S$ is infinite, let $W_S$ and $L_S$ be the sets $W$ and $L$ , respectively, for this particular $S$ .  What can be said about the finiteness of $W_S$ and of $L_S$ ?  How about the finiteness of the reciprocal sums $\sum_{n\in W_S}\,\frac{1}{n}$ and $\sum_{n\in L_S\setminus\{0\}}\,\frac{1}{n}$ ?  What do we know about the natural and the logarithmic densities of $W_S$ and $L_S$ ? For example, if $S=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$ for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$ , then we have $W_S=\big\{n\in\mathbb{N}_0\,\big|\,(m+1)\nmid n\big\}$ and $L_S=\big\{n\in\mathbb{N}_0\,\big|\,(m+1)\mid n\big\}$ .  Hence, $W_S$ and $L_S$ are infinite sets with $\sum_{n\in W_S}\,\frac{1}{n}$ and $\sum_{n \in L_S\setminus\{0\}}\frac{1}{n}$ being also infinite.  Note that the natural and logarithmic densities of $W_S$ are both $1-\frac{1}{m+1}$ , and the natural and logarithmic densities of $L_S$ are both $\frac{1}{m+1}$ .

1377906,Probability of histogram bars,"Say I collect data that follows a Normal distribution $f(z)$ in a histogram with bins of width $w$. I want to calculate the probability that the number of hits $N_i > N_j$. My naive approach would be to first calculate the probability of finding a hit in bin $i$ by integrating $f(z)$ over the bin:
$$
p_i = \int_{z_i-w/2}^{z_i+w/2}f(z)dz
$$ The number of hits in a bin then follows a binomial distribution such that
$$
P(N_i = x) = p_i^x\:(1-p_i)^{N-x}\cdot \left(\begin{matrix}N\\x\end{matrix}\right)
$$
where $N=\sum_i{N_i}$ is the total number of hits collected. To find $P(N_i>N_j)$, I would then sum over all combinations for which this condition holds:
$$
P(N_i>N_j) = \sum_{x=1}^{N/2} \sum_{y=0}^{x-1}P(N_i=x)\cdot P(N_j=y)
