2893222,Expressing Green's relations in regular semigroups,"Let $S$ be a semigroup and $a \in S$. An element $a' \in S$ is called an inverse of $a$ if
$$
 aa'a = a \qquad 
 a'aa' = a'.
$$
Denote the set of all inverses by $V(a)$. A semigroup where every element has an inverse is called a regular semigroup . We use Green's relations , in particular the definition of $\mathcal L-, \mathcal R-, \mathcal D-$ and $\mathcal H$-classes. The following is taken from J. M. Howie Fundamental of semigroup theory (page 49): Let $a,b$ be elements of a regular semigroup. Then $(a,b) \in\mathcal L$ if and only if there exists $a' \in V(a), b' \in V(b)$ such that $a'a = b'b$. I tried to prove it on my own, but failed. And I do not understand the proof in the book. So can anyone give me proof of it or clarify the one given in the book? By the way, I was unable to find this proposition for regular semigroups in other books. The proof from the book uses two previously shown Propositions, namely In a regular semigroup (or in a regular $\mathcal D$-class, i.e. every element is regular) each $\mathcal L$-class and each $\mathcal R$-class contains an idempotent. If $D$ is a regular $\mathcal D$-class and $a,b \in D$ are such that $R_a \cap L_b$ and $L_a \cap R_b$ contain idempotents $e,f$ respectively, then the $\mathcal H$-class of $b$ contains an inverse $a^*$ of $a$ such that $aa^* = e, a^*a = f$. Now the proof goes like this: Suppose that $(a,b) \in \mathcal L$. If $a' \in V(a)$ then $a'a$ is an idempotent in $L_a = L_b$. The $\mathcal R$-class $R_b$ contains at least one  idempotent by Proposition 1 above, and then, by Proposition 2 above, the $\mathcal H$-class $R_{a'a} \cap R_e$ contain an inverse $b'$ of $b$ with the property that $b'b = a'a$ (and $bb' = e$). Notice that we have shown the stronger implication that
  $$
 (a,b) \in \mathcal L \Rightarrow (\forall a' \in V(a))(\exists b' \in V(b)) a'a = b'b.
$$ That's it. I found that in an older book by the same author, named Introduction to semigroup theory (which seems to be a precursor of the present book) the same Proposition appears, but the referred $\mathcal H$-class is $R_{a'a} \cap L_e$ and not $R_{a'a} \cap R_e$ (which seems to make more sense as $\mathcal H$-classes are intersection of $\mathcal R$-classes and $\mathcal L$-classes by definition, but note that the $\mathcal H$-class of $b$ is $L_b \cap R_b = L_{a'a} \cap R_e$). But what I do not understand is that to apply Proposition 2 above, we need something like $L_a \cap R_b$ and $R_a \cap L_a$ should contain idempoents, but I do not see that $a'a$ is in $R_a$ (or $R_b$) neither do I see that $e$ is in $L_a = L_b$, and even if I write $e \in R_b \cap L_e$ then I need $a'a \in R_e \cap L_a$, but this I neither see?

We can split

2893246,Minimum value of the expectation $\mathbb{E}[ X_1 X_2 / (X_1^2 + X_2^2) ]$,"Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be i.i.d. random variables from a distribution $D$ on the real numbers with finite variance (and therefore finite mean). Assume that the probability of $X_i = 0$ is $0$. Must it be true that
$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ \frac{X_1 X_2}{X_1^2 + X_2^2} \right] \ge 0?
$$
If not, what is the infimum over all such distributions of this expectation? Comments The expectation is always finite. It is possible for the expectation to be $0$, when $D$ is symmetric about $0$. My conjecture is that this expectation is necessarily nonnegative. Of course without the denominator, $\mathbb{E}[X_1 X_2] = \mathbb{E}[X_1] \cdot \mathbb{E}[X_2] = \mu^2 \ge 0$. But with the denominator, it is not so clear. I imagine this may be very elementary: I am not an expert in most inequalities used in probability theory. I tried expanding the fraction with partial fractions over the complex numbers, getting
$$
\frac{X_1 X_2}{X_1^2 + X_2^2} = \frac{\tfrac12 X_2}{X_1 + i X_2} + \frac{\tfrac12 X_2}{X_1 - i X_2},
$$
but I don't have an idea for how to evaluate these expectations, either. This question is a result of my previous question . Specifically we can write
$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ \frac{(X_1 + X_2)^2}{X_1^2 + X_2^2}\right] = 1 + 2 \cdot \mathbb{E}\left[ \frac{X_1 X_2}{X_1^2 + X_2^2} \right],
$$
and in the answer to my previous question it seemed to be the case that the former expectation never goes below $1$. This is equivalent to the present question about the latter expectation.","['inequality', 'probability-theory', 'expectation']"

2893357,Counting Conjugacy Classes: $A^6 = I$,"This question is inspired by this earlier post .  The question that I'm interested in is as follows: Let $S= \{A \in \mathbb{Q}^{k \times k} : A^6 = I \text{ and }A^n \ne I \text{ for any }0 < n < 6\}$. How many orbits under conjugation by $GL_k(\mathbb{Q})$ does $S$ contain? Per the argument that I've given in the linked post, it suffices to list representatives in rational canonical form .  Thus, it is equivalent to enumerate the multisets of irreducible polynomials $\{p_1,\dots,p_n\}$ (which are the polynomials corresponding to companion matrix blocks) each of which divides $x^6-1$, whose degrees sum to $k$, and whose lcm divides $x^6 - 1$ but no polynomial of the form $x^n - 1$ for $n < 6$. Of course, there is only one such multiset in the case of $k=2$, hence the answer to the linked question.  As $k$ grows things get trickier. For $k=5$, we have
$$
\{x^2 - x + 1, x \pm 1, x \pm 1, x\pm 1\}\\
\{x^2 + x + 1, x+1, x\pm 1, x\pm 1\}\\

2893495,Why the weak topology is never metrizable?,"Let $X$ be an infinite-dimensional normed space.  Why the weak topology on $X$ is never metrizable ? I saw a proof here but I don't really understand the argument. Here is his argument Assume that there is a metric $d$ on $X$ inducing the weak topology, and consider $U_n:=\{x\in X: d(x,0)<\frac{1}{n}\}$.  We know each $U_n$ is weakly open and so will be unbounded, and thus $$\forall (n)\exists (x_n\in U_n) \:\text{s.t.}\: \|x_n\|\geq n$$ But $x_n\to 0$ in $(X, d)$, so that $x_n \stackrel{w}{\to}0$, and hence $(x_n)$ is bounded. Contradiction. Q1) Why $U_n$ is weakly open ? Is it because a basis of the weak topology is of the form $$\{B_d(x,\varepsilon)\mid x\in X, \varepsilon>0 \}$$
where $$B_d(x,\varepsilon)=\{y\in X\mid d(x,y)<\varepsilon\} \ ?$$ Q2) Why are $U_n$ unbounded ? Since $U_n\subset B(0,1)$ for all $n\geq 1$, then $U_n$ is bounded (for me, in a metric space $(X,d)$, a set $A$ is bounded, if it's included in a ball $B_d(a,\varepsilon)$... since here $U_n\subset B_d(0,1)$ for all $n\geq 1$, it should be bounded).

Let $L(V, W)$ be the vector space of continuous linear maps equipped with the weak operator topology , which is the initial topology for the maps

\phi_{v, \mu} : L(V, W) &\to \mathbb C \\
T & \mapsto \mu(Tv)
\end{align*}$$
for $v \in V$ and $\mu \in W^*$ (the continuous dual of $W$). Equivalently, it is the topology induced by the seminorms $p_{v, \mu} = |\phi_{v, \mu}|$. In particular, $L(V, W)$ is locally convex, and Hausdorff iff $W^*$ separates points of $W$. By construction, the $\phi_{v, \mu} : L(V, W) \to \mathbb C$ are continuous linear maps, and so are finite linear combinations of the $\phi_{v, \mu}$. Under which conditions do the $\phi_{v, \mu}$ span the continuous dual $L(V, W)^*$? I know that this is the case when $V = W$ is a Hilbert space. (Takesaki, Theory of Operator Algebras I , Chapter II Theorem 2.6.) In these notes , Paul Garrett suggests that this is more generally true for certain topological vector spaces: the proof of the second corollary on page 3 uses that this is true when $V$ is an LF-space and $W$ quasi-complete and locally convex.) It does not give a precise statement, which makes we wonder if this is true for general topological vector spaces: Is there any good reference which addresses the case of topological vector spaces (not just normed spaces)?","['operator-algebras', 'operator-theory', 'topological-vector-spaces', 'weak-topology', 'functional-analysis']"

I already proved that this is equivalent to $\sup_{x\in S}\|x\|<\infty$ in the previuos exercise, so probably I should use that here, but I don't know how.

What I can show is $$\|a\|=f_a(a)\leq\sup_{x\in S}|f_a(x)|<\infty.$$ But know I don't know what happen if I take the supremum on both sides.

(b) Conversely, for any invertible sheaf $\mathscr L$ on $X$ generated by $d+1$ global sections $s_0,\cdots,s_d$, there exists a morphism $f:X\to Y$ such that $\mathscr L\simeq f^*\mathscr O_Y(1)$ and $f^*T_i=s_i$ via this isomorphism. $\textbf{Proof}$ (b) The open subsets $X_{s_i}$ cover $X$. For every $i\le d$, let us consider the morphism $f_i:X_{s_i}\to D_+(T_i)$ corresponding to the ring homomorphism 
$\mathscr O_Y(D_+(T_i))\to \mathscr O_X(X_{s_i}),$ $T_j/T_i\mapsto s_j/s_i\in \mathscr O_X(X_{s_i})$. It is clear that the morphisms $f_i$ glue to a morphism $f:X\to Y$, and that $\mathscr L\simeq f^*\mathscr O_Y(1)$ by Proposition 1.14(b) and the description in Example 1.19. Now I'll explain the above proof. For every $i\le d$, let us consider the morphism $f_{ij}:X_{s_i}\cap X_{s_j}\to X_{s_i}\to D_+(T_i)$ corresponding to the ring homomorphism 
$\mathscr O_Y(D_+(T_i))\to \mathscr O_X(X_{s_i})\to\mathscr O_X(X_{s_i}\cap X_{s_j}),$ $T_k/T_i\mapsto s_k/s_i\mapsto s_k/s_i\in \mathscr O_X(X_{s_i}\cap X_{s_j})$. It can be factored as follows:
$\mathscr O_Y(D_+(T_i))\to \mathscr O_Y(D_+(T_iT_j))\to \mathscr O_X(X_{s_i}\cap X_{s_j})$ $T_k/T_i\mapsto (T_kT_j)/(T_iT_j)\mapsto s_k/s_i\in \mathscr O_X(X_{s_i}\cap X_{s_j})$. The second ring homomorphism $\mathscr O_Y(D_+(T_iT_j))\to \mathscr O_X(X_{s_i}\cap X_{s_j})$ is defined as follows:
$(T_mT_n)/(T_iT_j)\mapsto (s_m/s_i)(s_n/s_j)\in \mathscr O_X(X_{s_i}\cap X_{s_j})$. Let $s_j/s_i=a, s_i/s_j=b$. $\because s_j=as_i=(ab)s_j$, $\therefore ab=1$, $\therefore (s_m/s_i)(s_n/s_j)=(s_n/s_i)(s_m/s_j)$. $\therefore$The ring homomorphism is defined well. $\therefore f_{ij}(X_{s_i}\cap X_{s_j})\subset D_+(T_iT_j)$ and $f_{ij}=f_{ji}.$ It is clear that the morphisms $f_i$ glue to a morphism $f:X\to Y$.

2893586,Probabilities regarding casino slot machine,"Exercise : A casino slot machine has been programmed so as to offer total winnings $X$ euros per hour, regardless of other hours, with $μ_x = E[X] = 180$ and $σ_x = V[X] = 10.125$ . From long term data we know that the value $Y$ in euros that players bet per hour (independent of the values that are played at other hours and the winnings values) follows the uniform distribution over the interval $[100,300]$ . (a) Calculate approximately the probability that in the duration of one month the slot machine has yielded total winnings of over $135.000$ euros.

(Suppose that the casino operates the 24hrs per day and that every month has 30 days). Attempt - Question : (a) Since we are asked to calculate the probability of winnings over the course of one month, we should multiply the variable $X$ by $24 \cdot 30 = 720$ . Thus, what we need to find, is : $$P[720X > 135.000] = 1 - P[720X \leq 135.000] = 1 - P[X \leq 187.5] = 1 - P[X-180 \leq 7.5] = 1 - P\bigg[\frac{X-180}{45\sqrt{5}} \leq \frac{7.5}{45\sqrt{5}}\bigg] = 1 - P\bigg[Z \leq \frac{7.5}{45\sqrt{5}}\bigg]$$ which can be calculated approximately via the $\Phi$ probability function boards. (b) The clear profit of the casino in the duration of one month is the total value of the bets by the players minus the total winnings, thus $720(Y-X)$ . Now, the probability of the clear profit of the casino being over $10.000$ per month is : $$P[720(Y-X) > 10.000] = 1 - P[720(Y-X) \leq 10.000] = 1 - P[Y-X \leq 125/9$$ Since $Y \sim U(100,300)$ , it will be $E[Y] = 200$ and $V[Y] = 10000/3$ . How should I proceed now to calculate the probability above ? How would I form a normal distribution simulation for $2$ variables this time, which follow different distributions ? (c) For the probability of the casino earnings (total profit) being more than $10.000$ with at least $95%$ probability, I assume that something like this is needed : $$P[720(Y-X) > 10.000] = 0.95$$ but proceeding in this case I have the same issue as before, thus leading to the initial question. How would I proceed with implementing the parameters of the distributions both the variables $X$ and $Y$ into a normal distribution simulation fraction in order to produce an approximate probability ?

2893621,Avoiding exactly one permutation pattern,"Let $n \geq k$.  We say that a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ contains a permutation (or ""pattern"") $\tau \in S_k$ if there is a substring of $k$ (not necessarily consecutive) elements of $\sigma$ ordered like $\tau$.  For example, the permutation $\sigma=24513$ contains $132$, since the string $243$ in $\sigma$ has the same relative order as $132$. Similarly, it contains $123$ (the string $245$), $213$ (the string $213$), $231$ (the string $451$) and $312$ (the string $513$).  The only length-$3$ pattern it does not contain is $321$. Question: Given a permutation $\tau \in S_k$, is it possible to find a value of $n$ and a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ such that $\sigma$ contains every pattern of length $k$ except $\tau$? Overly Ambitious Generalization: Given a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ and a $k \leq n$, let $T_k(\sigma)$ be the set of patterns of length $k$ contained in $\sigma$.  For a fixed integer $k$, what sets of patterns can possibly appear as $T_k(\sigma)$ for some $\sigma$? For large $k$, almost all subsets do not ever occur as a $T_k(\sigma)$.  One way to see this: By Erdős–Szekeres every permutation with $n>(k-1)^2$ contains either $123\dots k$ or $k\dots 321$.  There's less than $(k^2)!$ other choices for $\sigma$, each of which contains at most $\binom{k^2}{k}$ patterns.   So at most $\binom{k^2}{k} (k^2)!$ subsets containing neither $123\dots k$ nor $k \dots 321$ ever appear as a $T_k$, which is much smaller than the total number of subsets not containing those two patterns. The first question arose out of a discussion I had with a computer science graduate student about the complexity of testing for pattern containment.  Most of the work I've seen on pattern-avoiding permutations has focused more on enumerating them, and I'd appreciate any references to other work done on relationships between various pattern containments.","['permutations', 'pattern-matching', 'combinatorics', 'reference-request']"

If $A$ is positive, then $x_0$ is a local minimum. Proof By Taylor's formula
\begin{align}f(x)=f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0)+\frac{f''(x_0)}{2!}(x-x_0)^2+\Vert x-x_0 \Vert^2\epsilon(x-x_0)\end{align}

\begin{align}
=\langle (x-x_0),A(x-x_0)\rangle\end{align}
Thus, 
\begin{align}f(x)-f(x_0)=\frac{\langle (x-x_0),A(x-x_0)\rangle}{2!}(x-x_0)^2+\Vert x-x_0 \Vert^2\epsilon(x-x_0)\end{align}

  $$0\longrightarrow M\longrightarrow I^0 \longrightarrow I^1 \longrightarrow I^2\longrightarrow\cdots$$ and a cochain map from the first resolution to the second, such that each $i\geq 0$ the morphism $X^i\to I^i$ is a monomorphism. Question: How do I find such an injective resolution, with such a chain map? My attempts are below! 1) Using that we have enough injectives, I can find a monomorphism $X^0\to I^0$ for some $I^0$ injective. Then by composition I can find a morphism $M\to X^0\to I^0$. This gives me the monomorphism $M\hookrightarrow I^0$. Similarly using enough injectives, we can find a monomorphism $X^1\hookrightarrow I^1$ for $I^1$ injective. Then using the composite $X^0\to X^1\to I^1$ and that $I^1$ is injective, we induce a morphism from $I^0\to I^1$. We can do this inductively to obtain a cochain map between $0\to M\to X^\bullet$ and $0\to M\to I^\bullet$, with these monomorphisms for all $k\geq 0$ $X^k\hookrightarrow I^k$ for $I^k$ injective. But I can't show that the bottom row is exact, and hence I cannot show that this $I^\bullet$ an injective resolution. In fact part of me doubts that it even is (even trying to chase elements fails, since I have no epimorphisms appearing). 1b) I tried taking cokernels in each degree so that I could try to do something with the epimorphisms it gives me. Mainly I want to apply $F$ and use the long exact cohomology sequence, to make use of the $F$-acyclicity. But unless I can show exactness on the second row, I can't ensure $F$ will preserve the short exact sequence of complexes. 2) I tried using that we have enough injectives to induces a monomorphism from $M\to I_M^0$ and a monomorphism $X^0\to I_{X^0}^0$ and taking the direct sum, which I can show is also an injective object, and then repeating this for $I_{X^0}^0\oplus I_M^0$ and $X^1$, so on. But this seems highly non-exact (in fact all the morphisms in this bottom row are probably injective...) 3) I think the category of chain complexes has enough injectives, but I don't think an injective object in the chain category looks like what I want. 4) I couldn't think of any way to take the injective resolution first, and then choose compatible morphisms such that the result follows.","['homological-algebra', 'abstract-algebra', 'homology-cohomology']"

$$f(f(z))-z=c(f(z)-z) $$
applying Picard's little theorem. If $c=0$, then $f(f(z))=z$, so $f\circ f$ has a fixed point (absurd). If $c=1$, then $f(f(z))=f(z)$, so $f$ is the identity $f(z)=z$ and of course it has fixed point (absurd). Then, 
$$F(z)=\frac{f(f(z))-z}{(f(z)-z)}$$
is an entire function which does not take the values 0 and 1 so, by Picard's little theorem, it must be constant. Also, I've proved that $f'\circ f$ is a constant function. Let's see this. Differentiating 
$$f(f(z))-z=c(f(z)-z) $$
we have
$$f'(z)f'(f(z))-1=cf'(z)-c$$
$$f'(z)[f'(f(z))-c]=1-c$$

For example: the permutation $245163$ doesn't follow the rule only because $1$ is in the 4th place, and because $3$ is in the 6th place. I solved a weaker version of this problem, in which there are only $4$ numbers with the same rule, by taking the overall number of permutations with the $4$ numbers, subtracting those who had $4$ in the first place and those who had $1$ in their 4th place, and adding those who had $4$ in their first place and $1$ in their 4th place, to avoid subtracting them twice: $4!-3!-3!+2 =

2894403,What is this 2D division algebra?,"Consider the set $A$ of 2-tuples of real values $(a,b)$, equipped with an addition defined as
$$ (a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c,b+d)$$
and multiplication defined as
$$ (a,b) \times (c,d) = (ac+bd,ad-bc).$$ What is this weird little thing? This algebra has some nice properties. For instance: on both sides multiplication distributes across addition, because the multiplication is bilinear it is a division algebra, as there are no zero divisors a subset is isomorphic to the reals,  $(a,0) \leftrightarrow a$ has a positive definite quadratic form
$$ (a,b)\times(a,b) = (a^2+b^2,0) $$ identity on left, $(1,0)\times(a,b) = (a,b)$ But it has some weird properties: there is no identity for multiplication on the right $z=(0,1)$ anti-commutes with the subset noted above as being isomorphic to the reals
$$ (a,0)\times z + z \times (a,0) = (0,0)$$ the multiplication is not associative the multiplication is not even power associative, as seen with $z=(0,1)$, $$ z\times(z\times z) = -(z\times z)\times z$$ the center is trivial, as only $(0,0)$ commutes with all elements. So I'm not sure on the terminology, but this can also be viewed as ""extending"" the Reals with an exotic sqrt of 1, 
$$ z^2 = 1,$$
which anti-commutes with multiplication of reals,
$$\forall a \in \mathbb{R} : az+za=0.$$
Then the set $A = \{a+bz : a,b \in \mathbb{R}\}$. After playing with it a bit I realized it can also be viewed as taking the complex numbers and defining the operation: 
$$x \times y = x^*\ y$$ Which means this is also like taking a 1D complex Hilbert space, and treating the inner product as if it is a multiplication because in this case the scalar and vector are the same dimension. This bizarre little thing is simple enough that I assume it has been studied before. Does it have a name? Also, regardless if it has a name, I'd like to know the proper terminology for describing this. Because of the relation to complex numbers, would mathematicians consider it ""just the complex numbers"" since the operations can be represented with complex numbers? It at least isn't isomorphic to the complex numbers, correct? Would you consider this a 2D real division algebra distinct from the complex numbers? Since the structure was defined in terms of operations on the reals, and the elements are a tuple of reals, it feels like this would be some-object ""over the Reals"". Maybe a left semimodule over the Reals. Or does the phrase ""over the reals"" require that the Reals commute with everything? Similarly, if you object to my use of terminology in the discussion of the properties, I'd appreciate if you could point that out and suggest more reasonable terminology with explanation.","['abstract-algebra', 'division-algebras']"

2894626,Show $\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \sin(ax) \log\Big(\Big| \frac{x+1}{x-1} \Big|\Big) = \frac{2 \pi \sin(a)}{a}$,"I'm interested in integrals of the form $\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx f(x) \log(\big| \frac{x+1}{x-1} \big|)$. It's particularly nice when f(x) has definite parity, since $\log(\big| \frac{x+1}{x-1} \big|)$ is odd. My question is how to show $$I \equiv \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \sin(ax) \log\Big(\Big| \frac{x+1}{x-1} \Big|\Big) = \frac{2 \pi \sin(a)}{a}$$ for $a>0$. I'm trying to use complex methods to solve the integral, but I keep finding an answer of 0 owing to the lack of residues. I suspect that I'm not being careful enough about divergences and phase, and please point out if you see a mistake in the comments. Here's my work so far: $$I = \Re \Big(\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx \sin(ax) \log\Big(\frac{x+1}{x-1} \Big) \Big)$$ I justify this line since removing the absolute value bars merely adds a finite imaginary component from the integral between $-1 < x < 1$. Next, $$I = -\frac{1}{2}\Re \Big(i\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\, e^{iax} \log\Big(\frac{x+1}{x-1} \Big) -i\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\, e^{-iax} \log\Big(\frac{x+1}{x-1} \Big) \Big).$$ I believe it's kosher to split the integral into two, because each split integral converges on its own by Dirichlet's test for $|x|>1$ . Next, I substitute $x \rightarrow -x$ in the second integral, and I find $$I = -\frac{1}{2}\Re \Big(i\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\, e^{iax}\, \Big(\log\Big(\frac{x+1}{x-1}\Big)-\log\Big(\frac{-x+1}{-x-1} \Big) \Big).$$ Combining the logarithms yields $$I = -\Re \Big(i\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\, e^{iax} \log\Big(\frac{x+1}{x-1}\Big) \Big).$$
The line above is where I wonder if some subtlety of the phase of the arguments of the logarithm was lost on me. In particular, I find that if I should have an extra '$\pi i $' added onto the logarithm, I would have the anticipated result. 
Continuing nonetheless, to evaluate the integral $J \equiv \int_{-\infty}^\infty dx\, e^{iax} \log\Big(\frac{x+1}{x-1}\Big)$, I choose to evaluate $$K \equiv \oint dz\, e^{iaz} \log\Big(\frac{z+1}{z-1}\Big) $$ on the semicircle contour in the UHP, pictured below. I do not believe the branch cut I chose matters too much, since I chose the cut along the x-axis, but it could be that this choice of branch was somehow inconsistent with how I handled merging the logarithms above. The shrinking semi-circles about -1 and 1 contribute nothing. There aren't any residues inside, so $K=0$. Thus my integral $J$ must be equal to the upper arc as $R$ goes to infinity. Along the upper arc, note that taking the radius $R$ of the arc outward sends $\log\Big(\frac{z+1}{z-1}\Big) \rightarrow 0 $ as $\frac{1}{R}$. This, coupled with Jordan's lemma, kills the upper arc as the radius goes to infinity. Thus we find that $J=0$ and hence $I=0$, in contradiction to what we wished to show.

2894674,Does there exist irreducible polynomials of each degree over arbitrary field?,"Let $F$ be an arbitrary field such that $[\overline{F}: F]=\infty$. Here $\overline{F}$ denotes the algebraic closure. The question in the title of this post can be rephrased as: Question 1 . For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, can we find a field extension $L$ of $F$ such that $[L:F]=n$? Let me remark that the condition $[\overline{F}: F]=\infty$ is necessary. Indeed, by the Artin-Schreier theorem , the condition $[\overline{F}:F]<\infty$ in fact forces $[\overline{F}:F]=2$, in which case $F$ can only have extensions of degree at most $2$. I suspect that Question 1 may have a negative answer for small values of $n$, so I am happy to consider the weaker problem: Question 2 .  Does there exist a number $n_0$ (that only depends on $F$) such that for each $n\geq n_0$, there exists a field extension $L$ of $F$ such that $[L:F]=n$? In case there are any separability issues, feel free to assume that $F$ is perfect. Added later: Looks like this question has already been asked. See this MSE thread .

2894675,Non-constant entire functions,"Question: If $g$ is a non-constant entire function does it follow that $G_1(z)=g(z)-g\left(z+e^{g(z)}\right)$ is non-constant? The reason I care is it would imply Prop 3 below, which in turn implies Prop 1, giving a proof that might seem better motivated than the proof here . It seems at least plausible. The only thought I've had is a little vague: $-G_1(z)$ is something somewhat like $g'(z)e^{g(z)}$. And $g'e^g$ cannot  be constant:  If $g'e^g=c$ then $e^g=cz+d$. So $cz+d$ has no zero, hence $c=0$, and it follows that $g$ is constant. The problem is that the size of $g'(z)e^{g(z)}+G_1(z)$ depends on the size of $e^g$ and also on the size of $g''$... Context: The other day at the link above I learned something totally new to me: Prop 1. Suppose $f$ is entire. Then $f\circ f$ has no fixed point if and only if $f$ is a nontrivial translation ($f(z)=z+b$, $b\ne0$.) The obvious question is when $f$ has a fixed point - this is trivial: Prop 2. The entire function $f$ has no fixed point if and only if $f(z)=z+e^{g(z)}$ for some entire function $g$. (Proof: $f$ has no fixed point if and only if $f(z)-z$ has no zero...) It occurred to me to try to use Prop 2 to prove Prop 1: Suppose $f\circ f$ has no fixed point. Then $f$ has no  fixed point, so $f(z)=z+e^{g(z)}$, and now we have something to work with in investigating when $f\circ f$ has a fixed point... It  turns out that to get to Prop 1 from Prop 2 we need this: Prop  3 If $g$ is a non-constant entire function then $G_2(z)=e^{g(z)}+e^{g\left(z+e^{g(z)}\right)}$ has a zero. Proving two assertions above: If the answer to the question is yes then Prop 3 follows: If $G_1$ is non-constant then little  Picard shows that there exist $k\in\Bbb Z$ and $z\in\Bbb C$ with $G_1(z)=(2k+1)\pi i$: this shows that $G_2(z)=0$. Prop  3 implies Prop 1: Suppose $f\circ f$ has no FP Then $f$ has no FP, so $f(z)=z+e^{g(z)}$. But now $f(f(z))=z+G_2(z)$,  so saying $f\circ f$ has no FP is saying exactly that $G_2$ has no zero. So Prop 3 implies that $g$ is constant, hence $f$ is a non-trivial translation. In fact the two are equivalent (and hence Prop 3 is in fact true): Prop 1 implies  Prop 3: Say $g$ is non-constant and let $f(z)=z+e^{g(z)}$. Then $f$ is not a translation, so $f\circ f$ has a FP, hence as before $G_2$ has a zero. My ""might seem better motivated"" might be worth justifying, given the bizarre appearance of Prop 3. It's  really perfectly natural: If we're investigating when $f\circ f$ has a FP it's natural to first wonder when $f$ has a FP. Then Prop 2 is trivial, and given Prop 2 the question of when $f\circ f$ has a FP leads naturally to Prop 3, since $f(f(z))=z+G_2(z)$. (And now saying $G_2$ has a zero is clearly equivalent to saying $G_1(z)=(2k+1)\pi i$ for some $z$, and to prove that we only need to show that $G_1$ is non-constant, hence the question ...) Perfectly clear, qed.","['complex-analysis', 'entire-functions']"
2894680,Intuition of error in Taylor appoximation and finding error in approximation of a function by a constant function,"I am reading up on Taylor approximation of a function and I'm trying to develop the intuition for the remainder, when approximating a function with $n^{th}$ degree polynomial which has a continuous $(n+1)^{th}$ derivate, given by
     $\frac{1}{n!}\int_{a}^{x} (x - t)^nf^{(n+1)}(t)dt$ My intuition of linear approximation is this: We used a constant first derivate to evaluate at x (since we approximate f at a). Hence, we have to use the information about rate of rate of change from the any point $ t \in (a,x)$ to compensate for this error. Specifically, the second derivative gives the difference between the first derivatives at two successive points and scales it over unit interval. Therefore, f''(t) corrects for error at t but introduces new error from (t, x) which is corrected with the same logic at the next point. Thus, the integral given above. Is this correct? My reasoning is because if I begin the approximation using a constant function and reason that by using the rate of change at every point, a function can be reconstructed starting from any point. But if I try to use the above integral to compute the error in estimates for the constant function, it doesn't work because of the $(-t)$. Is there a formula to estimate the error including the constant case? I understand the proof of the integral using integration by parts (and requirement of the continuity of $f^{(n+1)}(x)$ is to be able to use the first fundamental theorem).

However, it seems hard to find the expression / recurrence formula for $f$ and show it converges to $\dfrac{\sqrt2}2$. 2nd attempt Again we let $\{a_n\}$ be the sequence. Consider the continued fraction:

\sqrt2=1+\underset{i=1}{\overset{\infty}{\mathrm K}} ~ \frac{1}{2}=1+\cfrac1{2+\cfrac1{2+\cfrac1{2+\cfrac1{\ddots}}}}.

Obviously $b_m$ converges to $\dfrac{\sqrt2}2$. Then we just need to show that $a_n$ is between $b_m$ and $b_{m+1}$ for big $m$ and $n$ ( $m$ depends on $n$), which seems complicated.","['infinite-product', 'limits', 'continued-fractions', 'sequences-and-series']"

My attempt: (i) If $k$ is  infinite, then the collection of ideals of the form $(x-a) \forall a \in k$ will suffice. For finite fields I argue by contradiction.

Actually i don't have any idea except to get that derivatives manually one by one. Also, i've tried to get it with computer help, the function i get is something terrible.

2894944,Find the range of values of $k$ such that $f(x)$ is onto,"I am trying to solve the below problem in pre-calculus, I give below the steps I followed , I am stuck as it gets very complicated , need help in solution. A function $f : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ is defined by $$f(x) = \frac{kx^2+6x-8}{k+6x-8x^2}.$$ Find the intervals of values of $k$ such that $f$ is onto. The answer given in the book is $2 \leq k \leq14$. I started by trying to find the range of the function and find the values of k such that the range is = $\mathbb R$ ( that is range = co domain , in this case co domain is $\mathbb R$ and hence has to prove that range = $\mathbb R$) Let $$y = \frac{kx^2+6x-8}{k+6x-8x^2}$$ 
Rearranging and grouping gives
$$(k+8y)x^2 + 6(1-y)x - (8+ky) = 0.$$ 
This is quadratic in $x$ and for $x$ to be real $det(x) \geq 0$, which requires $$36(1-y)^2+4(k+8y)(8+ky) \geq 0.$$ Rearranging and grouping this equation gives 
$$(36+32k)y^2+(4k^2+184)y+(36+32k) \geq 0.$$
Now I have to find the range of values of $k$ such that the above expression is $\geq 0$. Totally stuck here. Please help. Also, is there any other easier way of arriving at the range of $k$ ?","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions', 'rational-functions']"
2894957,Interesting limit: $I(n)=\lim_{x \to 0} (e^x-1)^{-n} - \left(\frac{x}{1!}+\frac {x^2}{2!}+\dotsb+\frac{x^n}{n!}\right)^{-n}$,"I recently came up with a problem which I think is quite interesting and here it is. Let $$I(n)=\lim_{x\to 0} \left(\frac {1}{(e^x-1)^n} -\frac {1}{\left(\frac {x}{1!}+\frac {x^2}{2!}+\frac {x^3}{3!}+\cdots +\frac {x^n}{n!}\right)^n}\right) $$ Evaluate $I(n)$ in terms of $n$ . Now I tried a lot of messing ups with this monster.  Tried L'Hospital,  Squeeze theorem, Stolz-Cesaro,  Binomial theorem and Multinomial theorem,  etc.  But couldn't reach the general form. On writing out few terms using Wolfy I get $I(1)=\frac {-1}{2}$ , $I(2)=\frac {-1}{3}$ , $I(3)=\frac {-1}{8}$ , $I(4)=\frac {-1}{30}$ and so on On spending some time on these observations I could conjecture that $$I(n)=\frac {-n}{(n+1)!}$$ and tried this formula to check whether it was consistent with other values of $n$ and it indeed was.  So Now I have the general form but no proof to it. And something which is quite interesting in this question is that the first fraction has a denominator with a function raised to power $n$ while the denominator of second fraction is nothing but the Maclaurin expansion of that function with finite terms (here $n$ terms)  raised to power of $n$ . So I tried to test it with some other functions and the results impressed me a lot. 1) $$J(n)=\lim_{x\to 0} \left(\frac {1}{(\ln (1+x))^n} -\frac {1}{\left(x-\frac {x^2}{2}+\frac {x^3}{3}-\cdots +\frac {(-1)^{n+1} x^n}{n}\right)^n}\right) =\frac {(-1)^{n+1}n}{n+1}$$ 2) $$G(n)=\lim_{x\to 0} \left(\frac {1}{(\arccos x-\frac {\pi}{2})^n} -\frac {1}{\left(\underbrace{\frac {x}{1}+\frac {x^3}{6}+\frac {3x^5}{40}+\frac {5x^7}{112}+\cdots}_{\text {n terms}}\right)^n}\right) $$ Now this limit is more interesting because it equals $0$ for all even natural $n$ and it doesn't exist for any odd natural $n$ Now what I actually want is a proper method to solve such problems. You can take any of top 2 limits ( i.e of $(e^x-1)$ or $\ln (1+x)$ ) to demonstrate your method. Thanks in advance for your attention.","['limits', 'calculus', 'taylor-expansion']"
2894959,Determining the limit of $x_{n+1} = x_n + 1/(3 x_n^2)$,"Let $\{x_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence such that 
  $$
  x_1 > 0,
  \qquad
  x_{n+1} = x_n + \frac{1}{3 x_n^2}
$$
  Check whether the sequence converges, and if so find its limit. So I know that a sequence converges if it is bounded and monotone. So I proved those two (hopefully correct): Proving that $x_n > 0$ for all $n$: Base: $x_1 > 0$ Hypothesis: $x_n > 0$ Step:
  $$
           \text{$x_n > 0$ and $\frac{1}{3 x_n^2} > 0$}
  \implies x_n + \frac{1}{3 x_n^2} > 0
  \implies x_{n+1} > 0
$$ Proving that the sequence is monotone increasing:
  $$
    x_{n+1} - x_n
  = x_n + \frac{1}{3 x_n^2} - x_n
  = \frac{1}{3 x_n^2}
  > 0
  \qquad
  \text{for all $n$}
$$ Now, I've tried finding the limit, like this:
$$
           \exists \alpha = \lim_{x \to \infty} x_{n+1}
  \implies \alpha = \alpha + \frac{1}{3 \alpha^2}
  \implies \frac{1}{3 \alpha^2} = 0
