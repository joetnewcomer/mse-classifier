3557359,Does there exist a volume-preserving diffeomorphism of the disk without conformal points?,"This question is related to this one , though is supposed to be easier. Let $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ be the closed unit disk. Does there exist a smooth volume-preserving diffeomorphism $f:D \to D$ such that the singular values of $df$ are everywhere distinct? i.e. I want $\sigma_1(df_p) \neq \sigma_2(df_p)$ for every $p \in D$ , and the product $\sigma_1(df)\sigma_2(df)=1$ to be constant. This answer provides the following example for such a diffeomorphism $D\setminus \{0\} \to D \setminus \{0\}$ with the required properties: $f_c: (r,\theta)\to r\big(\cos(\theta+c\log(r)), \sin(\theta+c\log (r))\big),\;\; $ (for every non-zero $c Ö¿\in \mathbb R$ we get an example). Edit-a description of a possible topological obstruction: Set $\mathcal{NC}:=\{ A \in M_2(\mathbb{R}) \, |    \det A \ge 0 \, \,\text{ and } \, A \text{ is not conformal} \,\}$ , where by a non-conformal matrix, I refer to a matrix whose singular values are distinct. (i.e. I allow non-zero singular matrices in $\mathcal{NC}$ ). Suppose that such an $f \in \text{Diff}(D)$ exists. Then $df|_{\partial D}:\partial D \to \mathcal{NC}$ is homotopic to a constant. $df|_{\partial D}$ maps $T\partial D$ to itself, and in particular, at a specific point $\theta \in \mathbb{S}^1$ , $(df|_{\partial D})_{\theta}(T_{\theta}\partial D)=T_{f(\theta)}\partial D$ . So, thinking on $e_2$ as an element of $T_{(0,1)}\partial D$ , we have $R_{f(\theta)}^{-1} \circ df_{\theta} \circ R_{\theta}(e_2)=\lambda(\theta) e_2$ , for some positive factor $\lambda(\theta)$ . Setting $A_{\theta}:=R_{f(\theta)}^{-1} \circ df_{\theta} \circ R_{\theta}$ , and $$\mathcal{F}:=\{ A \in \text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R}) \, | \, Ae_2 \in \operatorname{span}(e_2) \, \, \text{ and } \, \, A \, \text{ is not conformal} \,\},$$ we get $$ df_{\theta} =R_{f(\theta)} \circ A_{\theta} \circ R_{-\theta}, \, \, \, A_{\theta}: \partial D \to \mathcal{F}. \tag{1}$$ If $\mathcal{F}$ were contractible in $\mathcal{NC}$ , we could deform $A_{\theta}$ to a constant map $ \partial D \to \mathcal{NC}$ . Thus, by equation $(1)$ , $df|_{\partial D}$ would be homotopic to the map $\theta \to R_{f(\theta)} \circ A \circ R_{-\theta}$ for some constant non-conformal matrix $A \in \mathcal{NC}$ . Writing $A=R_{\alpha} \Sigma R_{\beta}$ where $\Sigma$ is non-negative and diagonal, we would get that $df|_{\partial D}$ is homotopic to $\theta \to R_{f(\theta)+\alpha} \circ \Sigma \circ R_{-\theta+\beta}.$ On the space of non-conformal matrices $\mathcal{NC}$ , there is a continuous map* $H:\mathcal{NC} \to \mathbb{S}^1$ , given by $H(R_{\phi} \Sigma R_{\theta})= R_{2\theta}$ . This leads to a contradiction to the contractibility of $df|_{\partial D}$ : Indeed, if it were homotopic to a constant, then so would the map $\theta \to R_{f(\theta)+\alpha} \circ \Sigma \circ R_{-\theta+\beta}.$ Composing it with $H$ , we obtain the map $\theta \to R_{-2\theta+2\beta}$ , or $\theta \to -2\theta$ , which is not homotopic to a constant. Since $\mathcal{F}$ is not contractible in $\mathcal{NC}$ , this argument fails. However, perhaps a more refined topological argument could obtain more, I don't know. *The map $H$ is well-defined, since $U\Sigma V^T=(-U)\Sigma (-V)^T$ , and this is the only ambiguity in $U,V$ for a matrix in $\mathcal{NC}$ . Thus $\theta$ is well defined up to an addition of $\pi$ .","['real-analysis', 'quasiconformal-maps', 'differential-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

3557693,"Translating ""at most $n$ other people"" / ""exactly $n$ other people"" (besides possibly himself) into predicate formulas","Problem (Adapted from ""Mathematics for Computer Science"", Lehman, Leighton, Meyers, 2018.) Translate the following sentences into predicate formulas: (a) There is a student who has e-mailed at most two other people in the class, besides possibly himself. (b) There is a student who has e-mailed exactly two other people in the class, besides possibly himself. The domain of discourse are the students in the class. Use the predicate $E(x,y)$ to mean that "" $x$ has sent e-mail to $y$ "". Solution attempt (a) The sentence can be rephrased as: ""There is a student who did not e-mail 3 or more people in the class, besides possibly himself"". Or, in other words: ""There is a student $x$ such that, for all students $y_1,y_2,y_3$ , if $x$ has e-mailed all three of $y_1,y_2,y_3$ , then at least two of $y_1,y_2,y_3$ are equal to each other, or at least one of $y_1,y_2,y_3$ is equal to $x$ "". So, this can be expressed as: $\exists x \forall{y_1,y_2,y_3} \left[ E(x,y_1) \land E(x,y_2) \land E(x,y_3)) \implies (y_1=y_2 \lor y_1 = y_3 \lor y_2=y_3 \lor y_1=x \lor y_2=x \lor y_3=x ) \right]$ The value of this predicate formula is false if all students have e-mailed at least three distinct students $y_1,y_2,y_3$ all of which are different from $x$ . (b) Two solution attempts: The first attempt is based on rephrasing the sentence as: ""There are three distinct students $x,y,z$ such that $x$ e-mailed both $y$ and $z$ and, for all students $w$ , if $x$ has e-mailed $w$ , then $w$ is equal to one of $x,y,z$ "": $ \exists{x,y,z} \forall w \left[ E(x,y) \land E(x,z) \land y\neq z \land y\neq x \land z\neq x \land (E(x,w) \implies w=x\lor w=y\lor w=z) \right] $ The second attempt is based on rephrasing the sentence as: ""There are three distinct students $x,y,z$ such that, for all students $w$ : $x$ has e-mailed $w$ exactly when $w$ is equal to one of $x,y,z$ , or $w=x$ ( $x$ has possibly e-mailed himself)"". $ \exists{x,y,z} \forall w \left[ w=x\lor (y\neq z \land y\neq x \land z\neq x

3557778,Is finding martingales black magic?,"I've recently been learning about the power of martingales for calculating various stochastic quantities. This is a bit of a meta question: is coming up with the right martingale for the quantity you want just complete black magic? As an example, consider an unbiased random walk, where we start at position $x$ and want the probability we either hit $0$ or $L$ . In this case (after shifting the start to $0$ and left/right limits to $-x$ and $L-x$ ) a good martingale to use for the calculation is $$S_n=\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$ where $X_i$ is the random variable of the steps ( $X_i=\pm 1$ with equal probability). However, this is not a martingale when the walk is biased, i.e. $X_n=+1$ with probability $p$ and $X_n=-1$ with probability $q=1-p$ . Then it turns out that we should use a different martingale for the calculation, namely $$Y_n=\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}.$$ How does one come up with the appropriate martingale to calculate a given quantity in general? Edit: fixed definition of appropriate martingale for unbiased case above, thank you commenters...","['martingales', 'probability']"
3557790,"If a random variable $X$ is such that $P(X=0)<1,$ then there is an $\varepsilon>0$ with $P(\vert X\vert>\varepsilon)>0$","$\textbf{The Problem:}$ Show that if a random variable $X$ is such that $P(X=0)<1,$ then there is an $\varepsilon>0$ with $P(\vert X\vert>\varepsilon)>0.$ $\textbf{My Proof:}$ Since $P(X=0)<1,$ we have that $0<P(\{X=0\}^\complement)=P(\vert X\vert>0)\leq1$ . Now suppose that no such $\varepsilon>0$ exists. Then for all $n\in\mathbb N$ we have $P\left(\vert X\vert>\frac{1}{n}\right)=0$ . Now the sequence $\left(\left\{\vert X\vert>\frac{1}{n}\right\}\right)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ is nested with $\left\{\vert X\vert>\frac{1}{n}\right\}\nearrow\{\vert X\vert>0\}.$ To see this, note that for $n\in\mathbb N$ we have that if $\vert X(\omega)\vert>\frac{1}{n}$ , then $\vert  X(\omega)\vert>\frac{1}{n+1}$ , so $\left\{\vert X\vert>\frac{1}{n}\right\}\subseteq\left\{\vert X\vert>\frac{1}{n+1}\right\}$ . Now let $\omega\in\bigcup_n\left\{\vert X\vert>\frac{1}{n}\right\}.$ Then there is $n\in\mathbb N$ such that $\vert X(\omega)\vert>\frac{1}{n}$ , and hence $\vert X(\omega)\vert>0$ . Thus, $\bigcup_n\left\{\vert X\vert>\frac{1}{n}\right\}\subseteq\{\vert X\vert>0\}.$ For the reverse inclusion let $\omega\in\{\vert X\vert>0\}.$ Then by the Archimedean property there exists $n\in\mathbb N$ such that $\vert X(\omega)\vert>\frac{1}{n}$ , so $\omega\in\bigcup_n\left\{\vert X\vert>\frac{1}{n}\right\}.$ Hence, $\bigcup_n\left\{\vert X\vert>\frac{1}{n}\right\}=\{\vert X\vert>0\}.$ Thus, the continuity of the probability measure implies that $$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}P\left(\left\{\vert X\vert>\frac{1}{n}\right\}\right)=P(\vert X\vert>0)=0,$$ which is a contradiction. The result follows. Do you agree with the proof above? If not, it would be much appreciated if anyone could please point out where the proof goes wrong. Thank you for your time.","['solution-verification', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

3557931,Japanese Temple Geometry Problem: Two tangent lines and three tangent circles.,"I am working on my Senior Thesis for my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics. My project involves Japanese San Gaku problems, and moving said problems from Euclidean Geometry to Spherical and Hyperbolic Geometry. I've been working on a particular problem for weeks now. The problem is stated as follows: Problem 1.2.5: A circle $O(r)$ has its center on a line $m$ , and has a tangent line $\ell$ . The circles $O_1(r_1)$ and $O_2(r_2)$ both touch $O(r)$ externally and also the lines $\ell$ and $m$ . Show that \begin{align*}
4r=r_1+6\sqrt{r_1r_2}+r_2.
\end{align*} I have worked very hard on this and have come up with a lot of stuff. One very useful result is the following: Useful Result. Given tangent circles $O_1(r_1)$ and $O_2(r_2)$ , and a line $AB$ tangent to $O_1$ at $A$ and to $O_2$ at $B$ , it follows that $$|AB| = 2\sqrt{r_1 r_2}$$ See Useful Result . Additionally, I've managed to construct the figure in Geogebra. This is quite a difficult task unless you know what you're doing (which I did not at first!). Here is what the figure looks like after construction . By equating $AC$ and $A'C'$ in this image , I've been able to solve the problem, but not by hand. After using the Useful Result to rewrite $AC$ , and a clever usage of the Pythagorean Theorem to write $A'C'$ in terms of $r$ , $r_1$ , and $r_2$ , I get an algebraic nightmare. Mathematica can solve it for $r$ and provide us with the desired result, but that's a little unsatisfying. This problem comes from the book Japanese Temple Geometry Problems: San Gaku by H. Fukagwa and D. Pede. I can't find the problem anywhere online, and the ""solution"" in the back only says ""Written on a surviving tablet in the Yagamata prefecture in 1823."" If some incredibly smart individual out there could help me come up with a better way of solving this problem, I would be forever in your favor!","['sangaku', 'tangent-line', 'circles', 'geometry']"
3557935,$1-1+1-1+1-1+\cdots$ and $1-2+3-4+5-6+7-\cdots$ and Taylor's theorem,"Some background. I was exploring the series expansion for $\ln(1+\cos x)$ in an attempt to expand it (at least, initially!) up to the third non-zero term, and along the way I unexpectedly stumbled upon the infinite series $1-1+1-1+...$ and $1-2+3-4+5-6+7-...$ . Then I thought to expand it instead via a different method, as I had divergent series as coefficients which obviously wouldn't have helped in determining the terms exactly. The coefficients via this method (as expected) came out as reals, and I was then, out of curiosity, tempted to equate these respectively, arriving at a very unexpected (in this context) result: $1-1+1-1+1-1+1-...=\frac{1}{2}$ and $1-2+3-4+5-6+...=\frac{1}{4}$ . What caught me as particularly surprising is that these are well-known results for the sums via other methodologies. The ""proof"" is below. By Taylor's theorem, substituting the series for $\ln(1+x)$ and $\cos x$ : \begin{align}
\ln(1+\cos x)
&=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}\left({\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k}x^{2k}}{(2k)!}}\right)^{n}\right)\\
&=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}\left(1-\frac{x^2}2+\frac{x^4}{24}-\cdots\right)^n\right)\\
\end{align} We are only concerned with the first 3 terms overall, and terms whose order is 6 or above cannot contribute towards the coefficients of the lower order terms (0,2,4 in this case). So consider $\left(1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}\right)^n$ , ignoring order 6 or higher terms, for $n\in\mathbb{Z_{>0}}$ : \begin{align}
\left(1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}\right)^2
&=\ 1-\frac{2x^2}{2}+\frac{8x^4}{24}-\cdots\\
\left(1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}\right)^3
&=\ 1-\frac{3x^2}{2}+\frac{21x^4}{24}-\cdots\\
\left(1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}\right)^4
&=\ 1-\frac{4x^2}{2}+\frac{40x^4}{24}-\cdots\\
\end{align} and so on. Conjecture that (from the patterns in the coefficients) $$\left(1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}\right)^m=1-\frac{mx^2}{2}+\frac{am^2+bm+c}{24}x^4-\cdots$$ for some $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}$ . We know some $x^4$ coefficients from the manual calculations, so we can solve for a, b, c (using m = 1, 2, 3): $$a+b+c=1$$ $$4a+2b+c=8$$ $$9a+3b+c=21$$ $$\implies a=3,b=-2,c=0$$ $$\therefore\left(1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}\right)^m=1-\frac{mx^2}{2}+\frac{3m^2-2m}{24}x^4-\cdots$$ for m = 1, 2, 3. Assuming this as an inductive hypothesis for some $m\in\mathbb{Z_{>0}}$ , we have: \begin{align}
\left(1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}\right)^{m+1}
&=\left(1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24})^m(1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}\right)\\
&=\left(1-\frac{mx^2}{2}+\frac{3m^2-2m}{24}x^4-\cdots\right)\left(1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}\right)\\
&=1-\frac{m+1}{2}x^2+\frac{3m^2-2m+6m+1}{24}x^4-\cdots\\
&=1-\frac{m+1}{2}x^2+\frac{3(m+1)^2-2(m+1)}{24}x^4-\cdots\\
\end{align} $$\therefore\left(1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}\right)^m=1-\frac{mx^2}{2}+\frac{3m^2-2m}{24}x^4-\cdots\forall{m}\in\mathbb{Z_{>0}}$$ by mathematical induction. Substituting this expansion back into the initial series expression, ignoring any terms in $x^6$ or higher (again because these terms will not contribute towards lower order coefficients): \begin{align}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}(1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24})^n\right)
&=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}\left(1-\frac{nx^2}{2}+\frac{3n^2-2n}{24}x^4\right)\right)\\
&=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}-\frac{x^2}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}+\frac{x^4}{24}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(3n-2)(-1)^{n-1}\\
&=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}-\frac{x^2}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}+\frac{x^4}{24}\left(3\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n(-1)^{n-1}-2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}\right)\\
\end{align} Now we've expressed the first 3 terms with the coefficients as series, let's expand it in a different way. \begin{align}
\ln(1+\cos x)
&=\ln(2+(\cos x-1))\\
&=\ln\left(2\left(1+\frac{1}{2}\left(\cos x-1\right)\right)\right)\\
&=\ln2+\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{2}(\cos x-1)\right)\\
&=\ln2+\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}\left(\frac{1}{2}{\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k}x^{2k}}{(2k)!}}\right)^n\right)\\
&=\ln2+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{\left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^{n-1}}{n}\left(-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}-\cdots\right)^n\right)\\
&=\ln2+\frac{1}{2}\left(\left(-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}-\frac{x^6}{720}+\cdots\right)-\frac{1}{4}\left(-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}-\frac{x^6}{720}+\cdots\right)^2+\cdots\right)\\
\end{align} Here, we can leave from consideration any of the order 6 or higher terms in the first ""bracket"", any of the order 4 or higher terms in the second ""bracket"" and all terms in any subsequent ""bracket"" for the purpose of our expansion (only looking for the first 3 terms). None of these will contribute towards the coefficients of the first few terms, as the power of the ""bracket"" is incrementing by 1 at each step. We get: \begin{align}
\ln(1+\cos x)
&=\ln2+\frac{1}{2}\left(\left(-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}\right)-\frac{1}{4}\left(-\frac{x^2}{2}\right)^2+\cdots\right)\\
&=\ln2-\frac{x^2}{4}-\frac{x^4}{96}+\cdots\\
\end{align} Now that we have 2 different expressions for $\ln(1+\cos x)$ , we can compare their coefficients: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}-\frac{x^2}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}+\frac{x^4}{24}(3\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n(-1)^{n-1}-2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1})=\ln2-\frac{x^2}{4}-\frac{x^4}{96}$$ From this: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}=\ln2;$$ $$-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}=-\frac{1}{4}\implies\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}=\frac{1}{2};$$ $$\frac{1}{24}\left(3\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n(-1)^{n-1}-2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}\right)=-\frac{1}{96}$$ $$\implies3\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n(-1)^{n-1}-2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=-\frac{1}{4}\implies\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n(-1)^{n-1}=\frac{1}{4}$$ So the reason for the post was, why is it that this arrives at said conclusions, and where do the flaws in the method lie? What's the catch? These are obviously quite unintuitive (but interesting, nonetheless) values for such series, arrived at in a completely unforeseen (to me, at least) way. Would highly appreciate any clarifications/explanations. P.S - I'm an A-level/high-school student, so if there are obvious issues then apologies; I haven't done any analysis yet.","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'taylor-expansion', 'sequences-and-series', 'power-series']"
3558249,Validating solution to PDE using integral transforms,"I'm trying to obtain the analytical solution of a Fokker-Planck PDE, which the solution is a probability density function, and then use this to find the mean of some quantity in the paper. The paper has a solution which they say can be found via Mehler-Fock transform. Their solution which I am trying to obtain reads $$P_{\varepsilon}(L,u) = \frac{e^{-\varepsilon^2sL/4}}{2\sqrt{2\pi}(\varepsilon^2sL)^{\frac32}}\int_{u}^{\infty}\frac{xe^{-x^2/(\varepsilon^2sL)}}{\sqrt{\cosh{(x)}-\cosh{(u)}}}dx.$$ I obtain a different solution to this one. $\textbf{My attempt:}$ The equation in the paper reads \begin{align}
\frac{\partial P_\varepsilon}{\partial L} = \varepsilon^2s\frac{\partial}{\partial u}\bigg[(u^2-1)\frac{\partial P_\varepsilon}{\partial u}\bigg], \quad P_\varepsilon(L=0,u) = \delta(u-1).
\end{align} This is a $1d$ Fokker-Planck equation, where $P_\varepsilon(L,u)$ is a probability density for some diffusion Markov process. To solve this equation, note that the right hand side is simply a Legendre differential equation. Denote the legendre function of the first kind via \begin{align}
	\frac{d}{du}(u^2-1)\frac{d}{du}P_{-\frac12+i\mu}(u) = -\bigg(\mu^2+\frac14\bigg)P_{-\frac12+i\mu}(u),
\end{align} which has an integral representation \begin{align}
	P_{-\frac12+i\mu}(u) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\cosh{(\pi\mu)}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\cos{(\mu\tau)}}{\sqrt{\cosh{(\tau)}+u}}d\tau.
\end{align} Now use the Mehler-Fock transform. The Mehler-Fock transform of an integrble function $f$ defined on $[1,\infty)$ is the function $\check f$ defined on $[0,\infty)$ where \begin{align}
\hat{f}(\mu) = \int_{1}^{\infty}f(u) P_{-\frac12+i\mu}(u)\,du,
\end{align} with inverse transform \begin{align}
	f(u) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\check{f}(\mu)\mu\tanh{(\mu\pi)}P_{-\frac12+i\mu}(u)\,d\mu.
\end{align} Applying the Mehler-Fock transform to the PDF $P_\varepsilon(L,u)$ gives \begin{align}
	\check p(L,\mu) = \int_{1}^{\infty}p(L,u)P_{-\frac12+i\mu}(u)du.
\end{align} Taking a partial derivative in $L$ gives \begin{align}
	\frac{\partial\check p}{\partial L}(L,\mu) = \varepsilon^2s\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{\partial}{\partial u}\bigg[(u^2-1)\frac{\partial p}{\partial u}(L,u)\bigg]P_{-\frac12+i\mu}(u)du.

	\frac{\partial\check p}{\partial L}(L,\mu) = \varepsilon^2s\int_{1}^{\infty}p(L,u)\frac{\partial}{\partial u}\bigg[(u^2-1)\frac{\partial P_{-\frac12+i\mu}}{\partial u}(u)\bigg]du.
\end{align} Using the ODE $(2)$ which satisfies the Legendre function, the Mehler-Fock transform satisfies the ODE \begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \check p}{\partial L}(L,\mu) = -\varepsilon^2s\bigg(\mu^2+\frac14\bigg)\check p(L,\mu), \quad \check p(L=0,\mu) = 1.
\end{align} Then \begin{align}
	\check p(L,\mu) = \exp{\bigg(-\bigg(\mu^2+\frac14\bigg)L\varepsilon^2s\bigg)}.
\end{align} Hence, the solution to $(1)$ is \begin{align}\nonumber
	P_\varepsilon(L,u) &= \int_{0}^{\infty}\mu\tanh{(\mu\pi)}P_{-\frac12+i\mu}(u)\exp{\bigg(-\bigg(\mu^2+\frac14\bigg)L\varepsilon^2s\bigg)}d\mu \\
	&= \int_{0}^{\infty}\mu\tanh{(\mu\pi)}P_{-\frac12+i\mu}(u) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\cosh{(\pi\mu)}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\cos{(\mu\tau)}}{\sqrt{\cosh{(\tau)}+u}} \\
&\times\exp{\bigg(-\bigg(\mu^2+\frac14\bigg)L\varepsilon^2s\bigg)}d\tau d\mu.
\end{align} This paper claims to have a solution $$P_{\varepsilon}(L,u) = \frac{e^{-\varepsilon^2sL/4}}{2\sqrt{2\pi}(\varepsilon^2sL)^{\frac32}}\int_{u}^{\infty}\frac{xe^{-x^2/(\varepsilon^2sL)}}{\sqrt{\cosh{(x)}-\cosh{(u)}}}dx.$$ Here I have computed my solution vs theirs, for varying parameter $L\in[1,10]$ and fixed $\varepsilon^2s$ Clearly they do not agree. $\textbf{My second question}$ is how they use this solution to find a mean value via \begin{align}\mathbb{E(R)} &= \int_{1}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{u-1}{u+1}\bigg)P_{\varepsilon}(L,u)du \\
&= \frac{e^{(-\varepsilon^2sL/4)}}{2\sqrt{2\pi}(\varepsilon^2Ls)^{\frac32}}\int_{1}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{u-1}{u+1}\bigg)\int_{u}^{\infty}\frac{xe^{-x^2/(4\varepsilon^2sL)}}{\sqrt{\cosh{(x)}-\cosh{(u)}}}dxdu
\end{align} $\textbf{AND then reduce this expression to read}$ $$\mathbb{E(R)}=1-\frac{4}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-\varepsilon^2sL}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x^2e^{-x^2}}{\cosh{(\sqrt{\varepsilon^2sL}x)}}dx,$$ since it's easy to see asymptotically that they behave differently.

3558306,Possible to have $m$-dimensional $C^k$ embedded submanifold in $\mathbb{R}^p$ with canonical projections onto $m$ dimensions are of dim $<m$ a.e.?,"Notations/terminologies: Let $\lambda_m$ be the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^m$ .
Let $\sigma \in \Sigma_p$ be a permutation of the symbols $\{1,2...p\}$ .
Let $k\mathbb{N}$ denote a desired degree of smoothness of the manifold in question. Let $M^m \subset \mathbb{R}^p$ be a $C^k$ embedded submanifold of dimension $m$ . Does this always mean that: at least one of the canonical projections onto a collection of $m$ canonical (Euclidean) co-ordinates give rise to/have an image $N$ , so that $N \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ is also $\lambda_m$ almost everywhere a submanifold (with or without boundary) of $\mathbb{R}^p$ of dimension exactly $m$ ? I.e. is it true that, for any canonical projection $\pi: (x_1,...x_p) \mapsto (x_{\sigma(1)},x_{\sigma(2)},...x_{\sigma(m)})$ , where $\sigma \in \Sigma_p, N:=\pi(M)$ is also a $\lambda_m$ almost everywhere a submanifold? In other words, my question is: is it possible to construct a submanifold $M^m \subset \mathbb{R}^p$ so that all of the ${p \choose m}$ canonical projections onto any of the $m$ co-ordinates have dimension strictly less than $m$ for a subset of positive $\lambda_m$ measure? Attemp I: The way I was thinking of constructing a counter example is by constructing a non-linear map from a low dimension to a high dimension so that there's enough co-ordinates to make the map invertible, but none of the low dimensional projections are invertible. E.g. I was thinking of constructing a map: $F:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^3$ given by: $F(x,y):=(xy^2, x^2y, xy + x^2y)$ so that we can check that projection onto any of the two co-ordinates have manifold dimension $1$ . But I'm not sure if it's possible to construct such a counterexample? Attemp II: I think for any smooth submanifold in question defined using global charts (like the ones I was trying in Attempt I ) wouldn't give us a counter example. This is because, locally, any smooth submanifold of dimension $m$ can be written as $F(x_1,...x_m)\mapsto (y_1,...y_p)$ where $y_i = y_i(x_1,...x_m)$ is a smooth function so that the Jacobian $[\frac{\partial y_i}{\partial x_j}]_{1 \leq i \le m, 1 \leq j \leq p }$ is of rank $m$ , hence an $m \times m$ submatrix, which WLOG can be assumed to be $[\frac{\partial y_i}{\partial x_j}]_{1 \leq i \le m, 1 \leq j \leq m }$ is of full rank $m$ . But then the projection $(y_1,...y_m, y_{m+1},...y_p) \mapsto (y_1,...y_m)$ gives us locally a manifold of dimension $m$ . But I guess we can't construct a global such projection?","['linear-algebra', 'geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

$$ (the sums in brackets actually end at $a$ and $A-a$ , remaining terms being zero). The coefficients are all integers and can have these orders of magnitude: $A\sim \text{10 to 1000}$ $B\sim \text{10 to 300}$ $K \sim \text{50000 to 100000}$ and the argument satisfies $0\le F_b<1$ and $\sum_b F_b <1$ , which implies that $S(\pmb{F})\ge0$ . Unfortunately the terms of this sum (in $a$ ) easily assume extremely similar but opposite values, leading to catastrophic cancellation in numerical computations. For example one can get meaningless results with negative sign. Taking $b$ -independent terms out of the brackets doesn't help, because it doesn't change the relative precision of the mutually almost-cancelling terms. I've also tried grouping together the terms with $\tbinom{A}{a}$ and $\tbinom{A}{A-a}$ , but catastrophic cancellation occurs (especially if $A$ is even) even across such groups. Since I'm numerically dealing with this formula in R, I've tried using the Rmpf package for arbitrary-precision computation. It manages to get the correct result (which I can compute with Mathematica) in some cases, as opposed to machine-precision computation, but it still fails in some situations. And it makes the computation much slower. Does anyone have some clever ideas of how to transform this formula to avoid the catastrophic cancellation? I'd be really grateful for your help. Context This formula arises in network theory, in the problem of guessing the number of connections from a set of nodes to another, disjoint set of nodes. The first set has $K$ nodes, the second can be assumed to have infinite nodes. We know that exactly $A$ nodes of the first set connect to exactly $B$ nodes of the second, but we don't know which node connects to which. Each of the $A$ nodes must connect to at least one of the $B$ nodes; but not all $B$ nodes need to be receiving a connection. $F_b$ represents the fraction (relative frequency) of nodes in the second set that receive $b$ connections from the first set. The formula, derivable with some combinatorics, gives the probability (except for a factor independent of $\pmb{F}$ ) for a particular frequency distribution $\pmb{F}$ . The alternating sum appears from the probability-sum rule with more than two terms. Roughly speaking, we're calculating $1$ minus the probability that at least one node from the first set has no connections, or at least two nodes from the first set have no connections, and so on. Ultimately I'd be interested in the logarithm of $S(\pmb{F})$ . From this context, I'd be happy to hear suggestions for slight variations or limits that may lead to a more manageable formula.

Dashed lines near the $O$ are tangents to circles, and the solid lines near the second point of circle intersection ( $P'$ ) - are tangents to mapped curves. The proof goes by claiming that $\varphi$ - the angle between dashed tangent lines to $t_1'$ and $t_2'$ , is equal to $\theta$ (one of the properties, that were previously proved, is that tangent line to the circle at $O$ is parallel to its image under the inversion) [so far so good] ... and the angle $\theta'$ between the tangent lines to the $C_1'$ and $C_2'$ mapped curves equals the angle between the circles ( $t_1'$ and $t_2'$ )

Now lets find the values of $x$ that make $f'(x)=0$ . $f'(x)=49-4x^{-2}=49-\frac{4}{x^2}=0$ $\rightarrow x^2=\frac{4}{49}$ $\rightarrow x= \pm \sqrt{\frac{4}{49}}$ $\rightarrow x= \pm \frac{2}{7}$ Thus our critical points are $x=0, x= \frac{2}{7}, x= -\frac{2}{7}$ Step 2: Make a number line and plot the sign of $f'(x)$ to find where $f(x)$ is increasing and decreasing. $f'(-3)= 49-\frac{4}{9}>0$ $f'(\frac{-1}{7})=49-\frac{4}{(\frac{-1}{7})^2}=49-4(49)=-3(49)<0$ $f'(\frac{1}{7})=49-\frac{4}{(\frac{1}{7})^2}=49-4(49)=-3(49)<0$ $f'(3)=49-\frac{4}{3^2} >0$ Thus $f(x)$ is increasing as $x$ increases towards $\frac{-2}{7}$ and then $f(x)$ is decreasing as $x$ increases towards $0$ . Therefore $x=\frac{-2}{7}$ corresponds to a relative maximum. Thus $f(x)$ is decreasing $x$ increases towards $\frac{2}{7}$ and then $f(x)$ is increases as $x$ increases towards $\infty$ . Therefore $x=\frac{2}{7}$ corresponds to a relative minimum. Step 3: find the corresponding $y$ values. $f(\frac{2}{7})=28$ $f(\frac{-2}{7})=-28$ Therefore $(\frac{2}{7},28)$ is a relative minimum and $(\frac{-2}{7},-28)$ is a relative maximum.

3559416,Matrix exponential of sum of matrices,"I'm having trouble understanding why, in general, if $\mathbf A, \mathbf B$ are $n \times n$ matrices, it does not hold that $$\exp(\mathbf A + \mathbf B) = \exp(\mathbf A)\exp(\mathbf B)$$ but holds in general when $\mathbf A\mathbf B = \mathbf B \mathbf A$ . Specifically, I can try to prove this using the definition of matrix exponentials as follows, without using commutativity of the matrices. Notice that \begin{align*}
\exp(\mathbf A + \mathbf B) &\equiv \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{(\mathbf A + \mathbf B)^i}{i!} \\
&= \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \sum_{j = 0}^{i} \binom ij \frac{\mathbf A^{i-j}\mathbf B^{j}}{i!} \\
&= \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \sum_{j = 0}^{i} \frac{\mathbf A^{i-j}}{(i-j)!} \frac{\mathbf B^j}{j!}
\end{align*} which does not rely on the commutativity of multiplying $\mathbf A, \mathbf B$ , but only relies on the commutativity of matrix addition under absolute convergence. Meanwhile, \begin{align*}
\exp(\mathbf A)\exp(\mathbf B) &\equiv\left(\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \frac{\mathbf A^k} {k!} \right)\left(\sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{\mathbf B^l}{l!}\right)\\
&= \sum_{k=0}^\infty\sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{\mathbf A^k}{k!} \frac{\mathbf B^l}{l!}
\end{align*} which still does not rely on the commutativity of multiplying the two matrices.
However, we can see that both sums converge (because the matrix exponential always converges) and also that we can rewrite the first expression to be equal to the second one, because we can set any values for $k, l$ and see that an equivalent term occurs in the first sum, and vice versa.

3559547,When is the image of a line bundle again a line bundle,"Hello everybody Motivation of my question Let $X$ be a scheme. Given a morphism $\mathcal{L}\overset{\beta}\to\mathcal{O}_X$ of line bundles over $X$ . I want to understand under what conditions the image $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ is a line bundle. I will specify my question below. To avoid trivialities, lets assume the morphism is not surjective. I already know the following results If $X$ is a smooth curve over a field, then every non-zero coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$ -submodule of a line bundle is already a line bundle*. 
Because $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ is coherent and non-zero, we see that $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ is a line bundle in this case. If $X$ has the property, that every local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is a PID, then 
the submodule $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)_x=\mathrm{Im}(\beta_x)\subseteq \mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is free of rank $1$ , which implies that $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ is free, by finite presentedness of $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ . My question What if $X$ is a smooth scheme over a base scheme $S$ , say of relative dimension $1$ , for example? I am mainly interested in the case of a morphism $\mathcal{L}\overset{\beta}{\to} \mathcal{O}_{X_S}$ (non-surjective), where $X_S=S\times_{\mathrm{Spec}{k}}X$ where $S$ is any scheme over a field $k$ and $X$ is a smooth irreducible curve over $k$ . Under what conditions is the image $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ a line bundle? Some of my ideas Maybe one can prove that the restriction of $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ to the fibres $X_S\to \mathrm{Spec}(\kappa(s))$ are line bundles, by using the first result from above and then conclude, that $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ is a line bundle?
Alternatively one could try to understand the properties of the local rings $\mathcal{O}_{X_S,x}$ , but I have doubts that they have any useful properties? PS: *This follows by the fact that the stalks are valuation rings and that torsion-free modules over valuation rings are flat by Tag 0539 , and the fact that over finitely generated flat modules over a local ring are free by [Matsumura, Commutative Algebra, Prop. 3G, page 21], and a standard Argument about finitely presented modules.","['algebraic-geometry', 'coherent-sheaves', 'line-bundles']"

3559707,Probability of listening to a song in a shuffled playlist at time $t$?,"Suppose we have a playlist of $N$ songs, with durations $\{t_1, t_2, \dots, t_N\}$ . The list is set to shuffle indefinitely. This means that, after each song is finished playing, the next song is chosen uniformly at random, so each song, including the one that just played, has an equal probability of playing, regardless of their duration. When the playlist is started, it chooses a song uniformly at random. Let $P_j(t)$ be the probability that the playlist would currently be playing song $j$ after time $t$ has passed since beginning the playlist. Intuitively, I'm sure that in the limit of large $t$ , $P_j(t)$ must converge towards $t_j/\sum_i t_i$ . But is that convergence asymptotic, or is there a hard cutoff time after which that is the distribution? For example, is this the distribution for all $t > \max(\{t_i\})$ ? If so, it's not obvious to me why this might be the case. Also I know that, for all $t < \min(\{t_i\})$ the probability distribution must be uniform. What is $P_j(t)$ in its general form? (Not just the above limits). Is there an analytic form? My attempt: Without loss of generality, order the songs in ascending duration, so $t_1 \le t_2 \le \dots \le t_N$ . But with some loss of generality, let's assume that no two songs have equal duration (a reasonable assumption for continuous time), so $t_1 < \dots < t_N$ . As we know, for $t<t_1$ , the probability distribution is uniform. For $t_1 < t < t_2$ , the only possible song that could have completed is the first song. Assuming $t < 2 t_1$ , $P_1(t) = 1/N^2$ . This is because the only way song $1$ can be playing is if song $1$ was rolled twice in a row. For $j \ne 1$ , $P_j(t) = \frac{N+1}{N^2}.$ That is, either they were rolled initially and are still playing, or song $1$ was rolled, and then song $j$ was rolled afterwards. Now, this doesn't cover the general case for $t_1 < t < t_2$ , only for $t < 2 t_1.$ However, $t_2$ can be any multiple of $t_1$ in principle. Suppose, for example, that $t_2 = 6.5 t_1$ , and $t = 5.5 t_1$ . Then the only way song $1$ can be playing at time $t$ is if it was rolled six times in a row. Thus $P_1(t) = 1/N^6.$ And $P_j(t) = \frac{N^5 + N^4 + N^3 + N^2 + N + 1}{N^6}$ for $j \ne 1$ . This can go on and on, for $t_2$ being any arbitrary multiple of $t_1$ . So it seems like that must be specified: For $(k-1) t_1 < t < k t_1 \le t_2$ , $$P_1(t) = 1/N^k$$ and $$P_j(t) = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} N^i}{N^k}; \hspace{1mm} j \ne 1.$$ This approach shows why it's problematic to go anywhere beyond $t = t_2$ . For any interval $t_j < t < t_{j+1}$ , there will be a different discrete expression every time $t$ passes any sum of earlier times. For example, if we're evaluating the probability for $t_8 < t < t_9$ , and the sum $t_2 + 2 t_4 + t_7$ falls within this range, then there will be a different expression before and after that time, because there's a chance that the playlist just finished that sequence. Thus, I believe that a closed-form expression for $P_j(t)$ would take the form of an intractable number of disjoint expressions for different ranges, and for arbitrary $\{t_1, \dots, t_N\}$ it might be impossible to even show an expression, because this involves an arbitrary number of disjoint expressions. If that's true, though, then an answer may still be given for my question to the large- $t$ limit.","['markov-process', 'probability']"

3560675,Prove that a linear map is an isomorphism iff the image set of the basis of V is a basis of W.,"So, here's the result that I'm trying to prove: Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces over $F$ and let $(v_1,v_2,...,v_n)$ be a basis of $V$ . Then, a linear map $f:V \to W$ is an isomorphism if
  and only if the list $(f(v_1),f(v_2),...,f(v_n))$ is a basis of $W$ . Proof Attempt: Let $A = (v_1,v_2,....,v_n)$ and $B = (f(v_1),f(v_2),....,f(v_n))$ . Then, we have to show that the list B is linearly independent and generates $W$ . Consider the following linear combination: $$\sum_{k=1}^{n}\alpha_k f(v_k) = 0\\
\implies \sum_{k=1}^{n} f(\alpha_k v_k) = 0\\
\implies f[\sum_{k=1}^{n} \alpha_k v_k] = 0\\
\implies \sum_{k=1}^{n} \alpha_k v_k = 0\\
\implies \forall k \in \{1,2,...,n\}: \alpha_k = 0$$ In the above computation, we have used the linearity of $f$ and the fact that $f(0) = 0$ , alongside the bijectivity of $f$ . This proves the linear independence of the list of vectors in $B$ . Then, we need to show that it generates $W$ . Clearly, $L(B) \subset W$ . Let $w \in W$ . Then, there exists a unique element $v \in V$ such that $f(v) = w$ . So, we have: $$w = f(v) = f[\sum_{k=1}^{n} \alpha_k v_k]\\
\implies w = \sum_{k=1}^{n} f(\alpha_k v_k)\\
\implies w = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \alpha_k f(v_k)\\
\implies w \in L(B).$$ This proves that $W \subset L(B)$ and, thus, proves that $L(B) = W$ . This shows that the list $B$ is a basis of $W$ . Now, suppose that B is a basis of W. Then, we have to show that $f:V \to W$ is bijective. Let $u_1,u_2 \in V$ such that: $f(u_1) = f(u_2)$ Then, $u_1 = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \alpha_k v_k$ and $u_2 = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \beta_k v_k$ . So, we have: $f(u_1)-f(u_2) = f(u_1-u_2) = 0$ $\implies f[\sum_{k=1}^{n} (\alpha_k - \beta_k)v_k)] = 0$ $\implies \sum_{k=1}^{n} (\alpha_k-\beta_k)f(v_k) =0$ $\implies \forall k \in \{1,2,...,n\}: \alpha_k = \beta_k$ Hence, that proves that $u_1 = u_2$ . This proves the injectivity of $f$ . Then, consider $f(V)$ . Clearly, $f(V) \subset W$ . Let $w \in W$ . Then, we have: $$w = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \alpha_k f(v_k)\\
\implies w = \sum_{k=1}^{n} f(\alpha_k v_k)\\
\implies w = f[\sum_{k=1}^{n} \alpha_k v_k]\\
\implies w \in f(V)$$ . This proves that $W \subset f(V)$ and, therefore, $f(V) = W$ . That proves that f is surjective. Since f is injective and surjective, it follows that it is bijective and that proves that it is an isomorphism. I'd like some serious criticism on my proof above. Is it correct? Is my proof writing okay? How can I improve it?","['solution-verification', 'linear-algebra']"

Let $x$ be a point in a dynamical system $(X, T)$ . $\bullet$ The orbit of $x$ is defined as $O_x=\{T^nx:\ n\in\mathbb Z\}$ . $\bullet$ We say that a point $x\in X$ is almost periodic if for all neighborhoods $U$ of $x$ in $X$ , the set $\{n\in \mathbb Z:\ T^nx\in U\}$ is relatively dense in $\mathbb Z$ . $\bullet$ We say $x$ periodic if the orbit of $x$ is finite. Clearly, any periodic point is almost periodic. Question 1 Assuming $(X, T)$ is a dynamical system with $|X|=|\mathbb N|$ , is it necessary that every almost periodic point is also periodic?

Question 2 Assuming $(X, T)$ is a dynamical system with $|X|=|\mathbb N|$ , is it necessary that $X$ has a periodic point? The answer to this question is in the affirmative.
This is because we know that there is a $T$ -invariant probability measure $\mu$ on $X$ . Since $X$ is countable, there is a point $x$ in $X$ such that $\mu(x)>0$ . Now the orbit of $x$ must be finite, for otherwise, by the $T$ -invariance of $\mu$ , we would have that $\mu(X)=\infty$ .

Let's do it again!! $f''(x)=\frac{(x^2-4)^2 \frac{d}{dx}(-16x) - (-16x)\frac{d}{dx}(x^2-4)^2}{(x^2-4)^4}$ Note that we have to the chain rule to evluate $\frac{d}{dx}(x^2-4)^2$ . $\rightarrow f''(x)=\frac{(x^2-4)^2 (-16) - (-16x)(2(x^2-4)\frac{d}{dx}(x^2-4))}{(x^2-4)^4}$ $\rightarrow =\frac{(x^2-4)^2 (-16) - (-16x)(2(x^2-4)(2x)}{(x^2-4)^4}$ $\rightarrow =\frac{(x^2-4)^2 (-16) + 64x^2(x^2-4)}{(x^2-4)^4}$ Canceling off one of the $(x^2-4)$ from each term in the numerator and the denominator... $\rightarrow =\frac{(x^2-4) (-16) + 64x^2}{(x^2-4)^3}$ $\rightarrow =\frac{-16x^2+64+64x^2}{(x^2-4)^3}$ $\rightarrow =\frac{64+48x^2}{(x^2-4)^3}$ Few.. okay the hard part is over. Now we need to find the points to chop our number line up from, so we have to solve $f''(x)=0$ and find where $f''(x)$ DNE. Let's solve where $f''(x)=0$ $f''(x) =\frac{64+48x^2}{(x^2-4)^3}=0$ $\rightarrow 64+48x^2 = 0$ $\rightarrow x= \pm \sqrt{-64/48}$ So $f''(x)=0$ only when $x$ is imaginary... so those values are irrelevant. On the other hand, $f''(x)$ DNE when $x = \pm 2$ , because the denominator will be zero. So these are the values we split our number line up by. Since $f''(-3)=\frac{496}{125}>0$ , we have that $f(x)$ is concave up on $(-\infty,-2)$ . Since $f''(0)=-1<0$ , we have that $f(x)$ is concave down on $(-2,2)$ . Since $f''(3)=\frac{496}{125}>0$ , we have that $f(x)$ is concave up on $(2,\infty)$ .","['calculus', 'solution-verification', 'derivatives']"

3561329,"Ramified primes, as defined by Neukirch","In ch.

Then every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \subset \mathcal{o}$ possesses a unique factorisation $$\mathfrak{p} = \mathfrak{P}_1^{e_1}...\mathfrak{P}_1^{e_1}$$ where the $\mathfrak{P}_i$ are prime ideals in $\mathcal{O}$ . He then says that the prime ideal $\mathfrak{P}_i$ in the above factorisation is said to be $\textbf{unramified}$ over $K$ if $e_i = 1$ ( $\textit{i.e.}$ if the prime only appears once in the factorisation) $\underline{\textit{and}}$ the residue field extension $(\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{P}_i)/(\mathcal{o}/\mathfrak{p})$ is separable. But $(\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{P}_i)/(\mathcal{o}/\mathfrak{p})$ is a finite extension of finite fields, so will it not always be separable? Why is this included in the definition?

3561468,A problem about the connectivity of vertices that must have the same color for any proper minimal coloring of a graph.,"The question is now also published in MathOverflow (here) . I'm trying to solve a problem about connectivity of entangled vertices in a graph. Two vertices $u, v$ of a finite graph $G(V, E)$ are said to be entangled if for any proper coloring $c:V(G)\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ with $\chi(G)$ colors we have $c(u) = c(v)$ , that is, they must have the same color. What I'm trying to prove is that, given two entangled vertices $u, v\in V(G)$ , there is $w\in V(G)$ (possibly equal to $v$ ) also entangled with $u$ so that there is a set of size $\chi(G)-1$ of disjoint paths from $u$ to $w$ . EDIT: The proof cited below was incorrect, as shown by the accepted answer. I was able to prove, using the vertex-connectivity version of Menger's theorem and induction, that the previous statement is true if $v$ is the only vertex in $G$ entangled with $u$ , so I've been trying to show that if there is not a set of size $\chi(G)-1$ of disjoint paths from $u$ to $v$ (considering $u$ and $v$ entangled), there is still a vertex in $G-v$ entangled with $u$ , but without success. Another idea I had was showing that the minimal (in the number of edges) subgraph of $G$ for which there is still a vertex entangled with $u$ , has exactly one vertex entangled with $u$ .

It turned out to be an interesting problem, which then led to another question instead. Firstly, from Euler's identity, I know that $i=e^{\pi i\div 2}$ $$\therefore 1+i=\sqrt 2\bigg(\cos\frac{\pi}4 + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4}\bigg)$$ I know $\sqrt{2}^{10}=32$ so it suffices to prove that $$i=\bigg(\cos\frac{\pi}4 + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4}\bigg)^{10}$$ And this was where I got stuck. However, working backwards from $32i$ , it led me to a conjecture. $$32i=32(0+i)=32\bigg(\cos\frac{\pi}2+i\sin\frac{\pi}{2}\bigg)$$ and now in order to make the denominators equal to $4$ without changing the value of the brackets, I decided to do it like this. $$\cos\frac{\pi}2+i\sin\frac{\pi}{2}=\cos\bigg(2\pi+\frac{\pi}2\bigg)+i\sin\bigg(2\pi+\frac{\pi}{2}\bigg)=\cos\frac{10\pi}4+i\sin\frac{10\pi}{4}$$ $$\therefore \cos\frac{10\pi}4+i\sin\frac{10\pi}{4}=\bigg(\cos\frac{\pi}4+i\sin\frac{\pi}4\bigg)^{10}$$ Can the last equation be generalised for some $n$ , i.e. $$\bigg(\cos\frac{\pi}4+i\sin\frac{\pi}4\bigg)^n \stackrel{\small ?}{=}\cos\frac{n\pi}4+i\sin\frac{n\pi}4$$ Or is this just a coincidence for $n=10$ ? Can the denominator also be changed arbitrarily and not just be fixed on $4$ ? How does one go about proving this using only trigonometry?

3561630,Some help and clarification to more-rigorously derive Green's Function solution for ODE $\dot{x}(t)-Ax(t) = f(t)$ with $x(0) = x_0$,"I'm trying to derive this solution given to us in a systems / control-theory course without proof. The first-order vector linear differential equation in question is $$\dot{x}(t)-Ax(t) = f(t)$$ $$x(0) = x_0$$ Where $x$ is a $n$ -dimensional vector in $R^n$ (for instance, a two or three dimensional vector), and $A$ is an $n$ x $n$ constant matrix. The unexplained solution is $$x(t) = e^{At}x_0 + \int_0^t e^{A(t-\tau)}f(\tau)d\tau$$ Where the first term $e^{At}x_0$ is the homogenous solution to $$\dot{x}(t)-Ax(t) = 0$$ $$x(0) = x_0$$ and the second term is the ""particular"" solution, the one I'm interested in deriving. I think it comes from a Green's function approach where $f(t)$ is decomposed into an infinite sum of dirac delta functions $\delta$ : $$
f(t) = \int_0^\infty f(\tau)\delta(t-\tau)d\tau
$$ So by linearity of the differential equation, we first find a solution (response, trajectory, aka Green's function, $G(\tau,t)$ ) for a single delta function ""system input"" at time $\tau$ and add them up invoking the linearity of the differential equation to obtain: $$
x(t) = \int_0^\infty G(t, \tau)f(\tau)d\tau
$$ But I'm a bit confused how to set up the ODE to get the Green's function. Following wiki and other sources, I have: $$
\dot{G}(t,\tau) - A G(t, \tau) = \delta(t-\tau)
$$ but this $\delta$ has to be vector-valued since the left side is. And I suppose this ""dirac vector"" should point parallel to $f(\tau)$ : let $\hat{f}(\tau)$ be this unit vector to get it pointing properly. $$
\dot{G}(t,\tau) - A G(t, \tau) = \hat{f}(\tau) \delta(t-\tau)
$$ Then there is the question of what initial value to use with this ODE. I don't really know how to answer that and why. But I tried $G(t=0,\tau)=0$ for all $\tau$ . I figured if the initial condition wasn't zero it would mess up the homogenous solution obeying a non-zero initial condition(?). Then the ODE says the system does nothing until $t > \tau$ , after which it does its natural (homogenous) response after a sudden jump from the origin to the point $\hat{f}(\tau)$ : $$
G(t,\tau) = 0\space for \space 0<t<\tau
$$ $$
G(t,\tau) = e^{A(t-\tau)} \hat{f}(\tau) \space for \space 0<\tau<t
$$ Which can be captured in one line by using the step function $H(t-\tau)$ ( $1$ if $t>\tau$ , $0$ otherwise): $$
G(t,\tau) = H(t-\tau) e^{A(t-\tau)}
$$ Then adding up all the responses (ODE is linear, more justification desired) gives $$ x(t) = \int_0^\infty H(t-\tau) e^{A(t-\tau)} f(\tau) d\tau $$ The integrand is zero if $\tau$ exceeds t, so it simplifies to $$ x(t) = \int_0^t e^{A(t-\tau)} f(\tau) d\tau $$ All of which tries to explain the particular solution. Does this argument seem ok? Any areas where you could better explain what is going on? Specifically, I'm not sure if my reasoning about the boundary condition / initial value on $G$ is correct. Also my justification or reasoning for using $\hat{f}(\tau)$ to give my dirac delta function a vector value seems a little hand-wavy.

3561750,Jacobian for polar decomposition,"Let $f:\mathrm{Mat}_n(\mathbb{C})\to\mathbb{C}$ be some function and let us suppose we want to make a change of variables in the integral $$ \int_{A\in \mathrm{Mat}_n(\mathbb{C})}f(A)\mathrm{d}{A} $$ from $A$ to $|A| U$ , i.e., the polar decomposition of $A$ , where $|A|\equiv\sqrt{A^\ast A}$ and $U$ is the unique partial isometry with kernel equal to that of $A$ (there is a theorem saying it exists). What is the Jacobian matrix of the transformation $A \mapsto (|A|, U$ )? I.e., what is $J$ such that the following equation holds: $$ \int_{A\in \mathrm{Mat}_n(\mathbb{C})}f(A)\mathrm{d}{A} = \int_{P\geq0,U^\ast U\,\mathrm{idempotent}}f(P U)|\det(J(P,U))|\mathrm{d}{P}\mathrm{d}{U}$$ I tried to calcualte it but I'm not getting anything simple. In particular, I've written $A = A_R + i A_I$ with $A_R = \frac{1}{2}(A+A^\ast); A_I = \frac{1}{2i}(A-A^\ast)$ so that $A$ is parametrized by two self-adjoint matrices. In turn, we may write $|A| = \exp(H_1) ; U = \exp(i H_2)$ for two self-adjoint matrices $H_1,H_2$ (assuming for a moment that $A$ is invertible so that $U$ is actually unitary). Hence we want to calculate the Jacobian of the transformation $(H_1,H_2)\mapsto(A_R,A_I)$ from $\mathrm{Herm}_n(\mathbb{C})^2\to \mathrm{Herm}_n(\mathbb{C})^2$ . This, however, starts to get ugly, with the differential of the exponential map for example being given by functional calculus of the adjoint super operator ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_of_the_exponential_map ) and having to use the determinant of a block matrix formula. Is there an easier way out? Possible solution: In Edelman's PhD thesis there are given Jacobians to get from a matrix A to its LQ decomposition , and from its LQ decomposition to its Cholesky decomposition (Theorem 3.1). This possibly solves the problem as follows: \begin{align} \int_{A\in \mathrm{Mat}_n(\mathbb{C})}f(A)\mathrm{d}{A} &= \int_{L\text{ lower triangular},\,U\text{ unitary}} f(LU)\prod_{i=1}^{n}L_{ii}^{2n-2i+1}\mathrm{d}{L}\mathrm{d}{U} \\ &=2^{-n}\int_{P\geq0,\,U\text{ unitary}} f(\sqrt{P}U)\mathrm{d}{P}\mathrm{d}{U}\\&=2^{-n}\int_{P\geq0,\,U\text{ unitary}} f(PU)|\det(P\otimes I+I\otimes P^\ast)|^2\mathrm{d}{P}\mathrm{d}{U}\\&=2^{-n}\int_{P\geq0,\,U\text{ unitary}} f(PU)\prod_{1\leq i,j\leq n}(\lambda_i(P)+\lambda_j(P))^2\mathrm{d}{P}\mathrm{d}{U}\end{align} with the usual abuse of notation that $\mathrm{d}{L}$ integrates only over the non-zero elements of $L$ , $\mathrm{d}{U}$ is the volume element within the unitary group, and $\mathrm{d}{P}$ the volume element on self-adjoint matrices (so only $n$ real and $\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$ complex matrix elements). $\lambda_j(P)$ is the $j$ th eigenvalue of the matrix $P$ . Remaining question : Why is the LQ-decomposition change of variables valid for complex matrices? A complex unitary $n\times n$ matrix is $n^2$ real parameters, whereas a lower triangular matrix is $n(n+1)$ real parameters. On the other hand, a complex matrix is $2n^2$ real parameters, so there seem to be $n$ real parameters too many in this decomposition? (This is not a problem if matrices have real entries). Note that for the Cholesky decomposition this is not an issue since then the lower triangular matrix has positive entries on its diagonal. Could it be possible to make an LQ decomposition for complex matrices where the lower triangular has positive entries on the diagonal? Is this what Edelman is referring to? Unfortunately, precisely for the complex LQ decomposition he does not give a reference nor a proof.","['reference-request', 'jacobian', 'change-of-variable', 'linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis']"
