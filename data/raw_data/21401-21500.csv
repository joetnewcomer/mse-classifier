181691,"Extension of Homomorphisms (Lang, Atiyah and McDonald)","Let $A$ be a subring of a field $K$, and suppose that $A$ is a local ring with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$. Let $x \in K, \, x \neq 0$. Let $\phi: A \rightarrow L$ be a homomorphism of $A$ into the algebraically closed field $L$ with kernel $\mathfrak{m}$. Suppose that $\mathfrak{m} A[x] \neq A[x]$. Then $\mathfrak{m} A[x]$ is contained into a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{P}$ of $A[x]$ and $\mathfrak{P} \cap A = \mathfrak{m}$. Now, there exists an embedding $\psi : A/ \mathfrak{m} \rightarrow L$ such that $A \rightarrow A/ \mathfrak{m} \stackrel{\psi}{\rightarrow} L$ is equal to $\phi$. Suppose that the . According to Lang's Algebra p. 348, we can extend $\psi$ to $A[x]/ \mathfrak{P}$ whether the image of $x$ in $A[x]/ \mathfrak{P}$ is transcendental over $A/ \mathfrak{m}$ or not, but i can not see why this is possible. Any insights? Thanks Edited: Related to the question is the observation that, according to the proof of Theorem 5.21 in Atiyah's and McDonald's ""Introduction to Commutative Algebra"", where they follow a similar construction, it is mentioned that the image of $x$ in $A[x]/ \mathfrak{P}$ is algebraic over $A/ \mathfrak{m}$ (notation is different). But i can't see why that's the case.","['commutative-algebra', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"
181699,Roots of rational equation with multiple variables?,"Let's say we have a rational polynomial in $k$ variables. We are only interested in rational solutions. If $k = 1$, name the variables ${x}$, if $k = 2$, name them ${x,y}$. For $k = 1$, it can be done very fast. The Rational Root Theorem gives a set of candidates. But what for $k=2$? How can I split a polynomial into factors in this case? Example: $x^2-y^2$ should be split to $(x-y)(x+y)$.

181721,"What function $f$ such that $a_1 \oplus\, \cdots\,\oplus a_n = 0$ implies $f(a_1) \oplus\, \cdots\,\oplus f(a_n) \neq 0$","For a certain algorithm, I need a function $f$ on integers such that $a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus \, \cdots\,\oplus a_n = 0 \implies f(a_1) \oplus f(a_2) \oplus \, \cdots\,\oplus f(a_n) \neq 0$ (where the $a_i$ are pairwise distinct, non-negative integers and $\oplus$ is the bitwise XOR operation) The function $f$ should be computable in $O(m)$, where $m$ is the maximum number of digits of the $a_i$. Of course the simpler the function is, the better. Preferrably the output of the function would fit into $m$ digits as well. Is there something like this? It would also be okay to have a family of finitely many functions $f_n$ such that for one of the functions the result of the above operation will be $\neq 0$. My own considerations so far were the following: If we choose the ones' complement as $f$, we can rule out all cases where $n$ is odd. If $n$ is even, this means that for every bit, an even number of the $a_i$ has the bit set and the rest has not, therefore taking the ones' complement before XORing doesn't change the result. So the harder part seems to be the case where $n$ is even.","['algorithms', 'discrete-mathematics', 'binary', 'functions']"

181851,Any infinite set of a compact set $K$ has a limit point in $K$?,"I'm reading principles of mathematical analysis and have a question about a theorem 2.37. Theorem 2.37 If $E$ is an infinite subset of a compact set $K$, then $E$ has a limit point in $K$. The proof is If no point of $K$ were a limit point of $E$, each $q \in K$ would have a neighborhood $V_q$ which contains at most one point of $E$. 
  It is clear that no finite subcollection of $\{V_q\}$ can cover $E$.
  The same is true of $K$, since $E \subset K$. 
  This contradicts the compactness of $K$. I understand the first part that states that no finite subcollection of $\{V_q\}$ can cover $E$, in other words, $E$ is not compact. But I don't understand why it means that no finite subcollection can cover $K$. Is the author saying that if a subset of a set K is not compact, then $K$ is not compact?

181869,Finding the splitting field of $f(x)$,"I'm trying to learn the theory of splitting fields. So I went through this example on an old exam: Find the splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ for $f(x)=x^6-9$ $x^6-9=(x^3-3)(x^3+3)$
and so $\pm\sqrt[3]{3}$ is the only real roots. When defining $w=-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt[3]{3}}{2} i$ we have that $w$ is a root of $x^2+x +1$ and therefor a root of $x^{3}$$-$$1$ and so $\sqrt[3]{3}$$w$ is a solution and so is $\sqrt[3]{3}w^{2}$ since $w^3=1$ and $(w^2)^3=1$ and the same argument goes for the negative real root and so $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{3},w)$
Is the argument above correct? Or am I missing something? Is this how you always go about when finding the splitting field? Finding a real root and then multiplying with roots of unity? What if there are no real roots?

Now add $1$ to $S.$ $1$ is now the least element. Since there is no $X < 1$ in any such set $S,$ $1$ is the smallest element of any set $S$ and therefore the smallest natural number.","['natural-numbers', 'elementary-set-theory']"
181895,Outer measure of a union of 2 subsets of disjoint measurable sets of real numbers.,"Every set mentioned is a subset of the real numbers. Let $m^*(C)$ denote the outer measure of a set $C$. Let $E$ be $any$ set and $A,B$ be measurable, disjoint sets. I'm trying to show that $$m^*(E\cap (A\cup B))=m^*(E\cap A)+m^*(E\cap B).$$ Proof: 
($\le$) follows by the countable subadditivity of the outer measure since
$$E\cap (A\cup B)= (E\cap A)\cup (E\cap B).$$ Here's where I get stuck: ($\ge$) My attempts have reduced to something of the form: There are bounded open sets $G_1, G_2$ containing $E\cap A, E\cap
    B$, respectively, such that $$m(G_1)\ge m^*(E\cap A),\quad m(G_2)\ge
    m^*(E\cap B).$$ Hence $$m^*(E\cap A)+m^*(E\cap B)\le m(G_1)+m(G_2).$$
And I would like to extend this inequality to $m(G_1\cup G_2)$ but I
know that's not even true, especially since the sets $G_1, G_2$ may
not even be disjoint. I also tried de la Vallée-Poussin Criterion: Let $\epsilon>0$. Since
$A, B$ are measurable, there are closed subsets $F_1, F_2$ of $A,B$
respectively, such that $m^*(A\cap E - F_1)+ m^*(B\cap
    E-F_2)<\epsilon$. Even if I could show, $$|m^*(E\cap (A\cup
    B)-[(F_1\cup F_2))+ m^*(A\cap E - F_1)+ m^*(B\cap
    E-F_2)]|<\epsilon.$$ I'm not sure what that would mean. What I know: Measure has only been defined for bounded sets. A bounded set $A$ is $measurable$ if its outer and inner measures
    are equal; if so, the measure of $A$ is the common value of these
    measures. Differences, countable unions, countable intersections of measurable
sets are measurable. The union of a set of pairwise disjoint measurable sets is
measurable, with the measure of the union equal to the sum of the
measures of the sets in the union. Outer and inner measures are monotone increasing functions. Countable subadditivity for outer measure, which states that if $A$
is a countable or finite union of sets $A_i$ then $m^*(A)\le \sum
   m^*(A_i)$. De la Vallée-Poussin Criterion, which states that a bounded set $A$
is measurable iff for every $\epsilon >0$ there is a closed set
$B\subset A$ such that $m^*(A-B)< \epsilon$. For any bounded set $B$, I can always find a set $C$ that is a
countable intersection of open sets for which $B \subset C$ and
$m^*(B)=m^*(C)$. If $A$ and $B$ are measurable sets, then $m(A\cup B) + m(A\cap B) =
   m(A) + m(B)$. If $A$ is bounded and $I$ is an open interval containing $E$, then
$m^*(E) + m_*(I-E) = m(I)$.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

I have an equation $$\dfrac{x^2}{(y-1)^2}=1 \tag{1}$$ and I was looking for its solutions. It was asked by some kid ( of $9$nth standard ) to me. 
I did some manipulation and got $$x^2=(y-1)^2 \tag{2} $$ finally. And one can see that $(0,1)$ satisfies the Equation $[2]$ well. But I was happy, and within small time, 
I realized that the same solution set can't satisfy the equation $[1]$ . If you substitute $(0,1)$ in $[1]$ you get $\dfrac{0}{0}=1$ which is wrong. The  answer that convinced me finally : We can see the same equation as this $x^2. \dfrac{1}{(y-1)^2}=1$ . We know that the set  of integers form a ring. So the product of two numbers is one if one number is the inverse of other number. '$1$' present on the R.H.S is the identity element. So the product of the entity with its inverse always gives us the identity. So when $x$ is $0$, the $0$ doesn't have an inverse in the integers. So the case is to be emitted.

We omitted that solution, but in fact $(0,1)$ is the intersection of the two lines. Questions that are to be answered by learned people : What is the value of term $\dfrac{0}{0}$ ? Isn't it $1$ ?

It is an easy exercise to show that whenever $f$ is locally integrable and such a limit, $l$, exists the Abel means $A_\epsilon =\int_0^\infty e^{-\epsilon x}f(x) \ dx$ converge to $l$. The limit is of course taken as $\epsilon$ tends to $0$, and we are using Lesbegue integrals. Unfortunately, I am not finding this to be an easy exercise.

But the symmetric group is a very big object (e.g. for $\mathbb{Z_3}$ with its 3 elements, $S_3$ has 3!=6 elements) and I don't find it in the Yoneda lemma. Put another way: Cayley's theorem says something about a subset, basically that $G$ is isomorphic to some transformation on $G$, let's name it $\lambda(G)$, and the insight is $\lambda(G)\le S(G)$. As the Yoneda lemma only has an equal (or isomorphic) sign, I wonder where the $\le$ symbol is in the categorical language. I can only assume that the lemma $F(A)=\text{nat}(\text{hom}(A,-),F)$ translates to $G=\lambda(G)$ if one plugs in the hom functor for $F$ and the resulution to my question would then be to see what the $S(G)$ is in terms of $\text{nat}(\text{hom}(A,-),F)$ and why. (I don't get much out of it as there seems to be only the one object $A$ I can play around.

182029,Divergence Theorem/ partial integration of higher order,"I'm in the middle of a proof and i'm trying to understand a step of the proof which does give me a hard time.
The proof is about minimal surfaces and at the moment I'm trying to understand why the mean curvature has to vanish on a regular surface for it to be minimal.
The question is not about differential geometry, but I'm trying to be as complete as possible.
The book im using is from Dierkes, Hildebrandt,.. and its called Minimal Surfaces I (Page 54..). First some notation and the conditions of the problem. I do adumbrate the situation of the proof very so little, but the question is strictly technical, so if you don't need it, skip ahead to the actual problem and find what you need in the notation section later on: NOTATION: Let $U$ be an open set in $\mathbb R^2$ and $w = (u,v) =(u^1,u^2) \in U$. Let $X: U\rightarrow\mathbb R^3 $ be a regular surface of class $ C^2 $ with its spherical image defined by $  N = \frac {1}{\mathcal W} X_u \times  X_v $. $\mathcal W = (\mathcal E \mathcal G - \mathcal F^2)^{1/2}$ where $\mathcal E,\mathcal F, \mathcal G $ are the coefficients of the first fundamental form. There is $Z:\;U\times(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)\;\rightarrow \mathbb R^3 ,\;\varepsilon> 0$, which is a Variation of X of Class $C^2$, with the property that $Z(w,0)=X$ for all $w \in U$.
By Taylor expansion we get: 
$Z(w,\varepsilon) =X(w)+Y(w)+\varepsilon^2 R(w,\varepsilon)$, where $R$ is a continous remainder term. $Y(w)= \frac{\partial}{\partial\varepsilon}Z(w,\varepsilon)|_\varepsilon \in C^1(U,\mathbb R^3) $ is called the first variation of the family of surfaces $Z(.,\varepsilon)$. For partial derivations we use $ {\partial X}/{\partial u^\beta}=X_{u^\beta}$. Now we can write $Y(w) =\sum \eta^\beta(w)X_{u^\beta} + \lambda(w)N(w)$ with $\beta \in {{1,2}}$ and $w = (u,v) =(u^1,u^2)$ with functions $\eta^1,\eta^2,\lambda $ of class $C^1(U)$. QUESTION: Performing a partial integration, it follows that:
$\int_U [\;(\eta^1\mathcal W)_u +(\eta^2 \mathcal W)_v\;]\;du dv= \int_{\partial U}\mathcal W(\eta^1 dv-\eta^2du)$ This is supposed to be partial integration with the help of the divergence theorem.
But as i understood partial integration, there has to be a vectorfield there, which isn't, and a continous scalarfunction.
The thing is, with what i got, i don't know where to start from.
Any first hints to get me going would be very appreciated. Thank you in advance, marcel","['calculus-of-variations', 'differential-geometry']"

I believe my answer is correct, however one thing I couldn't explain fully, and which is bugging me, is why the rationals $\mathbb Q$, integers $\mathbb Z$ and naturals $\mathbb N$ all have cardinality $| \mathbb Q |=| \mathbb Z | = |\mathbb N| = \aleph_0$, when $\mathbb N \subsetneq \mathbb Z \subsetneq \mathbb Q$. The basic proof of the other question, from my answer, is that for any $r$ in $\mathbb Q$ there is a single function $f(r)$ such that $f(r) \in \mathbb Z$, and the same holds between $\mathbb Z$ and $\mathbb N$. Because there is this 1:1 transformation possible, there must be the same number of numbers in the three sets, because otherwise there would be a number in one set for which the bijection could not produce a number of the other set, and this is not so. Now, Belgi explained why $1<2$ in the other question by defining the value 0 as the cardinality of the empty set $\emptyset$, 1 as the cardinality of a set of sets containing only the empty set, and 2 as the set of sets containing the empty set and a set containing the empty set, then proceeding as follows: Now that we have defined the natural numbers we can define when one number
  is smaller than another. The definition is $x<y$ is $x\subset y$
  and $x\neq y$ . Clearly $\{\emptyset\}\neq\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}$ and $\{\emptyset\}\subset\neq\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}$
  So this a proof, by definition, of why $1<2$. ... however, by the same definition, because $\mathbb N \subsetneq \mathbb Z \subsetneq \mathbb Q$, then $| \mathbb N | < | \mathbb Z | < |\mathbb Q|$ and thus a maximum of one of these quantities can be the ordinal quantity $\aleph_0$.","['cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory', 'infinity']"

But I'm stuck as to how to do this.  In the one variable case, to show that $q(x) = |x|$ is not differentiable, I can calculate the limit $\frac{|x + h| - |x|}{h}$ as $h\to 0^+$ and $h\to 0^-$, show that the two one-sided limits are distinct, and conclude that the limit

182278,When is $\mathbb{Z}$ a flat $\mathbb{Z}G$-module?,"Suppose that $\mathbb{Z}$ is a flat $\mathbb{Z}G$-module for a group $G$. Question: Is $G$ the trivial group ? Nb. I know that the question can be answered affirmatively if $G$ is finitely generated. Edit: I think the following lemma solves the problem. I would be grateful if someone could have a look on its proof and give some feedback whether it looks ok. Thanks. Lemma: Let $R \le S$ be rings with unit such that $S$ is flat as left $R$-module. Then every flat left $S$-module is also flat as left $R$-module. Now let $G\neq 1$ be any group. If $G$ is abelian then $\mathbb{Z}$ isn't flat by Georges' argument. If $G$ is not abelian, we can find an abelian subgroup $1 \neq H \le G$. Now, if $\mathbb{Z}$ were flat as $\mathbb{Z}G$-module, it would also be flat as $\mathbb{Z}H$-module by the lemma. But we just saw that this isn' true. Hence $\mathbb{Z}$ isn't flat as $\mathbb{Z}G$-module. We have therefore shown: For a group $G$ the following is equivalent: $G=1$ $H_i(G,-)=0\,$ for all $i > 0$ $H^i(G,-)=0\,$ for all $i > 0$ Proof of the Lemma: Let $E$ be a flat left $S$-module and let $i: M \to N$ be an embedding of right $R$-modules. We have to show that $i \otimes id_E: M \otimes_R E \to N \otimes_R E$ is also an embedding. Since $S$ is a flat left $R$-module, tensoring with $S$ from the right yields an embedding $i \otimes id_S: M \otimes_R S\to N \otimes_R S$ of right $S$-modules. Similarly, as $E$ is a flat left $S$-module, we obtain the embedding
$$(i \otimes id_S)\otimes id_E: (M \otimes_R S)\otimes_S E \to (N \otimes_R S) \otimes_S E$$
which, by associativity of the tensor product, is equivalent to 
$$i \otimes (id_S\otimes id_E): M \otimes_R (S\otimes_S E) \to N \otimes_R (S \otimes_S E)$$
which, by the natural isomorphism $S \otimes_S E \cong E$ is equivalent to 
$$i \otimes id_E: M \otimes_R E \to N \otimes_R E.$$
Hence $i \otimes id_E$ is an embedding and thus $E$ is flat as left $R$-module. QED","['commutative-algebra', 'group-cohomology', 'group-theory']"
182297,Maximal ideals in $R[x]$,"I want to prove the following result: Let $R$ be a ring and $M$ a maximal ideal in $R$. If $P$ is a prime ideal in $R[x]$ that (strictly) contains $M[x]$, then $P$ is a maximal ideal in $R[x]$. I have an idea how to prove that, but I'm not quite sure if the argument is totally valid; maybe someone has a cleaner proof. My argument is like that: $R[x]/M[x]$ is isomorphic to $(R/M)[x]$, that is a PID (since $R/M$ is a field). So, any prime ideal in this ring is maximal; If $P$ contains $M[x]$, then $P$ corresponds to a (prime??) ideal in $R[x]/M[x]$ (this needs more clarification); The prime ideal (that corresponds to $P$) in $R[x]/M[x]$ is then maximal, and this guarantees that $P$ is maximal in $R[x]$.

I am using Complex Analysis by Serge Lang, but I find myself struggling with some of his power series manipulations and his representations of power series as polynomials. For instance, given the following theorem/proof (taken from Theorem 6.1, p.76): Theorem Let $f(T) = a_1 T + higher$ $terms$ be a formal power series with $a_1 \not= 0$. Then there exists a unique power series $g(T)$ such that $f(g(T)) = T$. This power series also satisfies $g(f(T)) = T$. Proof : For convenience of notation we write $f(T)$ in the form $$f(T) = a_1T - \sum_{2}^{\infty} a_nT^n$$ We seek a power series $$g(T) = \sum_{1}^{\infty} b_nT^n$$ such that $$f(g(T)) = T$$ The solution to this problem is given by solving the equation in terms of the coefficients of the power series $$a_1g(T) - a_2g(T)^2 - ... = T$$ These equations are of the form $$a_1b_n - P_n(a_2, ..., a_n, b_1,..., b_{n - 1}) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad a_1b_1 = 1 \quad \text{for} \quad n = 1$$ where $P_n$ is a polynomial with positive integer coefficients (generalized binomial coefficients) ...

At any step his probability of taking a step away is $\frac{2}{3}$ of a step toward the cliff $\frac{1}{3}$
. What is his chance of escaping the cliff?' Although the book provided a solution for the eventual probability of falling via the use of recursive equations, I decided to see if I can derive an expression to compute the probability of one falling down prior step N. What I did was to calculate the number of paths that one can take such that he reaches $X_n=1$, where n=2m-1 for some m (this is because at even steps the person would not fall so I'm only considering the case with odd steps) without reaching $X_j=1$ for any $0\le j< 2m-1$. The following expression is what I have calculated. $P_n=1-\sum\limits_{i=0}^{m} p_{2i+1}\\
=1-\sum\limits_{i=0}^{m} \left({{2i+1}\choose{i+1}} - \sum\limits_{k=1}^{i}{{2k}\choose{k}}\right)\left(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{i+1}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{i}\right)$ (I actually made a mistake here as I considered 2m+1 rather than 2m-1, which left the summation sign with $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{i}{{2k}\choose{k}}$ undefined when i=0) Where $p_2i+1=$ the probability of the path touching 1 at $n=2i+1$ without touching $1$ prior to the step. The first binomial expression corresponds to choosing n+1 steps towards the cliff out of the 2n+1 steps. The second binomial expression is to subtract the paths that stemmed from previous 1's (in order to ensure that the path did not touch 1 prior to $n=2i+1$.) However as I plotted this into excel I found that the probability does not converge to $\frac{1}{2}$ as n->infinity, which is the answer the book obtained through recursive relations.

Then apply Zorn to get a maximal element $(X^\prime, f^\prime)$ and show that $X^\prime = X$. The way to do this is by contradiction. One assumes that there is a point $z$ in $X \setminus X^\prime$ and then defines a $g$ such that $(X^{\prime \prime}, g) $ where $X^{\prime \prime} $ is spanned by $z$ and $X^\prime$ is strictly  greater than $(X^\prime, f^\prime)$ in $\Sigma$, contradicting maximality.

182412,Relating the homogeneous coordinate ring of a projective variety with the affine coordinate ring of an affine open subset,"I'm currently working on exercise 2.6 in chapter 1 of Algebraic Geometry by Hartshorne. I'm pretty confident with my answer apart from the first bit which I feel I could be ""fudging"". I'm looking for people to tell me where I have gone wrong... Here is the set up for those who don't have the book: If $S=k[y_0, \dots ,y_n]$ is a graded ring, let $S_{(f)}$ denote the subring of $S_{f}$ consisting of elements of degree $0$. Let $Y$ be a projective variety embedded in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ with homogeneous coordinate ring $S(Y)$, let $H$ be the hyperplane $y_0=0$, let $U=\mathbb{P}^{n}-H$, and let $X=Y\cap U$. The claim is that the affine coordinate ring $A(X)$ is isomorphic to $S(Y)_{(y_0)}$. My answer with help from the book: define an isomorphism $\theta$ from $k[x_1, \dots ,x_n]$ to $S_{(y_0)}$ by mapping $f(x_1, \dots ,x_n)$ to $f(y_1/y_0, \dots ,y_n/y_0)$. The image of $I(X)$ under this map is equal to $I(Y)_{(y_0)}$. Indeed, if $f(x_1, \dots ,x_n)$ vanishes on $X$, then $y_0^{d}f(y_1/y_0, \dots ,y_n/y_0)$ vanishes on $Y$, and hence, $f(y_1/y_0, \dots ,y_n/y_0)=y_0^{d}f(y_1/y_0, \dots ,y_n/y_0)/y_0^{d}$ is an element of $I(Y)_{(y_0)}$. To show surjectivity, it is enough to there is an element of $I(X)$ which maps to each generator of $I(Y)_{(y_0)}$. If $F(y_0, \dots ,y_n)/y_0^{d}=y_0^{d}F(1,y_1/y_0 \dots ,y_n/y_0)/y_0^{d}$ is such a generator, then $F(x_1 \dots x_n)$ is an element of $I(X)$ which maps to it. Thus, $\theta$ induces an isomorphism from $A(X)$ to $S_{(y_0)}/I(Y)_{(y_0)}$, and the latter is clearly isomorphic to $S(Y)_{(y_0)}$. Also, is there an easier way to see/think about this? For example, some books I have read have stated that $A(X)$ can be identified with  $k[\xi_1/\xi_0 \dots \xi_n/\xi_0]$ (where the $\xi_i$ are the coordinate functions of $Y$) without further justification.

182414,"How small parallelograms are we guaranteed to get, when we select the two sides from different plane lattices?","This a shortened version (motivation from telecommunications stripped away) of a question I asked in MO in late May (no answers). I am mostly checking, if somebody has seen this or a related question studied during the history. Of course, all answers, suggestions and comments are welcome. A detailed description of the question: Select two lattices $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ (here a lattice=additive free abelian group without accumulation points) of maximal rank two in the real plane. We normalize the lattices in such a way that their fundamental regions have area $=1$. Let $B(r)$ be a disk of radius $r$ centered at the origin. Let $N_1,N_2>0$ be two parameters. Select one non-zero vector $\vec{v}_1$ from $B(N_1)\cap \Lambda_1$ and another $\vec{v}_2$ from $B(N_2)\cap \Lambda_2$. Consider the area of the parallelogram with sides $\vec{v}_i,i=1,2.$ Let $D(N_1,N_2)$ be the minimum area of such parallelograms. We want to make the function $D(N_1,N_2)$ as large as possible by selecting the lattices $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ in a clever way. The simplest form of my question is: what can we say about the asymptotic behavior of $D(N_1,N_2)$ as the parameters $N_1,N_2\to\infty$ (either separately or jointly)? As additional questions I would like to ask: Does this ring a bell? What kind of methods have been used in studying this problem? What methods would you use? What we know about the problem: The pigeon hole principle tells us that there is a constant $K$ (may depend on the lattices, but not on the scale parameters $N_1, N_2$) such that
$$
D(N_1,L_{2,\min})\le \frac{K}{N_1},
$$
where $L_{2,\min}$ is the length of the shortest vector of $\Lambda_2$.
The proof is easy. Fix a short non-zero vector $\vec{v}_2$ from $\Lambda_2$. The orthogonal projections of the vectors from $\Lambda_1\cap B(N_1/2)$ on to the line $\perp\vec{v}_2$ have lengths $\le N_1/2$. As there are $O(N_1^2)$ points in $\Lambda_1\cap B(N_1/2)$, some of those projections are within $O(1/N_1)$ of each other. Let $\vec{v}_1$ be the difference vector. As it is the difference between two vectors of length $\le N_1/2$, we have $\vec{v}_1\le N_1$. In the above image the short arrow is the vector $\vec{v}_2$. The black line is the subspace generated by it, and the grey line is the orthogonal complement. The dots mark the points of the lattice $\Lambda_1$. Two points with nearby projections have been singled out by using larger dots. As is their difference vector $\vec{v}_1$, whose projection is then predictably very short. I also drew another copy (= the other arrow) of $\vec{v}_2$ to begin at the endpoint of $\vec{v}_1$. The two copies of $\vec{v}_2$ are a pair of parallel edges of the parallelogram. The small parallelogram has base $=|\vec{v}_2|$ and height = the length of the projection of $\vec{v}_1$ on the grey line.
When drawing this image, I was selecting the lattice points from a square shaped region as opposed to a disk. The effects of that change can be absorbed into the constant $K$, and can IMHO be ignored. Using real quadratic number fields and Liouville's theorem it is easy to construct lattices $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ in such a way that we always have
$$
D(N_1,N_2)\ge \frac{K'}{N_1N_2}.

In this sense the pigeon hole bound from the previous paragraph has the correct order, when $N_2=L_{2,\min}$. In light of this I think a natural main question would be Is their a known upper bound $D(N_1,N_2)\le f(N_1,N_2)$ where both $N_1$ and $N_2$ appear in an essential role? With the word essential I mean that a bound should decrease, when we increase either $N_1$ or $N_2$. For example, in the above application of the pigeon hole principle we can trivially switch their roles to get a symmetric function 
$D(N_1,N_2)\le K\max\{N_1,N_2\}^{-1}$, but this is not useful :-)","['geometry', 'integer-lattices', 'reference-request', 'pigeonhole-principle']"
182432,Digicode cracking problem,"I have a digicode to enter my home. Let's say the combination is 4432. This morning, I got it wrong, so I retyped it, and the door opened. But the final code I entered was 4424432. That made me realize that the door opens for any sequence of number containing 4432, in fact any sequence that matches [0-9]*4432[0-9]* . And I asked myself the question: what is the optimal way of cracking it, if you don't know the code ? To simplify, let's assume a couple of things: The combination is a sequence of 4 digits. All combinations are equiprobable. If you could submit one code at a time. For example, if you have to press 4 buttons then press  ""submit"", the approach would be a simple bruteforce. You try out all the 10000 solutions one by one: 0000, 0001, 0002 etc... But given the fact that 2 combinations somewhat overlap, you can optimise your search, and I'm interested about what is the best optimisation you can do.","['sequences-and-series', 'combinatorics']"
182460,Boundary conditions on asymmetric random walk recursion formula,"A random walker moves at each step two units to the right or one unit to the left, with corresponding probabilities $p$ and $q = 1-p$.

182482,Can lines connecting nearest neighbors ever cross?,"I don't have any background in graph theory so I am sorry if this is a basic question.  I want to know if lines connecting nearest neighbors can cross in a few different cases. I have convinced myself that if there are no ties for nearest
neighbor it is impossible for lines to cross.  Is this correct? I think it might still be impossible even if ties are allowed, in which case either or both lines can be drawn but I haven't come up with solid reasoning to back that up. This case is a bit more complicated.  Say that points can be connected to their second nearest neighbor if a line originating from them has yet to be drawn and they are already connected to their nearest neighbor.  In this condition, two pairs of points very far from one another would be connected into one long line.  Each pair would get a line connecting it to its nearest neighbor and then one or two lines would connect between the pairs.  Connecting to the third nearest neighbor is not allowed.  It seems to me that in this case as well no lines would cross. I have no idea where to begin looking for formal math to back up these statements.  Is there a general theory of lines crossing in a network of nearest neighbor connections?  Any help would be appreciated.","['geometry', 'graph-theory']"

182523,What is the English name of these definitions?,"An italian real analysis book frequently uses the following definitions Definition 1 . Separated sets, separation elements. The sets $A,B\subset\mathbb{R}$ are said to be separated if $$a\leq b\quad\forall a\in A, \forall b\in B.$$ It is said a separation element every $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $$a\leq\lambda\leq b\quad\forall a\in A, \forall b\in B.$$ and Definition 2 . Adjacent sets. The separated sets $A,B$ are said to be adjacent if they have a unique separation element. These definitions are used, for example, to introduce the Riemann integral as the unique separation element between the sets of the inferior integral sums and the superior integral sums, when it exists.

182527,Equivalence of a Lebesgue Integrable function,"I have the following question: Let $X$: $\mu(X)<\infty$, and let $f \geq 0$ on $X$.  Prove that $f$ is Lebesgue integrable on $X$ if and only if $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}2^n \mu(\lbrace x \in X : f(x) \geq 2^n \rbrace) < \infty $. I have the following ideas, but am a little unsure. For the forward direction: By our hypothesis, we are taking $f$ to be Lebesgue integrable.  Assume $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}2^n \mu(\lbrace x \in X : f(x) \geq 2^n \rbrace) = \infty $.  Then for any n, no matter how large, $\mu(\lbrace x \in X : f(x) \geq 2^n \rbrace)$ has positive measure.  Otherwise, the sum will terminate for a certain $N$, giving us $\sum_{n=0}^{N}2^n \mu(\lbrace x \in X : f(x) \geq 2^n \rbrace) < \infty $.  Thus we have $f$ unbounded on a set of positive measure, which in combination with $f(x) \geq 0$, gives us that $\int_E f(x) d\mu=\infty$.  This is a contradiction to $f$ being Lebesgue integrable.  So our summation must be finite. For the reverse direction: We have that $\sum_{n=0}^{N}2^n \mu(\lbrace x \in X : f(x) \geq 2^n \rbrace) < \infty \\$.  Assume that $f$ is not Lebesgue integrable, then we have $\int_E f(x) d\mu=\infty$.  Since we are integrating over a finite set $X$, then this means that $f(x)$ must be unbounded on a set of positive measure, which makes our summation infinite, a contradiction. Any thoughts as to the validity of my proof?  I feel as if there is an easier, direct way to do it.",['real-analysis']
