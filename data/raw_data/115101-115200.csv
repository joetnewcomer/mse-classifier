1685222,What is wrong with this proof that the power set of the natural numbers is countable?,"Here I offer a ""proof"" of why the power set of the natural numbers is countable by creating a supposed bijection. I know that my proof is wrong, but where? If anyone could point it out, that'd be awesome. Consider the power set of the natural numbers. We can form a bijection $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ as follows. For any $f(x)$ convert $x$ to its binary representation, which is a string of $0$s and $1$s. If the $i$-th digit is $1$, then include $i$ in the output set $S=f(x)$. Otherwise do not include $i$. Note that $i$ is $0$-indexed and starts from the right-most digit. So in this case $f(5)=\{1,3\}$. Supposedly we can construct any set in $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ with an appropriate choice of $x$. Where does this proof blow up?",['elementary-set-theory']

1685548,Two ways of defining rank of a set,"I am studying set theory, and I have some difficulties in understanding how people define the notion of rank there (I hope, specialists in logic will excuse me for this). As far as I understand, there are two equivalent ways of defining rank of a set: Krzysztof Ciesielski in his book Set Theory for the Working
Mathematician defines rank by the formula 
$$
\text{rank}(X)=\min\{A\in\text{Ordinal numbers}: \ X\in V_{A+1}\},
$$ 
where $V_A$ is what is called cumulative hierarchy . J.Donald Monk in his Introduction to Set Theory defines rank by the formula
$$
\text{rank}(X)=\min\{A\in\text{Ordinal numbers}: \ \forall Y\in X\quad \text{rank}(Y)< A\}.
$$ There is no problem for me with the first definition, but I don't understand the second one. J.D.Monk writes that his definition is justified by the General recursion principle: each function $F:V\to V$ (where $V$ is the class of all sets) defines a unique function $G:V\to V$ by the formula $$
G(X)=F(G\big|_X),\qquad X\in V
$$ 
  (here $G\big|_X$ is the restriction of $G$ on $X$; I simplify a bit Monk's Theorem 13.1). The problem for me is that I don't understand, which function $F:V\to V$ in these terms defines rank. I would think that Monk has in mind the function
$$
F(H)=\min\{A\in\text{Ordinal numbers}: \ \text{Range}(H)\subseteq A\}.
$$
But this function is not defined for all $H\in V$, only for those $H$ which have range in the class of all ordinals (I wrote this in one of my previous questions, here ). I suppose, there must be a standard trick, that people use here, but I don't know it. Can anybody clarify me this?","['elementary-set-theory', 'ordinals']"
1685569,Can different control points lead to the same Bézier curve?,"A cubic Bézier curve is a polynomial $$F(u) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \mathbf{b}_i^n P_i \;\;\;\text{ with } u \in [0,1], P_i \in \mathbb{R}^2, n=3 \text{ and } \mathbf{b}_i^n = \begin{pmatrix}n\\i\end{pmatrix} u^i (1-u)^{n-i}$$ You get plots like this ( source ): Having the set $\mathbb{R}^{4 \times 2}$ of all cubic Bézier curves defined by their control points and the set of all of their plots, I wondered: Are there any two Bézier curves which have different control points $P_i, P_i'$ but are the same function? Obviously, to be the same function the point $P_0 = P_0'$ and $P_3'$ have to be the same. Also, $P_1, P_1'$ and $P_2, P_2'$ have to be on the same line, because $\overline{P_0 P_1}$ is a tangent on the curve. But besides that, I'm not too sure if there could be a combination where the points are different, but the curves are the same. edit: I think one problem might be when all control points are on the same line.

1685612,Smoothness of solutions of the curve shortening flow given bounded curvature,"I've been looking at the Lemma 1.5 of The Heat Equation Shrinks Embedded Plane Curves to Round Points ( here ), where Matthew Grayson proved that If $\kappa(s,t)$ is bounded for $t\in[0,t_0)$. Then for some $\varepsilon>0$, $C(t)$ exists and is smooth for $t\in [0,t_0+\varepsilon)$. In the proof he uses the formula 
$${\partial\over\partial t}{\partial\over\partial s}={\partial\over\partial s}{\partial\over\partial t}+\kappa^2{\partial\over\partial s}$$
and also
$${\partial\kappa\over\partial t}={\partial^2\kappa\over\partial s^2}+\kappa^3$$
to obtain that
$${\partial\over\partial t}\left({\partial\kappa\over\partial s}\right)={\partial\over\partial s^2}\left({\partial\kappa\over\partial s}\right)+4\kappa^2\left({\partial\kappa\over\partial s}\right).$$
He claims that this equation bounds the rate of growth of ${\partial\kappa\over\partial s}$ to exponential. Repeated applications of the first formula yield
$${\partial\over\partial t}\left({\partial^n\kappa\over\partial s^n}\right)={\partial\over\partial s^2}\left({\partial^n\kappa\over\partial s^n}\right)+(n+3)\kappa^2\left({\partial^n\kappa\over\partial s^n}\right)\;+\;\text{previously bounded terms},$$
so he gets the same as before for the $n$-th derivative of $\kappa$. With this, using again the first formula, it is proved that the curve converges as $t\to t_0$. And similarly, $C(t_0)$ is smooth. He finally applies the Theorem 1.1 to obtain that $C(t)$ exists and is smooth for some further short time. I'm struggling to understand the key parts of this proof: The boundedness of the derivatives is not that obvious to me from the above formulas. I guess he gets an PDE which solution can be bounded by an exponential, but if so I don't really see how. From the boundedness of the derivatives of $\kappa$ with respect to $s$ for a fixed $t$, $C(t)$ converges as $t\to t_0$. This is because with $\kappa$ and its derivatives bounded, the curves under the flow must exist for $t\in[0,t_0)$. And the same argument for the smoothness... Am I right? As you can see I'm kind of lost here, it would be great if anyone could explain to me a little bit these two ideas.

1685621,What really is ''orthogonality''?,"I know that we can define two vectors to be orthogonal only if they are elements of  a vector space with an inner product. So, if $\vec x$ and $\vec y$ are elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (as a real vector space), we can say that they are orthogonal iff $\langle \vec x,\vec y\rangle=0$, where $\langle \vec x,\vec y\rangle $ is an inner product. Usually the inner product is defined with respect to the standard basis $E=\{\hat e_1,\hat e_2 \}$ (for $n=2$ to simplify notations), the standard definition is:
$$
\langle \vec x,\vec y\rangle_E=x_1y_1+x_2y_2
$$
Where 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1\\x_2
\end{bmatrix}
=[\vec x]_E
\qquad
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1\\y_2
\end{bmatrix}
=[\vec y]_E
$$
are the components of the two vectors in the standard basis and, by definition of the inner product, $\hat e_1$ and $\hat e_2$ are orho-normal. Now, if $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$ are linearly independent the set $V=\{\vec v_1,\vec v_2\}$ is a basis and we can express any vector in this basis with a couple of components:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x'_1\\x'_2
\end{bmatrix}
=[\vec x]_V
\qquad
\begin{bmatrix}
y'_1\\y'_2
\end{bmatrix}
=[\vec y]_V
$$
from which we can define an inner product:
$$
\langle \vec x,\vec y\rangle_V=x'_1y'_1+x'_2y'_2
$$ Obviously we have:
$$
[\vec v_1]_V=
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\0
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad
[\vec v_2]_V=
\begin{bmatrix}
0\\1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
and $\{\vec v_1,\vec v_2\}$ are orthogonal (and normal) for the inner product $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle_V$. This means that any two linearly independent vectors are orthogonal with respect to a suitable inner product defined by  a suitable basis. So orthogonality seems  a ''coordinate dependent'' concept. The question is: is my reasoning correct? And, if yes, what make the usual standard basis so special that we chose such basis for the usual definition of orthogonality? I add something to better illustrate my  question. If my reasoning is correct than, for any basis in a vector space there is an inner product such that the vectors of the basis are orthogonal. If we think at vectors as oriented segments (in pure geometrical sense) this seems contradicts our intuition of what ''orthogonal'' means and also a geometric definition of orthogonality. So, why what we call a ''standard basis'' seems to be in accord with intuition and other basis are not?","['vector-spaces', 'hilbert-spaces', 'geometry']"

1685660,"Galois Group of the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5}):\mathbb{Q}$. Why is it like this?","The $4$th edition of Ian Stewart's Galois Theory is what I am looking at where there is an example stated in the following manner Let the field extension be  $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5}):\mathbb{Q}$. We have previously seen that $t^2-5$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$. Similarly, $t^2-2$ i irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5})$ and $t^2-3$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{5})$. Thus there are three automorphisms of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5})$ which are, \begin{equation} \begin{split} \rho_1:& \sqrt{2} \rightarrow -\sqrt{2} \text{ , }\sqrt{3} \rightarrow \sqrt{3} \text{ , } \sqrt{5} \rightarrow \sqrt{5}\\
\rho_2:& \sqrt{2} \rightarrow \sqrt{2} \text{ , }\sqrt{3} \rightarrow -\sqrt{3} \text{ , } \sqrt{5} \rightarrow \sqrt{5}\\
\rho_3:& \sqrt{2} \rightarrow \sqrt{2} \text{ , }\sqrt{3} \rightarrow \sqrt{3} \text{ , } \sqrt{5} \rightarrow -\sqrt{5} \end{split}
\end{equation} It is easy to see that the maps commute so it generates the group $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2  \times \mathbb{Z}_2 $. Okay, my question. $1.$ First, what are the elements of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5})$? Tower law leads me to say the degree of extension $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5}):\mathbb{Q}]=8$. So, there are $8$ elements as bases, yes? I have found these to be $\beta=\{1,\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5},\sqrt{6},\sqrt{10},\sqrt{15},\sqrt{30}\}$. Now, all $\rho$ up there, seem only to care about $\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5}$.Since we are looking for $\mathbb{Q}$-automorphisms over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5})$, sure $\rho$ will not touch on any rationals. But why do they ignore, say a map like $\sqrt{30} \rightarrow -\sqrt{30}$(while all other radicals are mapped to itself for instance). SHouldn't we consider ""all"" automorphisms like $\rho$? Then surely there are more than just $3$? $2.$ And okay, say you managed to convince me that there are only those $3$ $\rho$s up there. But the next confusion is, how do these generate $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2  \times \mathbb{Z}_2 $? If I understand the notation correctly, $\mathbb{Z}_2 =\{e,x\}$ where $e$ is the identity and $x$ is some non-identity. Commonly, I see it as $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{\bar{0},\bar{1}\}$. Then, taking direct products should give me a set of $3$-tuples $\{(a,b,c): a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}_2=\{\bar{0},\bar{1}\}\}$ so something like $(\bar{0},\bar{1},\bar{1})$ etc. I believe there are $8$ distinct such t$3$-tuples. My understanding from the example is that the Galois Group of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5}):\mathbb{Q}$ is $\{id, \rho_1,\rho_2,\rho_3\}$ so $4$ elements. How is this going to generate $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2  \times \mathbb{Z}_2$? I am very well confused. Overall, I am only starting to learn all of this so my experience is very limited. I may be confusing some mathematical concept with another(afterall, math does jump from one and another definition ""depending on the context"") or simply misunderstanding an idea, notion, theorem whatever. Tricky wordings like $K$-autmorphisms ""over"" $L$ gets me to stop for a second and check in my head what exactly the properties are and what it's meant.

1685772,Characterization of open sets in $R^3$ homeomorphic to $R^3$.,"Background: By the Riemann mapping theorem, for any non-empty, simply connected open subset $U \subset \mathbb{C}$, $U \neq \mathbb{C}$ there exists a biholomorphic map (in particular a homeomorphism) $U \rightarrow \mathbb{D}$ where $\mathbb{D}$ is the unit disk.  Since $\mathbb{D}$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$, any two simply connected subsets of $\mathbb{C}$ are homeomorphic . Trivially the same result holds for $\mathbb{R}^2$. 
I'm wondering if a similar result can be found for subsets of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Specifically, I want to know which open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^3$ are homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^3$ (or the unit ball). The answer to this question (and this one ) seems to claim that an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ if and only if it is contractible and ""simply connected at infinity"" (please correct me on this if I'm mistaken).
Thus as far as I can tell, the problem reduces to describing contractible open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^3$ which are simply connected at infinity. Wikipedia leads me to believe that here, contractible simply means ""no holes"". I have not been able to find a definition for ""simply connected at infinity"" that I could understand. Question: My question is threefold: Is it true that a domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^3$ iff it is contractible and simply connected at infinity? Is there a simpler sufficient and necessary condition that works in $\mathbb{R}^3$? Is there a simple sufficient condition that guarantees that a contractible, open subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^3$? For example, by this question and answer , it seems that convexity is a sufficient condition. Is boundedness a sufficient condition? Can you give an example of a contractible open subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ that is not homeomorphic to the ball? The simpler, the better. Side note: It appears to me that the usual counterexample to the question ""are contractible $n$-manifolds homeomorphic to the $n$-ball"" is the Whitehead manifold . However, this appears to me to be a 3-manifold embedded in 4-dimensional Euclidean space and thus not a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$.

1685843,"Words built from $\{0,1,2\}$ with restrictions which are not so easy to accomodate.","We assume a ternary alphabet $V=\{0,1,2\}$ and are looking for a generating function describing the number of words of $V^*$ fulfilling certain restrictions. The words I am interested in  do not contain runs of length $k+1$ (with $k\geq 1$) and do contain the string $1^k2$, i.e. a run of $1$ of length $k$ followed by $2$. I'm aware of two techniques which are useful for attacking questions of this kind. Smirnow words: One of them is based upon Smirnov words, which are words with no consecutive equal letters. See e.g. example III.24 in Analytic Combinatorics by P. Flajolet and R. Sedgewick. The Smirnov words of the three letter alphabet $V$ are represented by the generating function $S(z)$
  \begin{align*}
S(z)=\left(1-\frac{3z}{1+z}\right)^{-1}
\end{align*}
  Since we are looking for words having maximal runs of $0,1$ and $2$ of length $k$ we substitute
  \begin{align*}
z\rightarrow z+z^2+\cdots+z^k=z\frac{1-z^k}{1-z}
\end{align*}
  Words which do not contain runs of length $k+1$ can therefore obtained as
  \begin{align*}
\left(1-\frac{3z\frac{1-z^k}{1-z}}{1+z\frac{1-z^k}{1-z}}\right)^{-1}=\frac{1-z^{k+1}}{1-3z+2z^{k+1}}
\end{align*} $$ $$ The Goulden-Jackson Cluster Method nicely presented by J. Noonan and D. Zeilberger is predestinated if we are looking for words which are not allowed to contain so-called bad words. Applying this technique it is easy to find a generating function $T(z)$ which do not contain the bad word $1^k2$. According to the formula in page $7$ of the referred paper we obtain
  \begin{align*}
T(z)=\frac{1}{1-3z+z^{k+1}}
\end{align*}
  The generating function $S(z)$ can also be easily obtained with this method. Again according to the formula in page $7$ we get
  \begin{align*}
S(z)=\frac{1}{1-3z+3\frac{z^{k+1}(1-z)}{1-z^{k+1}}}=\frac{1-z^{k+1}}{1-3z+2z^{k+1}}
\end{align*} I have problems to derive a generating function which follows the combined requirements of counting words which do not contain words with runs of length $k+1$, but contain the substring $1^k2$.

There are also others like $$\sum_{i=-\infty}^\infty a_i=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=-n}^{0}a_i+\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^na_i$$ but this seems a bit arbitrary. More specifically: if I'm asked to show that a certain series of functions $$\sum_{i=-\infty}^\infty f_i$$ converges, then which sequence of partial sums should I consider? edit: yet another possibility is to consider these types of series only if they converge absolutely, in which case these considerations are irrelevant. edit2: The problem with the splitting definition is that it does not seem to work when considering different modes of convergence. For example, if I want to show that $\sum_{i=-\infty}^\infty f_i$ converges uniformly, I would need for a given $\epsilon$ need to find a $\delta(\epsilon)$ s.t. for $N>n$ the $N$ th partial sum close enough to the limit function for all $x$ in my domain.

I am confronted with computing the integral below: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \cos(2bx)dx, b \in \mathbb R, b \gt0$$ I understand that this is a question in which Complex Analysis has applications to Real Analysis. Specifically, Cauchy's Theorem will be used. That being said, the hint I was given (and the method I am attempting to use) is the following: Integrate $e^{-z^2}$ over this curve: The curve is a rectangle such that its length is $2R$ and its width is $b$. Also, the length on the lower side of the rectangle lies on the x-axis. Lastly, the direction of curvature is counter-clockwise. My question is this: why integrate $e^{-z^2}$, and not $e^{-z^2}\cos(2bz)$? That is, the actual integral we're computing? I know that the former would be easier to integrate, but where did the $\cos(2bz)$ term go, and where will it come into play again? Also, it's important to say that $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-t^2}dt = \sqrt\pi$ will be useful here as well.

1685906,Determining whether an orthogonal matrix represents a rotation or reflection,"The exercise asks us to determine whether the given orthogonal matrix represents a rotation or a reflection. If it is a rotation, give the angle of rotation; if it is a reflection, give the line of reflection. $$
A = \begin{bmatrix}

       -\frac{4}{5} & \frac{3}{5}\\[0.3em]
     \end{bmatrix}
$$ I know you can check whether it is a reflection or rotation by calculating the determinant. So for example for the matrix above $$det(A) = -\frac{3}{5}\cdot\frac{3}{5}-(-\frac{4}{5})\cdot(-\frac{4}{5}) = -1$$ And so that means that matrix $A$ corresponds to a reflection in $R^2$, but how do you get the line of reflection from this? $$
B = \begin{bmatrix}
       -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\\[0.3em]
       -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\frac{1}{2}\\[0.3em]

$$ And for a rotation, so for example matrix $B$ given above, can you simply say that it corresponds to the rotation matrix $R$ $$ 
  R =   \begin{bmatrix}
       cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta)\\[0.3em]
       sin(\theta) & cos(\theta)\\[0.3em]

So this gives $$cos(\theta) = -\frac{1}{2}, \theta = cos^{-1}(-\frac{1}{2}) = 120^{\circ}\\
  sin(\theta) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \theta = sin^{-1}(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = -60^{\circ}

How does one see this? EDIT: Here are some ideas: Using $\mathcal{O}_Z(D)=\mathscr{H}om(\mathcal{O}_Z(-D),\mathcal{O}_{Z})$ (not sure if this is generally true with the hypotheses above, but I believe it is true in the situation I am concerned with) and adjunction of pullback and pushforward, and $f_*\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{Z}}=\mathcal{O}_Z$, it would be sufficient to show $(f^* f_* S)/torsion=S$ when $S$ is rank $1$ reflexive.  By adjunction of pullback and pushforward there is a natural map $f^* f_* S \to S$ corresponding to the identity $f_* S \to f_* S$.  Now I would need to prove this is surjective and it's kernel equal to the torsion.  The latter part may use reflexitivity since torsion is the kernel of the map to a sheaf's double dual (but I'm not clear on how to use this).","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

1686011,Why are these definitions of groups of central type equivalent?,"Let $G$ be a finite group. In the celebrated paper of Howlett and Isaacs, On Groups of Central Type , Math. Z.

(In other sources, the quotient $G/Z(G)$ is called to be of central type, where $G$ satisfies above property). For each 2-cocycle $f \in Z^2(G, \mathbb{C}^*)$, a complex twisted group algebra, denoted by $\mathbb{C}^fG$, is defined by extending the multiplication $g_1.g_2:=f(g_1, g_2)g_1g_2$, $\forall g_1, g_2 \in G$, to all linear combinations of elements of $G$ with coeffecients in $\mathbb{C}$. It is known that complex twisted group algebra $\mathbb{C}^fG$ may be a simple ring. A group $G$ is called to be of central type, if the twisted complex group algebra $\mathbb{C}^f \overline{G}$ is simple for some $2$-cocyle $f$ on $\overline{G}$, where $\overline{G}=G/Z(G)$ . (For example see the preprints of Ofir Schnabel on this topic). I know that $\mathbb{C}^fG$ is simple if and only if $G$ possesses only one class of irreducible $f$-projective character. But I can't see the relation of these two definitions. So my questions are as following: QUESTION 1: How simplicity of $\mathbb{C}^f \overline{G}$ implies that $G$ is of central type according to the definition given in  $1$? ( Update: this question is settled by the Theorem $1$ of this paper . The statement and proof of the theorem are given in answers). Further Discussions: In the paper mentioned in $1$, the authors proved the following brilliant theorem: Theorem (Howlett-Isaacs): If $N \lhd G$ and $\lambda \in Irr(N)$ is a $G$-invariant irreducible character of $N$ such that ${\lambda}^G$ is a multiple of some $\chi \in Irr(G)$, then $G/N$ is solvable. It is mentioned in this paper that if $\mathbb{C}^fG$ is simple, then Howlett-Isaacs theorem implies that $G$ is solvable. QUESTION 2: Why the above claim is true?

It made sense that this would continue until point $n$, at which point there would be zero lines you can draw. This meant that if you just add up all of those, you'd get the number. For example, in the picture below there are $12$ points, so $11+10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 66$ lines.

$$ d(a, i, n) = \begin{cases}
    d(^it \cdot log(t) \cdot a+\ ^it\ ^{i-1}tt^{-1}, i+1,n),& \text{if } i\leq n\\

Strictly speaking, $\theta$ is measured in any units we want - it's the interpretation/definition of the $\cos(\theta)$ function relative to our chosen ""units"" for $\theta$ that matters. That's why it's just a matter of economics when choosing between radians, degrees, or anything else. Of course, when finding arcs on a circle, it's convenient to define the angle $\theta$ in terms of the ratio between the radius of a circle and its circumference, $1/2\pi$ (e.g. when you've covered an angle $\pi$ in these units along the circumference of a circle, you've traveled $\pi/(2\pi)=1/2$ of the circumference). That way, calculating arc-lengths becomes simple multiplication by the angle $\theta$ (this obviously isn't true for degrees!). However, I don't know how to interepret the power (Taylor/Maclaurin) series for trig functions like $\cos(\theta)$ and $\sin(\theta)$. $$\cos(\theta)=1-\frac{\theta^2}{2}+\cdots,\,\,\,\,\sin(\theta)=\theta-\frac{\theta^3}{6}+\cdots$$ Why must we use radians in the above series representation? Why don't we use for the ""units"" of $\theta$, for example, the fraction of the entire circle that it covers (e.g. $1/4$ instead of $\pi/2$, $1$ instead of $2\pi$, etc.)?

1687111,Understanding the definition of the covariance operator,"Let $\mathbb H$ be an arbitrary separable Hilbert space. The covariance operator $C:\mathbb H\to\mathbb H$ between two $\mathbb H$-valued zero mean random elements $X$ and $Y$ with $\operatorname E\|X\|^2<\infty$ and $\operatorname E\|Y\|^2<\infty$ is defined by
$$
C(h)=\operatorname E[\langle X,h\rangle Y]
$$
for each $h\in\mathbb H$. Why is the covariance operator defined in this way? It seems that we can arrive at this definition if we try to generalise the definition of the covariance matrix. Suppose for the moment that $\mathbb H=\mathbb R^n$. Then the covariance matrix is given by $\operatorname E[XY^T]$ which is a bounded linear operator from $\mathbb R^n$ to $\mathbb R^n$. Also, we have that
$$
\operatorname E[YX^T](h)
=\operatorname E[YX^Th]
=\operatorname E[Y\langle X,h\rangle]
=\operatorname E[\langle X,h\rangle Y]
$$
for each $h\in\mathbb R^n$. The rightmost expression only depends on the inner product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ and maybe we can say that this is the definition of the covariance operator for the arbitrary $\mathbb H$. Is this the right intuition behind the definition of the covariance operator? Any help is much appreciated!","['probability-theory', 'covariance', 'operator-theory', 'hilbert-spaces']"

So I substitute with $\ u(x)= \frac{y}{x}$ and do the following $\ y'= \frac{3y}{2x}-\frac{x}{2y} => y'=\frac{3y}{2x}-\frac{1}{2u(x)} = \frac{3}{2x}y-\frac{1}{2u(x)}$ so I can use separation of variables and get the homogeneous solution and the inhomogeneous.
