76294,an important property of an ellipse,"Good morning everybody.
I would like to know the proof of the following observation on the ellipse. A circle is drawn with the right latus rectum as diameter. Another circle is drawn with its center on the major axis such that it is internally tangent to both the circle given above, and the auxiliary circle (the circumcircle of the ellipse). This circle is said to be right associate circle of ellipse. (The left associate circle is defined similarly.) All the circles whose diameters are right focal chords are tangent to the right associate circle, and similarly, all the circles whose diameters are left focal chords are tangent to the left associate circle. Also, can we see something similar in the other conic sections?","['geometry', 'conic-sections']"

$$(f \cdot g)^{-1}=f^{-1} \cdot g^{-1}= \mu f \cdot g^{-1},$$

76369,"For symmetric stable distributions, why is $\alpha \le 2$?","I'm preparing a lecture on stable distributions, and I'm trying to find a simple explanation of the following fact. Suppose we are trying to come up with stable distributions.  From the definition, it's clear that a distribution is stable iff its characteristic function $\phi$  satisfies $\phi(t)^n = e^{i t b_n} \phi(a_n t)$.  The normal distribution, with chf $\phi(t) = e^{-t^2/2}$ clearly satisfies this with $b_n = 0$, $a_n = \sqrt{n}$.  This suggests that we look for distributions with chfs of the form $\phi(t) = e^{-c |t|^\alpha}$.  For $0 \le \alpha \le 2$, this is indeed a chf, and there is a nice proof in Durrett's book, constructing it as a weak limit using Lévy's continuity theorem.  But: For $\alpha > 2$,  is there a simple reason why $\phi(t) = e^{-c |t|^\alpha}$ cannot be a chf? Breiman's Probability proves a general formula for the chf of a stable distribution, using a representation formula for infinitely divisible distributions, but it's  more work  than I want to do for this.","['probability-theory', 'fourier-analysis', 'probability-distributions', 'characteristic-functions']"

(Take two equations defining $X$ in $\mathbf{P}^3$ and consider the number field containing the coefficients of this equation.) Suppose that $X$ can be defined  over a number field $K$. It seems to be a basic fact that there are infinitely many non-isomorphic curves $Y$ over $K$, called twists I believe, such that $Y$ is isomorphic to $X$ over $\overline{\mathbf{Q}}$. Why is this? Now, this actually bothers me a bit. Because I was hoping to have only a finite number of such ""twists"". How can I guarantee that there are only a finite number of twists of a given curve $X/K$? Let me be more precise. For example, if I also want all the twists of $X$ over $K$  to have semi-stable reduction over $K$, is the number then finite? Another example, if I also want all the twists of $X$ over $K$ to have good reduction over $K$, is the number then finite?

76470,Why do horizontal curves have zero covariant derivative along their projection?,"Background: Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold.  Let $(p,v) \in TM$ and $V, W \in T_{(p,v)}TM$.  We can introduce a Riemannian metric on $TM$ via $$\langle V, W\rangle_{(p,v)} = \langle d\pi(V), d\pi(W) \rangle_p + \left\langle \frac{D\alpha}{dt}\!(0), \frac{D\beta}{dt}\!(0)\right\rangle_p,$$ where $\alpha, \beta\colon I \to TM$ are curves in $TM$ with $\alpha(0) = \beta(0) = (p,v)$ and $\alpha'(0) = V$ and $\beta'(0) = W$, and $\pi\colon TM \to M$ is the natural projection. Given this metric on $TM$, we then call $\text{Ker}(d\pi) \subset T_{(p,v)}TM$ the vertical space , and its orthogonal complement the horizontal space .  We say that a curve $\alpha\colon I \to TM$ is horizontal iff its tangent vector $\alpha'(t) \in T_{\alpha(t)}TM$ is horizontal for all $t \in I$. Question: How can one show that a curve $\alpha\colon I \to TM$ is horizontal if and only if $\alpha$ is parallel along its projection curve $\pi\circ \alpha$? Source/Motivation: This is Problem 2(b) from Chapter 3 of do Carmo's ""Riemannian Geometry.""  It was assigned as a homework problem, and the homework was collected the other day (Oct 27), but I was unable to do the forward direction $(\implies)$ of the problem. I would especially appreciate a coordinate-free proof if possible. My Attempt: Suppose $\alpha'(t)$ is horizontal, so $\langle \alpha'(t), W \rangle_{\alpha(t)} = 0$ for any vertical vector $W \in T_{\alpha(t)}M$.  Since $d\pi(W) = 0$, we have that $0 = \langle \alpha'(t), W \rangle_{\alpha(t)} = \langle \frac{D\alpha}{dt}\!(0), \frac{D\beta}{dt}\!(0)\rangle_{(\pi\circ\alpha)(t)}$, where $\beta\colon I \to TM$ is a curve with $\beta(0) = \alpha(0)$ and $\beta'(0) = W$. It seems to me that if we chose $W$ cleverly enough, then we could perhaps conclude that $\frac{D\alpha}{dt}\!(0) = 0$, which is what we want to show. Other thoughts: Perhaps an application of Gauss' Lemma could help somewhere? While attempting to prove this problem, I conjectured that if $\alpha'(t) \in T_{\alpha(t)}TM$ is horizontal, then $d\pi(\alpha'(t)) = \alpha(t)$.  However, even if this is true -- it certainly seems likely -- I am not sure how to apply it to get a solution.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
76478,"Exercise on convergence in measure (Folland, Real Analysis)","This one comes from Folland, Real Analysis, Problem 33 in the section titled Modes of Convergence.

f = g^{ord_{Y,x}(f)} \cdot h

It seems impossible to write $z_2 = z_1^d h$ for some $h \in \mathcal O_{X,x}^*$.  Further, it is stated that the order at any point on an irreducible hypersurface is independent of the point.  But clearly $ord_{Y,x} z_2 = 0$ if $x \ne (0,0)$.  So if the order is 0 at (0,0) as well, then this is saying that $z_2 \in \mathcal O_{X,(0,0)}^*$.  What am I missing?

The paper is assumed to be infinitely thin of course and no cutting or stretching is permitted. I must be able to justify any claims I make.

Wouldn't it be the greatest lower bound of a monotonically decreasing sequence of $A$ 's with lower bound 6?) A well-known fact from geometry says that a cube has $11$ nets. Since none of the nets are square, my sheet of paper can't be folded like any of them, so $A>6$ . A square $2\sqrt{2}$ on a side can wrap a unit cube. Here's how: make four folds each perpendicular to a diagonal and $\frac{3}{2}$ from the paper's corner. Place the cube in the resulting square created by the folds.

Afterthought : It might have been more impressive to have asked for the $10^{10}$th digit of, say, the $10^{10^{10^{10^{10}}}}$th prime (that digit being $8$), since perhaps no one has ever before computed the ten-billionth digit of a particular prime.","['prime-numbers', 'elementary-number-theory', 'recreational-mathematics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Then the two topologies are the same. Now looking at a space $ X $ with two topologies $ \tau_1,\tau_2 $ this is not true any more, i.e. if the topological spaces $ (X,\tau_1), (X,\tau_2)$ have the same convergent sequences the topologies may differ!

76713,"Homogeneous polynomials on a vector space $V$, $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V^*)$ and naturality","My three questions all relate to Harris' ""Algebraic Geometry - A First Course"". Unless mentioned otherwise, $V$ is an n-dimensional vector space over an arbitrary field $k$. 1) At first, I'd like to make sure that I have the right motivation for this construction. According to my humble understanding, the main advantage of $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V^*)$ is having a framework to talk about homogeneous polynomials of a fixed degree on V and being able to evaluate them without the need to choose a basis. More precisely, there exists an evaluation map $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V^*) \times V \rightarrow k$ via $(\sum\limits_i a_{i_1}a_{i_2}\cdots a_{i_d}\hat{v_{i_1}}\cdot \hat{v_{i_2}} \cdots \hat{v_{i_d}}, v) \mapsto \sum\limits_i a_{i_1}a_{i_2}\cdots a_{i_d}\hat{v_{i_1}}(v) \hat{v_{i_2}}(v) \cdots \hat{v_{i_d}}(v)$ Is that correct? 2) On page 4, it is written that homogeneous polynomials on $\mathbb{P}V$ can be naturally identified with the vector space $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V^*)$. I was able to find the obvious isomorphism from $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V^*)$ to $k[X_0, X_1, \ldots, X_n]_d$ after choosing a basis for $V^*$, but I don't see how such an identification can be made naturally. 3) Let $V$ be two-dimensional, $char\ k \neq 2$ In chapter 10, 10.8 we deal with the action of $PGL_2(k)$ on $\mathbb{P}^2$. Now $PGL_2(k)$ obviously acts on $\mathbb{P}^1$ and Harris mentions that this naturally induces an action on $\mathbb{P}(\operatorname{Sym}^2(V^*))$. However, I fail to realize what this action is supposed to look like, let alone how it is obtained naturally (I DO see how $PGL_2(k)$ acts on $\mathbb{P}(\operatorname{Sym}^2(V))\cong \mathbb{P^2}$, though). On a side note, where exactly comes the assumption on the characteristic of $k$ into play? When I verified that the set of squares $v\cdot v$ is isomorphic to the image of the quadratic Veronese, I had to divide by two, but I suspect that this is not the only reason to make this assumption.

A hint is given: ""For the left-hand inequality do first the case where $\|x\|_p = 1$, and for the right-hand inequality do first the case $\|x\|_q = 1$."" So first I set $\|x\|_p = 1$ and got $\sum_{k = 1}^n|x_k|^q \leq 1 \leq n^\frac{q}{p}\sum_{k = 1}^n|x_k|^q$. This makes sense since $\frac{q}{p} > 1$.

76931,"Finding simple, step, and continuous functions to satisfy Lebesgue integral conditions","The problem: Suppose $E \in \mathfrak{M}$ and that $f$ is (Lebesgue) integrable over $E$. For any $\epsilon > 0$ show that there exist simple, step, and continuous functions $\varphi, \psi, g$ (respectively) such that: $\displaystyle\int_E |f - \varphi|\,dm < \epsilon$ $\displaystyle\int_E|f - \psi|\,dm < \epsilon$ $\displaystyle\int_E|f - g|\,dm <\epsilon$ Now, we have shown in the notes that for $f: [a, b] \to [-\infty, +\infty]$ measurable (and $f \neq \pm \infty$ almost everywhere) we can find simple, step, and continuous functions such that :
$$m(\left \{x \in [a, b] : |f(x) - (\text{the function})| \geq \epsilon \right \}) < \epsilon $$ So I'm certain that these two are related! We also have that $\displaystyle\int_E |f|\,dm < \infty$ by assumption on $f$. But how are these connected?","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
76934,Contraction mapping does not hold in metric space,"Let $X=\mathbb{Q}\cap [1,2]$, i.e $X$ is the set of rational number between 1 and 2 inclusive.
We can consider $X$ to be a metric space by endowing it with the usual distance function, i.e for $x,y \in X$ we put $d(x,y)=|x-y|$. Now we define $f:X\rightarrow X$ by $f(x)=x-\dfrac{x^2-2}{2x}$.
Ones should check that if$x\in X$ , then $f(x)\in X$ as well. This means checking that if $x$ is rational and in $[1,2]$ then $f(x)$ is also rational and in $[1,2]$.

Prove that $f$ is not continuous with respect to $\|x\|_\infty =\sup_n|\alpha_n|$. This is my proof: Since $f$ is a linear map, $f$ is continuous iff $f$ is bounded. Assume for the sake of contradiction that $f$ is bounded. This implies that there exist $k\gt 0$.  such that $$\|f(x)\|\le k\|x\|_\infty \text{ for all } x\in \ell^1$$
In particular, $k$ may be $1$. Now, let $x=(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots)\in \ell^1$ where $\alpha_i \ge 0$ for all $i$. $$\|f(x)\|=\|\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\alpha_{n}\|$$ Since for each $i$ $\alpha_{i}\gt 0$, $$=\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty |\alpha_n|
\gt\sup_n|\alpha_n|=\|x\|_\infty$$ This implies $$\|f(x)\|\gt\|x\|_\infty$$ Contradicting my first line of proof. Hence $f$ is not bounded, i.e. $f$ is not continuous.

76983,Approximation with complex polynomials on $S^1$ - can it be done?,"Can one uniformly approximate a function 'similar' to identity on $S^1$ with complex polynomials? I mean a function like: $f(z)=z \cdot (1+h \cdot \sin(m\cdot Arg(z)))$, for $|h| < 1,\ m \in \mathbb{N}$. What I actually have is a function (actually I have a sequence of them but that is another story) like the following one (or a smooth version of it): $f(z)=z \cdot (1+ h \cdot wave(Arg(z)))$, where $wave(\phi)=[\phi^{-1} \in [\pi,k\pi]] \cdot \sin(\frac{1}{\phi})$, $[p]$ is $1$ if $p$ is true and $0$ otherwise and $k \in \mathbb{N_+}$. Can anyone tell me if there are any theorems saying that this approximation can be done or not? It looks similarly to Fourier series. What actually needs to be done is approximating $wave(Arg(z))$. However I need $z^{-n}$ to use Fourier series theory and I have only polynomials. $z^{-n}$ can not be approximated on the whole $S^1$ with polynomials. If I was able to extend the function to the whole 'unit+$\varepsilon$' disk in a holomorphic way I would be able to use Taylor series for this function, but I don't know if such an extending can be done, since the intuitive way with going orthogonally from the $f(S^1)$ when one goes orthogonally from the $S^1$ leads nowhere. My question comes from a bigger problem and what I actually need to solve it is: make such an approximation $w$ of $f$, that: $w(S^1) \subseteq{} \lbrace z \in \mathbb{C}: dist(z,f(S^1))< \delta \rbrace$ $|z-w(z)| < \varepsilon(h)$ where $\delta$ is some unknown constant depending on $f$. We may choose as $\varepsilon$   any function that is is continuous at zero and $\varepsilon(0)=0$. This one looks more complicated but is weaker than the previous one.

76990,What if $f^{(n)}(a)=0$ for all $n\geq 0$?,"This morning I was trying to imagine what a function would look like if all it's derivatives were zero at a point $a$ (assuming it is $C^\infty$). My first thought was that it should be identically zero in a neighborhood of $a$, but this is only true if the function is analytic. So my question is this: What can we say in general about a smooth function (i.e. has derivatives of all orders) whose derivatives are all zero at a single point $a$? It seems like the function $f$ should approach zero at $a$ faster than any polynomial because of Taylor's theorem. In other words, for every $k\geq 1$, there exists some remainder function $r_k(x)$ with $$\frac{f(x)}{(x-a)^k}=r_k(x)\qquad \left( \text{and}\quad \lim_{x\rightarrow a}\ r_k(x)= 0\right).$$ So can we conclude that $f$ approaches zero faster than any polynomial?

77012,Irreducible but not prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}] $,"Show that $2,3, 1-\sqrt{-5}, 1+\sqrt{-5}$ are irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, but not prime and that 1 and -1 are the only units. Let $N$ be the norm map into $\mathbb{Z}$ and let u denote the unit, then because it is a homomorphism it follows that : $N(xy)=N(x)N(y)$ and thus with $N(u)N(u^{-1})=N(uu^{-1})=N(1)$ it follows that the norm of u is a divider of 1 and thus also a unit of $\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore we have in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$: $\forall a,b \in \mathbb{Z}: N(a+b\sqrt{-5})=(a+b\sqrt{-5})(a-b\sqrt{-5})=a^{2}+5b^{2}=1 \ \ \Rightarrow u= \pm 1$ Now it is to show that $2,3,1-\sqrt{-5}, 1+\sqrt{-5}$ are irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]: $ Assume $1-\sqrt{-5}$ is reducible, then there must exist $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ so that $N(1-\sqrt{-5})=N(a)N(b) \Rightarrow N(a)=N(b)= \pm (1-\sqrt{-5})$ But since $1-\sqrt{-5}$ is not a quadratic remainder of $5$, there doesn't exist a solution for the equations $a^{2}+5b^{2}= \pm (1-\sqrt{-5})$ And the exactly same argument also works for $2,3$ and $1+\sqrt{-5}$. Thus we have shown that $2,3,1\pm \sqrt{-5}$ are not reducible over $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. Now we show that they are not prime: Assume that 2 is a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, then because of $2\cdot 3 = (1-\sqrt{-5})(1+\sqrt{-5})=6$ it must hold that $2|(1-\sqrt{-5})$ or $2|(1+\sqrt{-5})$. But with $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ it immediately follows that for : $(1\pm\sqrt{-5})= 2(a+b\sqrt{-5})$ $2b = \pm 1$. So 2 is not a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. Assume that 3 is a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}$, then: $(1\pm \sqrt{-5}) = 3(a+b\sqrt{-5}) \Rightarrow 3b= \pm 1$ it follows that 3 is not a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. Assume that $1\pm \sqrt{-5}$ is a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, then: $3 = (1\pm \sqrt{-5})(a+b\sqrt{-5}) \Rightarrow (1\pm \sqrt{-5} )a = 3$ which is not solvable in $\mathbb{Z}$. And also $2=(1\pm \sqrt{-5})(a+b\sqrt{-5})=(1\pm \sqrt{-5})a$ which is also not solvable in $\mathbb{Z}$ and thus $(1\pm \sqrt{-5})$ can not be a prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$.

77024,L'Hopital's rule and series convergence,"I teach freshman calculus, and have recently been discussing series. In one question on a recent test, I asked whether $\sum\frac{n^2}{n^3+1}$ converges or diverges. One student got the correct answer by the following incorrect reasoning. They used L'Hopital's rule to conclude that $\frac{n^2}{n^3+1}$ has the same limit as $\frac{2n}{3n^2}$ and as $\frac{2}{6n}$ (which is true so far). They then claimed that because $\sum\frac{2}{6n}$ diverges, the original series must diverge. This, of course, does not follow from anything they've been taught. L'Hopital's rule merely says that if $\frac{2}{6n}$ approaches zero, we can conclude that $\frac{n^2}{n^3+1}$ approaches zero. But L'Hopital's rule, as typically stated, says nothing about the ""rate"" at which $\frac{n^2}{n^3+1}$ approaches zero. However, the following conjecture seems to be true for many expressions, such as $\frac{x^a}{e^x}$, $\frac{\ln x}{x^a}$, and $\frac{x}{x^2(\ln x)^a}$. Can anyone help me come up with the ""correct"" conjecture, and a proof?

EDIT: It appears essentially the same question has already been asked. And a nice answer was given by Robert Israel. However, he requires that $f$ and $g$ be meromorphic.

Each pair $\mathbf{u}_i$ and $\mathbf{v}_i$ form a pair of left and right singular vectgors with singular value $\sigma_i$.
