437861,Is this recursion relation proof correct?,"Recurrence relation:$$a_0 = 1$$ $$a_{n+1} = 2a_n$$ I'm trying to prove that for any n ∈ N, $a_n = 2^n$.  I want to use induction. What I have is, assume that $a_n = 2^n$ is true for $P(n)$. Then $P(n+1)$ would be: $$a_{n+1} = 2^{n+1}$$ $$a_{n+1}=2\cdot(2^n)$$ Because $a_n = 2^n$, then we can substitute, so $a_{n+1} = 2a_n$.","['discrete-mathematics', 'number-theory']"
437862,"Prove that if $\langle x,z\rangle = 0$ for all $z,$ then $x=0.$","I just wanted to check if my reasoning in this proof was correct.
The question is as follows. Let $\beta$ be a basis for a finite dimensional inner product space $V.$ a) Prove that if $\langle x,z \rangle = 0$ for all $z \in \beta,$ then $x=0.$ OK, I reasoned it this way: from the definition of inner products, we have that $\langle x,0 \rangle = \langle 0,x \rangle = 0.$ Further, since $z$ is a basis element and linearly independent, then $x_1z_1+x_2z_2+\dots+x_nz_n = 0$ only if either all the $z_i$ s are zero or all the $x_i$ s are zero. Therefore, $x=0$ since in the initial construction, we defined $z$ as a basis for $V,$ and it doesn't have to be zero. b) Prove that if $\langle x, z \rangle = \langle y,z \rangle$ for all $z \in \beta,$ then $x=y.$ Again, we can go to the fact that $z$ is a basis and linearly independent. We have that $x_1z_1+x_2z_2+\dots+x_nz_n = y_1z_1+y_2z_2+\dots+y_nz_n,$ so if $z$ is linearly independent, then it can only be zero if all the $z$ s are zero or all the $x$ s and $y$ s are zero. In which case, $x$ would be equal to $y$ if $z$ isn't zero. For other cases, we just divide the left side of the equation by the $z$ s on the right, and we get $x_1+x_2+\dots+x_n = y_1+y_2+\dots+y_n$ Is this correct? Did I miss something important? I know this is a simple exercise, but I want to be sure.","['vector-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

437900,A problem from Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds,"Notation As Spivak suggests, given $A\subset\mathbb R^n$, boundary $A$ denotes the topological boundary of $A$, i.e. $\overline A\cap\overline{A^c}$. Problem 5-3(a): Let $A\subset\mathbb R^n$ be an open set such that boundary $A$ is an $n-1$ dimensional manifold. Show that $N=A\cup$ boundary $A$ is an $n$ dimensional manifold-with-boundary. Thoughts It seems that we only need to show that there's a neighborhood $V_x$ of $x\in$ boundary $A$ such that $V_x\cap N$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb R^n$ or $[0,\infty)\times \mathbb R^{n-1}$. The first situation is met when $A=\{x:0<\lVert x\rVert<1\}$. The condition of boundary $A$ is indispensable, but I don't know how to make use of it. At first, I found a counterexample , eventually pointed out by somebody that it is against the condition of boundary $A$:
$$A=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty\left(\frac1{2^{n+1}},\frac1{2^n}\right)\times\mathbb R$$

437904,Confused with proof that all Cauchy sequences of real numbers converge.,"First the textbook proves that all Cauchy sequences are bounded, and so have a convergent subsequence, $\{a_{n_{k}}\}$ that converges to a limit, say $L$. Now we use this to prove that all Cauchy sequences are convergent. So an $N_1$ exists such that $$\left|a_{n_{k}}-L\right|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$$ for all $ k > N_1$,
and an $N_2$ exists such that $$\left|a_m-a_n\right|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$$ for all $n,m > N_2 $. Pick any $k > N_1$ such that $n_k > N_2$. Then for every $n > N_2$, $$\left| a_n - L \right | \leq \left| a_n - a_{n_{k}} \right| + \left| a_{n_{k}} - L \right| < \epsilon/2 + \epsilon/2 = \epsilon$$. So $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}a_n = L$$ I'm fine with this proof until the last part - I'm confused as to why we can pick an abitrary $k$ like we do? Should the limit not depend only on $n$? Now it appears like it also depends on $k$ and if we pick a $k < N_1$, the inequality isn't true. Can someone clarify this for me please?","['proof-explanation', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'cauchy-sequences']"
437908,The Product Rule of Square Roots with Negative Numbers,"In the statement $\forall a, b \geq0, \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}$, why is it necessary to restrict $a$ and $b$ to being $\geq 0$? It seems that one should be able to say, for example, $(-3)^{1/2} \cdot (-3)^{1/2} = (-3 \cdot -3)^{1/2} = 9^{1/2} = 3$, so where is the flaw in this statement, since it just seems to be using laws of exponents. Edit: I don't think people are understanding what I'm asking. To reemphasize, my question is: why do we say $\forall a, b \geq 0, \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}$, instead of just $\forall a, b \in \mathbb{R}, \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}$",['algebra-precalculus']

437950,"A question about bounds, least and minimal elements, and partial vs strict ordered sets","It's not very clear to me if the concepts of bounds , least elements and minimal elements (also, greatest elements and maximal elements, etc. ) apply only to partial orders or if the definition applies to general ordered sets. If I try to make an analogy between sets in general and the real numbers I would say that those definitions are explicitly made for partial orders, though I'm not sure and I don't know whether there are some sets with strict order to which the definitions apply. For example, there is a theorem that says that ""if $b$ is the least element of $B$ in some order on $A$ and $B\subseteq A$, then $b$ is the infimum of $B$"". In this case I can think of the set $A=\{1,2,3\}$ with the usual strict order $<$ on $\mathbb{R}$ and $B=\{2,3\}$. Then $\inf(B)=1$ and $\min(B)=2$. But if I take the usual partial order $\leq$ then $\min(B)=\inf(B)=2$. Here I'm using the next definition: Let $R$ be an ordering on $A$, and let $B\subseteq A$. Then, 1.- $a\in A$ is a lower bound of $B$ iff $\forall x\in B(a R x)$. 2.- $a\in B$ is a greatest element of $B$ iff $\forall x\in B(x R a)$. 3.- $a\in A$ is called an infimum of $B$ iff it is the greates element of the set of all lower bounds of $B$. Note: For the example I'm assuming as proved that the greatest element an the infimum are unique.

438190,Going from the Poisson distribution to the Gaussian.,"In this lecture, at about the $37$ minute mark, the professor explains how the binomial distribution, under certain circumstances, transforms into the Poisson distribution, then how as the mean value of the Poisson distr. increases, the devation from the mean behaves like a Gaussian. I'm having trouble with calculating this. The pmf of the Poisson distr. is $$p(n)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^n}{n!}$$ If we define $x=\lambda-n$ to be the deviation from the mean and substitute into the pmf, we get $$p(x)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{\lambda-x}}{(\lambda -x)!}$$ Using the Stirling formula, this becomes approximately $$p(x) \approx \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{\lambda-x}}{(\lambda -x)^{\lambda -x} e^{-(\lambda -x)} \sqrt{2\pi (\lambda -x)} } = \frac{e^{-x}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \frac{\lambda^{\lambda-x}}{(\lambda -x)^{\lambda -x}} (\lambda -x)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$ $$=\frac{e^{-x}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} (\lambda -x)^{-\frac{1}{2}} (1-\frac{1}{\lambda /x})^{x-\lambda} = \frac{e^{-x}}{\sqrt{2\pi}} (\lambda -x)^{-\frac{1}{2}} ((1-\frac{1}{\lambda /x})^{\lambda /x})^{\frac{x^2-\lambda x}{\lambda}}$$ Now the rightmost term tends to $$e^{-\frac{x^2}{\lambda}}e^x$$ as $\lambda \to \infty$ , which cancels the $e^{-x}$ in front. So this would be looking fairly Gaussian if not for the uncomfortable factor of $(\lambda -x)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ which tends to zero, killing the whole thing! Where am I making a mistake? Clearly, in the Stirling approximation, the square root factor isn't too relevant (order-wise), and if it's omitted then the problem goes away (or does it? the result isn't normalised!)... but surely this can be fixed?","['probability-theory', 'normal-distribution', 'probability-distributions']"

438310,Show that an entire function is a polynomial,"There is a question in the book that asks me to show that if f is an entire function such that $|f(z)| \le L|z|^m$ where $|z| \ge R$ , then $f$ is a polynomial of degree of at most $m$ . The problem gives me a hint that I should use the Cauchy estimates for n>m and $r \to \infty$ The below is from a post https://math.stackexchange.com/a/143881/64742 Since $f$ is entire, it is equal to a power series centered at zero with radius of convergence $\infty$ , which must match its Taylor series there. $$f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}z^n$$ Since $|f(z)|\leq k|z|^m$ , Cauchy's estimate gives us $$|f^{(n)}(0)|\leq \frac{n!k|z|^m}{R^n}$$ for all $|z|=R$ . For $n>m$ , letting $R\rightarrow\infty$ , we see that $|f^{(n)}|=0$ . It follows that $f$ is a polynomial of degree $\leq m$ . Now, I follow what the above answer says except where ""It follows that f is a polynomial of degree $ \le m$ . Why do we arrive at that conclusion?

438311,discretize a function using $z$-transform,"I would like to discretize the following continuous function using $z$-transform: $$G(s)=\frac{s+1}{s^2+s+1}$$ The process I am using is to take the inverse Laplace transform of $\frac{G(s)}{s}$ and then take the z-transform of it. Finally I multiply it the result for $1-z^{1}$ to simulate a zero order hold. The results I am obtaining are the following ones: $$\mathcal{L} \{\frac{G(s)}{s}\}= F(t)=e^{-0.5}[\cos{\frac{\sqrt{3}t}{2}}+\frac{1}{{\sqrt{3}}} \sin{ \frac{\sqrt{3t}}{2}}]$$ $$Z\{F(t)\} = \frac{1-e^{-0.5t}z^{-1}\cos{\frac{\sqrt{3}T}{2}}}{1-2e^{-0.5t}z^{-1}\cos{\frac{\sqrt{3}T}{2}}+e^{-T}z^{-2}} + \frac{1-e^{-0.5t}z^{-1}\sin{\frac{\sqrt{3}T}{2}}}{1-2e^{-0.5t}z^{-1}\cos{\frac{\sqrt{3}T}{2}}+e^{-T}z^{-2}} $$ Definig $\alpha=e^{-0.5T}\cos \frac{\sqrt{3}T}{2}$, $\beta=\frac{e^{-0.5T}}{\sqrt{3}}e^{-0.5T}\cos \frac{\sqrt{3}T}{2}$ and by writing it in function of $z$ instead of $z^{-1}$ we have: $$Z\{F(t)\} =\frac{ z^2+z(\alpha+\beta)}{z^2-2 \alpha z + e^{-T}}$$ Multiplying it by $ 1-z^{-1} $ we finally get: $$\frac{z^2+z(1-\alpha- \beta)+ \alpha - \beta}{z^2-2 \alpha z + e^{-T}}$$ I already redone the calculation a number of times and I couldn't find any errors.

. \left|  \sum_{n = 0}^{2013} a_n z^n \right| &= \left| a_0 +  \sum_{n = 1}^{2013} a_n z^n \right| \\

&\geq a_0 -  \sum_{n = 1}^{2013} a_n |z^n|\\
&\geq a_0 -  \sum_{n = 1}^{2013} a_0 |z^n|\\
&= a_0\left( 1  -  \sum_{n = 1}^{2013} |z^n| \right)

I have the following problem: $x = \text{ quantity }$, $12 < x < 48$ Total Cost: $C(x) = \dfrac 92x^2 -17x + 2700$ Price per item: $p(x) = -\dfrac{x^2}3 +\dfrac{23}2x + 78 + \dfrac{20000}x$ To find the total revenue $R(x)$, I believe that I have to multiply the quantity x by the price/item.  Thus, $$\begin{align} R(x) &= x\cdot p(x)\\ 
         &= x\left( -\dfrac{x^2}3 +\dfrac{23}2x + 78 + \dfrac{20000}x\right) \\
         &=  -\dfrac{x^3}3 +\dfrac{23}2x^2 + 78 + 20000\end{align}$$ To find total profit $P(x)$, I believe that I have to subtract cost from revenue. Thus, $$\begin{align} P(x) &= R(x) - C(x) \\
         &= -\frac{x^3}3 +\frac{23}2x^2 + 78x + 20000 - \left(\frac 92x^2 -17x + 2700\right) \\
         &= --\frac{x^3}3 +\frac{17}2 x^2 + 61x + 17300\end{align}$$ To find $x$ for maximum revenue, I believe I need to find the derivative of $R(x)$, so that $$\begin{align} R'(x) = -x^2 + 23x + 78 &= 0\\
              -(x-26)(x+3) &= 0\\
              x = 26  \text{ or }x &= -3\end{align}$$ Since $x = -3$ is not in the domain, this means that the quantity of $x$ that will generate the maximum revenue is $26$. To find $x$ for maximum profit, I need to first find the derivative of $P(x)$, set it equal to zero, and solve for $x$.  Thus, $$P'(x) = -x^2 + 17x + 61 = 0$$ And here's where I run into trouble.

438572,Path Connectedness in Van Kampen Theorem,"On page 17 of this pdf, http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/CONCISE/ConciseRevised.pdf , the Van Kampen Theorem is proven.

Now the theorem is proven by showing that the required universal property is satisfied, that is that given any groupoid $G$ with family of maps $f_{U_i}:\pi(U_i) \to G$ such that the associated diagram commutes (that is that if $U_i \subset U_j$ we have $f_{U_j}|_{U_i} = f_{U_i}$) we can find a unique family of maps $f^*: \pi(X) \to G$ such that $f^*|_{\pi(U_I)} = f_{U_i}$. For $a\in U_j$ we can define $f^*(a) = f_{U_j}(a)$.  This is obviously unique and is well defined because if $a \in U_j, U_k$ we have $a \in {U_j \cap U_k}$ and $f_{U_j}|_{U_j \cap U_k} = f_{U_k}|_{U_j \cap U_k}$.

It seems celar that we can find proper endpoints to do this.  We can then define $f([\phi])$ to be the composite of all such $\phi_i$.

I have to (1) Prove that if $\hat{\mu} \in \tilde{T},$ then $\hat{\mu}$ it's unbiased; and (2) Show that for every estimator $\beta \in \tilde{T}$, $\mathrm{Var}(\bar{X_n})<\mathrm{Var}\{\beta\}$. Here's my attempt: (1) $\hat{\mu} \in \tilde{T} \implies \hat{\mu} = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_iX_i \implies \mathrm{E}(\hat{\mu}) = \mathrm{E}\bigg(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_iX_i\bigg) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i\mathrm{E}(X_i)$. Now, since $X_1,\dots, X_n$ it's a sample mean, then all of them have the same distribution, let's say $X$. Follows $\mathrm{E}(\hat{\mu}) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i\mathrm{E}(X_i) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i\mathrm{E}(X) = \mathrm{E}(X)\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i = \mathrm{E}(X)$ and then follows $ \hat{\mu}$ unbiased ? (2) I know that $\mathrm{V}(\bar{X}) = \displaystyle\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$, if $\mathrm{V}(\beta) < \displaystyle\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ and since $\beta \in \tilde{T}$ we have $\beta = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \beta_iX_i$ for $\beta_i$ scalars, then $\mathrm{V}(\beta) =\mathrm{V}\bigg(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \beta_iX_i\bigg) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i^2\mathrm{V}(X_i) > \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{V}(X_i) = n\sigma ^2$ and should be $n\sigma ^2 < \displaystyle\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$.

438647,Tricky detail in the proof of Haar's theorem,"I'm trying to dig in the details of the proof of Haar's theorem, and at some point I need to use Fubini's theorem, which requires that if we want to change the order of integration over the product space $X  \times Y$, the spaces $X$ and $Y$ must be complete measure spaces. (In my case, they are topological measure spaces and my measure is also defined over the completion of their $\sigma$-algebras, but in order to have a topological measure space, I restrict the measure to the Borel $\sigma$-algebra). However, I am working with a continuous function (the one I am integrating). I am wondering if the following holds : given a continuous function $h : X \times X \to \mathbb C$ where $(X, \mathcal T)$ is a topological space, $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ is a complete measure space and $\sigma(\mathcal T) \subseteq \Sigma$ (the Borel sets are measurable), is it possible to show that $h$ is measurable with respect to $\overline{\sigma}(T) \times \overline{\sigma}(\mathcal T)$? (Here $\overline{\sigma}$ denotes the completion of the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal T$.) This will imply I can use Fubini. Note that my measure $\mu$ comes from Haar's theorem, so if it helps, it is non-zero and inner/outer regular. Perhaps the following could be easier to prove : if $f : (X, \mathcal T_X) \to (Y, \mathcal T_Y)$ is a continuous function, is $f$ measurable with respect to $\overline{\sigma}(\mathcal T_X)$ and $\overline{\sigma}(\mathcal T_Y)$? I guess it's false if you put the zero measure on $Y$ because then the completion is just the trivial $\sigma$-algebra, but in my case I am working with $\mathbb C$ and the Lebesgue measure, so perhaps I can find my way around it. All the proofs I've read seem to hide this tricky detail that the assumptions of Fubini must be satisfied...","['topological-groups', 'measure-theory']"

438684,"Polar decompostion should be a diffeomorphism, right?","I seem to have gotten stuck in the mud verifying what I thought was going to be a completely straightforward fact. I would appreciate if somebody could help dig me out. Inside the $n \times n$ complex matrices $M_n(\mathbb{C})$, let $U, GL, GL_+$ denote, respectively, the unitary matrices, invertible matrices and positive invertible matrices. I was trying to check: The multiplication map $F : U \times GL_+ \to GL$ sending $(u,p) \mapsto up$ is a diffeomorphism. Everything here is being viewed as a submanifold of the $2n^2$-dimensional Euclidean space $M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Even though all the scalars here are complex, the objects are being viewed as real manifolds. Some relevant facts: I calculated the tangent spaces to $U$ and got $T_u(U) = \{ a \in M_n(\mathbb{C}) : u^*a + a^*u = 0 \}.$ That is, $a$ is tangent to $U$ at $u$ if and only if $u^*a$ is anti-self-adjoint.  In particular, $T_1(U)$ is the anti-self-adjoint matrices. $GL_+$ is an open subset of the vector space $SA \subset M_n(\mathbb{C})$ of self-adjoint matrices. So, $T_p(GL_+) = SA$ for all $p \in GL_+$. $GL$ is an open subset of $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ so $T_a(GL) = M_n(\mathbb{C})$ for all $a \in GL$. Since $F$ is a bijection (polar decomposition), we will be done if we can show that $F$ has invertible derivative everywhere. The derivatives are given by $DF_{(u,p)} (a,b) = ap + ub$. I figured the easiest thing to do would be to check that this linear map always has zero kernel (since the domain and codomain are manifolds of the same dimension). Look how well this works at the point $(1,1) \in  U \times GL_+$! If $DF_{(1,1)}(a,b) = a+b = 0$ (where $a$ is anti-self-adjoint and $b$ is self-adjoint) then, taking adjoints, we also have $-a + b = 0$. Combining these equations gives $a = b = 0$. But, I get stuck checking injectivity at other points. Even, say, at $(1,p)$ where $p \in GL_+$. Then, if we take $(a,b) \in T_{(1,p)}(U \times GL_+)$ (i.e. $a^* = -a, b^* = b$) and assume that $DF_{(1,p)}(a,b) = b + ap = 0$, I get stuck doing all sorts of crazy algebra trying to deduce $a=b=0$.","['multivariable-calculus', 'linear-algebra', 'manifolds']"

438715,Meaning of fractional Fourier transform with imaginary iteration count?,"As one may know, the Fourier Transform $$F[f](\nu) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-2\pi i \nu t} dt$$ can be iterated, and this iteration generalized to fractional iteration count via $$F^h[f](\nu) = \sqrt{1 - i \cot\left(\frac{\pi h}{2}\right)} e^{i\pi \cot\left(\frac{\pi h}{2}\right) \nu^2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-i 2\pi \left( \csc\left(\frac{\pi h}{2}\right) \nu t - \frac{\cot\left(\frac{\pi h}{2}\right)}{2} t^2\right)} f(t) dt$$. This can be interpreted, in a sense, as ""rotating"" $f$ between the time and frequency domain. In particular, $h = 1/2$ corresponds to a half-way rotation -- half-way between time and frequency. $h = -1$ is the inverse Fourier transform. $h = 2$ (i.e. $F \circ F$) is the ""mirror-image"" transform, that is, the time reversal of $f$, or $f(-t)$. The above formula may be written without the $\frac{\pi}{2}$ factors, which parameterizes it more directly in terms of the angle as an actual radian angle, with $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians, i.e. a right angle, being the angle at which the frequency domain lies to the time one. But what is the interpretation and meaning of the above when $h = i$, that is, a single imaginary iteration of the transform? What does the ""spectrum"" given by $F^i[f]$ mean? More generally, what happens with $h = 2i$, $h = 3i$, etc.? EDIT: I note that for such positive-imaginary $h$, the kernel in the integrand grows quickly because the exponent becomes real (note that $\csc(ix) = -i\ \mathrm{csch}(x)$ and $\cot(ix) = -i \coth(x)$ and these get multiplied by $-i 2\pi$, turning them real), suggesting a strong decay of $f$ is required to get convergence, unless perhaps we can abuse analytic continuation from the real iteration counts in other cases somehow, though I think that might not yield a unique result. However it does seem to work better for negative -imaginary $h$, i.e. $h = -i$, $h = -2i$, etc. . Perhaps exploring those would be better? EDIT 2: Perhaps an example would be in order. Let $$f(t) = \begin{cases} 1, \mbox{if } |t| \le 1 \\ 0, \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}$$, i.e. the ""boxcar"" function, or a fixed-width pulse in the time domain. Since the support is compact, the integral will converge. If we take the usual Fourier transform, $F^1[f] = F[f]$, we get a sinc function as the result. We can interpret this as a frequency spectrum of the original $f$, and it contains mostly low-frequency content, with little ripples of higher frequencies. But, suppose we take the imaginary Fourier transform -- one imaginary iteration of $F$, or $F^i$. What we get cannot be expressed in elementary terms, however we can use the ""imaginary error function"" to get a ""closed form"" of sorts: $$F^i[f](\nu) = \frac{\sqrt{1 – \coth\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}}{2 \sqrt{\coth\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}} e^{\pi \left(\coth\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) – \mathrm{csch}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \mathrm{sech}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\right) \nu^2} \\ \left(\mathrm{erfi}\left(\frac{2\pi \coth\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) – 2\pi \mathrm{csch}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \nu}{2 \sqrt{\pi \coth\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}}\right) – \mathrm{erfi}\left(\frac{-2\pi \coth\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) – 2\pi \mathrm{csch}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \nu}{2 \sqrt{\pi \coth\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}}\right)\right)$$ Now the $1 - \coth\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$ under the one square root sign is negative, so $F^i[f]$ is purely imaginary at each $\nu$. At $0$, it is about $3.338i$, and grows very quickly as we move toward the positive and negative $\nu$ directions. What kind of ""spectrum"" is this ? What is it telling us about the boxcar function?","['fourier-analysis', 'analysis']"

Is that true that for any non-empty $M$ it holds that $\sup_M f = \sup_{\operatorname{sco(M)}}f$? In case the latter fact is true, I would be happy if someone can provide a reference to this. I am not sure whether the integral is always defined over topological vector spaces, so the motivation was the case $X=P(A)$ where $A$ is a Borel space, and $P(A)$ is endowed with the topology of weak convergence. In the latter situation the integration is well-defined, but I guess that a similar result shall hold for a more general case as well. Feel free to correct me.","['convex-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'probability-theory', 'reference-request', 'topological-vector-spaces']"

439005,"What ""is"" a matrix in the context of a vector space?","I'm familiar with the definition of a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ I'm also comfortable with the notion that a matrix ""represents"" a linear map from one vector space $V$ to another vector space $W$. The Wiki article on Vector Spaces says this: Matrices are a useful notion to encode linear maps. But this conflicts with what I think a matrix is. Is a matrix a ""thing"" or ""element"" that we can write down and multiply by other matricies/vectors? Or is it simply a ""representation"" of a linear map between spaces? Does it depend on the context? If it is a ""thing"" - then how do we define the multiplication of objects from the vector space with objects of a different kind that do not belong to the vector space? We can write a meaningful equation such as: $M \cdot \textbf{x} = \textbf{y}$ Where x and y are vectors, and M is a matrix. I know how to perform the multiplication, but it seems wrong to me that $M$ is of a different ""species"" (apologies - I'm not familiar enough with abstract algebra to know the correct classification - set/group/etc.) than the thing we are multiplying it with. Sorry if this is vague, I'm just hoping someone might be able to clear up this slight confusion. Thanks!","['vector-spaces', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"

I am currently trying to go through Humphrey's Linear Algebraic Groups and am stuck on a problem that sounds deceivingly simple but can not seem to figure out (Problem 5 from Section 7). I have spent a fair amount of time on it and expect it to be something silly that I just am not seeing. The problem is: A closed subset of an algebraic group which contains e and is closed under multiplication is a subgroup,['algebraic-geometry']
