1453522,Solving limits without using L'Hôpital's rule,"$$\lim_{x \to \frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{b(1-\sin x) }{(\pi-2x)^2}$$ I had been solving questions like these using L'Hôpital's rule since weeks. But today, a day before the examination, I got to know that its usage has been 'banned', since we were never officially taught L'Hôpital's rule. Now I am at a loss how to solve questions I breezed through previously. While it is not possible to learn in 18 hours methods that would cover all kinds of problems, I am hoping I can pick up enough of them to salvage the examination tomorrow. It has been hinted to me that the above could be solved using trigonometric techniques, but I'm at a loss as to how.","['limits-without-lhopital', 'limits', 'trigonometry']"
1453541,$\frac{2n\choose n}{n+2}\not\in\mathbb N$ and $n\neq3k+1$ and $n\neq4k+2$,"Are there any natural numbers $n\not\equiv1\bmod3$, and $n\not\equiv2\bmod4$, so that $~\dfrac{\displaystyle{2n\choose n}}{n+2}\not\in\mathbb N$ ? Since $C_n=\dfrac{\displaystyle{2n\choose n}}{n+1}\in\mathbb N$ for all n , this is equivalent to asking whether there are any Catalan numbers not divisible by $n+2$, with n neither of the form $3k+1$, nor of the form  $4k+2$. Inspired by the afore-mentioned Catalan numbers , I began investigating integers with the property that $~\dfrac{\displaystyle{2n\choose n}}{n+2}\in\mathbb N$, and then soon afterwards arrived at the conclusion that there were too many of them for such a quest to be even remotely interesting, so I negated the above property, and, after a rather short while, I immediately started noticing that the new results were either of the form $n=$ $=3k+1$, or of the form $n=4k+2$. Updating the search parameters so as to eliminate these two classes as well, I eventually came to the realization that there were no solutions for $n\le10^5$.","['divisibility', 'catalan-numbers', 'number-theory', 'binomial-coefficients']"
1453553,Finite subsets of countable and uncountable sets,"If I take all the subsets of exactly size $n$ (where $n$ is some fixed natural number) from the set of natural numbers, and put them into a set, then the result is a countable set (a set containing all subsets of size $n$). If I do the same, but this time taking the subsets (of size $n$ - I'll call them $n$-subsets) from the reals, then the result is an uncountable set. Can someone please explain to me why this is the case? And perhaps how to show it?
I guess it's because the natural numbers contain a countable number of $n$-subsets, and the reals contain an uncountable number of $n$-subsets. But I don't know how to formalize this. Thanks in advance","['elementary-set-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"

Let $x=(x(1),x(2),…,x(n),…) \in c_0$. So for any $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|x(n)| \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ for all $n \geq n_0$.

1453566,Limitations of fractional derivative approximation with Taylor series,"I was playing around with the concept of fraction derivatives, and came across some base functions for which it is defined, namely power and exponential functions $$
\left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)^\alpha t^k = \frac{\Gamma(k+1)}{\Gamma(k-\alpha+1)} t^{k-\alpha}, \quad k\geq0 \tag{1}
$$ $$
\left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)^\alpha e^{kt} = k^\alpha e^{kt} = e^{kt + \alpha \log(k)}. \tag{2}
$$ I was wondering what the fractional derivative would be of $\sin(\omega t)$ and initially though that if I would calculate its Taylor series at $t=0$, I then could use (1) to find its fraction derivative. But later I came across (2) and realized that in this case it can be found much easier. Namely $\sin(\omega t)$ can be written as $$
\sin(\omega t) = \frac{1}{2i} \left(e^{i\omega t} - e^{-i\omega t}\right), \tag{3}
$$ thus the fractional derivative can be found with (2) $$
\left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)^\alpha \sin(\omega t) = \frac{1}{2i} \left(e^{i\omega t + \alpha \log(i\omega)} - e^{-i\omega t + \alpha \log(-i\omega)}\right) = \omega^\alpha \sin\left(\omega t + \alpha \frac{\pi}{2}\right). \tag{4}
$$ But if I compare this with the result I get when using the Taylor series I get very wrong results for $t<0$ and for $t$ slightly larger than $0$ I get a transition towards the correct result. For example here are the results I get when $\alpha=\frac 12$, $\omega=1$ and the Taylor series is approximated with 50 terms: Could it be that (1) is only true for $t>0$ and that taking the factional derivative of a Taylor series might not have a convergence near the point at which the Taylor series is constructed, in my case $t=0$?","['taylor-expansion', 'derivatives']"
1453588,Proving tan((x + y)/2) = (sin x + sin y)/(cos x + cos y) with the angle sum and difference identities,"I've recently come across this problem of proving $$ \tan \frac{x + y}{2} = \frac{\sin x + \sin y}{\cos x + \cos y} $$ Not a difficult problem, I thought. I would have rewritten the RHS using the sum-to-product identities of sine and cosine. But the solution given in the back of the book is \begin{align}
\tan \frac{x + y}{2} &= \frac{\sin x \sin y}{\cos x + \cos y} \\
&= \frac{2\sin(\frac{x}{2})\cos(\frac{x}{2})+2\sin(\frac{y}{2})\cos(\frac{y}{2})}{2\cos^2(\frac{x}{2})-1 + 1 - 2\sin^2(\frac{y}{2})} \\
&= \frac{\sin(\frac{x}{2})\cos(\frac{x}{2}) + \sin(\frac{y}{2})\cos(\frac{y}{2})}{\cos^2(\frac{x}{2}) - \sin^2(\frac{y}{2})} \tag{1} \\
&= \frac{\sin(\frac{x+y}{2})}{\cos(\frac{x+y}{2})}  \tag{2} \\
&= \tan \frac{x + y}{2}
\end{align} What I'm confused about is the step from (1) to (2). It appears they tried to use the angle sum identities, but Wikipedia says that the formulas are actually $$ \sin(\alpha \pm \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta \pm \cos \alpha \sin \beta \\
\cos(\alpha \pm \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta \mp \sin \alpha \sin \beta
$$ which don't actually match the numerator or denominator in (1). Can the angle sum identities be used like this? I'm also interested in knowing how one would actually go from (1) to (2) without the angle sum identities. It seems like there would be a few intermediate steps.",['trigonometry']
1453591,Probability of combinations of independent events,"Disclaimer: I'm almost 70 and trying to learn math concepts I didn't learn earlier in life. So don't expect this to be a deep or particularly difficult question. I've always understood the statement that the probabilities of independent events are not affected by the outcomes of their combination. In other words, after 3 heads in a row of a coin toss the 4th toss still only has 0.5 probability of happening. And yet that has always seemed counter intuitive. If I have 3 tosses the probability of 3 heads is $\frac{1}{8}$. However, if the first head is tossed the odds of tossing two more is $\frac{1}{4}$. Yet the odds on the next toss of a head is still $\frac{1}{2}$. If I had tossed a tail on the first toss, the odds of 3 heads now becomes zero. So, the result of one independent event in a combination does impact the probability of the combination. Key here, I think are the words ""probability of the combination"" and not ""probability of the next event"". If this is correct, this is a significant understanding for me. Are my assumptions and conclusions correct?","['probability-theory', 'probability']"
1453633,Integral $\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx$,"Here is an integral I derived while evaluating another. It appears to be rather tough, but some here may not be so challenged :) Show that: $$\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\frac{11}{9}\zeta(3)-\frac{\pi}{72\sqrt{3}}\left(5\psi_{1}\left(\frac13\right)+4\psi_{1}\left(\frac23\right)-3\psi_{1}\left(\frac56\right)\right)$$ $$=\frac{11}{9}\zeta(3)+\frac{4\pi^{3}}{27\sqrt{3}}-\frac{2\pi}{9\sqrt{3}}\psi_{1}\left(\frac13\right)=\frac{11}{9}\zeta(3)-\frac{4\pi}{9}\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)$$ $$=\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)-2\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)-\frac{4\pi}{9}\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)$$ I attempted all kinds of 'starts' to no satisfactory end, but things look promising. There are some mighty sharp folks here that may be better at deriving the solution. I thought perhaps the identity: $$\frac{\log^{2}(1-(x-x^{2}))}{x}=2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_{n}}{n+1}x^{n}(1-x)^{n+1}$$ or the Beta function could be used if given enough ingenuity. This led me to the no-less-imposing Euler/reciprocal of central binomial coefficients sum below. It would be great to just show the middle sum is equivalent to the right sum: $$1/4\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_{n}n\Gamma^{2}(n)}{(n+1)(2n+1)\Gamma(2n)}=1/2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_{n}}{(n+1)(2n+1)\binom{2n}{n}}=1/3\zeta(3)-2/3\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{3}\binom{2n}{n}}$$ Is there a general form for $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_{n}}{\binom{2n}{n}}x^{n}?$$ I tried starting with the identity: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\Gamma^{2}(n)}{\Gamma(2n)}x^{n-1}=\frac{4\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{x(4-x)}}$$ and using various manipulations to hammer into the needed form. This, too, turned monstrous. There appears to be a relation to Clausen functions (as with other log integrals such as $\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\log(x)}{x^{2}-x+1}dx$ ), to wit: I use Cl for sin and CL for cos Clausen functions $$\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(\frac{\pi k}{3})}{k^{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{72}\left(\psi_{1}(1/6)+\psi_{1}(1/3)-\psi_{1}(2/3)-\psi_{1}(5/6)\right)$$ $$=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}\psi_{1}(1/3)-\frac{\pi^{2}\sqrt{3}}{9}$$ and $$\operatorname{Cl}_{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)-\operatorname{Cl}_{3}\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(\frac{\pi k}{3})}{k^{3}}-2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(\frac{2\pi k}{3})}{k^{3}}=\frac{11}{9}\zeta(3)$$ Another approach . I also broke the integral up as such: $$\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\log^{2}(1-xe^{\frac{\pi i}{3}})}{x}dx+2\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\log(1-xe^{\pi i/3})\log(1-xe^{-\pi i/3})}{x}dx+\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\log^{2}(1-xe^{-\pi i/3})}{x}dx$$ The middle integral right of the equal sign is the one that has given me the fit. I think this is a fun and head-scratchin' integral that has led me to other discoveries.  Maybe a generalization could be obtained with other powers of log such as n = 3, 4, etc. I wonder if they can also be evaluated in terms of Clausens and then into closed forms involving $\zeta(n+1)$ and derivatives of digamma, $\psi_{n-1}(z)?$ . Another easier one is $$\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\log(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\frac{-\pi^{2}}{18}=\frac{-1}{3}\zeta(2)?$$","['definite-integrals', 'integration']"
1453647,Derangments of N Elements Given That One Specific Element Remains In Its Original Position,"Some context: Our teacher gave us a classroom exercise and it was returned to us this week. I am revisiting all the questions in the exercise, particularly the ones I got wrong. I am stuck at a particular problem whose answer involves the derangement function. Definition: Derangement is defined using this function: D(n, k) = the number of permutations where in n - k objects are not in their original position/s and k objects are in their original position/s. Problem: Jasmin, being a teacher’s pet, was asked to distribute the group
  assignments in the class. She plans to sabotage her classmates by
  exchanging the other group problems given to them. There are five
  groups in class including hers. In how many ways can she do this if
  she distributed the wrong problems to her classmates with her group
  receiving the correct problem? Correct Answer (based on an answer key) : D(5, 1) My Question: Since Jasmin already has a group, aren't we supposed to only count the number of permutations in which the other 4 assignments will be given to the wrong group? If I'm not mistaken, D(5, 1) would find the sum of a, b, c, d, and e. where: a = the number of ways where only the other 4 assignments are given to the wrong group given that Jasmin is in group #1 b = the number of ways where only the other 4 assignments are given to the wrong group given that Jasmin is in group #2 c = the number of ways where only the other 4 assignments are given to the wrong group given that Jasmin is in group #3 d = the number of ways where only the other 4 assignments are given to the wrong group given that Jasmin is in group #4 e = the number of ways where only the other 4 assignments are given to the wrong group given that Jasmin is in group #5 All of those five would count the permutations where only 1 assignment is given to its correct group (i.e. Jasmin's group).

Else, there are two remaining cases: infinitely many solutions or no solutions. How would I know which it is? Can we not tell until we have row reduced the augmented matrix?

1453695,How is $\int f(x) dx$ different from $\int_0^x f(t)dt$? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Understanding integrals double meaning (2 answers) Closed 8 years ago . Something niggling at me from way back. Is our definition of an antiderivative $\int f(x)dx = F(x)$ (such that $F'(x) = f(x)$) different in any way from the definite integral with variable limits, i.e. the function $f(x) = \int_0^x f(t)dt$ ? It seems that I can think of them both as operators which take in a function and give back a function. Doesn't the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus then give us that $\frac{d}{dx}\int f(x)dx = f(x)$? This came up because Wolfram says, of the FTC $$\int_a^b = f(x)dx = F(a) - F(b)$$ that, ""This result, while taught early in elementary calculus courses, is actually a very deep result connecting the purely algebraic indefinite integral and the purely analytic (or geometric) definite integral.""

1453745,Theorem on Measurability-Preserving Maps?,"How to tell whether you should bother reading this: Consider two well known facts about measurable functions: (i) the supremum of a sequence of measurable functions is measurable, (ii) if $f$ is measurable and $F$ is Borel then $F\circ f$ is measurable. It seems interesting to me that (i) is actually a special case of (ii). If you don't find that interesting you don't need to read this. Teaching reals. I tell the kids that measurability is the last thing they should worry about, because although it may or may not be easy to prove, it never goes wrong in ""real life"". Then I give a more precise version, still too fuzzy to be susceptible to proof : If you start with countably many measurable functions and derive a function from them in any reasonable way the result will be measurable. (Commenting that of course the countability is important - measurability can go wrong in, say, probability, where we have an uncountable family of random variables to start with...) I noticed something that has me wondering whether perhaps there is an actual theorem that includes the cases that actually come up. Recall that if $X$ is a measurable space and $Y$ is a topological space then $f:X\to Y$ is measurable if the inverse image of every open set (equivalently every Borel set) is measurable. Hence for example if $X$ is a measurable space, $Y$ and $Z$ are topological spaces, $f:X\to Y$ is measurable and $F:Y\to Z$ is Borel then $F\circ f$ is measurable. Question: Could it be that in the context of the last paragraph, if $F\circ f$ is measurable for every measurable $f:\Bbb R\to Y$ then $F$ must be Borel? Regardless, it's clear that for example if $f,g:X\to\Bbb R$ are measurable and $F:\Bbb R^2\to\Bbb R$ is Borel then $F(f,g)$ is measurable. What I just noticed that makes me think maybe there is a very general result about a function of countably many measurable functions being measurable is this: say $f_n:X\to\Bbb R$ for $n=1,2\dots$. Define $f:X\to\Bbb R^{\Bbb N}$ by $f(x)=(f_1(x),f_2(x),\dots)$. Give $\Bbb R^{\Bbb N}$ the product topology. Then $f_n$ is measurable for every $n$ if and only if $f$ is measurable. In particular if $ (f_n)$ is a sequence of measurable functions and $F:\Bbb R^{\Bbb N}\to\Bbb R$ (or $[-\infty,\infty]$, whatever) is Borel then $F(f_1,f_2,\dots)$ is measurable. And this does include a lot of standard special cases. For example the function $s:\Bbb R^{\Bbb N}\to(-\infty,\infty]$ defined by $s(x)=\sup_n x_n$ is Borel, being the limit of $s_n$, where $s_n(x)=\max(x_1,\dots,x_n)$. Hence (i) above is a special case of (ii). Hence similarly for $\liminf$ and $\limsup$. And hence similarly for $f(x)=\lim f_n(x)$ if the limit exists, $0$ otherwise (because the characteristic function of the diagonal in $\Bbb R^2$ is Borel). Raising the question of whether every example where $F(f_1,f_2,\dots)$ must be measurable arises from a Borel functionn $F$.","['geometric-measure-theory', 'measure-theory']"

1453923,Geodesics that paint curves on the projective space bundle,"Let $M$ be a geodesically complete connected riemannian manifold. Let $p \in M$ be a point and $c: \mathbb{R} \to M$ an arbitrary geodesic that doesn't intersect p. Our aim is to find a ""nice"" map sending points on the curve $c$ to tangent lines at $p$. Pick a point $q$ on the curve $c$ and connect it with $p$ via a geodesic curve (this is possible by completeness of $M$). Here is the relavent picture: Every such geodesic corresponds to a unique tangent line through $p$. Ideally we want to have a cannonical choice of such geodesic for every point of $c$. Assuming there is such a choice we could obtain a function $f: c(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{P}T_pM$. where $\mathbb{P}T_pM$ is the tangent projective space or equivalently the fibre at $p$ of the $(1,dim(M))-$grassman bundle over $M$. Now my question has two parts: 1) Given a initial point $q$ and an initial choice of geodesic connecting $p$ and $q$, is there then a cannonical choice for every other point on $c$? What i have in mind is a choice that ""minimizes"" in some suitable sense the variation of the geodesics with respect to variation of the initial point $q$. (I'm not so familiar with jacobi fields but i have a strong sense that this is what's missing here). 2) Under what conditions on $M$ is the map $f$ (defined above) smooth (resp. continuous) as a curve in $\mathbb{RP}^{n-1}$ where $n=dim(M)$. By which i mean the composition $f \circ c : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{P}T_pM \cong \mathbb{R P}^{n-1}$ is smooth (resp. continuous). Here's the picture I'd like to have in mind in this context.

1454204,Nested solutions of a quadratic equation.,"A quadratic equation of the form $x^2+bx+c=0$ can be solved with the classical formula that gives all solutions. Here I want discuss some other methods to find one solution. The best known is by means of continued fraction .
In this case, from the given equation we find:
$$
x^2+bx+c=0
\Rightarrow
x+b+\dfrac{c}{x}=0
\Rightarrow
x=-b-\dfrac{c}{x}
\Rightarrow
x=-b+\cfrac{-c}{-b+\cfrac{-c}{-b+\ddots}}
$$
But there are at least other two methods: Solving for $x^2$ the given equation we find
$$
x^2=-bx-c 
\Rightarrow
x=\pm\sqrt{-c-bx}
\Rightarrow
x=\sqrt{-c\mp b\sqrt{-c\mp b\sqrt{-c\mp \dots}}}
$$
that is a solution in form of infinite nested radicals . And solving for $x$ we find:
$$
x=\dfrac{1}{b}\left( -c-x^2 \right)
\Rightarrow
x=\dfrac{1}{b}\left(-c-\dfrac{1}{b}\left(-c-\dfrac{1}{b}\left(-c \cdots\right)^2\right)^2\right)
$$
that is a solution in form of infinite nested squares . These methods cannot give all the two solutions, but only an approximation of one of these.
The method of continued fraction is well studied and documented in its limits and potentialities ( here ), but for the other methods I found little or nothing on the Web. I have done some numerical experiment with a spreadsheet (see the figure for $x^2-3x-4=0 $), and it seems the methods works (with some care for the nested radicals where we have to be careful for the signs). From these experiments I see that the method of nested radicals gives the root that has the greatest absolute value ( as the continued fraction), and the method of continued squares seems that gives the lowest absolute value solution, with a convergence rate that seems not so different than for continued fractions.
I'm interested to know if we can prove that this is always true and if there are some general results about these methods. My final interest is to know if such methods can be extended to the solution of higher degree equations.","['approximation', 'algebra-precalculus', 'nested-radicals', 'quadratics', 'continued-fractions']"

1454248,Spectral theorem for momentum operator,"I'm trying to apply the spectral theorem to the explicit example of the momentum operator: \begin{equation}
p:= i\frac{d}{dx}
\end{equation} on the domain $D=\{\psi\in H^1(0,2\pi)\ |\ \psi(0)=\psi(2\pi)\}$. Then p is self-adjoint, and its spectrum is given by the integers. Now, given a $\psi$ in the domain, it holds by the spectral theorem \begin{equation}
<\psi\ |\ p[\psi]> = \int_{\mathbb Z}^{}n\ d\mu_\psi(n)
\end{equation} In order to explicitly obtain $\mu_{\psi}$, one should apply Stieltjes' inversion formula to the function \begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_\psi:\ z \longmapsto <\psi,\ (p-z)^{-1}[\psi]>, \ z\in\mathbb C
\end{equation} Namely, the task is to compute the following resolution of identity: \begin{equation}
\mu_\psi(\lambda) = \lim_{\delta\to 0^+} \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0^+} \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\lambda + \delta}Im[\mathcal{F}_\psi (t+i\varepsilon)]dt
\end{equation} The most natural thing to do would seem to be using Fourier Series. This has however proved unuseful. One gets: \begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_\psi(z) = \int_0^{2\pi}\sum_{k\in\mathbb Z}\frac{|c_k|^2}{k+z}\exp{[ikx]}dx
\end{equation} where $\psi(x) = \sum_{k\in \mathbb Z}c_k\exp{[ikx]}$. I'm not getting anywhere with this: the series keeps hanging around, and there are integrals over the whole half-line of sines and cosines. Any hint would be greatly appreciated! Edit 1 : I tried digging deeper into the rabbit hole: switching series and integral in the last equation kills every k-term but $k=0$. The computation of $\mu_\psi(\lambda)$ is then doable, at the least with the help of Mathematica.\newline
Unfortunately, the computation yields \begin{equation}
\mu_\psi(\lambda) = \frac{\lambda + |{\lambda}|}{2\lambda}||{\psi}||^2
\end{equation} i.e. a delta measure centered at zero. This would mean \begin{equation}
<\psi\ |\ p[\psi]> = \int_{\mathbb Z}^{}n\ d\delta_0(n) = 0
\end{equation} so that the problem is still not solved. By the way, I also realized that Fourier Series are really the answer to my question. ""Reverse engineering"" is then maybe possible. Edit 2 : I put some more thought into the problem, and I think I solved it. I'd still like to receive a confirm. Apparently, the equation \begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_\psi(z) = \int_0^{2\pi}\sum_{k\in\mathbb Z}\frac{|c_k|^2}{k+z}\exp{[ikx]}dx
\end{equation} is wrong. The right computation implies a Kronecker Delta and yields just \begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_\psi(z) = \sum_{k\in\mathbb Z}\frac{|c_k|^2}{k+z}
\end{equation} Now everything gets easier. One can compute $\mu_\psi(\lambda)$ explicitly, and the result is \begin{equation}
\mu_\psi(\lambda) = \sum_{k\in\mathbb Z}|c_k|^2\frac{k+\lambda + |{k+\lambda}|}{2(k+\lambda)} = \sum_{k\in\mathbb Z}|c_k|^2\chi_{[-\lambda, +\infty)}
\end{equation} The resulting measure is some kind of counting measure, characterized by \begin{equation}
\mu_\psi(\{n\}) = \mu_\psi(n)-\mu_\psi(n-1) = |c_n|^2,\ \forall n\in\mathbb Z
\end{equation} So that \begin{equation}
<\psi\ |\ p[\psi]> = \int_{\mathbb Z}^{}n\ d\mu_\psi(n) = \sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}n|c_n|^2
\end{equation} Which is exactly the result one gets applying the Fourier Series theory. From here it's also possible to see \begin{equation}
p[\cdot] = \sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}n\Big[\int_0^{2\pi}\cdot(x)e^{-inx}dx\Big]e^{inx}
\end{equation} which also agrees with the FS theory. I hope this is at least useful for the internet wanderers...","['quantum-mechanics', 'spectral-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

$d_3X_2 -d_2X_3 = 0$ (*3 this is for what? we never hear about this subspace  or this ecuations again). The $q-1$ 2-dimensional subspaces wich contains $x$, but don´t contains $y$ or $z$, are defined by the ecuations $$ X_2-\alpha X_3 = 0$$ With $\alpha\in\mathbb(F)_q^*$. Since the product of the non-zero elements of$\mathbb(F)_q$ is $-1$, it follows that $$
\prod_{d\in S\backslash\left\{ x,y,z\right\}}\frac{d_2}{d_3}\prod_{X_2,X_3\in L_C}\frac{(-a_{32})}{a_{23}}=-1
$$
(* how can that be an implication of the above) Observe that $ \prod a_{23} = T_{\left\{ x\right\}}(y) $ and $\prod a_{32} = T_{\left\{ x\right\}}(z)$, and so the above implies that $$
T_{\left\{ x\right\}}(z)\prod_{d\in S\backslash\left\{ x,y,z\right\}}d_2 = (-1)^{ t + 1}T_{\left\{ x\right\}}(y)\prod_{d\in S\backslash\left\{ x,y,z\right\}}d_3
$$ Multiplying this ecuation with the corresponding for $y$ and for $z$ we obtain $$
T_{\left\{ x\right\}}(z)T_{\left\{ z\right\}}(y)T_{\left\{ y\right\}}(x)\prod_{d\in S\backslash\left\{ x,y,z\right\}}d_1d_2d_3 = (-1)^{ 3t + 3}T_{\left\{ x\right\}}(y)T_{\left\{ y\right\}}(z)T_{\left\{ z\right\}}(x)\prod_{d\in S\backslash\left\{ x,y,z\right\}}d_1d_2d_3
$$
and we can conclude $$
(-1)^{t + 1}T_{\left\{ x\right\}}(z)T_{\left\{ z\right\}}(y)T_{\left\{ y\right\}}(x)
 = T_{\left\{ x\right\}}(y)T_{\left\{ y\right\}}(z)T_{\left\{ z\right\}}(x)

Suppose we have two manifolds $M$ and $N$, and $M$ is a surface in $N$ ($M \hookrightarrow N$). $g$ is a metrics on $N$, so $f^{*}g$ (pullback) is a metrics on $M$. Let $\rho$ to be a projection $T_{x}N \rightarrow T_{x}M$. Then $\nabla^M_{y}X=\rho(\nabla^N_{y}X)$ is a Levi-Civita connection on $M$ .

[Here, the dual $\|\cdot\|^*$ of a norm $\|\cdot \|$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined to be $\|y\|^* := \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \frac{y^\top x}{\|x\|}$.] For $A$ being the identity matrix, the result follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: $y^\top x \le \|y\| \|x\|$ with equality attained when $x=y$, so
$$\|y\|^* = \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \frac{y^\top x}{\|x\|} = \|y\|.$$ However I am having trouble with general $A$. I tried using Cauchy-Schwarz on the inner product $\langle x,y \rangle = x^\top A y$, but got stuck. Any hints would be appreciated!

However, I am still stuck on showing that $x=y$ indeed maximizes $\frac{y^\top x}{\|x\|_A}$. Cauchy-Swcharz (for the usual Euclidean norm) only gives $\frac{y^\top x}{\|x\|_A} \le \frac{\|y\|_2 \|x\|_2}{\|x\|_A}$ with equality if and only if $x$ and $y$ differ by a scalar, but the $\|x\|_A$ will mess things up.","['normed-spaces', 'inner-products', 'duality-theorems', 'matrices']"

1454436,Holomorphic implies analytic,"I am trying to understand the proof that a holomorphic function is analytic but I have some questions. The claim is the following: Let $D\subset \mathbb C$ be connected and open and let $f: D \to \mathbb C$ be holomorphic. Then $f$ is analytic. The proof (what I understand so far): Let $z_0 \in D$. We must find an open ball around $z_0$ contained in $D$ and such that $f$ equals its Taylor series on the open ball. Step 1: Pick any $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $B(z_0, \varepsilon) \subset D$ and apply Cauchy's integral formula to get $$ f(z_0) = {1\over 2 \pi i} \int_{\partial B(z_0, \varepsilon)} {f(z) \over z_0 - z} dz $$ Step 2: Expand the geometric series ${1\over 1 - {z \over z_0}}$ to get $$ f(z_0) = {1\over 2 \pi i} \int_{\partial B(z_0, \varepsilon)} f(z) {1\over z_0}\sum_{n}\left ({z\over z_0}\right )^n dz $$ Step 3: Use that the series converges absolutely (because it converges and so converges absolutely for smaller radii by Abel's theorem?) so that $\int$ and $\sum$ commute: $$ f(z_0) = {1\over 2 \pi i} \sum_{n}z^n\int_{\partial B(z_0, \varepsilon)} f(z) {1 \over z_0^{n+1}} dz = \sum_{n} c_n z^n $$ This proves that if $f$ is holomorphic then it is infinitely differentiable. But how can I show from here that $f^{(n)}(z_0) = {n! \over 2 \pi
> i}\int {f(z) \over (z- z_0)^{n+1}}dz$? My idea was to apply the identity theorem to the Taylor series of $f$ and this power series above but the problem is that at this point I don't know that the Taylor series converges to $f$. And another problem is that the proof of the identity theorem might rely on the theorem that holomorphic implies analytic. Also: Is every step above 100% correct?",['complex-analysis']

If is a sets closure is equal to $\mathbb R^n$, then it is dense . The question asks to show that the set of rational numbers are a dense subset of the reals. This is a second year university textbook. Here is what I have so far:
To show that the of set rational numbers is dense, it suffices to show that its closure is the set of Real Numbers. The closure of the set of rational numbers is defined to be the intersection of closed sets containing the rational numbers, and is thus the smallest closed set containing the rational numbers. A real number is defined to be the limit of a sequence of rational numbers, and therefore the smallest set that can contain all rational numbers (of which there exists a rational number between every two real numbers) as well as their boundary points (the irrational numbers) is the set of real numbers.","['elementary-set-theory', 'general-topology']"

It is in finding the left ideals that I am stuck. Finding the Right Ideals To find the right ideals I considered a nonzero element $\begin{bmatrix} a & b\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ of an arbitrary right ideal $I_{r}$ . I  then considered two cases. Case 1: $a\neq0$ We have $\begin{bmatrix} a & b\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} a^{-1} & 0\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\in I_{r}$ . Hence for any $\begin{bmatrix} c & d\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \in R$ we have: $\begin{bmatrix} c & d\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} c & 0\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 0 & d\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \in R$ . That is $I_{r}=R$ . Case 2: $a=0$ We have $K=\{b\in\mathbb{Q}\mid\begin{bmatrix} 0 & b\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\in I_{r}\}$ is an additive subgroup of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $I_{r}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & K\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ . Moreover one can verify that $\begin{bmatrix} 0 & K\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ is a right ideal of $R$ . Hence in this case any ideal is of the form $\begin{bmatrix} 0 & K\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ where $K$ is an additive subgroup of $\mathbb{Q}$ . Finding the Left Ideals I have tried a similar strategy as above. I considered a nonzero element $\begin{bmatrix} a' & b'\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ of an arbitrary left ideal $I_{l}$ . I then attempted to consider two cases. Case 1: $b'=0$ We have $K'=\{a'\in\mathbb{Q}\mid\begin{bmatrix} a' & 0\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\in I_{r}\}$ is an additive subgroup of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $I_{l}=\begin{bmatrix} K' & 0\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ . Moreover one can verify that $\begin{bmatrix} K' & 0\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ is a leftideal of $R$ . Hence in this case any left ideal is of the form $\begin{bmatrix} K' & 0\\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ where $K'$ is an additive subgroup of $\mathbb{Q}$ . It is for the second case that I am stuck, I have no idea how to proceed. Moreover when finding the ideals, I will simply check whether each left/right ideal I find is a right/left ideal.

(Thinking in $\mathbb{R}^3$ , assuming all ""good conditions"", like smooth curve, $\kappa \neq0$ etc.) Since the equation looks like a inner product. I tried to construct a curve with $\frac{1}{\kappa}$ and $\frac{1}{\tau}\frac{d}{ds}(\frac{1}{\kappa})$ as its components. But it turns out that the resulting curve's curvature is not the given $\kappa$ . I also tried differentiating the equations w.r.t $s$ , but did not find any clues. Any ideas? Update: although this question was marked duplicate, that post did not solve the problem completely. Here I posted my solution. Updated 2: the following text is also posted to that post ( math.SE ). But be noticed that the two posts' problem differs subtlety, and my problem requires an extra step to prove. Thanks to @Ted Shifrin and another post at math.SE , I solved this problem. The key is to construct a vector $\alpha$ as in the link above : We assume that $R$ is in a sphere. Then think of the vector $\alpha$ as exactly the vector that points from the centre of sphere to the curve $R$ . So $\alpha$ is different from the original curve $R$ by just by a translation, hence they have the same tangent, curvature and torsion. We can always express $\alpha$ as a linear combination (as suggested by Shifrin) of: $$\alpha(s) = \lambda(s)T(s) + \mu(s)N(s)+\nu(s)B(s)$$ for some functions $\lambda$ , $\mu$ , $\nu$ (Note that $\alpha$ itself not necessarily arc length parametrised.) Then since we assume that the $R$ is on the sphere, and that $\alpha$ is from the centre to the sphere, we require that $\alpha$ is tangent to its tangent vector (notice that if $\alpha$ does not point from the centre to the sphere, it will not be tangent to its tangent vector $T$ ), that is, $$<\alpha, T>=0$$ By differentiating above, we will find the expression for $\alpha$ as shown in the post mentioned: $$\alpha=-\frac{1}{\kappa}N-\left(\frac{1}{\kappa}\right)'\frac{1}{\tau}B,$$ We see clearly $\alpha$ is of constant length. If we can prove $r(s)= R(s) - \alpha(s)$ is a fixed point, then our proof is done. To prove $r(s)$ is a fixed point, we prove that $\frac{d}{ds}r(s) =0$ . This could be done by differentiating the original equation w.r.t $s$ (do a straight forward calculation and then  compare the results of the two)",['differential-geometry']

1455257,Writing real numbers as sum of reciprocals,"I want to rigorously prove that given any $x\geq 0$, we can write $x=\sum_{k\in J} \frac{1}{k}$ for some $J\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ eg. $2=\sum \frac{1}{2^{k}}$. Also, for what other $\{a_{k}\geq 0\}$ is that true (any theorems?)? For example, it fails for $a_{k}=\frac{1}{k!}$: Writing number as sum of reciprocals of factorial Another possible $\{a_{k}\}$ collection is $\mathbb{N}\cup \{\frac{1}{2^{n}}\}$. For conditionally convergent we have the Riemann series theorem but in our case $\sum a_{k}$ is not even conditionally convergent. Anyhow back to proving it for reciprocals. So there is a bunch of algorithms https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm_for_Egyptian_fractions and a proof of what I want in ""The Approximation of Numbers as Sums of Reciprocals"". But the proof there is a bit too wordy for me. I bet if I sit down I can flesh it out completely. Attempt 1)First for rationals $\frac{x}{y}$, we split into $\frac{x}{y}=\frac{1}{\lceil y/x\rceil}+\frac{(-y)\bmod x}{y\lceil y/x\rceil}$, then repeat for $\frac{(-y)\bmod x}{y\lceil y/x\rceil}$ and the result follows by induction on x ($x=1$ and then $x>1$): $\frac{x+1}{y}-\frac{1}{\lceil y/x+1\rceil}=\frac{(x+1)\lceil y/x+1\rceil-y}{y\lceil y/x+1\rceil}\leq \frac{(x+1)( \frac{y-1}{x+1}+1)-y}{y\lceil y/x+1\rceil}=\frac{x}{y\lceil y/x+1\rceil}$. Thus, $(x+1)\lceil y/x+1\rceil-y<x$, for which the result is already true by IH. Then because any irrational (eg. decimal expansion) can be written as sum of rationals we are done. A possible problem here is repetition of reciprocals.","['number-theory', 'real-analysis']"

Prove that $C^*(X,R)\cong K(l^2(I))$. Here is $C^*(X,R)$ the universal $C^*$-algebra for $(X,R)$ and $K(l^2(I))$ are the linear, bounded operators $l^2(I)\to l^2(I)$ which are compact.
