3590429,Stokes Theorem application question,"Below is an excerpt from the book ""Partial Differential Equations"" by Evans.  The underlined equation confuses me.  Clearly it is an application of Stokes theorem, and the implication seems to be that if $f$ is any compactly supported smooth function (for simplicity say on all of $\mathbb{R}^n$ ) then $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^n-B_\epsilon(0)} f_{x^i} d{x}=\int_{\partial B_\epsilon(0)} f\cdot \frac{(-x^i)}{\epsilon} d{S}$$ (here i am just replacing $u\phi$ with $f$ and $\nu^i$ with $ \frac{(-x^i)}{\epsilon} $ ).  But I can't get this equation to come out of stokes theorem.  E.g. assume for simplicity $n=2$ (set $(x^1,x^2)=(x,y)$ ), and $\epsilon =1$ . Let $d\theta$ be the 1-form gotten by pulling back (via $\mathbb{R}^2-0\rightarrow S^1, v\mapsto v/|v|$ ) the volume form on $S^1$ .  Then stokes gives $$\int_{S^1}f\cdot(-x) d\theta=\int_{\mathbb{R}^2-B_1(0)}d(f\cdot(-x) d\theta)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^2-B_1(0)}\frac{\partial f\cdot(-x)}{\partial x}dx\wedge d\theta+\int_{\mathbb{R}^2-B_1(0)}\frac{\partial f\cdot(-x)}{\partial y}dy\wedge d\theta.$$ Now it seems $dx\wedge d\theta = \frac{x}{x^2+y^2}~~ dx\wedge dy$ and $dy\wedge d\theta = \frac{y}{x^2+y^2}~~ dx\wedge dy$ so this gives $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^2-B_1(0)}\frac{\partial f\cdot(-x)}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{x}{x^2+y^2} ~~dx dy+\int_{\mathbb{R}^2-B_1(0)}\frac{\partial f\cdot(-x)}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{y}{x^2+y^2}~~dx dy=$$ $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^2-B_1(0)}- \frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\cdot f~~dx dy+\int_{\mathbb{R}^2-B_1(0)}- \frac{x^2}{x^2+y^2}\cdot f_x ~~dx dy+\int_{\mathbb{R}^2-B_1(0)}- \frac{xy}{x^2+y^2}\cdot f_y~~dx dy.$$ I see no cancellations here or any way to make this look like $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^2-B_1(0)}f_x~~dx dy.$$","['stokes-theorem', 'analysis', 'differential-geometry']"

3590718,Perfect Sampling - Reuse of random bits,"I'm currently studying the Perfect Sampling approach to Markov Chain Monte Carlo proposed by Propp and Wilson in 1996.Though having understood most important aspects, I'm still struggling to figure out their example used for explaining that one must reuse the random numbers generated in earlier iterations. The example reads as follows and is allegedly ""simple to check"". It is sometimes desirable to view the process as an iterative one, in which one successively starts up $n$ copies of the chain at times $-1$ , $-2$ , etc., until one has gone sufficiently far back in the past to allow the different histories to coalesce by time $0$ . However, when one adopts this point of view (and we will want to do this in the next subsection), it is important to bear in mind that the random bits that one uses in going from time $t$ to time $t+1$ must be the same for the many sweeps one might make through this time-step. If one ignores this requirement, then there will in general be bias in the samples that one generates. The curious reader may verify this by considering the Markov chain whose states are $0$ , $1$ , and $2$ , and in which transitions are implemented using a fair coin, by the rule that one moves from state $i$ to state $\min(i+1,2)$ if the coin comes up heads and to state $\max(i-1,O)$ otherwise. It is simple to check that if one runs an incorrect version of our scheme in which entirely new random bits are used every time the chain gets restarted further into the past, the samples one gets will be biased in favor of the extreme states $0$ and $2$ . So obviously the transition matrix of the described Markov Chain is $$
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
1/2 & 1/2 & 0 \\
1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \\
0 & 1/2 & 1/2
\end{pmatrix}
$$ with state space $S = \lbrace 0,1,2 \rbrace$ . So the stationary distribution is $ \pi = \begin{pmatrix} 1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3 \end{pmatrix}$ and the claim is that when applying Perfect Sampling wrongly( that is with regeneration of the random transitions) we would get states $0$ and $2$ with a higher frequency than $1/3$ . I tried modeling the dynamics of the coupled Markov-Chains started at each of the 3 different states. To do so I defined the following $2$ -dimensional Markov-Chain $$
X_t = (X_t^1, X_t^2),
$$ where $X_t^1$ denotes the number of the $3$ -chains currently in state $0$ and $X_t^2$ denotes the number of the $3$ -chains currently in state $1$ . The number of chains in state $2$ would then follow from $3 = X_t^1 + X_t^2$ .
Then the state space of $X$ is $$
S = \lbrace (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (3,0) \rbrace
$$ and the respective transition matrix I came up with is (in R code) m <- matrix(c(.5, 0, 0, .5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
              .25, 0, .25, 0, .25, 0, .25, 0, 0, 0,

&=-\displaystyle\int_0^x |\sin(\frac{1}t)|dt = -H(x),\end{align} so $H(x)$ is odd. Also, $H(0) = 0.$ It suffices to evaluate $\lim\limits_{x\to 0^+}\dfrac{H(x)}x,$ since if $\lim\limits_{x\to 0^+} H(x)$ exists, it must equal $-\lim\limits_{x\to 0^-}H(x),$ which implies that $\lim\limits_{x\to 0^+}\dfrac{H(x)}x = \lim\limits_{x\to 0^-}\dfrac{H(x)}x.$ So assume $x>0.$ Since $|\sin(\frac{1}t)|$ is bounded and continuous on $(0, x], H(x) = \displaystyle\int_0^x |\sin(\frac{1}t)|dt = \lim\limits_{u\to 0^+}\displaystyle\int_u^x |\sin(\frac{1}t)|dt=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\displaystyle\int_{1/((n+1)\pi)}^{1/(k_x\pi)}|\sin(\frac{1}t)|dt + \displaystyle\int_{1/(k_x\pi)}^x |\sin(\frac{1}t)|dt \\

Proof: Suppose $\bigcup (F \setminus G) \subseteq (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G)$ . Let $A \in (F \setminus G) $ and $B \in G$ be arbitrary. Now suppose $\exists x (x \in A \cap B)$ . Since $x \in A$ and $A \in (F \setminus G)$ , it follows by definition that $x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G)$ . Since $x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G)$ and $\bigcup (F \setminus G) \subseteq (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G)$ , $x \in (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G)$ . Thus, $x \in (\bigcup F) $ and $x \notin (\bigcup G) $ . But since $x \in B$ and $B \in G$ , $x \in \bigcup G$ . Thus, we have $x \in \bigcup G$ and $x \notin \bigcup G$ , which is a contradiction. So $\forall x (x \notin A \cap B)$ and $A \cap B = \emptyset$ . Since $A$ and $B$ were arbitrary, it follows that $\forall A \in (F \setminus G) \forall B \in G (A \cap B = \emptyset)$ . Suppose $\forall A \in (F \setminus G) \forall B \in G (A \cap B = \emptyset)$ . Let $x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G)$ be arbitrary. Since $x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G)$ , we can choose some $W \in (F \setminus G)$ such that $x \in W$ . Since $x \in W$ and $W \in F$ , it follows that $x \in \bigcup F$ by definition. Suppose $x \in \bigcup G$ . We can then choose a $V \in G$ such that $x \in V$ . But then we have $W \in (F \setminus G)$ , $V\in G$ , and $x \in W \cap V$ . This is a contradiction because it was given that $\forall A \in (F \setminus G) \forall B \in G (A \cap B = \emptyset)$ . Thus, $x \notin \bigcup G$ . Therefore, if $x \in \bigcup (F \setminus G)$ , then $x \in (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G)$ . Since $x$ was arbitrary, $\bigcup (F \setminus G) \subseteq (\bigcup F) \setminus (\bigcup G)$ . $\square$","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-writing', 'logic', 'solution-verification']"
3591060,"Creating a SIIR (susceptible, infected, isolated, recovered) model using differential equations.","I wasn't too sure of where to post this since it's a mix of physics (dynamical systems), medicine, and mathematics but here it goes. I am trying to model the current outbreak of Covid 19 using a more sophisticated model than the simple SIR model, and so I added two categories: Isolated Sick people to represent sick people who self isolate after presenting symptoms, and Isolated Healthy people to represent people who isolate once isolation is ordered. I set the following set of differential equations and I could appreciate criticism or ways of improving the model, or just confirmation that it should be able to model a pandemic like the one today. I name $S(t)$ the susceptible people, $I(t)$ the infected people (not in quarantine), $Q_s(t)$ people who are sick in quarantine, $Q_h(t)$ people who are healthy in quarantine, and $R(t)$ recovered people. $$
\frac{dS}{dt}=-\beta \frac{S}{N}I-\alpha(t)\frac{S}{N}S+\alpha'(t)\frac{S}{N}Q_h-\beta c\frac{Q_s}{N}S
$$ $$
\frac{dI}{dt}=\beta \frac{S}{N}I+\beta c\frac{S}{N}Q_s+\beta c\frac{I}{N}Q_h-\lambda I-\gamma I -\alpha(t)\frac{S}{N}I
$$ $$
\frac{dQ_s}{dt}=\lambda I-\gamma Q_s+\alpha(t)\frac{S}{N}I
$$ $$
\frac{dQ_h}{dt}=\alpha(t)\frac{S}{N}S-\alpha'(t)\frac{S}{N}Q_h-\beta c\frac{I}{N}Q_h
$$ $$
\frac{dR}{dt}=\gamma Q_s+\gamma I
$$ $$
N = S(t)+I(t)+Q_s(t)+Q_h(t)+R(t) = constant
$$ The equations use the following parameters. $\beta$ is the transmission rate of the disease. $\alpha(t)$ is a time-dependent parameter that indicates the rate at which people go into quarantine once a compulsory quarantine is in effect. You can think of it being a pulse shaped function of a given duration (quarantine duration) and a given amplitude. $\alpha'(t)$ follows the same idea but instead describes how people get out of the quarantine once it's over. $c$ is a percentage multiplier that describes how reduced the infection rate for quarantine people is. In an ideal quarantine, it would be $0$ . $\lambda$ is the rate at which people self isolate once they get infected. $\gamma$ is the rate of recovery from the disease.
Finally, $N$ should be the total population and it should be a constant since all the time derivatives should add up to $0$ (unless I mistyped). I am currently solving it using Python and Scipy, and the main question I have apart from how relevant the coefficients like $\frac{S}{N}$ or $\frac{I}{N}$ are is how come isolation doesn't seem to affect much the amplitude of the peak of infections. Instead what happens is that it only pushes it back. Furthermore, sometimes it seems like isolation at the right moment (once the peak starts to form) can help a lot more than isolation too early there's barely any cases. Indeed, early isolation just pushes it back, but isolation at the right time seems to reduce the future peek since a lot of individuals are by that time already immune and the susceptible population is a lot smaller than just pure isolation when the susceptible population just bounces back to pre isolation levels and since the disease is just as infectious and it hasn't been eliminated, the peak happens just later in the future. Is this effect normal? Is this effect truly what happens in a real pandemic? And if so isn't the current isolation a bit counterproductive in the sense that we don't allow any herd immunity to happen? Thank you! EDIT: I have updated the equations following a comment and removed a squared dependence on S. So now: $$
\frac{dS}{dt}=-\beta \frac{S}{N}I-\alpha(t)S+\alpha'(t)\frac{S}{N}Q_h-\beta c\frac{Q_s}{N}S
$$ $$
\frac{dQ_h}{dt}=\alpha(t)S-\alpha'(t)\frac{S}{N}Q_h-\beta c\frac{I}{N}Q_h
$$ Also, I have been running some simulations (You can find the code on my Github ) that I'd like to discuss. Both correspond to a run with N=40 million people (the size of California), with $\beta=\frac{1}{24*4.375} \text{h}^{-1}$ (the $\beta$ was obtained doing a fit to the cumulative cases in California, and getting the time constant in days). $\lambda=\frac{1}{24*5}=\alpha_0$ (so people take around five days to fully comply with a quarantine. $c=0.5$ . The initial conditions are $I_0=1190$ cases $R_0=20$ , $Q_{h_0}=10$ . The first picture shows a quarantine that is pronounced at $t=20$ days, with a duration of 60 days, with 30 days at full swing, and 15 for rise at full level, and another 15 to come back to pre isolation levels. The first picture has a peak at 199 days, with a total number of infected at 24.1 million people. The second one gives a peak at day 86 with 24.2 million people infected. So as you can see the peak is moved back significantly but the amplitude of said peak stays about the same. Now what's interesting is if I launch the isolation when a little outbreak is happening. I will delay the full quarantine by 50 days. And leave the rest the same. Now the peak on the right is ""only"" at 15.5 million and it was still pushed back to day 243. It seems more manageable. Since probably around 30% of those cases might require hospitalization. Finally, I wonder if repeating a quarantine while the second outbreak happens will work like the first one further helping to reduce the total number of infected. I could model that by changing $\alpha(t)$ and $\alpha'(t)$ .","['nonlinear-dynamics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems']"

Why is this true? I read that since the proof that shows expected values are linear does not use anything regarding independence, independence is not a requirement. I don't quite follow that step. Why would we not need to show that both independent and dependent events have this property? This also leaves me confused with questions regarding this property. For example, Suppose you toss a fair coin 12 times resulting in a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T). Let N be the number of times that the sequence HTHT appears.  For example, HTHT appears twice in HTHTHTTTTTTT. Find E(N) The answer to this problem is 9/16 , which comes from the fact that there is a 1/16 probability that HTHT occurs, starting at index n, with 1 <= n <= 9 , and the answer is 9 * 1/16 . Why is it that we can add the probability that the string HTHT occurs starting at any index? I ask this because say HTHT were to appear in the first four flips, then the probability that HTHT occurs starting at the second index is zero because T was the outcome of the second index.

3591187,Overall equal probabilities when replacing choices,"Explanation: I want to choose marbles from a bag x times. Once chosen, the marbles are not put back in the bag. After each choice, some number of new marbles are added to the bag. x is less than the total number of marbles, i.e. not all marbles will be chosen. My goal is to make it so every marble has an equal chance of being chosen overall (or as close as possible). Example 1 (x = 2): Start with marbles A and B. Choose one at random. Let's say B was chosen. Now marble C is added to the bag and the second marble is chosen. A has already had a 50% chance of being chosen, so giving A and C the same odds would mean A was more likely than C. Is there any weighting possible to make it such that A, B, and C were all equally likely in the beginning? I assume it is not possible because C was not available in the beginning. I believe the next best thing would be to make it so A and C were equally likely from the beginning. My guess is that this can be done by making C twice as likely as A for the second draw (A should have 1/3 chance and C should have 2/3 chance). However, I am not sure how to prove it. Example 2 (x = 3): Start with marbles A and B. Again let's say B is chosen. Now Marbles C and D are added and a second is chosen. Again, I want to say C and D should be twice as likely as A. Assuming I was correct before, A should have a 1/5 chance and C and D should both have a 2/5 chance. Let's say C was chosen. Now marbles E and F are added and so the odds of each marble for the third draw should be 0.0909 for A, 0.1818 for C, 0.3636 for E and 0.3636 for F. Is this correct? How can it be shown mathematically?

Here are my thoughts: If the polygons are disjoint, the intersection is empty. $n_{2,min} = 0$ . If one polygon is inside the other, the inner polygon coincides with the intersection. $n_{2,max} >= n_0$ . The polygon $p_0$ with more vertices can cross polygon $p_1$ at most $2n_1$ times (each edge twice). Each crossing point is a vertex of the intersection.

At $t=0$ , the seal is removed and the reservoir starts leaking. Moreover, $A_O > A_G$ and to be less precise it can be assumed $A_O >> A_G$ , however, I would like to solve it as precisely as possible. The equation is: $$\frac{2gA_O^2}{A_O^2 - A_ G^2}h(t)+\frac{A_O^2}{A_G^2}\bigg(\frac{dh(t)}{dt}\bigg)^2 - \frac{2gA_O^2}{A_O^2 - A_G^2}H_0=0$$ with $h(0)=0$ . Additionally, $h(t)$ is bounded above by $H_0$ , is a strictly increasing function and thus also $\lim_{t \to \inf} h(t)=H_0$ The constants: $A_O$ is the surface of the top of the reservoir. $A_G$ is the surface area of the hole. $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. $H_0$ is the height of the water at t=0. The simplified formula would be: $$\lambda h(t)+\mu\left(\frac{dh(t)}{dt}\right)^2-\lambda H_0=0$$ And just to be clear $\bigg(\frac{dh(t)}{dt}\bigg)^2$ is simply the first derivative squared not the second derivative.

I evoke a generalization of a well-known conjecture, I mean the Feitâ€“Thompson conjecture from Wikipedia. An integer $n>1$ is square-free or squarefree if has no repeated prime factors. For example $n=15$ is squarefree, while than $12$ has repeated prime factors. Conjecture. There are no distinct square-free integers $p$ and $q$ (both greater than $1$ ) with $\gcd(p,q)=1$ such that $\frac{p^q-1}{p-1}$ divides $\frac{q^p-1}{q-1}$ . Question. What work can be done about the veracity of this conjecture? Since Feitâ€“Thompson conjecture seems a particular case of this, then I'm asking if previous conjecture is in the literature, or well if you've some approach or heuristic about the Conjecture or well if it is possible to find a counterexample. Many thanks. I wrote a Pari/GP program and I've tested the Conjecture , let's say for the segments of integers $2\leq p,q\leq 2000$ .

3591844,Chain of circles internally tangent to an ellipse.,"I tried to get an answer to this question (which was hastily closed) but couldn't find a proof, so I decided to ask it again, adding some of my efforts. Suppose we have a finite sequence of $n$ circles ( $n\ge10$ , see figure below) whose centres lie on the major axis of an ellipse. All circles are internally tangent to the ellipse and each circle is also externally tangent to the preceding and following circle (if they exist). If $r_1$ , $r_2$ , ..., $r_n$ are the radii of these circles, prove that: $$
r_7(r_1 + r_7) = r_4(r_4 + r_{10}).
$$ If $x_0$ , $x_1$ , ..., $x_n$ are the abscissae of the intersection points between the circles and the major axis (taking as origin the ellipse centre, see figure above), then it is not difficult to find a recursive relation for $x_k$ . Let $a$ , $b$ be the semi-major axis and semi-minor axis of the ellipse, $A$ and $B$ its foci, $O$ its centre and $c=AO=BO=\sqrt{a^2-b^2}$ . If $C_k$ is the centre of $k$ -th circle and $P_k$ one of its tangency points with the ellipse, then radius $P_kC_k$ is the normal to the ellipse at $P_k$ and thus the bisector of $\angle AP_kB$ . It follows from the length of bisector formula that $$
P_kC_k={b^2\over a^2}\sqrt{AP_k\cdot BP_k}={b^2\over c^2}\sqrt{AC_k\cdot BC_k}=
{b^2\over c^2}\sqrt{c^2-c_k^2},
$$ where $c_k$ is the abscissa of centre $C_k$ . 
Inserting here $P_kC_k=(x_{k}-x_{k-1})/2$ and $c_k=(x_{k}+x_{k-1})/2$ , 
then squaring both sides and rearranging, one finds: $$
x_k^2+x_{k-1}^2-2(2e^2-1)x_kx_{k-1}=4e^2b^2,
$$ where $e=c/a$ is the eccentricity of the ellipse. From the above recursive equation one can find, once $x_0$ is given, all $x_k$ and thus compute $r_k=(x_{k}-x_{k-1})/2$ for all values of $k$ . I used these   results with GeoGebra to draw the first figure, and could numerically check that the formula to prove holds for any value of $x_0$ . Nonetheless, I couldn't obtain a real proof of that formula using algebra, hence I believe I'm missing a simpler way to find those radii. Any idea to prove the statement is welcome.","['conic-sections', 'circles', 'geometry', 'sangaku']"

If the test is positive, a second different test is carried out. The second test always correctly detects if the patient is in fact not under under the influence of the drug, but has a 10% error rate with drug users/under the influence. If 20% of the patients tested are actually users/under the influence we are asked to calculate: a) Proportion of patients that have to be given the second test (i.e proportion of testing positive on the first test)
b) probability patients testing positive on the first test are really under the influence/drug users
c) probability that patients testing negative on the second test are actually under the influence/drug users; For a) I am not sure I've arrived at the correct solution,as its 30% more than the population of 20% who are actually users. d - drug user/under the influence 
c - not under the influence/not a drug user $P(d|+) = \frac{P(+|d)*P(d)}{P(+)*P(+|d) + P(+|c)*P(c)}  = \frac{0.2*0.8}{(0.2*0.8 + 0.2*0.8)} = 0.50 $ i.e % 50% of patients will test positive on first test b) I am immediately confused by this question and c).

P2 = second test Then the desired probability is $$\Pr[P_2 \mid P_1] = \frac{\Pr[P_2 \cap P_1]}{\Pr[P_1]} = \frac{\Pr[P_2 \cap P_1 \mid d]\Pr[d] + \Pr[P_2 \cap P_1 \mid c]\Pr[c]}{\Pr[P_1 \mid d]\Pr[d] + \Pr[P_1 \mid c]\Pr[c]} = \frac{(0.8+0.9)*0.2 + (0.8+1)*0.8}{0.8*0.2 + 0.8*0.8} = 5.5625 $$ This is obviously not correct, I am not sure where I went wrong here.

$$ which I wasn't able to simplify further.  So, our coefficient should be equal to $\sum_{j=0}^{d-k} (-1)^{k+j-p} 
\binom{k}{p-j} \binom{d-k}{j}$ . Another thought is to compute the coefficient as $\frac 1{p!} f_{k,d}^{(p)}(0)$ , where $f_{k,d}(x) = (x-1)^k(x+1)^{d-k}$ .  Taking derivatives leads to the interesting recurrence $$
f_{k,d}' = kf_{k-1,d-1} + (d-k)f_{k,d-1}.
$$ So in other words, if $c^p_{k,d}$ denotes the desired coefficient, then we have $$
c_{k,d}^p = \frac 1{p!}f^{(p)}_{k,d}(0) = 
\frac{k}{p!}f_{k-1,d-1}^{(p-1)} + \frac{d-k}{p!}f_{k,d}^{(p-1)}\\
=\frac{k}{p}c_{k-1,d-1}^{p-1} + \frac{d-k}{p}c_{k,d-1}^{p-1}.

I'm looking for asymptotically correct bounds on the mixing time of this random walk, where mixing is defined in terms of total variation distance as in Markov Chains and Mixing Times by Levin and Peres. A coordinate-wise coupling argument (Ã  la that given in the solution to exercise 5.4 in MC&MT) gives that for any $\varepsilon>0$ , the mixing time $t_{\text{mix}}(\varepsilon)$ is at most $\frac{1}{\log(4)}n^{3}\log(n/\varepsilon)$ , where the logs are natural logs. This is of the right order, but I believe that the constant $1/\log(4)$ is too big. Using a slight generalization of Wilson's Method (see section 13.5 of the text), I obtained that for any $\varepsilon>0$ , the mixing time $t_{\text{mix}}(\varepsilon)$ is at least $(1-o(1))\frac{1}{2\pi^{2}}n^{3}\log(n).$ Based on the mixing times of related chains, I think the constant $\frac{1}{2\pi^{2}}$ at least has the right ""flavor,"" if it isn't already correct. At the very least, we know the mixing time is of order $n^{3}\log n.$ Of course, the question I'd like to answer is what is the correct constant? If my hunch about the upper bound being too large is correct, answering this requires obtaining an upper bound with a constant less than $\frac{1}{\log(4)}.$ What method(s) can I use to get a better upper bound? I am guessing that I need some spectral method. Note that the usual spectral upper bound $t_{\text{mix}}(\varepsilon) \leq \frac{1}{\text{spectral gap}}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon \pi_{\text{min}}}$ (where $\pi_{\text{min}}$ is the smallest probability in the stationary distribution) is not helpful here: the spectral gap is of order $n^{-3}$ , but since $\pi_{\text{min}}=1/n!$ the bound is $O(n^{3}\log(n!/\varepsilon)).$ $\mathscr{l}^{2}$ methods like those in section 12.4 of the text seem difficult to apply, since the eigenvalues are complicated. A final question would be, can the lower bound be improved? Any insight would be appreciated!","['spectral-graph-theory', 'markov-chains', 'asymptotics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'probability']"

3592191,Some properties of zero-sets and cozero-sets,"Definition A subset $Y$ of a topological space is zero-set if there exist a continuous real function $f:X\rightarrow\Bbb{R}$ such that $Y=f^{-1}(\{0\})$ and so we say that a subset $Z$ of $X$ is cozero-set if $X\setminus Z$ is zero-set. So now we prove the following statements: any zero-set is closed and any conul set is open and moreover the sets $\varnothing$ and $X$ are respectively zero-set and cozero-set; the finite union and the finite intersection of zero-sets or cozero-sets is respectively zero-set or cozero-set; a $T_1$ space $X$ is completely regular iff for any $x\in X$ the collection of cozero-set neighborhoods of $x$ is a local basis for $x$ ; if $X$ is completely regular then the collection of cozero open sets is a basis. Proof . Since in the above definition $f$ is a continuous function and since $\{0\}$ is closed in the euclidean topology -indeed $(\Bbb{R},\mathcal{T}_e)$ is a $T_1$ space- it result that $f^{-1}(\{0\})$ is closed and so a zero-set is closed and thus a cozero-set is open. Then since the costant function $f:X\owns x\rightarrow 0\in\Bbb{R}$ is trivially continuous and since $f^{-1}(\{0\})=X$ it result that $X$ is zero-set and $\varnothing$ is cozero-set. So we proved 1. Now we suppose that $X$ a comletely regular space and so let be $x\in U$ a open neighborhood of $x$ : since $X$ is a Tychonoff space we can claim that there exist a continuous function $f:X\rightarrow[0,1]$ such that $f(X\setminus U)=\{0\}$ and so this means that every open sets are cozero-set and so the local basis of open neighborhood of $x$ is a local basis of cozero-sets. Therefore now we suppose that $X$ is a $T_1$ space such that any its point have a cozero-set local basis and so let be $F$ a closed set and $x\notin F$ : since $X\setminus F$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ there exist a cozero-set neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such $x\in U\subseteq X\setminus F$ , from which it result $F\subseteq X\setminus U$ ; and since $U$ is cozero-set there exist a coutinuous function $f:X\rightarrow\Bbb{R}$ such that $(X\setminus U)=f^{-1}(\{0\})$ and so it is clear that $f(F)=(\{0\})$ and $f(x)\neq 0$ and so for what I proved here -is it correct?- we can claim that $X$ is a completely regular space. So we proved 3. Now we suppose that $X$ is completely regular and so for what we prove above we know that for any $x\in X$ the collection of open cozero-set neighborhoods $\mathcal{B}(x)$ of $x$ is a local basis for $x$ : so it is clear that the collection of $\mathcal{B}:=\bigcup_{x\in X}\mathcal{B}(x)$ is a topological basis for $X$ . So we proved 4. As you can observe unfortunately I can't prove the second statement and then in the first statement it result that $X$ is cozero-set and $\varnothing$ is zero-set whereas I proved the contrary. So I ask to prove the second point and to explain if what it is written in the final part of first point is a typo. Then I ask if the proof of 3 and 4 points is correct.

Indeed, if we replace $m$ by $-m$ and $n$ by $-n$ in (**), taking into account that ${-a \brace -b}$ = ${b \brack a}$ and ${-n \choose k}=(-1)^k{n+k-1\choose k}$ , we obtain \begin{align*} {\ell-m \choose \ell}{-n \brace \ell-m}&= \sum_k {k\brace \ell}{-n-k \brace -m}{-n \choose k} \\
(-1)^\ell{m-1 \choose \ell}{m- \ell \brack n}&= \sum_k {k\brace \ell}{m \brack n+k}(-1)^k{n+k-1 \choose k}\end{align*} which is (*) after the appropriate change of notation. But in Concrete Mathematics , the identity (**) is given under the condition $\ell,m,n \ge 0$ , so I am note sure whether it is licit to do such negation of the indices. Then my question is: how can we derive (*) directly, without resorting to (**). Maybe with generating functions, coefficient extractors or things like that?","['summation', 'combinatorics', 'stirling-numbers', 'generating-functions']"

3592286,"When $\mathbb{C}[u,v]$ is a UFD, for special $u,v \in \mathbb{C}[t]$?","Let $f=f(t) \in \mathbb{C}[t]$ be a non-scalar polynomial.
Write $f=a_{2n}t^{2n}+a_{2n-1}t^{2n-1}+\cdots+a_2t^2+a_1t+a_0$ ,
where $a_j \in \mathbb{C}$ . The map $\iota: t \mapsto -t$ is an involution on $\mathbb{C}[t]$ , namely, a $\mathbb{C}$ -algebra automorphism of degree two. Denote the set of symmetric elements w.r.t. $\iota$ by $S$ and 
the set of skew-symmetric elements w.r.t. $\iota$ by $K$ .
Notice that even polynomials are symmetric elements w.r.t. $\iota$ ,
while odd polynomials are skew-symmetric elements w.r.t. $\iota$ . Write $f=s+k$ , where $s \in S$ and $k \in K$ . Clearly, $\mathbb{C}[f] \subseteq \mathbb{C}[t]$ is a UFD ( $\mathbb{C}[f]$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}[t]$ ). Question 1: Is it possible to find a general form of $f$ such that $R_{f}:=\mathbb{C}[s,k]$ is a UFD? Partial answer: In the following four cases $R_{f}$ is a UFD: (i) $k=0$ , so $f=s \in S$ , and then $R_{f}=\mathbb{C}[s,0]=\mathbb{C}[s] \cong \mathbb{C}[t]$ . (ii) $s=0$ , so $f=k \in K$ , and then $R_{f}=\mathbb{C}[0,k]=\mathbb{C}[k] \cong \mathbb{C}[t]$ . (iii) $k=t$ , so $R_{f}=\mathbb{C}[s,t]=\mathbb{C}[t]$ . (iv) $s=k^{2m}$ for some $m$ ,
so $R_{f}=\mathbb{C}[k^{2m},k]=\mathbb{C}[k] \cong \mathbb{C}[t]$ .
For example, $s=\lambda t^6$ , $k=\mu t^3$ , so $R_{f}=\mathbb{C}[\lambda t^6,\mu t^3]=\mathbb{C}[t^3] \cong \mathbb{C}[t]$ . Question 1': Are there additional cases? Non-example: For $f=t^3+t^2$ , $R_{f}=\mathbb{C}[t^2,t^3]$ is not a UFD, as $t^2t^2t^2=t^3t^3$ shows. Remark: This question is relevant, especially the comments of Mohan and user26857,
saying the following: ""If $R$ is Noetherian, integrally closed and dimension one $\mathbb{C}$ -subalgebra of the polynomial ring, it is isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}[t]$ "". Therefore, here, if $R_{f}$ is not a UFD, then it is not isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}[t]$ , hence $R_{f}$ is not integrally closed. On the other hand, if $R_{f}$ is integrally closed, then it equals its integral closure, which is of the form $\mathbb{C}[g]$ for some $g \in \mathbb{C}[t]$ (= this result appears in the paper of Paul Eakin ""A note on finite dimensional subrings of polynomial rings""). Therefore, $R_{f}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}[t]$ , hence it is a UFD. Summarizing, my questions 1 and 1' are equivalent to the following question: Question 1'': Let $s \in S$ (= even polynomials), $k \in K$ (= odd polynomials). Is it possible to find general forms of $s$ and $k$ such that $R_{s+k}=\mathbb{C}[s,k]$ is integrally closed? (Are cases (i) , (ii) and (iii) the only ones?). Important remark to question 1'': This question and its answer are highly relevant. Question 2: I guess that questions 1 and 1' are not too difficult (perhaps some algebraic geometry is needed?),
  so what if we replace $\mathbb{C}$ by an arbitrary UFD $D$ ? Any comments are welcome! Thank you.","['involutions', 'unique-factorization-domains', 'algebraic-geometry', 'polynomials', 'commutative-algebra']"

3592401,Proof verification : A weird identity involving sums,"I recently managed to solve a question that I asked a few days ago, but that was unfortunately closed, probably because it wasn't clear enough. Here is the question : Let $ n $ be a positive integer, prove the following identity : $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n}{\frac{1}{2k+1}\binom{n}{k}}=\left(\sum_{k=0}^{n}{\frac{1}{2^{k}}\binom{2k}{k}}\right)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{n}{\frac{\left(-1\right)^{k}}{2k+1}\binom{n}{k}}\right) $$ What I'm asking you for is to verify the following solution for me. First of all : $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n}{\frac{1}{2k+1}\binom{n}{k}}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{\binom{n}{k}\int_{0}^{1}{x^{2k}\,\mathrm{d}x}}=\int_{0}^{1}{\left(1+x^{2}\right)^{n}\,\mathrm{d}x}\overset{\mathrm{denoted}}{=}I_{n}$$ Then : \begin{aligned} I_{n}=\int_{0}^{1}{\left(1+x^{2}\right)^{n}\,\mathrm{d}x}&=\left[x\left(1+x^{2}\right)^{n}\right]_{0}^{1}-2n\int_{0}^{1}{x^{2}\left(1+x^{2}\right)^{n}\,\mathrm{d}x}\\ &=2^{n}-2n\int_{0}^{1}{\left(\left(1+x^{2}\right)^{n}-\left(1+x^{2}\right)^{n-1}\right)\mathrm{d}x} \\ I_{n}&=2^{n}-2n\left(I_{n}-I_{n-1}\right)\\ \iff I_{n}&=\frac{2^{n}}{2n+1}+\frac{2n}{2n+1}I_{n-1}\end{aligned} In order to solve this recurrence relation, we'll multiply everything by $ \prod\limits_{k=1}^{n}{\frac{2k+1}{2k}} $ , so that we could have telescopic cancelling between the consecutive terms. Meaning, $$ \prod_{k=1}^{n}{\frac{2k+1}{2k}}I_{n}=\frac{2^{n}}{2n+1}\prod_{k=1}^{n}{\frac{2k+1}{2k}}+\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}{\frac{2k+1}{2k}}I_{n-1} $$ Since : $$ \frac{2^{n}}{2n+1}\prod_{k=1}^{n}{\frac{2k+1}{2k}}=\frac{2^{n}\prod\limits_{k=0}^{n-1}{\left(2k+1\right)}}{\prod\limits_{k=1}^{n}{\left(2k\right)}}=\frac{\left(2n\right)!}{2^{n}\left(n!\right)^{2}}=\frac{1}{2^{n}}\binom{2n}{n} $$ We get that for any $ k\geq 1 $ : \begin{aligned} \prod_{j=1}^{k}{\frac{2j+1}{2j}}I_{k}-\prod_{j=1}^{k-1}{\frac{2j+1}{2j}}I_{k-1}&=\frac{1}{2^{k}}\binom{2k}{k}\\ \Longrightarrow\sum_{k=1}^{n}{\left(\prod_{j=1}^{k}{\frac{2j+1}{2j}}I_{k}-\prod_{j=1}^{k-1}{\frac{2j+1}{2j}}I_{k-1}\right)}&=\sum_{k=1}^{n}{\frac{1}{2^{k}}\binom{2k}{k}}\\ \iff \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \prod_{k=1}^{n}{\frac{2k+1}{2k}}I_{n}-1&=\sum_{k=1}^{n}{\frac{1}{2^{k}}\binom{2k}{k}}\\ \iff \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ I_{n}&=\left(\prod_{k=1}^{n}{\frac{2k}{2k+1}}\right)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{n}{\frac{1}{2^{k}}\binom{2k}{k}}\right)\end{aligned} Secondly : $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n}{\frac{\left(-1\right)^{k}}{2k+1}\binom{n}{k}}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{\left(-1\right)^{k}\binom{n}{k}\int_{0}^{1}{x^{2k}\,\mathrm{d}x}}=\int_{0}^{1}{\left(1-x^{2}\right)^{n}\,\mathrm{d}x}\overset{\mathrm{denoted}}{=}J_{n} $$ Then : \begin{aligned} J_{n}=\int_{0}^{1}{\left(1-x^{2}\right)^{n}\,\mathrm{d}x}&=\left[x\left(1-x^{2}\right)^{n}\right]_{0}^{1}+2n\int_{0}^{1}{x^{2}\left(1-x^{2}\right)^{n}\,\mathrm{d}x}\\&=2n\int_{0}^{1}{\left(\left(1-x^{2}\right)^{n-1}-\left(1-x^{2}\right)^{n}\right)\mathrm{d}x} \\ J_{n}&=2n\left(J_{n-1}-J_{n}\right)\\ \iff \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ J_{n}&=\frac{2n}{2n+1}J_{n-1}\\ \Longrightarrow \prod_{k=1}^{n}{\frac{J_{k}}{J_{k-1}}}&=\prod_{k=1}^{n}{\frac{2k}{2k+1}}\\ \iff \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ J_{n}&=\prod_{k=1}^{n}{\frac{2k}{2k+1}}\end{aligned} Thus, $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n}{\frac{1}{2k+1}\binom{n}{k}}=\left(\sum_{k=0}^{n}{\frac{\left(-1\right)^{k}}{2k+1}\binom{n}{k}}\right)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{n}{\frac{1}{2^{k}}\binom{2k}{k}}\right) $$ What do you guys think ?","['summation', 'binomial-coefficients', 'solution-verification', 'sequences-and-series']"
3592421,PoincarÃ© duality for de Rham cohomology on non-compact manifolds,"Let $M$ be an $n$ -dimensional orientable non-compact manifold. Is there an isomorphism as follows, and if so how can we construct it? (Or can you provide a reference?) $$
 H^{n-i}_{\operatorname{dR},c}(M, \mathbb R) \cong H_i(M,\mathbb R).
 $$ On the left hand side we have de Rham cohomology with compact support and on the right hand side we have singular homology. According to [1], PoincarÃ© duality can be stated as saying that the integration pairing between compactly supported forms and forms induces an isomorphism: $$
H^i_{\operatorname{dR}}(M,\mathbb R)\cong \left(H^{n-i}_{\operatorname{dR},c}(M, \mathbb R)\right)^\vee.
$$ Where $\bullet^\vee$ denotes the vector space dual. Now, note that $H^{n-i}_c\not\cong (H^i)^\vee$ in general, because in our situation the homology groups might be infinite dimensional. The de Rham theorem says that integration gives an isomorphism witht he dual of singular homology: $$
H^i_{\operatorname{dR}}(M,\mathbb R)\cong \left(H_{i}(M, \mathbb R)\right)^\vee.
$$ Now, knowing that two (infinite dimensional) vector spaces have the same dual doesn't seem all that helpful. I don't even see how integration can give a map $H^{n-i}_c\to H_i$ . Another attempt would be to try to follow the proof that appears in [1] and [2]. You could try to ""induct"" by showing that if PoincarÃ© duality holds in two open sets $U$ abd $V$ then it holds in the union. But the five-lemma together with the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequences aren't enough to construct a map, much less a canonical one. I'd be happy with an answer that uses Verdier duality (bonus points for an answer with coefficients in a local system), but then the trouble is that books that talk about sheaves don't talk about homology (or they define it as the cohomology with compact support of the dual local system, in which case this is tautology). Then the question becomes: For a local system $\mathcal L$ on $M$ , are the following quasiisomorphic? $$Rp_!(\mathcal L) \cong C_\bullet(M,\mathcal L):= C_\bullet(\widetilde M, \mathbb R)\otimes_{\mathbb R[\pi_1(M)]} \mathcal L_p.$$ Here $p:M\to *$ is the map to a point, $\widetilde M$ is the universal cover, and the fundamental group acts on $\widetilde M$ by deck transformations and on the stalk $\mathcal L_p$ by the monodromy of $\mathcal L$ . I guess this would be a corollary of the question Is there a soft complex of sheaves that resolves $\mathcal L$ , and whose compactly supported sections form a complex quasiisomorphic to $C_\bullet(M, \mathcal L)$ ? Update: I've been looking at Glen Bredon's book [3], and Theorem V.9.2. is promising in that it relates homology and compactly supported cohomology. However, the definition of ""sheaf homology"" in that book doesn't seem to be related to singular homology as far as I can tell. In Chapter VI there is a relation between singular homology and ÄŒech homology, but somehow not between these two and sheaf homology.

3592481,Means and entropy: what's the relationship?,"Economist here. In my current research I often encounter the concepts of entropy and means, and I find some connections interesting (for my purposes). The context is a set of $n$ nonnegative numbers $\{a_1,\dots,a_n\}$ , which can be normalized by the sum of the $a_i$ 's to get $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ . These $x_i$ 's serve as weights in the context of means, and they serve as probabilities out of which entropy can be calculated.
I find relationships between entropy and means, particularly between \begin{align*}
\mathcal{A}\left(a_{i},\frac{1}{n}\right) & =\frac{1}{n}\sum a_{i} & \underset{\textrm{(i.e. equal weights }\frac{1}{n})}{\textrm{unweighted arithmetic mean}}\\
\mathcal{G}\left(a_{i},x_{i}\right) & =\prod a_{i}^{x_{i}} & \underset{\textrm{(with weights }x_{i}\textrm{ summing to one)}}{\textrm{weighted geometric mean}}\\
H(x_{i}) & =-\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\ln x_{i} & \underset{\textrm{(same }x_{i}\textrm{ as above, i.e. probabilities)}}{\textrm{Shannon entropy}}
\end{align*} Questions: In general, how are entropy and means related? I can't think I'm the first one to notice. The only thing I can think of is the inequality $\mathcal{A}\ge\mathcal{G}$ between the arithmetic and geometric means; if I am right, the difference or divergence between these two means relates to the Shannon entropy. But not so fast: the inequality of means is valid when both the arithmetic and geometric means have the same weights (either $\frac{1}{n}$ or $x_i$ )--which is not the case here.

3592648,"Is $Ext^1_{Lie-Gr}(\mathbb C, \mathbb C^*)=0$?","I want to know if any Lie group extension $$1\to \mathbb C^*\to A\xrightarrow{\pi} \mathbb C\to 0 \tag{1}\label{1}$$ is trivial, where the group structure is multiplicative on $\mathbb C^*$ and additive on $\mathbb C$ . I guess the answer is Yes and it suffices to find a section $s:\mathbb C\to A$ as Lie group morphism such that $\pi\circ s=Id$ . From the point of view of topology, $A$ is a principal $\mathbb C^*$ -bundle over the contractible base $\mathbb C$ . This implies $A$ is trivial as principal $\mathbb C^*$ -bundle, so there is a section $s:\mathbb C\to A$ . However, the section need not preserve the group structure. Can I modify the section $s$ so as preserve the group structure? Edited remark : As @Roland's points out, considering the extension $(1)$ purely as group extension which lives in $Ext_{Ab}^1(\mathbb C,\mathbb C^*)$ is different from an extension as Lie groups (or algebraic groups), because a section in the category of groups does not need to be even continuous. Second Edition : Here is another idea: If we pull back $A$ to its universal covering $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD}
\mathbb C @>>> \tilde{A}@>\tilde{\pi}>>\mathbb C\\
@VVV  @VVV  @VV=V \\
\mathbb C^* @>>> A @>\pi>> \mathbb C
\end{CD} If I can show the sequence on the first row is trivial, then a section $\tilde{s}:\mathbb C\to \tilde{A}$ will descend to a section $s:\mathbb C\to A$ , but how do we show $Ext^1_{Lie-gr}(\mathbb C,\mathbb C)=0$ (although it sounds trivial)?","['homological-algebra', 'group-extensions', 'abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-topology']"
3592684,"Galois Extension, Chinese Remainder Theorem, and Quotients of Polynomial Rings","I am trying to prove the following assertion (, which is an exercise from a section on tensor products in the book Algebra: Chapter 0 by P.Aluffi): Let $F=k(\alpha)\supset k$ be a finite simple extension such that $F\otimes_kF\cong F^{[F:k]}$ as a ring. Then the extension is Galois. A related question has been asked several times on this site, for example in here . Reading the answers to these questions, I learned that  the above assertion may be proved as follows: There is a canonical isomorphism $F\otimes_k F\cong F[x]/(m(x))$ of $k$ -algebras. Now $F^n$ is obviously reduced, so $F[x]/(m(x))$ is also reduced. It follows that $\alpha$ is separable over $k$ . (This step requires a little more argument, but I am OK with this step.) Therefore, to prove that $F/k$ is Galois, it suffices to show that the $\alpha$ splits over $F$ . Let $m(x)\in k[x]$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $k$ . But $F[x]/(m(x))\cong F^n$ as a ring by hypothesis. By the Chinese remainder theorem, this implies that $m(x)$ factors into linear factors over $F$ . I do not understand the bold faced part in step 3. Sure, the Chinese remainder theorem implies that if $m(x)$ splits over $F$ , then $F[x]/(m(x))\cong F^n$ as rings. However, we want to go in the other direction. How do we do this? Thanks in advance. In addition to the above question, I would greatly appreciate the answers to the following additional questions. ( But you do not have to answer these unless you want to. ) The question which I cited above actually assumed that the isomorphism $F\otimes_k F\cong F^{[F:k]}$ to be an $F$ -algebra isomorphism. In my book, this isomorphism is assumed to be merely a ring isomorphism. Maybe the author took it for granted that the isomorphism to be $F$ -linear? Or maybe we can do without the $F$ -linearity. In general, which quotient of $F[x]$ isomorphic to the direct product of $F$ as a ring (or as an $F$ -algebra)?","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'tensor-products', 'extension-field']"

3593636,Counterexample: Uniqueness of fiber metric on alternating $2$-vectors,"I'm working on the following problem (Lee's ""Riemannian Manifolds"", Problem 8-33(a)). Suppose $(M,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold. Let $\Lambda^2(TM)$ be the bundle of $2$ -tensors on $M$ . Show that there is a unique fiber metric on $\Lambda^2(TM)$ whose associated norm satisfies $$|w \wedge x|^2 = |w|^2|x|^2-\langle w, x\rangle^2$$ for all tangent vectors $w, x$ at every point $q \in M$ . My question: Are we guaranteed uniqueness? Existence is straightforward by taking a local orthonormal frame $\{E_1,\ldots, E_n\}$ of $M$ and declaring $\{E_i \wedge E_j : i < j\}$ to be an orthonormal frame. One can further show using the algebra of alternating bivectors that given any local orthonormal frame $\{\tilde E_1, \ldots, \tilde E_n\}$ , the corresponding set $\{\tilde E_i \wedge \tilde E_j : i < j\}$ of contravariant $2$ -tensor fields is orthonormal in this inner product, so this fiber bundle is smooth and well-defined on all of $M$ . However, I'm not sure we have uniqueness. Consider $(M,g) = (\mathbb{R}^4, \overline g)$ , where $\overline g$ is the Euclidean metric, and let $\{E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4\}$ be the standard orthonormal coordinate frame. Define the metric $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ on $\Lambda^2(T\mathbb R^4)$ by declaring $|E_i \wedge E_j| = 1$ for $1 \leq i<j \leq 4$ , along with the relations $$
\langle E_1 \wedge E_2, E_3 \wedge E_4 \rangle = \langle E_1 \wedge E_4, E_2 \wedge E_3 \rangle = -\langle E_1 \wedge E_3, E_2 \wedge E_4 \rangle = 1,
$$ and all products of the form $\langle E_i \wedge E_j, E_i \wedge E_k \rangle = 0$ for $j \neq k$ . Noting $w \wedge x = \sum_{i<j}\left(w^i x^j - w^j x^i\right) E_i \wedge E_j$ , one can show by direct computation that in this metric, we have: \begin{align*}
|w \wedge x|^2 &= 2\bigg((w^1 x^2 - w^2 x^1)(w^3x^4-w^4x^3) - (w^1x^3-w^3x^1)(w^2x^4-w^4x^2) + (w^1x^4-w^4x^1)(w^2x^3-w^3x^2)\bigg) \\ &\quad+ \sum_{i<j}(w^i x^j - w^j x^i)^2 \\
&= \sum_{i<j}(w^i x^j - w^j x^i)^2 = \sum_{i\neq j} \left((w^i)^2(v^j)^2-w^i v^i w^j v^j\right) \\
&= |w|^2|v|^2-\langle w, v \rangle^2,
\end{align*} because the parenthetical term to the right of the $2$ in the first equation above simplifies to $0$ . This is obviously a different metric from the one generally constructed in the proof of existence, so is there a reason this metric fails the conditions of the problem, or is uniqueness indeed too much to ask for?","['tensors', 'exterior-algebra', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
3593658,Conditional expectation for multivariate normal: Independence trick,"Let $n\ge2$ be an integer, let $\Sigma$ be a positive semidefinite, symmetric $n\times n$ matrix of real numbers partitioned as $$\Sigma=\begin{pmatrix}\Sigma_{a,a}&\Sigma_{a,b}\\\Sigma_{b,a}&\Sigma_{b,b}\end{pmatrix},$$ where $\Sigma_{a,a}$ is $1\times1$ and $\Sigma_{b,b}$ is $(n-1)\times(n-1),$ assume $\Sigma_{b,b}$ is positive definite (i.e., invertible) and let $X=(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ be $N(0,\Sigma),$ normal with mean zero and covariance matrix $\Sigma.$ I wish to find $E(X_1\mid X_2,\dots,X_n).$ In addition, I am using the Radon-Nikodym-derivative definition of conditional expectation, so I would prefer not to compute conditional densities $f_{X_a\mid X_b}(x_a\mid x_b)=f_{X_a,X_b}(x_a,x_b)/f_{X_b}(x_b).$ From Conditional Expectation Multivariate Normal , I can guess that $E(X_1\mid X_2,\dots,X_n)=\Sigma_{a,b}\Sigma_{b,b}^{-1}(X_2,\dots,X_n)^T.$ To prove this result, I tried reasoning as follows, similar to user357269's answer to ""Conditional expectation of a joint normal distribution"": If $X_1-\Sigma_{a,b}\Sigma_{b,b}^{-1}(X_2,\dots,X_n)^T$ and $\sigma(X_2,\dots,X_n)$ are independent, then we have $$E(X_1\mid X_2,\dots,X_n)$$ $$=E(X_1-\Sigma_{a,b}\Sigma_{b,b}^{-1}(X_2,\dots,X_n)^T+\Sigma_{a,b}\Sigma_{b,b}^{-1}(X_2,\dots,X_n)^T\mid X_2,\dots,X_n)$$ $$=E(X_1-\Sigma_{a,b}\Sigma_{b,b}^{-1}(X_2,\dots,X_n)^T)+\Sigma_{a,b}\Sigma_{b,b}^{-1}(X_2,\dots,X_n)^T=\Sigma_{a,b}\Sigma_{b,b}^{-1}(X_2,\dots,X_n)^T,$$ where the last equality follows from $EX_1=0$ and $E((X_2,\dots,X_n))=0.$ However, I am stuck on showing independence. For the case $n=2,$ we can compute the covariance $\text{Cov}(X_1-\Sigma_{a,b}\Sigma_{b,b}^{-1}X_2,X_2)=0$ and appeal to a theorem. However, I am unsure what to do for larger $n,$ since $(X_2,\dots,X_n)$ is vector-valued rather than real-valued.","['probability-distributions', 'independence', 'conditional-expectation', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"
3593659,Places and schemes,"In my algebraic number theory, we're currently studying local fields, and we've noted that given a number field $K$ , its normalized discrete valuations correspond exactly to primes of $O_K$ , and we are supposed to think of its archimedean absolute values as ""primes at infinity"". This terminology suggests that the set of places (equivalence classes of absolute values modulo homeomorphism) is a sort of projectivization or compactification of $\operatorname{Spec}(O_K)$ . Is there a natural geometric structure, such as the structure of a scheme or locally ringed space, that can be put on this set? If so, what is its relation to the affine scheme of $O_K$ ? Finally, do we get something similar when we extend to arbitrary global fields, or even to function fields of complex algebraic curves? Any information or references would be appreciated.","['algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'valuation-theory', 'arithmetic-geometry']"
