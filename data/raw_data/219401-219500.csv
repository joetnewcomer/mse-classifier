4487189,Nice proof that expected number of $k$-cycles in a permutation of $n$ is $\frac1k$ whenever $0<k\leq n$,"Taking the combintorialist point of view that a cycle of a permutation $~\sigma$ of a finite set $S$ is an orbit of the action of the subgroup generated by $~\sigma$ in its (natural) action on $~S$ , it is known that whenever $S$ admits $k$ -cycles at all (so $0<k\leq n$ where $n$ is the size of $S$ ), the expected number of $k$ -cycles of $~\sigma$ where $\sigma$ is chosen uniformly at random among all permutations of $~S$ , is precisely $~\frac1k$ . Stated differently, the statistic ""number of $k$ -cycles"" takes an average value of $~\frac1k$ when $\sigma$ runs over all permutations of $~S$ . I am looking for nice, intuitive, transparent, proofs of this fact, notably where the fraction $~\frac1k$ comes about naturally, preferably as the probability of obtaining a specific value when choosing an element uniformly from a $k$ -element set. While I know a few easy computations that prove the result, none I've seen so far have achieved this highest standard, though some arrive at the fraction after some very basic cancellations. The cases $k=1$ (the expected number of fixed points of a permutation is precisely $1$ ) and $k=n$ (there are $(n-1)!$ distinct cyclic permutations of $S$ , which is $\frac1n$ of all permutations) are very well known and with easy proofs, but I would like a proof that covers all allowed values of $k$ in a uniform manner. I've seen quite a few questions on this site that come close to this one, but few state the result in isolation and none specifically ask for elegant arguments, so I don't feel this question is truly a duplicate of any of them. This question was inspired by watching this video (with a rather click-bait title) where the deduction of the case for $k=n$ (from 8:17 on) is followed by the irrefutable argument ""this is a general result"" (implying it's validity for all $k$ ) with no mention of expectation (for $k=n$ the only possible numbers of cycles are $0$ and $1$ , so the expected value is just a probability) and no explanation whatsoever.","['permutations', 'combinatorics', 'probability']"
4487193,Prove that a half-open line is uncountable - corrected,"I have to provide a proof that a halfopen line $L_a:={𝑥 ∈ ℝ:x > a}$ is uncountable. I have used Schröder-Bernstein-Cantor and tried to show that an injection exists between $L_a$ and $ℝ$ an injection between $ℝ$ and $L_a$ to conclude that a bijective function exists between $ℝ$ and $L_a$ to prove that $L_a$ is uncountable. I chose the following two functions: $f:L_a \rightarrow ℝ:x \rightarrow x$ is injective $g:ℝ \rightarrow L_a:x \rightarrow a+e^x$ is injective It follows that a bijection exists between both sets, so $L_a$ is uncountable.

4487231,Bound on the probability of infinity norm of a Gaussian vector,"I consider a random vector $X\in \mathbb{R}^N$ following a multivariate Gaussian distribution of mean zero and covariance matrix $\Sigma_X$ such that $\forall 1\le i \le N, (\Sigma_X)_{ii}=1$ (there are only 1's on the diagonal). I am interrested in the maximum of the absolute value of the elements of $X$ : $\lVert X \rVert_\infty = \max_{1\le n \le N} |X_n|$ . I have the intuition that the following inequality is true: \begin{equation}\label{goal}
\forall K>0, \; \mathbb{P}(\lVert X \rVert_\infty \le K) \ge \mathbb{P}(\lVert Y \rVert_\infty \le K) \qquad \mathrm{where} \qquad Y\sim \mathcal{N}(0,I_N)
\end{equation} In other words, the probability of $\lVert X \rVert_\infty$ being smaller than $K$ is minimum in the case where all the elements of $X$ are iid centered normal variables. I managed to prove this in the case $N=2$ by direct calculation of the above probability but the integrals get too complicated for bigger $N$ . Does this result holds for $N>2$ and is there a proof ? In the case that the result is not true, are there smaller classes of covariance matrices $\Sigma_X$ (for example Toeplitz matrices, or Toeplitz matrices with $1, \rho, \rho^2,\rho^3,\dots$ on the first line) for which the inequality holds ?","['probability-distributions', 'probability', 'real-analysis']"

4487261,"Finding a dominant root $\alpha$ for a semisimple, irreducible Lie-algebra $\mathfrak{g}$.","I´m working myself right now through this article and have trouble understanding a part of the proof of Proposition 6.4, case II) on page 345-346. I try to give a short outline of the situation: Suppose $V$ is an irreducible $\mathfrak{g}$ module, with highest weight $\lambda$ . And $\mathfrak{g}$ being a semisimple Lie-algebra, with a subalgebra $\mathfrak{s} \simeq \mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ . Also let $V$ be a complex vector space [Edit] that as an $\mathfrak{s}$ -module is the direct sum $V=V(1)\oplus V_0$ , where $V(1)$ is the usual 2-dimensional (irreducible) representation of $\mathfrak{s}$ , and $V_0$ is a direct sum of trivial 1-dimensional representations of $\mathfrak{s}$ [/Edit, JL]. Then the statement i want to verify goes as follows: Then there exists a dominant root $\alpha$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ , s.th. $(\lambda, \alpha^{\lor})=1, (w_0 \lambda, \alpha^{\lor})=-1, (\mu, \alpha^{\lor})=0$ for all weights $\mu$ with $w_0 \lambda < \mu < \lambda$ . Here $w_0$ is the longest element in the Weyl group $\mathfrak{W}$ , and $<$ the usual ordering. My thoughts so far: By the theorem of the highest weight there exists a highest weight $\lambda$ satisfying $$2\frac{(\lambda, \alpha)}{(\alpha,\alpha)} \in \mathbb{Z},$$ which coincides with $(\lambda, \alpha^{\lor})$ , using the definition of the coroot of a semisimple Lie-algebra. Using the Properties of the longest element $w_0$ in the Weyl-group of a semisimple Lie-algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and concidering that $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})$ has root system $A_{n-1}$ , $w_0$ satisfies $w_0\lambda = - \lambda$ . So in particular we have $$(w_0 \lambda, \alpha^{\lor}) = - (\lambda, \alpha^{\lor}).$$ The trivial representation of $\mathfrak{s}$ has a single weight, $0$ . Let $V(1)=\mathbb{C}^2$ be the standard representation. Write $e_1,e_2$ for the standard basis. Note that $$H=\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0\\
0 & -1\\
\end{pmatrix}.$$ Then $He_1 = e_1$ and $He_2 = -e_2$ . Thus the set of weights of $V(1)$ is $\{\pm1\}$ .","['lie-algebras', 'representation-theory', 'root-systems', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

4487279,Getting Prime by Changing 2 Digits,"I just got a result that one cannot get a prime from arbitrary natural number $n$ by changing only one digit of its decimal expansion. For example, you cannot get prime by changing only one digit of $200$ since you need to change the last digit. Another proof is one can use prime number theorem by assuming we can change only one digit of $10k, k\in \mathbb{N}$ to get prime, but this means \begin{align*}
\pi(x)\geq \sum_{k\leq x/10}1\geq \lfloor x/10 \rfloor

4487288,"If every closed curve on a surface has zero total torsion, then the surface is totally umbilic","Let $\Sigma$ be an oriented, simply connected surface in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ , let $\xi$ be its unit normal, and let $\alpha$ be a a smooth curve in $\Sigma$ . In this paper , the authors prove that, if every closed curve $\alpha$ has vanishing total torsion, i.e., if $$
\int_{\alpha} \tau = 0 \quad \text{for all closed curves $\alpha$},
$$ then $\Sigma$ is totally umbilic. (In fact, they prove a stronger statement by considering a Riemannian ambient space.) I am having a hard time understanding a step in their proof of Lemma 2, which establishes the said result. After proving that the integral of the geodesic torsion $\tau_{g}$ over any closed curve $\alpha$ vanishes, they claim that continuity forces the geodesic torsion to vanish identically ; see text after equation (26) in the picture below. I am not sure why continuity is invoked here. I agree that, if $\nabla_{X}\xi$ and $X$ are not parallel at $p$ , then they remain not parallel in a neighborhood of $p$ , but how can one then conclude that every closed curve around $p$ has $\tau_{g} =0$ ?","['submanifold', 'riemannian-geometry', 'proof-explanation', 'curves', 'differential-geometry']"

I have correctly derived the streamlines from $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{v}{u}$$ at $t=2$ giving $$y=\frac{C}{0.8(0.5+0.8x)}+1.875$$ in agreement with the text. Using a Runge-Kutta numerical integration method I approximated the pathlines from $0<t<2$ s using these equations. $$u=\frac{dx}{dt}=0.5+0.8x$$ $$v=\frac{dy}{dt}=1.5+2.5\sin(\omega t)-0.8y$$ Plotting the equations agrees with the figure in the text. My results are on the left red: starting from $(0.5,0.5)$ blue: starting from $(0.5,2.5)$ green: starting from $(0.5,4.5)$ and the light pink curves in the right figure are from the text. These questions ( here , and here ) deal with methods to find the streaklines . This link , however, has been the most helpful in understanding how to derive the necessary equations. But my results do not agree with the text. The text defines the method for plotting the streaklines this way. Finally, the streaklines are simulated by following the paths of many fluid tracer particles released at the given three locations at times between $t=0$ s and $t=2$ s, and connecting the locus of their positions at $t=2$ s. I want to try and avoid solving the ODEs by hand since $y(t)$ will involve an integrating factor, but more importantly, to arrive at equations for $x=x(x',t,t')$ and $y=y(y',t,t')$ without going through lots of error-prone algebra. From the third link above $(x',y')$ are the future positions of the particle at time $t'$ and $t$ is the current time. To close out the question, I am looking for a way to use my approximate values for the pathlines to plot my streaklines from $0<t<2$ s. EDIT: It has just occurred to me that in the first of the previous links, an ODE that defines a streakline is mentioned. The ODE is from Wikipedia and is given here. $$\left\{\begin{matrix}
\frac{d\vec{x}_{str}}{dt}=\vec{u}_P(\vec{x}_{str},t) \\
\vec{x}_{str}(t=\tau_P)=\vec{x}_{P0}

The parameter $\tau_P$ , parameterizes the streakline $\vec{x}_{str}(t,\tau_P)$ and $t_0\le\tau_P\le t$ , where $t$ is a time of interest. The second link from above describes this parameterization, but I am struggling to understand how to work it out in general, not just for this velocity field. But if I can make that work then the ODE should be able to be solved numerically with a similar Runge-Kutta method. However, this link suggests that there are errors in the Wikipedia article. The parameterized ODEs from $0<\tau<t$ should be the following. $$\frac{dx_\tau}{d\theta}=0.5+0.8x_\tau(\theta)$$ $$\frac{dy_\tau}{d\theta}=1.5+2.5\sin\left(\omega(\tau+\theta)\right)-0.8y_\tau(\theta)$$ Getting some help setting up the numerical integration is where I'm stuck.

What I do is to count the number of samples that have been assigned to each class, and depending on this establishing a threshold, k, where an individual will be classified as Class 1 if the number of samples classified as Class 1 exceeds that threshold. My problem is that I don't have much knowledge of formal mathematical writing, and I would like to translate the above into mathematical notation. I have written the following but I don't know if it is correct. $$
Y=1, \sum_{i=0}^{n}\hat{y_{i}}\Leftrightarrow \hat{y_{i}}=1 > k\sum_{i=0}^{n}\hat{y_{i}}

For example, we know that there are many methods in mathematics that can be used for function approximation - for instance, Taylor Polynomials, Lagrange Polynomials, Padé Polynomials, etc. As in the case of Machine Learning algorithms, can any claims similar to those asserted by the ""No Free Lunch Theorems"" be made regarding different methods of Polynomial Approximations? For example - is it possible that Taylor Polynomials might ""better"" approximate some functions compared to Padé Polynomials; but by virtue of this fact, there also might exist some other functions that Padé Polynomials approximate better than Taylor Polynomials? Or are have we been able to mathematically determine that some approximation methods are ""universally better"" than other approximation methods for broad classes of functions? Thank you! Note: I suppose that in this context, ""better"" can be quantified through properties such as ""strength of convergence"", ""size of the radius of convergence"" or properties of the ""bounded error"" (e.g. magnitude) - but I am not sure about this.","['approximation', 'machine-learning', 'functions', 'taylor-expansion', 'polynomials']"
4487531,Why isn't the dimension of the space of curvature-like tensors equal to the dimension of the Grassmannian?,"It's a well known fact that if $V$ is a vector space of dimension $n$ , then the vector space consisting of all curvature-like tensors ( see this text for a precise definition and a proof ) has dimension $\frac{n^2(n^2-1)}{12}$ . It's also well known that any curvature-like tensor $R$ is determined by its sectional curvatures (i.e, the values $R(x, y, x, y)$ with $x, y$ going through all of $V$ ). The sectional curvature can be thought of as a function $K: \mathrm{Gr}_2(V) \to \mathbb{R}$ . In my mind these two separate facts appear to be in contradiction: if the sectional curvatures determine $R$ , shouldn't the vector space consisting of all curvature-like tensors have the same dimension as $\mathrm{Gr}_2(V)$ (which has dimension $2(n-2)$ )?

4487618,"""Pushforward"" of de Rham cohomology along ""normal"" surjective local diffeomorphisms?","Notation: for $X$ a smooth manifold, let $T^n(X)$ denote the space of (global, smooth) covariant rank- $n$ tensors on $X$ , i.e. sections of $(T^*X)^{\otimes n}$ . Let $X\xrightarrow{Q}Y$ be a smooth, surjective, local diffeomorphism between smooth manifolds. Let us also assume $Q$ is ""normal"" in that its group of deck transformations acts transitively on each fiber. We say $s \in T^n(X)$ is "" $Q$ -invariant"" if $s$ is invariant under all deck transformations of $Q$ . Denote by $\text{inv}_{Q}T^n(X)$ the space of $Q$ -invariant covariant rank- $n$ tensors on $X$ . Then we claim for each integer $n\geq 0$ there is a unique homomorphism $Q^n_! : \text{inv}_{Q}T^n(X) \rightarrow T^n(Y)$ , such that for every open $U\subset X$ , if $Q|_U$ is a diffeomorphism onto $Q(U)$ with inverse $P : Q(U)\xrightarrow{\approx} U$ , then for any $\omega \in \text{inv}_{Q}T^n(X)$ we have $$
(Q_! \omega)|_{Q(U)} = P^*(\omega|_U)
$$ Furthermore: For $\omega \in T^n(Y)$ we have $Q^*\omega$ is $Q$ -invariant, and we should have $Q_!Q^*\omega = \omega$ . $Q^n_!$ preserves symmetric and antisymmetric tensors, thus also restricting to maps $\text{inv}_{Q}\mathrm{Sym}^n(X)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sym}^n(Y)$ and $\text{inv}_{Q}\Omega^n(X)\rightarrow \Omega^n(Y)$ . $Q^2_!$ should preserve signatures; therefore, $Q^2_!$ of a $Q$ -inv Riemannian metric (or pseudo-Riemannian of some signature) is another Riemannian (or pseudo-Riemannian of same signature) metric. For $\omega \in \text{inv}_{Q}\Omega^n(X)$ we have $d\omega \in \text{inv}_{Q}\Omega^{n+1}(X)$ and $Q^{n+1}_!(d\omega) = d(Q_!^n \omega)$ . So also, $Q_!$ gives a chain complex morphism $\text{inv}_{Q}\Omega^\bullet(X)\rightarrow \Omega^\bullet(Y)$ . Also, by the 1st bullet point, if $Q_!\omega$ is exact (on $Y$ ) then $\omega$ is exact (on $X$ ). It should follow that $Q^n_!$ induces injective maps $H^n_{\mathrm{dR}}(X)\rightarrow H^n_{\mathrm{dR}}(Y)$ , provided every de Rham class on $X$ has a $Q$ -invariant representative. My 1st question is whether the above is valid and makes sense? My 2nd question is whether the last condition above is satisfied, and how to show this?
I.e., for every closed $n$ -form $\omega$ on $X$ , is there an $Q$ -invariant (i.e. invariant under deck transformations of $Q$ ) closed $n$ -form $\omega'$ on $X$ , which is cohomologous with $\omega$ (i.e. their difference is exact)? Or (more weakly?) can we show the inclusion of the $Q$ -invariant de Rham complex into $X$ 's full de Rham complex is a quasi-isomorphism (induces isomorphisms on all cohomology groups)? Update : Here is my thinking thus far on the 2nd question: Let us further assume: that the group $G$ of deck transformations is a topological group, acting continuously on $X$ , and it admits a Haar measure $\mu$ with finite total volume; and that each $g \in G$ induces the identity (not just an isomorphism) on the de Rham cohomology of $X$ . Then, given a closed $\omega \in \Omega^n_{\text{closed}}(X)$ , we would like to define a form via an integral of a $G$ -dependent form over $G$ , $$
\omega' = \frac{1}{|G|}\int_{g\in G} (g^*\omega)\,d\mu(g) \,,
$$ which we expect to be $G$ -invariant by the usual arguments.
Here $|G| = \mu(G)$ is the finite volume of $G$ .
Furthermore, since for each $g\in G$ we know $g^*$ induces the identity on $H^n_{\mathrm{dR}}(X)$ it follows that $\omega$ is cohomologous with $g^*\omega$ , so also $\omega = \frac{1}{|G|}\int_{g\in G}\omega\,d\mu(g)$ is cohomologous with $\omega' = \frac{1}{|G|}\int_{g\in G} (g^*\omega)\,d\mu(g)$ . Would this be valid? Are the above assumptions necessary? The 2nd assumption bothers me, since e.g. this is not satisfied by $S^2 \xrightarrow{\text{mod $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$}} \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^2$ .","['solution-verification', 'de-rham-cohomology', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

I wrote a program that computes the actual values of the averages by simulating all the possible rolls for 20-sided dice (up to 8 dice because it takes too much more time after that). The values I get from my program are also very similar to Matt's values when he simulates the rolls, but those values differ by a greater value at every increase of $m$ . $m$ Matt's formula result Computed result Difference 1 10.500 10.500 0 2 13.833 13.825 0.008 3 15.500 15.487 0.013 4 16.500 16.483 0.017 5 17.166 17.145 0.021 6 17.642 17.617 0.025 7 18.000 17.970 0.030 8 18.277 18.244 0.033 Furthermore, if we take much higher values like $m=99$ , we get an average of $20.3$ , which is absurd because the average is then higher than the maximum rollable value.

4488118,Polyhedron with only π/4 dihedral angles,"I have a puzzle to construct a polyhedron where the measure of every dihedral angle is $\frac\pi4$ radians or prove that none can exist.  The polyhedron may self-intersect however it must be finite, bounded, and dyadic as well as have planar faces. Here's a quick glossary of terms as I use them: Polyhedron: A polytope in Euclidean 3-space. Finite:  There are only a finite number of elements in the polyhedron. Bounded: There exists a sphere of finite radius which encloses every vertex of the polyhedron. Dyadic : Each edge is incident on exactly two faces. Planar faces: For every face all vertices of that face lie on some plane. These are all pretty standard when talking about polyhedra. As an example, if we were to imagine a 2-dimensional version of this problem, a regular octagram ( Schläfli symbol $\{8/3\}$ ) would be a solution.  A square bowtie would be another solution ( illustration ). Both are polygons with all interior angles measuring $\frac\pi4$ radians. Of course a polyhedron is tougher since there is more freedom to arrange things in 3 space.","['polyhedra', 'geometry']"
4488150,Do these functional equations imply linearity?,"$f:[0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]$ is a strictly decreasing function (i.e. $f(x+\delta)<f(x)\;\forall\;x \in[0,1), \delta>0$ ), such that $f^{-1}=f$ . Further, $f(x)+f(1-x)=1\;\forall\;x\in[0,1]$ . Edit: I earlier said ""There is no requirement of continuity"". However, while there is no explicit continuity requirement, I think these properties imply continuity as pointed out in the comments. Does this imply $f$ must be linear? My approach: I drew the pictures. Due to $f^{-1}=f$ , $f$ must look the same when we rotate the page by $90^{o}$ so that the y-axis becomes the x-axis. By strict decreasingness, it must be strictly above $1/2$ for $x<1/2$ , equal to $1/2$ for $x=1/2$ (by $f(x)+f(1-x)=1$ ) and strictly below $1/2$ for $x>1/2$ . In addition, due to $f(x)+f(1-x)=1$ , when you reflect it around the $y=1/2$ line and then the $x=1/2$ line, you get back the same function. To me it seems this means $f$ in $[1/2,1]$ is a replica of $f$ in $[0,1/2]$ except ""dragged down"", I think by $1/2$ but I'm not sure. i.e. $f(x)=f(x-1/2)-1/2$ for $x>1/2$ , but I'm not sure. To me it seems  the replica property combined with the rotational symmetry property described above, indicates that this can't hold unless $f$ is linear. Obviously, the above is vague, and I'm not even sure it goes loosely in the right direction. Any help is most appreciated.","['symmetry', 'functions', 'graphing-functions']"

The new user who posted and subsequently deleted their question suggested taking a rectangular contour, limiting in $R\to\infty$ on the rectangle with base $-R\to R$ , of height $i\pi$ , and with a semicircular inward indent around the point $i\pi$ , say of radius $\varepsilon$ . The integrand $f(z)=\frac{\sin^2z}{\sinh^2z}$ is holomorphic on the boundary and interior of this contour, so the integrals over all paths sum to zero. Moreover the small strips $R\to R+i\pi,-R\to-R+i\pi$ obviously vanish. We have: $$\begin{align}\sin(x+i\pi)&=\sin(x)\cosh(\pi)+i\sinh(\pi)\cos(x)\\\sin^2(x+i\pi)&=\sin^2(x)\cosh^2(\pi)-\cos^2(x)\sinh^2(\pi)+2i\sin(x)\cos(x)\sinh(\pi)\cosh(\pi)\\&=\sin^2(x)(1+2\sinh^2(\pi))-\sinh^2(\pi)+2i\sin(x)\cos(x)\sinh(\pi)\cosh(\pi)\end{align}$$ For asymptotically large $R$ , asymptotically small $\varepsilon\gt0$ we then need to use: $$0=o(1)+I-\int_{[-R,-\varepsilon]\cup[\varepsilon,R]}\frac{\sin^2(x)(1+2\sinh^2(\pi))-\sinh^2(\pi)}{\sinh^2(x)}\d x+i\varepsilon\int_{-\pi}^0\frac{\sin^2(i\pi+\varepsilon e^{it})}{\sinh^2(\varepsilon e^{it})}e^{it}\d t\\\overset{R\to\infty}{\longrightarrow}-2\sinh^2(\pi)\cdot I+\\\lim_{\varepsilon\to0^+}\left[2\sinh^2(\pi)(1-\coth(\varepsilon))+i\varepsilon\int_{0}^\pi\frac{\sin^2(i\pi-\varepsilon e^{it})}{\sinh^2(\varepsilon e^{it})}e^{it}\d t\right]$$ The original asker claimed that it is possible to use this method to calculate the final answer (they didn't go as far, but it was implied). Taking this on good faith, I will assume this works - but I am very uncertain how to do this. The limit of the semicircular integral is, well, nasty - I'd appreciate help with the asymptotics here. I am fairly certain my calculations thus far are correct, but I unfortunately do not own a copy of Mathematica or equivalent to help me here. It is my (purely intuitive) suspicion that the limit does not exist, but this is weird since the limit must exist, as all the other limits do and the total limit of zero obviously exists. To present a concrete target - to get the correct evaluation, we need to show that: $$\begin{align}2\sinh^2(\pi)(I-1)&=\pi\sinh(\pi)\cosh(\pi)-3\sinh^2(\pi)\\&\overset{?}{=}\lim_{\varepsilon\to0^+}\left[i\varepsilon\int_0^\pi\frac{\sin^2(i\pi-\varepsilon e^{it})}{\sinh^2(\varepsilon e^{it})}\d t-2\sinh^2(\pi)\coth(\varepsilon)\right]\end{align}$$","['complex-analysis', 'contour-integration', 'asymptotics']"

The argument I was think of is that given a particular $x$ in $Q$ if a step function converges to it then for an irrational point ""near enough"" $x$ it shouldn't; however, since pointwise convergence depends on the point x (i.e. finding N depends on x) and the sequence of step functions isn't necessarily increasing, I got stuck in attempting to prove it.

The Müntz–Szász theorem gives that $$ \sum_{n\in E}\frac{1}{n} = +\infty \Longleftrightarrow f(x)\equiv 0 $$ so there is a non-zero continuous function $f(x)$ such that $$ \int_{0}^{1} f(x) x^{n^2}\,dx = 0 \tag{1}$$ holds for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ . Question : can we construct a nice, explicit function $f\neq 0$ fulfilling $(1)$ for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ ? We may consider functions of the form $$ f(x) = \sum_{n\geq 0} c_n P_n(2x-1) $$ with $P_n(2x-1)$ being the $n$ -th shifted Legendre polynomial. The orthogonality to $1$ and $x$ translates into $c_0=c_1=0$ , the orthogonality to $x^4$ translates into $\frac{2}{35}c_2+\frac{1}{70}c_3+\frac{1}{630}c_4=0$ , the orthogonality to $x^9$ translates into $\frac{3}{55}c_2+\frac{21}{715}c_3+ \frac{9}{715}c_4 +\frac{3}{715}c_5+\frac{3}{2860}c_6+\frac{9}{48620}c_7+\frac{1}{48620}c_8+\frac{1}{923780}c_9=0$ and so on. The minimal (with respect to the $\ell^2$ norm) solution of this infinite system with $c_2=1$ (or $c_4=1$ ) should give a sequence $\{c_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ ensuring the continuity of $f(x)$ , but this is non-trivial and I would appreciate a more explicit construction / example of such $f$ . Addendum : another possible construction is to apply the Gram-Schmidt process to $\{1,x,x^4,x^9,\ldots\}$ in order to get a sequence of polynomials $\{p_n(x)\}_{n\geq 0}$ such that $p_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k x^{k^2}$ $n\neq m \Longrightarrow \langle p_n(x),p_m(x)\rangle = 0$ $\max_{x\in [0,1]} |p_n(x)| = 1$ or $\langle p_n(x),p_n(x)\rangle = 1$ then take $f(x)$ as the pointwise limit of a convergent subsequence of $\{p_n(x)\}_{n\geq 0}$ . Still, not really explicit. A more promising approach is to consider some lacunary Fourier series, like $$ g(\theta) = \sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{\cos(n\theta)}{n^2} - \sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{\cos(n^2\theta)}{n^4}, $$ which clearly fulfills $\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}g(\theta)\cos(n^2\theta)\,d\theta = 0$ , then turn such $g(\theta)$ into an $f(x)$ fulfilling $(1)$ via some slick substitution. Yet another way is to consider the inverse Laplace transform of $$ \frac{1}{s}\prod_{k=0}^{n}\frac{k^2+1-s}{k^2+1+s} $$ evaluated at $-\log x$ . This gives a polynomial, bounded between $-1$ and $1$ , which is orthogonal to $1,x,x^4,\ldots,x^{n^2}$ . Is this sequence of polynomials (or a subsequence of this sequence) convergent to a continuous function? I do not know. If so, $$ f(x)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin(\pi\sqrt{s-1})}{\sqrt{s-1}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{s+1}}{\sin(\pi\sqrt{s+1})}\cdot \frac{1}{s}\right)(-\log x)$$ is an explicit solution.

For any two sets $X$ and $Y$ recall that $Y^X$ is the set of functions from $X$ to $Y$ . If $G$ acts on $X$ , we claim that $$g \cdot f(x) = f(g^{-1} \cdot x)$$ defines a group action of $G$ on $Y^X$ Now in proving the second property (the non-identity one) from the function definition of a group action we see that for $g,h \in G$ and $f \in Y^X$ $$\begin{align}
g \cdot (h \cdot f)(x) &= h \cdot f(g^{-1} \cdot x) \\

But someone has cut out squares of one of diagonals.,"I was thinking about asking this is chat because I thought that my concern is not serious enough, but it became too long so here I am. I hope that the question is clear: you just can't place rooks on squares with coordinates $(1, 1), 2, 2)$ and so on. I will call these squares forbidden. For small board sizes the answer is:
2x2 - 1,
3x3 - 2,
4x4 - 9 (if I haven't made a mistake which I'm not so sure about). This problem is harder than it felt at the first glance. What makes it harder is the fact that after placing a rook on the 1st line and figuring out ways for all the lower lines, these lower lines are not equal: one of them already has forbidden square on a column on which you placed the 1st line rook, so nothing is changed for this line, but for other lines you have lessen the number of vacant places by one. To make it more clear, think of coordinates as index of a matrix element, and say: forbidden squares are $(1, 1), (2, 2), \ldots$ , you place a rook on square $(1, 2)$ , and thus squares $(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), \ldots$ are now closed, but $(2, 2)$ was already closed before that, so nothing changed. My question is: can you evaluate ""offhand"" if it would be hard to solve on a computer? By solving I mean continue the sequence $1, 2, 9, \ldots$ for increasing chessboard size. And secondly: is such a programm really would be easier to write on python than c/c++? To me it seems like an easy thing for a computer to calculate, but what if I'm missing something. I'm not even asking to solve this problem, but if you want then I don't mind. If you want to do it on a computer than I also would be very glad. But maybe this question is already known or explained in some book? I don't know because I came up with this problem myself, but I don't consider myself an expert in combinatorics, so maybe I just don't know something. It seems obvious that for any $n$ and arbitrary set of cut squares there can't be any algorythm. In any case, thank you a lot. Add:
After posting I realised why it seems easy to caltulate on a machine. In a ""worst case scenario"" you could just place $n$ rooks on a special board in any way possible and than add $+1$ if no one of them are hitting each other. Of course it would take a huge amount of time, but it should work. For regular board it would be $8\cdot7 = 56$ squares, $C_{56}^8$ seems like impossible number, but you could hugely decrease it by placing only one rook on a line.

A regular curve $\alpha: I \to \mathbb R^3$ is a helix if there is a unit vector $v$ that forms a constant angle with $\alpha'(t), \forall t \in I$ . We can assume $\alpha$ parameterized by arc length. If $\alpha$ is a helix, then there is a unit vector $v$ such that $\langle \alpha'(s), v \rangle$ is constant. So $\langle \alpha''(s),v \rangle = 0$ , that is $k(s)\langle n(s), v
 \rangle = 0$ . As $k(s) \ne 0$ , it follows that $v$ belongs to the plan determined by $t(s)$ and $b(s)$ , for each $s \in I $ . So be $$ v= \cos\theta(s)\,t(s) + \sin\theta(s)\,b(s)$$ Differentiating and using Frenet's formulas, we get $$0 = -\sin\theta(s)\theta'(s)t(s) + (k(s)\cos\theta(s)+\tau(s)\sin\theta(s))n(s) + \cos\theta(s)\theta'(s)b(s)$$ Therefore, $\forall s \in I$ , $$\sin\theta(s)\theta'(s) = 0,$$ $$\cos\theta(s)\theta'(s) = 0,$$ $$k(s)\cos\theta(s) + \tau(s) \sin\theta(s) = 0$$ The first two equations determine $\theta'(s) = 0, \forall \in I$ . Therefore, $\theta(s)$ is constant. Also, the constant $\cos\theta$ is non-zero, otherwise we would have $\tau(s)=0$ , which contradicts the hypothesis. It follows from the third equality that $\frac{k}{\tau}$ is constant. Conversely, if $\frac{k}{\tau}$ is constant, we set $\theta$ such that $tg\theta = -\frac{k}{\tau}$ . So $$v=cos\theta t(s) + sin \theta b(s)$$ is a constant unit vector and $\forall s \in, \langle t(s), v \rangle = cos\theta $ is constant. So $\alpha$ is helix.

then $H= \langle d \rangle$ , where $d=\gcd(a_1, a_2, ...,a_k)$ And I try to prove it in the following way (both finite and infinite case): Because $H$ is Abelian, we can write $H=\{m_1 a_1+...+m_k a_k~|~m_1\in \mathbb{Z},...,m_k\in \mathbb{Z} \}$ (1) For any $x\in H$ , $x=m_1 a_1+...+m_k a_k$ for some $m_1\in \mathbb{Z},...,m_k\in \mathbb{Z}$ , Since $d=\gcd(a_1, a_2, ...,a_k)$ , which means $d|a_1,...,d|a_k$ , so $a_1=r_1 d, ...,a_k=r_kd$ , where $r_1\in \mathbb{Z},...,r_k\in \mathbb{Z}$ $x=m_1r_1d+...+m_kr_kd=(m_1r_1+...+m_kr_k)d$ , so, $x\in \langle d \rangle$ , Therefore, $H\subseteq \langle d \rangle$ (2) For any $x\in \langle d \rangle$ , $x=rd$ , where $r\in \mathbb{Z}$ , Because $d=\gcd(a_1, a_2, ...,a_k)$ , there exists $r_1\in \mathbb{Z},...,r_k\in \mathbb{Z}$ , such that $r_1a_1+...+r_ka_k=d$ ( Bézout's identity ) so we have: $x=r(r_1a_1+...+r_ka_k)=(rr_1)a_1+...+(rr_k)a_k$ , so, $x\in H$ Therefore, $\langle d \rangle \subseteq H$ By (1) and (2), we have $H=\langle d \rangle$ .

4488484,What's wrong with this 'proof' that probability of being $2$ m away is $1/9$?,"Suppose there is a chicken (which we will assume to simply be a point), which is encolsed in a circular barn of radius $6$ m. At the centre of the barn, there is a well, (which we will also assume to simply be a point). If the chicken was equally likely to be at any point within the barn, what is the probability that the chicken is exactly $2$ m away from the well? I know it should be zero , since this is a continuous distribution. However, I was wondering, what goes wrong in the following reasoning to obtain an answer which isn't zero. The only way for the chicken to be exactly $2$ m away from the well, is if it were confined to a concentric circle of radius $2$ m at the well. The length of the circumference can then be thought of as all the possible points the chicken could be at in order to be $2$ m away from the well, so that's $2\pi r' = 2\pi(2) = 4\pi$ . All the possible points in the barn is simply the area, so that's $\pi r^2 = \pi(6^2) = 36\pi$ . Hence, if we let $X$ be the random variable of how far the chicken is away from the well, then $$ \mathbb{P}(X = 2) = \dfrac{4\pi}{36\pi} = \dfrac{1}{9}. $$ So to be extra clear: Question: What goes wrong in the reasoning above?

4488767,"$f$ integrable on $[a,b]$, differentiable at $c\in (a,b)$. $F(x)=\int_a^x f$. Out of the three ways $F'$ can be discont. at $c$, which are possible?","Assume a function $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ , differentiable at a point $c\in (a,b),$ and define $$F(x)=\int_a^x f$$ Let's investigate the theoretical conditions under which $F'$ could be discontinuous at $c$ . Since $f$ is differentiable at $c$ , this implies $f$ is continuous at $c$ . By the first fundamental theorem of calculus (FTC1) applied to $f$ on $[a,b]$ , we have that $F$ is differentiable at $c \in (a,b)$ and $F'(c)=f(c)$ . Let's recall the definition of continuity Spivak, Ch. 6, Definition: A function $f$ is continuous at $c$ if $$\lim\limits_{x\to c} f(x)=f(c)\tag{1}$$ What are the ways a function can be discontinuous at a point $c$ ? $f$ isn't defined at $c$ , hence $f(c)$ isn't defined and so $(1)$ doesn't make sense and is false $\lim\limits_{x\to c} f(x)$ does not exist, so again $(1)$ doesn't make sense and is false $f$ is defined at $c$ and the limit above does exist but it differs from $f(c)$ . Which of the above scenarios is possible in our setup of $f$ and $F$ , for $F'$ to be discontinuous at $c$ ? Here is what I came up with In the case of our function $F$ , it is differentiable wherever $f$ is continuous. If $f$ were to be continuous in an interval around $c$ , then $F$ would be differentiable and hence continuous on that interval, including at $c$ . Therefore, $f$ has to be discontinuous on every interval containing $c$ . We've established that $F'(c)=f(c)$ so $F'$ is defined at $c$ and hence option 1. above is not possible. If 3. were true, then we'd have $$\lim\limits_{x\to c} F'(x)\neq F'(c)=f(c)\tag{2}$$ Here is a line of reasoning I am unsure about Since the limit above exists, then $F'$ is defined everywhere around $c$ . Is this true? Ie, when we defined a limit $$\lim\limits_{x\to c} f(x)$$ as $$\forall \epsilon>0\ \exists \delta>0\ \forall x, |x-c|<\delta\implies |f(x)-f(c)|<\epsilon$$ Did the $\forall x$ mean literally for every single real number within $\delta$ of $c$ , or just the $x$ where $f$ is defined? if the above is indeed true, then we have the following happening (i) $F'$ defined in an interval containing $c$ (ii) since $f$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ , $F$ continuous on $[a,b]$ , and in particular at $c$ (iii) $\lim\limits_{x\to c} F'$ exists I believe the following theorem is thus applicable Spivak, Ch. 11, Theorem 7: Suppose $F$ is continuous at $c$ , $F'(x)$ exists for all $x$ in some interval containing $c$ , except possibly at $x=c$ . Suppose, moreover, that $\lim\limits_{x\to c} F'(x)$ exists. Then, $F'(c)$ exists and $F'(c)=\lim\limits_{x\to c} F'(x)$ This theorem basically says that if a function is continuous at a point, then its derivative cannot have a jump discontinuity there. Applying to $F$ , we conclude that $F'(c)=\lim\limits_{x\to c} F'(x)$ , which contradicts $(2)$ , and hence scenario 3. isn't possible. Which leaves only scenario 2., which is possible by virtue of the fact that I can come up with an example for it: $$f(x)=\begin{cases} 0, \text{ if } x \in \left (\frac{1}{n+1},\frac{1}{n} \right ] \\ x^2, \text{ if } x \in \left (\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n-1} \right ] \end{cases}$$ for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ . Edit For the record I thought I'd mention this is a problem from Spivak's Calculus and there is a (terse solution) that isn't very didactical. Here it is If we assume that $f$ is continuous in an interval around $c$ , then $F'$ will be continuous at $c$ , since we will have $F'(x)=f(x)$ in
this interval, and differentiability of $f$ at $c$ implies continuity
of $f$ at $c$ . But without this assumption $F'$ may not even be exist
at all points near $c$ . For example, $f$ could be the function shown

Each of the 13 lines consists of four points. A possible listing would be A23T, 456T, 789T,  A47J, 258J, 369J, A59Q, 267Q, 348Q, A68K, 249K, 357K, and TJQK. I note that 13 lines with 4 points to a line suggests using playing cards, explaining my notation, and indeed I got out a set of playing cards and dealt them out into a 4x13 rectangle that represents PP3. But playing cards have suits too, and I rearranged the cards so that each line contains one card from each suit. The resulting arrangement seemed haphazard, so I tried it with the Fano plane, using 3 suits and 7 lines. I found that the 124, 235, 346, 457, 561, 612, 723 arrangement (1 = Ace) can be obtained by adding 1 mod 7 to each card in a line to get the next line. In that case, then let each first element of the line be a heart, each second a diamond, and each third a spade.  I tried doing this with PP3 and it didn’t seem to work. Is there such an arrangement for PP3, where the points represent elements of $\mathbb{Z}_{13}$ ? Is there an orderly way of assigning suits to the cards?

4488949,"An undirected graph is partitioned. For every partition $V_1 \cup V_2 = V$, $v_1 \in V_1$ is connected to some $v_2 \in V_2$. Show it is connected.","We have an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ partitioned into two non-empty subsets $V_1 \cup V_2 = V$ . For this graph it holds that $(V_1 \cup V_2 = V) \implies (\exists v_1, v_2 : v_1 \in V_1 \land v_2 \in V_2 \land (v_1,v_2) \in E)$ . So for every partition some $v_1 \in V_1$ is connected to some $v_2 \in V_2$ . We need to show $G$ is connected, i.e.: to show that there is a path between any two elements in the graph. This problem came from a problem set in a course on discrete mathematics. I solved the problem in two ways. One being by contradiction. Namely by assuming that the graph is not connected, then there exists a partition $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ such that no edge $(v_{1}, v_{2})$ exists with $v_{1} \in V_{1}$ and $v_{2} \in V_{2}$ which means the assumption that the graph is not connected is false. And so the graph must be connected. The other approach I came up with is based on induction and I would like to put this approach up to scrutiny. In this approach I incorporate the definition that for all partitions there is a $v_1 \in V_1$ and $v_2 \in V_2$ with $(v_1, v_2) \in E$ in an induction hypothesis. The induction hypothesis (IH) $P(n)$ being that ""for any partition $V_1$ with $n$ elements these elements are part of an induced (sub)graph $G[V_1]$ which is connected and there exists a $v_1 \in V_1$ and $v_2 \in V_2$ with $(v_1, v_2) \in E$ "". $G[V_x]$ is the induced subgraph of $G$ with elements in $V_x$ . Since the partitions are defined to be non-empty the base case contains one element. Applying the induction hypothesis to the base case $P(1)$ one gets ""for any partition $V_1$ with 1 element this element is part of an induced (sub)graph $G[V_1]$ which is connected and there exists a $v_1 \in V_1$ and $v_2 \in V_2$ with $(v_1, v_2) \in E$ "", which is true since any graph of one element is trivially connected and furthermore by definition this element is connected to some element $v_2 \in V_2$ . So there exists no element which is not connected to some other element, i.e.: every element in $V$ is connected to some other element in $V$ . Since we have added $(v_1, v_2)$ to a connected $G[V_1]$ we get that $G[V_1 \cup v_2]$ is connected. By definition the induced subgraphs consisting of two elements in $V_1$ are connected to some element $v_2 \in V_2$ . And so $P(1) \implies P(2) $ . Generalising we get that $P(n) = $ ""for any partition $V_1$ with $n$ elements these elements are part of an induced (sub)graph $G[V_1]$ which is connected and there exists a $v_1 \in V_1$ and $v_2 \in V_2$ with $(v_1, v_2) \in E$ "", which implies that every induced subgraph $G[V_1 \cup v_2] = (V_1 \cup {v_2}, E_1 \cup (v_1, v_2))$ of $G$ with $n + 1$ elements is connected and furthermore by IH these subgraphs contain some element connected to some element in $G[V_2 \setminus v_2]$ . And so $P(n) \implies P(n + 1)$ . And now we have that $P(1)$ and $P(n) \implies P(n + 1)$ and so $P(n)$ holds for all $n \leq \#V - 1$ (since partitions are non-empty). To finish things off we consider $P(m - 1)$ with $m = \#V$ . We have shown that all induced subgraphs $(V_1, E_1)$ of $G$ of size $m - 1$ are connected and by IH there is some element in this subgraph connected to an element in $V \setminus V_1$ . There is only one element left and since this element is connected to a connected subgraph the graph $G$ is connected. I can't find anything wrong with this reasoning but I'm not certain it's correct either. If anyone can point out something wrong with this, or provide a better induction hypothesis or something of that nature it would be much appreciated :).","['graph-connectivity', 'discrete-mathematics', 'computer-science']"

4488980,Is there anything wrong with this proof that $\lim_{x\to0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$?,"Definitions Since I'm asking for verification of a proof, I'll start with some basic definitions. I believe these definitions are  more or less equivalent to the ""standard"" definitions of curve length, radian, and sine/cosine: Let the length of a continuous curve $f(t): [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ be defined as $\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^N \sqrt{(x(t_{i})-x(t_{i-1}))^2 + (y(t_{i})-y(t_{i-1}))^2}$ where $(x(t_{i}),y(t_{i}))=f(t_{i})$ and $t_{i} = a+i(b-a)/N$ . Let the angle measured by the counter-clockwise rotation of a point $P$ on a unit circle $C$ , such that the locus of $P$ generates a curve of length $\theta$ , be defined as $\theta$ radians. This angle measured by a clockwise rotation can be defined as $-\theta$ radians. Let the point on the Cartesian plane reached by rotating the point $(1,0)$ on the unit circle centered at $(0,0)$ by an angle of $\theta$ radians be defined as $(\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))$ . Detailed Proof Consider the curve $f(t) = (\cos(t), \sin(t))$ for $t \in [0,1]$ . On the one hand, this is just a circular arc that subtends 1 radian from the center of a unit circle, and must therefore have length 1, by the definition of a radian. On the other hand, we can compute the length of the curve by the definition of curve length, which means that: $$\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^N \sqrt{(\cos(i/N)-\cos((i-1)/N))^2 + (\sin(i/N)-\sin((i-1)/N))^2} = 1$$ Using basic trigonometric properties and algebra (see appendix for details), we can get: $$\lim_{N\to\infty}2N\sin(\frac{1}{2N}) = \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{\sin(\frac{1}{2N})}{\frac{1}{2N}} = 1$$ Since we can always choose an $x\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $0<x<\frac{1}{2N}$ , we have that: $$\lim_{x\to0^+}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$$ Now we just observe that $\sin(x)$ is an odd function since we rotate starting from the x-axis, and therefore a counter-rotation reflects the y-coordinate along the x-axis, so we have: $$\lim_{x\to0^-}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} = \lim_{x\to0^+}\frac{\sin(-x)}{-x} = \lim_{x\to0^+}\frac{-\sin(x)}{-x} = \lim_{x\to0^+}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$$ Therefore: $$\lim_{x\to0}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$$ QED Note, however, that to show that the length of the curve is $\lim_{N\to\infty}2N\sin(\frac{1}{2N})$ , we don't need to use trigonometric properties or algebra at all. Consider the following diagram where we break a circular arc of length 1 into N=3 parts: The summation in the definition of the curve length is just the sum of the lengths of the orange segments in the above diagram. Notice that all the orange segments are of equal length since all the triangles are congruent isosceles triangles with two side lengths of 1 joined at an angle of 1/N = 1/3 radians. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of all segments is 2N multiplied by half the length of a single segment. To find half the length of a single orange segment, we split the bottom triangle into two right triangles and rotate the bottom half like so: This shows that half the length of a segment is $\sin(1/6)$ for N=3 and $\sin(\frac{1}{2N})$ in general. Therefore, the general the sum of the lengths is $2N\sin(\frac{1}{2N})$ . TL;DR Proof If I was showing this as a basic proof, with the same level of rigor as I usually see the proof of $\lim_{x\to0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$ thrown around everywhere, it would be much more straightforward: Here's a diagram splitting an arc of length 1 into N equal parts: Observe that there are N parts each of length $2\sin(\frac{1}{2N})$ , so the total length is $2N\sin(\frac{1}{2N})$ . This implies that: $$\lim_{N\to\infty}2N\sin(\frac{1}{2N}) = \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{\sin(\frac{1}{2N})}{\frac{1}{2N}} = 1$$ Now let $x = \frac{1}{2N}$ and we get: $$\lim_{x\to0}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$$ QED Motivation Why do I bring up this proof? If it's valid, I honestly think this is a much better proof than the common proof that relies on the squeeze theorem and geometric areas demonstrating that $\frac{\sin(\theta)}{2}\leq\frac{\theta}{2}\leq\frac{\tan(\theta)}{2}$ . The common proof hides the fact that we ultimately need to find the limit of an infinite process. To do this, it relies on the area of a circular sector. Ironically, many common proofs that we are taught for the area of a circle, if expressed more rigorously, are actually relying on this very same limit. You can even see this in the above diagrams. If we split a sector of arc length $\theta$ into N triangles, each one has area $\frac{1}{2}\sin(\frac{\theta}{N})$ and therefore the total area is: $$\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{2}N\sin(\frac{\theta}{N}) = \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{2}\frac{\sin(\frac{\theta}{N})}{\frac{1}{N}} = \frac{1}{2}\lim_{x\to0}\frac{\sin(\theta x)}{x}$$ And it is precisely the proof shown here that can be trivially extended to show that: $$\lim_{x\to0}\frac{\sin(\theta x)}{x} = \theta$$ So in short, I believe the advantages of using the proof here, if valid, as the typical proof for demonstrating that $\lim_{x\to0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$ are: It avoids circular reasoning if we're relying on a modern notion of Archimedes' proof for the area of a circle. It avoids dealing with areas at all and instead directly deals with the ratio of two measures of length. It easily extends to a more general result, namely that $\lim_{x\to0} \frac{\sin(\theta x)}{x} = \theta$ . Appendix $$\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^N \sqrt{(\cos(i/N)-\cos((i-1)/N))^2 + (\sin(i/N)-\sin((i-1)/N))^2}$$ The above expression will contain $(\cos(i/N)^2 + \sin(i/N)^2)$ and $(\cos((i-1)/N)^2 + \sin((i-1)/N)^2)$ so once we simplify we will get the expression: $$\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^N \sqrt{2 - 2(\cos(i/N)\cos((i-1)/N) + \sin(i/N)\sin((i-1)/N))}$$ Since cosine is an even function and sine is an odd function, this is equivalent to: $$\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^N \sqrt{2 - 2(\cos(i/N)\cos((1-i)/N) - \sin(i/N)\sin((1-i)/N))}$$ Since $\cos(a+b) = \cos(a)\cos(b) - \sin(a)\sin(b)$ , we get the expression: $$\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^N \sqrt{2 - 2(\cos(i/N + (1-i)/N))} = \lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^N \sqrt{2 - 2\cos(1/N)}$$ Since $1 - \cos(\theta) = 2\sin^2(\theta / 2)$ , we get: $$\lim_{N\to\infty} N\sqrt{2*2\sin^2(\frac{1}{2N})}$$ And the final result: $$\lim_{N\to\infty} 2N\sin(\frac{1}{2N})$$","['limits-without-lhopital', 'geometry', 'alternative-proof', 'calculus', 'solution-verification']"

If $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb R$ is measurable and bounded, then $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_0^1 f(\{nx^k\})\,dx=\int_0^1f(x)\,dx.$$ Proof of Lemma 1. Firstly, $$\int_0^1 f(\{nx^k\})\,dx=\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\int_{\left(\frac mn\right)^{1/k}}^{\left(\frac {m+1}n\right)^{1/k}}f(nx^k-m)\,dx=\int_0^1\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\frac1{nk}f(t)\left(\frac{m+t}n\right)^{\frac1k-1}\,dt.$$ Let $$f_n(t)=\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\frac1{nk}f(t)\left(\frac{m+t}n\right)^{\frac1k-1},\qquad n\geq 1, t\in(0,1].$$ For fixed $t\in(0,1]$ , we have $$f_n(t)\to f(t)\int_0^1 \frac1k u^{\frac1k-1}\,du=f(t),\qquad \text{as }\ \ n\to\infty.$$ On the other hand, \begin{align*}
	|f_n(t)|&\leq |f(t)|\frac1{nk}\left(\frac tn\right)^{\frac1k-1}+|f(t)|\sum_{m=1}^{n-1}\frac1{nk}\left(\frac{m}n\right)^{\frac1k-1}\\
	&\leq |f(t)|\frac1{k}t^{\frac1k-1}+|f(t)|\frac1k\int_{1/n}^1\left(u-\frac1n\right)^{\frac1k-1}\,du\\
	&\leq \frac{\|f\|_{L^\infty}}{k}t^{\frac1k-1}+|f(t)|.
	\end{align*} Therefore, DCT implies that $\int_0^1 f_n(t)\,dt\to\int_0^1 f(t)\,dt$ , concluding the proof of Lemma 1. Lemma 2. If $f\in L^\infty(0,1)$ , and $0<\eta\ll1$ , then there exists a positive cosntant relying only on $k$ , $C(k)>0$ such that $$\int_{1-\eta}^1|f(\{nx^k\})|\,dx\leq \left(\eta+\frac{C(k)}{n}\right)\|f\|_{L^1}.$$ Proof of Lemma 2. Assume that $\left(\frac mn\right)^{1/k}\leq 1-\eta<\left(\frac {m+1}n\right)^{1/k}$ for some $m\geq \frac n2+1$ , then \begin{align*}
		\int_{1-\eta}^1|f(\{nx^k\})|\,dx&\leq \int_{\left(\frac mn\right)^{1/k}}^1|f(\{nx^k\})|\,dx\\
		&=\int_0^1|f(t)|\sum_{p=m}^{n-1}\frac1{nk}\left(\frac{p+t}n\right)^{\frac1k-1}\,dt\\
		&\leq \|f\|_{L^1}\sum_{p=m}^{n-1}\frac1{nk}\left(\frac{p}n\right)^{\frac1k-1}\\
		&\leq \|f\|_{L^1}\frac1k\int_{\frac mn}^1\left(u-\frac1n\right)^{\frac1k-1}\,du\\

	\end{align*} Let $\phi(s)=s^{1/k}$ for $s\in(0,1]$ , then \begin{align*}
		\phi\left(\frac mn+\frac1n\right)-\phi\left(\frac mn-\frac1n\right)&\leq \frac2n\max_{1/2\leq s\leq 1}|\phi'(s)|=\frac{2^{2-\frac1k}}{nk}\\
		&=\frac1{nk}+\frac{C(k)}{n}=\frac1n\min_{1/2\leq s\leq 1}|\phi'(s)|+\frac{C(k)}{n}\\
		&\leq \phi(1)-\phi\left(1-\frac1n\right)+\frac{C(k)}{n}.

	\end{align*} This completes the proof of Lemma 2. Proof of the main problem. We prove $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_0^1 f(\{nx^k\})g(x^n)\,dx=g(0)\int_0^1f(x)\,dx.\tag{1}$$ For each $\epsilon>0$ and $0<\eta\ll1$ , since $g$ is continuous at $x=0$ , we can find $\delta>0$ such that $|g(x)-g(0)|\leq \epsilon$ for all $x\in[0,\delta]$ . For $n$ large enough, we have $(1-\eta)^n<\epsilon$ and thus $$|g(x^n)-g(0)|\leq \epsilon,\qquad \forall x\in[0,1-\eta].$$ Therefore, for all large $n$ , we have \begin{align*}
		&\ \ \ \left|\int_0^1 f(\{nx^k\})g(x^n)\,dx-g(0)\int_0^1f(x)\,dx\right|\\
		&\leq\left|g(0)\int_0^1f(\{nx^k\})\,dx-g(0)\int_0^1f(x)\,dx\right|+\int_0^1|f(\{nx^k\})||g(x^n)-g(0)|\,dx\\

Written out explicitly, (1) is of the form $$x^4\frac{d^4 y}{dx^4}+6 x^3\frac{d^3y}{dx^3}+(5x^2-2x^4)\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-(x+6x^3)\frac{dy}{dx}+(x^2-1)^2y=0. \tag{2}$$ I am interested in the general solution to (1) which is bounded at $x=0$ . Since the solution that we are looking for is bounded at $x=0$ , we may write it as $$y(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n,$$ near the origin. Substituting the above solution into (2) and equating the coefficient of $x^n$ to be zero, we obtain the following recurrence relation $$ a_2=\frac{2}{9}a_0,\quad a_3=\frac{1}{8}a_1,\quad a_4=\frac{1}{75}a_0,\quad a_5=\frac{1}{192}{a_1},\quad a_6=\frac{4}{11025}a_0,\quad\dots.$$ Setting $(a_0,a_1)=(1,0)$ and $(a_0,a_1)=(0,1)$ , we obtain two linearly independent solutions whose linear combination gives the general solution to (1) bounded at $x=0$ . The solution to with $(a_0,a_1)=(0,1)$ can be written as $$
y_1(x)=x+\frac{1}{8}x^3+\frac{1}{192}x^5+\cdots=2I_1(x),$$ where $I_1(x)$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind, while the solution with $(a_0,a_1)=(1,0)$ can be represented as $$
y_2(x)=1+\frac{2}{9}x^2+\frac{1}{75}x^4+\frac{4}{11025}x^6+\cdots$$ My question is that: can $y_2(x)$ be represented in terms of any special function (like $y_1(x))$ ?

4489346,Why do we construct Lagrangian submanifolds after symplectic reductions,"I am learning about Hamilton-Jacobi actions, symplectic reductions and Lagrangian submanifolds and I am trying to understand the relation between these concepts. I have read that Lagrangian submanifolds are physically interesting as they can be thought of the space of all momenta at fixed coordinate, locally. Moreover, they allow us to recover the variational form of the Hamiltonian mechanics of the system we are dealing with. As I understand it, symplectic reductions arose from the interest of taking quotients of symplectic manifolds under group actions and the Hamilton-Jacobi group action is the one that makes it possible (via the momentum map $\mu$ ) as it satisfies several requirements as the dimension and the symplectic structure of the manifold. In particular, the Mardsen-Weinstein-Meyer theorem states that the quotient $\mu^{-1}(0) / G$ is a symplectic manifold. Finally, I have read that this latter quotient captures the original Hamiltonian mechanics. From this, most of the documents I have read naturally turn to the wish to recover Lagrangian submanifolds from symplectic reductions. For this, they use the level sets of the momentum map. It is a rough summary and obviously any correction/precision will be appreciated. My confusion comes from the wish to construct Lagrangian manifolds from symplectic reductions. First, $\mu^{-1}(0) / G$ seems to provide some physical insights on our system and so do Lagrangian submanifolds. So, either they do it in a more interesting/accurate way, or I am missing the point in doing it ""twice"". Then, the problem is probably that I am a bit short on basic knowledge here but why are we interested in many level sets of $\mu$ and not only the $0$ one? Is it because the variational form of the Hamiltonian mechanics is local?","['submanifold', 'symplectic-geometry', 'classical-mechanics', 'moment-map', 'differential-geometry']"

Some backgrouds: Originally dark matter was posed to explain the flattening of spiral rotational curve observed in galaxies, which does not match the density distribution measured from luminosity, modelled by Boltzmann equation (and its deviations). See for example [Chandrasekhar S.;Principles of Stellar Dynamics]. There is also an interesting stability theory which explained the formation of spiral arms [C.LIN,F.SHU;On the spiral structure of disk galaxies]. To quote from Poincare's celebrated ""Les Méthodes Nouvelles de la Mécanique Céleste"": 'Le but final de la Mécanique céleste est de résoudre cette grande question de savoir si la loi de Newton explique à elle seule tous les phénomènes astronomiques.' Motivated by this, if one considers a simplified  2-dimensional system, with axially-symmetric velocity field $u_i(x,t)$ given by rotation curves observed, and $\rho_i(x,t)$ the correponding density distribution measured. My question may be formulated: Question: How to find the functional $F(u_i,\rho_i,\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x},\frac{\partial \rho_i}{\partial x},\dots,x,t)=0$ which hold for all $i$ , such that  the functional $F$ coincide with newtonian gravitational law locally in $x$ , and is generic in the functional space? A first impression is to do as Kepler did: trial and error. But from a mathematical point of view, there are still many unexplored area in differential\difference equations which may lead to the well-posedness (or ill-posedness) of the above question. Inverse problems in PDEs seem to deal with the case where the differential equations underlining the problem are given, and to find the coefficients.

4489455,Is turtle graphics a group?,"I'm trying to construct examples of combinatorial group theory flavor to introduce the ideas to young students. More specifically, I'm trying to introduce the idea that you can have strings of letters that have some replacement rules (such as ""you can delete $\texttt{XX}$ "" or ""you can replace $\texttt{XY}$ with $\texttt{YX}$ ""), and that you can just play with these things as formal symbols. But it would be nice to also have real examples that the students can act/draw out to verify their computations with the abstract pencil-and-paper manipulations. It struck me that turtle graphics could be one such example. Here's the idea: Let's say that the turtle graphics group $\mathcal{T}$ is generated by elements $L,R,F,B$ . In the typical setting of a turtle with a pen moving in the standard integer lattice in the plane, $L$ means to make a quarter turn left, $R$ a quarter turn right, $F$ move forward one step drawing e.g. a black line, $B$ move backward one step drawing e.g. a blue line. We'll keep track of the multiplicity of lines between the lattice paints, and let's say that black lines and blue lines along the same edge cancel. Then $L=R^{-1}$ and $B=F^{-1}$ , and I think it follows that this is a group. Can anyone give a presentation for this group? I.e. what are the relators? It's clear that $R$ has order $4$ and $F$ has infinite order, so a presentation might start at $\mathcal{T}=\langle R,F \mid R^4,\dotsc \rangle$ . But it's unclear to me whether $R$ and $F$ have any relation. Is the group in fact just the free product $\mathbb{Z}/4 * \mathbb Z$ ? Edit: to make the question more rigorous along the lines of the comment from @Kyle Miller, there are a few things at play here. There is a monoid generated by the symbols $R$ and $F$ . There is a set $D$ (for drawings?) that indexes possible states of the turtle graphics system. This set can be described as follows: Let $V=\mathbb{Z^2}$ denote the set of integer points in the plane ( $V$ for vertices). This is the set of possible positions of the turtle. Let $E$ denote the set of edges in the standard square grid. If you like, the elements of this set are all intervals of the forms $\{x\} \times [y,y+1]$ and $[x,x+1] \times \{y\}$ , where $x,y \in \mathbb Z$ . Then $D$ is the set $V \times \{0,1,2,3\} \times \mathbb{Z}^E$ where the first coordinate is the position of the turtle, the second is the turtle's orientation, and the third tells you how many times each edge has been drawn with multiplicity (positive for a forward step, negative for a backwards one). Then there is an action $\langle R,F \rangle \to \operatorname{Sym}(D)$ , and I suppose $\mathcal{T}$ is the group that is the image of this representation.","['combinatorial-group-theory', 'group-presentation', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
