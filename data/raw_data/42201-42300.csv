417573,"Prove $\sum\limits_{\mathrm{cyc}}\sqrt{x^2+yz+2}\ge 6$ for $x, y, z \ge 0$ with $x+y+z=3$","Let $x+y+z=3,x,y,z\ge 0$,show that
  $$\sqrt{x^2+yz+2}+\sqrt{y^2+zx+2}+\sqrt{z^2+xy+2}\ge 6$$ Additional information I have seen the following problem: $x,y,z>0,x+y+z=3$, prove that
$$\sqrt{x^2+y+2}+\sqrt{y^2+z+2}+\sqrt{z^2+x+2}\ge 6.$$ Without loss of generality we can let $x=\max{\{x,y,z\}}$ Proof : case 1
$x\ge y\ge z$ we can easily prove 
$$\sqrt{y^2+z+2}+\sqrt{z^2+x+2}\ge\sqrt{y^2+x+2}+\sqrt{z^2+z+2}$$ and
$$\sqrt{x^2+y+2}+\sqrt{y^2+x+2}\ge\sqrt{x^2+x+2}+\sqrt{y^2+y+2}$$ so we have
$$\sqrt{x^2+y+2}+\sqrt{y^2+z+2}+\sqrt{z^2+x+2}\ge \sqrt{x^2+x+2}+\sqrt{y^2+y+2}+\sqrt{z^2+z+2}.$$ Then use
$$\sqrt{x^2+x+2}\ge\dfrac{3}{4}x+\dfrac{5}{4}$$
$$\sqrt{y^2+y+2}\ge\dfrac{3}{4}y+\dfrac{5}{4}$$
$$\sqrt{z^2+z+2}\ge\dfrac{3}{4}z+\dfrac{5}{4}$$
to get the result. Whereas the case 2 when $x\ge z\ge y$ can be proved using the same methods. Now,I have another idea: using Holder inequality
we have
$$\left(\sum\sqrt{x^2+yz+2}\right)^2\left(\sum\dfrac{x^2+2yz+9}{x^2+yz+2}\right)\ge 36^3$$
$$\Longleftrightarrow \sum\dfrac{x^2+2yz+9}{x^2+yz+2}\le 1296$$ and  the following link has some discussion about this problem http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=538230 and http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=52&t=538752&p=3097872#p3097872 and Vasc gave the hint: $$\sum\sqrt{8(a^2+bc+2)}\ge \sum\sqrt{(3a+b+c)^2+7}\ge 12\sqrt 2$$ How prove this hint?Thank you everyone. and my other idea is as follows: let $a=\min(a,b,c)$
we can prove 
$$\sqrt{b^2+ca+2}+\sqrt{c^2+ab+2}\geq \sqrt{(b+c)^2+2a(b+c)+8-(b-c)^2}\tag{1}$$
\begin{align*}
&\sqrt{a^2+bc+2}+\sqrt{(b+c)^2+2a(b+c)+8-(b-c)^2}\\
\geq &\sqrt{a^2+\frac{(b+c)^2}{4}+2}+\sqrt{(b+c)^2+2a(b+c)+8} \tag{2}
\end{align*}
Summing up
\begin{align*}
&\sum_{cyc}{\sqrt{a^2+bc+2}}\\
\geq &\sqrt{a^2+\frac{(b+c)^2}{4}+2}+\sqrt{(b+c)^2+2a(b+c)+8}\\
=&\sqrt{a^2+\frac{(3-a)^2}{4}+2}+\sqrt{(3-a)^2+2a(3-a)+8}

Intuitively, if we think of measurable sets as rocks, a nonatomic measure allows us to chip off a small rock of some size from a larger one, while a continuous measure allows us to chip off a small rock of any size from a larger one.  It follows that a continuous measure is nonatomic. Show that the converse is also true: nonatomic measures are continuous. I remember that my solution involved Zorn's lemma.

417798,Hartshorne proof of adjunction formula proposition II.8.20,"On page 182 Hartshorne argues that $\omega_X \otimes \mathcal O_Y = \omega_Y \wedge^r (\mathcal I / \mathcal I^2)$, where Y is a nonsingular subvariety of codimension r in the nonsingular variety X over k, and $\omega$ is the canonical sheaf. Then, he writes: ""Since formation of the highest exterior power commutes with taking the dual sheaf, we find $\omega_Y \cong \omega_X \otimes \wedge^r \mathcal N_{Y/X} $"". Here $\mathcal N$ is the normal sheaf. There are two things that I would like to ask at this point: 1) Why does only the highest exterior power commute with the dual sheaf? 2) Assuming anyway that they commute, after taking the dual sheaf, which is exact in this case (cf. Is the dualizing functor $\mathcal{Hom}( \cdot, \mathcal{O}_{X})$ exact? ), we would be now taking the highest exterior power of the SES written just before the proposition, i.e. $$0\to \mathcal T_Y \to \mathcal T_X \otimes \mathcal O_Y \to \mathcal N_{Y/X} \to 0$$which should give us now $\bigwedge \mathcal T_X \otimes \mathcal O_Y \cong \bigwedge \mathcal T_Y \otimes \mathcal N_{Y/X}$. How does one now get the isomorphisms $\bigwedge \mathcal T_X \otimes \mathcal O_Y \cong \omega_Y$ and $\bigwedge \mathcal T_Y \cong \omega_X$? Edit: now I realize that maybe Hartshorne is not looking at the dual SES, but possibly he is going from the isomorphism $\omega_X \otimes \mathcal O_Y = \omega_Y \otimes \wedge^r (\mathcal I / \mathcal I^2)$ to the result $\omega_Y \cong \omega_X \otimes \wedge^r \mathcal N_{X/Y}$ by taking the dual on the congruence rather than on the exact sequence itself. How does this work though? Finally, just to finish the proof, I would like to ask how one gets the isomorphism $\mathcal {I/I^2} \cong \mathcal L^{-1} \otimes \mathcal O_Y.$ In other words, how is factoring by $\mathcal {I^2}$ equivalent to tensoring by $\mathcal O_Y$?",['algebraic-geometry']

Let c '( t ) denote the tangent vector of the path c ( t ).  Can we ""stitch"" together the tangent vectors given by evaluating c '( t ) at each point along the path such that a smooth manifold is generated?  Does this only work for simply connected closed paths?  Rather, what are the constraints for a path that can potentially serve as a substructure for such a manifold?  Can we meaningfully evaluate the area of this manifold?  Is this manifold 1-dimensional?  Are such manifolds unique to their paths?  Can there exist a manifold for one orientation of the path but not the other?  What properties would need to hold for the reverse orientation to generate a manifold of equivalent area to the standard orientation's manifold?  How can we classify this object?  Are there any applications for this? I will award the answer to whoever covers each question and provides both an interesting example of a path and a counterexample to the idea that any path can have such a manifold. I guess the simplest example of a substructure would be c ( $\theta$ ) : $\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ given by c ( $\theta$ ) = < $\cos\theta$, $\sin\theta$ >.

$$
\gamma : \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix} \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} \sin\alpha\cos\beta \\ \sin\alpha\sin\beta \\ \cos\alpha \end{pmatrix}

Part (c) is where I am a bit stuck. Consider the region $R$ bounded between the described cube, say $C$ with boundary $\partial C$, and the unit ball at the origin, say $S$. We can use Guass' theorem since $\varphi$ is well defined there. We have
$$
\int\limits_{\partial C} \varphi = \int\limits_C \textbf{d}\varphi = \int\limits_R \textbf{d}\varphi \, + \int\limits_S \textbf{d}\varphi = \int\limits_S \textbf{d}\varphi \stackrel{?}{=} 4\pi

by part (a). How do I go about obtaining the last equality since $\varphi$ is not defined at the origin? I'm not sure how to justify appealing to my result in part (b).","['multivariable-calculus', 'differential-geometry']"

418010,Particular solutions of ODE,"I'm reading Morris Tenenbaum's book and it says that given a solvable n-th order differential equation, we can have more than one n-parameter family of solutions. By n-parameter family of solution he means what is usually called a ""general solution"" , a possible solution with n coeficients.He calls it n-parameter family of solutions because it is not necessarily a general solution ( it might not contain some possible particular solutions ). He gives many examples : Given the first order ODE $y' = -2y^{3/2}$  while we might obtain the following 1-parameter family of solutions $y = \frac{1}{(x+c)^2}$ , it's not the only possible one. There's also the 1-parameter family of solutions $y = \frac{C^2}{(Cx + 1)^2}$ . While the particular (or singular ) solution $y=0$ for example, can't be obtained by the first 1-parameter family of solutions ( no matter what $C$ we choose ), it can be obtained by the second 1-parameter family of solutions ( by setting $C = 0$ ). The problem i'm having : My doubt is if, even tho a single n-parameter family of solutions might not provide all possible particular solutions, any particular solution can be obtained by any n-parameter family of solutions. For example, given the first order ODE $y = xy' + (y')^2$ We can easily find one possible 1-parameter family of solutions as $y = cx + c^2$.
But it also has a singular solution $y = -\frac{x^2}{4}$ that can't be obtained by $y = cx + c^2$ ( no matter what c we choose ). My question is : Could $y = -\frac{x^2}{4}$ be obtained by another 1-parameter family of solutions
that would satisfy $y = xy' + (y')^2$ ? Is it a rule that there's always is a n-parameter family of solutions that can provide any particular solution ?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'functions']"
418034,Class of all finite sets,"In a higher algebra book that I'm working through, the natural numbers are constructed in the following manner:- Consider the class $S$ of all finite sets. Now, $S$ is partitioned into equivalence classes based on the equivalence relation that two finite sets are equivalent if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between them, i.e. if they are equipotent. And each of these equivalence classes are given a label, corresponding to the number of one-to-one correspondences. So, $S= S_1 \bigcup S_2 \bigcup S_3 \bigcup....$where $S_1, S_2, S_3,$ etc are disjoint equivalence classes, and to $S_n$, we give the label of the $n$th natural number. This is how the natural numbers are constructed. Now, as I understand it, the number of elements of $S_n$ for any $n$, has to be infinite. For instance, the number $5$ is the label given to $S_5$. But $5$ can be represented in an infinite number of ways: five chairs, tables, coins, pencils, pens, etc. So, this means that $S_5$ is an infinite class, and so is any $S_n$. The only way I see this possible is, the class $S$ that we started out with, has to be an infinite class. Is this true? Basically, what I'm asking is: Is the class of all finite sets infinite?

Several results on the distribution of $\|W\|_\infty$ exists when $\|W\|_\infty$ is almost surely finite. However, it is not clear to me when this is the case. $\textbf{My question:}$ What are sufficient criteria on $R$ to ensure that $\|W\|_\infty$ is almost surely finite?

Note that $R$ is not assumed to be continuous in the above, and nor is it assumed that $W$ has a continuous modification. Theorem 2.4 of Marcus & Shepp: ""Sample behaviour of Gaussian processes"" gives a bound on the distribution which would imply that $\|W\|_\infty$ is almost surely finite when $x\mapsto R(x,x)$ is bounded.

418353,What is this method called - Abelization of a Group.,"Today, I wanted to make a post for this question . There are some approach in which we can overcome the problem like this and this . According to my knowledge, I could solve the problem via the approach I had learned. Since I don't know what is this way called , so I refused to post an answer. I am very thankful if somebody tells me what is the method named? Here is some of the preliminaries but not the whole things because it is difficult for me to translate whole story (sorry). Definition: Let $R=\{r_1,r_2,...,r_m\}$, $X=\{x_1,x_2,...,x_n\}$ and $G=\langle X| R\rangle$. And consider the abelian group $G/G'$. If $\alpha_{ij}$ be the sum of the powers of $x_j$ in relation $r_i$ so we can call the following matrix, the relation matrix of abelian group $G/G'$: $$M=\begin{pmatrix}
  \alpha_{11} & \alpha_{12} & ... & \alpha_{1n}\\
  \alpha_{21} & \alpha_{22} & ... & \alpha_{2n}\\
  \vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\vdots\\
  \alpha_{m1} & \alpha_{m2} & ... & \alpha_{mn}
\end{pmatrix}$$ Definition: Let $G=\langle X| R\rangle$, such that $|X|-|R|\le 0$. If we can make $M$ to have an standard diagonal form: $$D:=\begin{pmatrix}
  d_1 & 0 & ... & 0 & 0\\
  0 & d_2 & ... & 0 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & d_3 &0 & 0\\
  \vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\vdots &d_k\\
0 & 0 & 0 &0 & 0\\\vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\vdots\\0 & 0 & 0 &0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}_{m\times n}$$ wherein $d_i\in\mathbb N\cup\{0\}$, by employing elementary row operations, then we can have $G/G'\cong\mathbb Z_{d_1}\times\mathbb Z_{d_2}\times...\mathbb Z_{d_k}$. For example: Let $$G=\langle a,b\mid a^{2^{n-1}}=1, a^{2^{n-2}}=b^2, b^{-1}ab=a^{-1}\rangle$$ so $$G/G'=\langle a,b\mid a^{2^{n-1}}=1, a^{2^{n-2}}=b^2, a^2=1, [a,b]=1\rangle$$ Now we have $$M=\begin{pmatrix}
  2^{n-1} & 0\\
  2^{n-2} & -2\\
  2 &0\\
 \end{pmatrix}\xrightarrow{R_3\leftrightarrow R_1}\begin{pmatrix}

$$\int_{a}^b |F'(x)|dx=T_F([a,b])$$

$$\int_{a}^b |F'(x)|dx\le \int_a^b |P_F'([a,x])|dx+\int_a^b|N_F'([a,x])|dx\le P_f([a,b])+N_F([a,b])=T_F([a,b])$$

418516,"Calculating the average of a possibly infinite ""compound"" length","Sorry for the ambiguous title, I couldn't find a good word to describe my problem. So here is my problem: You are a player, and you have a dice. You have N number of throws available then you can't throw any more. However, every time you get a 6 in a throw. You get M more throws available. Example:
N = 5
M = 1 1st throw: 1 (remains 4 throws) 2nd throw: 2 (remains 3 throws) 3rd throw: 3 (remains 2 throws) 4th throw: 6 (remains 2 throws) 5th throw: 4 (remains 1 throws) 6th throw: 6 (remains 1 throws) 7th throw: 1 (remains 0 throws, STOP) As you can see, it's theoretically possible to get infinite number of throws. Also you can see why I said ""compound"", because every time you get extra throws, within those extra throws you can get again more extra throws and so on, which is why it can be infinite. Now how do I calculate the average number of throws you can get based on the three inputs: Initial throws available = N Awarded throws when outcome is X = M Probability of getting X in one throw = 1/6 (in this case of a dice) One note however: I can already solve this using Markov Chains but I want an answer using Algebra or something other than Markov Chains (I know it exists because someone showed me before but I cannot remember any more how he did it, should have taken notes) For the interested, here is how I do it using Markov Chains: By constructing a transition matrix, where the ""state"" is the number of throws remaining. Of course, you can have infinite number of throws so you should only make the matrix big enough to provide a good approximation. Now, you can get the chance of stopping within X number of throws by checking the matrix power X number of throws, row N (initial state) and column 0 (end state: stop). Since we can calculate the chance of stopping within X number of throws, we can get the chance of stopping exactly after X number of throws by calculating for X and X-1 then doing (chance of stopping within X - chance of stopping within (X-1)) = Chance of stopping exactly after X throws You can then do this for X = N .... Infinity Then you can sum the product of the two arrays of probabilities of stopping and X number of throws and you get the average number of throws that the player gets before stopping. Thanks,

But (see the top of p. 9) a real-valued function means, in the terminology of Bogachev, a function with values in the open interval $(-\infty, +\infty)$, so in particular a measure is not allowed to take the value $+\infty$.
