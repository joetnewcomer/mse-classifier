1331042,How to find this limit and prove it rigorously: $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt2...)}}}$? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Limit of the nested radical $x_{n+1} = \sqrt{c+x_n}$ (5 answers) Closed 9 years ago . $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt2...)}}}$. Pretty classic question, I think - and the limit is equal to 2. But how do I prove this rigorously?  An epsilon-delta proof wouldn't work, since I wouldn't know the limit is equal to 2 - the question asks, if the limit exists, compute it.  This was for an old analysis exam, not a calculus class, so I feel that I can't just set the above = some number L, and then make algebraic manipulations on both sides of the equation, until I get what I want.  We can't assume the limit exists, I think. Thanks,","['nested-radicals', 'calculus', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"
1331078,Using a Fourier Series to Solve Differential Equation,"The problem states to use the fourier series of the function f(t) defined as follows: $f(t)= t+1 , -1<t<0  $ $f(t)=1-t  , 0<t<1$ to solve the differential equation:
x''+4x=f(t), x(0)=1, x'(0)=0 I have found the fourier series of f(t) to be: $\frac1 2 + \sum_{n=odd}^\infty \frac{cos(\pi n t)}{n^2}$ the complementary solution for the homogeneous equation is:
$x_c= C_1 cos(2t) + C_2 sin(2t)$ The particular solution corresponding to the constant 1/2 is 1/8 I then proceed to find the coefficient of each n-th particular solution corresponding to the n-th $cos(n \pi t)$ this turns out to be $\frac{1}{n^2(4-n^2 \pi^2)}$ The solution should be a sum of the complementary and particular solutions, thus: $x=C_1 cos(2t) + C_2 sin(2t)+\frac{1}{8} + \sum_{n=odd}^\infty \frac{cos(\pi n t)}{n^2(4-n^2 \pi^2)}$ differentiating this termwise yields:
$x'=-2C_1 sin(2t) + 2C_2 cos(2t) + \sum_{n=odd}^\infty \frac{-\pi n sin(\pi n t)}{n^2(4-n^2 \pi^2)}$ using the initial condition x'(0)=0 it is apperent $C_2$=0 thus: $x=C_1 cos(2t) +\frac{1}{8} + \sum_{n=odd}^\infty \frac{cos(\pi n t)}{n^2(4-n^2 \pi^2)}$ This is where I am lost, how do I find the remaining coefficient? My intuition tells me to use the initial condition x(0)=1 which yields:
$C_1 + \frac{1}{8} + \sum_{n=odd}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2(4-n^2 \pi^2)}$=1 but this implies:
$C_1 = \frac{-7}{8} - \sum_{n=odd}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2(4-n^2 \pi^2)}$ is such a solution allowed or is there a different way of doing this?

The two vertices aren't neighbours: $\binom {10} 2 \binom 85 ^2 \binom {\binom 82} 2$. Explanation: choosing the two, then neighbours for each, then a place for the two edges that's left. The two vertices are neighbours: $\binom {10} 2 \binom 8 4 ^2 \binom {\binom 82} 3$ In both cases there could be a third vertex with a degree 5 so we need to uncount it: $\binom {10} 3 \binom 7 3 ^3$, choosing the 3 and then since they're all neighbours to each other, choose another 3 neighbors for each, which is exactly 12 edges. The total is:
$\binom {10} 2 \binom 85 ^2 \binom {\binom 82} 2 + \binom {10} 2 \binom 85 ^2 \binom {\binom 82} 2 - \binom {10} 3 \binom 7 3 ^3$ Does this cover all the overcounting? Is there a way to know for sure?","['graph-theory', 'combinatorics']"

I would think the answer to the question is yes, since the degree of $E$ is zero which implies the degree of any coherent subsheaf of $E$ is also $0$. In turn the slope of both $E$ and any subsheaf of $E$ is zero, implying semi-stability. Am I right?","['coherent-sheaves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

1331291,Understanding $p$-adic fields,"OK, I'm completely lost on this. Define the $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$ as the projective limit $$\lim_{\leftarrow} \mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z}.$$
So, if $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p$, then $a$ can be represented by an infinite sequence of numbers $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}}$, right? So if $a=(a_1, a_2, \cdots) \in \mathbb{Z}_p$, then $$a \in \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z} \times \cdots,$$ with $a_{n+1} \equiv a_n \mod p^n$. So $a_2 \equiv a_1 \mod p$, $a_3 \equiv a_2 \mod p^2,$ so $a_3 \equiv a_1 \mod p,$ and so on (right?). So if I understand it correctly, when you determine $a_1$, all the other $a_i's$ are fixed. So my first question is: how do you determine this $a_1$? Also, I don't grasp the concept of the $p$-adic extension (now with $\mathbb{Q}_p$ as an example).Let $p$ be prime, $x \in \mathbb{Q}_p$ and $v = \nu_p(x)$, the $p$-adic valuation of $x$. Then there exists a sequence of integers $0 \leq a_i \leq p-1$ for $i \geq v$ such that $$ x = \sum_{i=v}^{\infty} a_ip^i.$$ This really doesn't make any sense to me, as an element $x \in \mathbb{Q}_p$ is defined to be an infinite sequence of numbers, while $\sum_{i=v}^{\infty} a_ip^i$ clearly has dimension $1$, i.e. it's just a 'regular' number. I think my misunderstanding of the latter is also the reason why I don't get this: let $p \neq 2$ be a prime and $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}$. We define $\Big(\frac{a}{p}\Big)$ to be the legendre symbol $\Big(\frac{a'}{p}\Big)$, with $a' \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a' \equiv a \mod p$. Again, as $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}$ is an infinte sequence of numbers, how can $a \mod p$ be equal to another integer modulo $p$?  Can someone clear up my confusion or tell me where I went wrong?

1331303,Proving generalized form of Laplace expansion along a row - determinant,"Definition: Let $A$ be an ($n \times n$)-matrix. Let $M_{ij}$ denote the matrix acquired from $A$ by deleting row $i$ and column $j$. For $n \geq 2$ we define the determinant of $A$ inductively as \begin{align*} \det(A) = \sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{1+j} a_{1j} \det(M_{1j}). \end{align*} This is called Laplace expansion along the first row . I now want to proof the generalized form of this definition, i.e. using any row $i$ (not necessarily the first one). Proposition: Let $A$ be a ($n \times n$)-matrix, and let $i$ be an arbitrary rowindex. Then we have \begin{align*} \det(A) = \sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_{ij} \det(M_{ij}). \end{align*} Proof: Let $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n$ be the rows of $A$. Thus we get \begin{align*} A = \begin{pmatrix} C_1 \\ \vdots \\ C_i \\ \vdots \\ C_n \end{pmatrix}. \end{align*} Now let $B$ be the matrix that is given as \begin{align*} B = \begin{pmatrix} C_i \\ C_1 \\ \vdots \\ C_{i-1} \\ C_{i+1} \\ \vdots \\ C_n \end{pmatrix}. \end{align*} Then $B$ can be acquired from $A$ by doing an ($i-1$)-amount of successive rowinterchanges. Hence we have $\det(B) = (-1)^{i-1} \det(A)$. Then I'm not sure how to continue. I know how to get $(-1)^{i+j}$. But if I just insert the definition then I'm stuck with the minor $M_{1j}$, and not the generalized form. Any ideas?","['solution-verification', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant', 'matrices']"

I have: estimations of the Polish population for the future years a CF patients' register for the last couple of years in the USA estimates for the USA population in the next few years.

All those data seem to have a linear trend for the last couple of years, so I thought I could just make linear regressions for all three data sets and then assume that the polish CF subpopulation will grow according to the slope $\alpha_{\textrm{CF in Poland}} = \alpha_{\textrm{CF in USA}} - \alpha_{\textrm{USA}} + \alpha_{\textrm{Poland}}$, where $\alpha$ are slopes for the respective reggresions.

1331326,Upper bounds for the number of intermediate subgroups,"Assume that $G$ is a finite group, and $H\le G$ a subgroup of index $n>1$. What can we say about the number of distinct intermediate subgroups $K$, i.e. groups such that $H\subset K\subset G$? Thoughts: No matter how large $n$ is, it is possible that no such subgroups $K$ exist. An example of that is: $G=S_n$ and $H=S_{n-1}$ (= a point stabilizer). Therefore the general lower bound is trivial, but upper bounds are more interesting. Let us denote by $S(n)$ the maximum number of such intermediate subgroups (keep $n$ fixed, but allow $G$ and $H$ to vary any which way you want as long as $[G:H]=n$). To get a simple upper bound we can do the following. Assume that $K$ is such a subgroup with $[K:H]=d$, $1<d<n, d\mid n$. Then, in addition to $H$, $K$ contains $d-1$ cosets of $H$. There are $\binom{n-1}{d-1}$ ways of selecting those. This gives us a trivial upper bound
$$
S(n)\le\sum_{d\mid n, 1<d<n}\binom{n-1}{d-1}.
$$
This bound is tight in the case $n=4$, because $H\unlhd G, G/H\cong K_4$ meets it. In general it is clearly loose. Also we already see that the prime factor $p=2$ of $n$ may contribute a lot. Because $d=n/2$ is the largest possible value, the above bound implies as a weaker version
$$S(n)\le\sum_{i=1}^{n/2-1}\binom{n-1}{i}=2^{n-2}-1.$$ Motivation: This question arises as the Galois correspondence translation of the question asking for bounds on the number of intermediate subfields between a perfect field $K$ and its degree $n$ extension $F$. See this question and this question . Comments: The case $|H|=1, |G|=n$, has surely been studied. I included the more general variant in case it matters, because it is needed in the field-theoretical application. In the case of a fixed $K$ the field-theoretical application needs, in addition to more precise information about $S(n)$, also an affirmative answer to the inverse Galois theory question of realizing $G$ as a Galois group $Gal(F/K)$.","['group-theory', 'finite-groups']"
1331334,How is $\sin 45^\circ=\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}$?,"I've been reading about the proof of $\sin 45^\circ=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt 2}$ in my book.

I am satisfied with this explanation. But on https://proofwiki.org they used a square to prove this formula as shown: In that proof over proofwiki they say that the $\angle A$ is $45^\circ$ because the diagonal $AC$ is the bisector of $\angle A$. They do not use the property of isosceles triangle. My questions are, Why is the diagonal of a square bisector of the angle from which it originates? How can we prove this mathematically?

I solved the problem using the fact that under this constraint of $P$, $\phi$ is defined over $Z_{p}$.   In other words, the quadratic congruence $x^2 \equiv x + 1 $ mod $P$ has a root $\phi$ (the other one being $P - \phi$). Then, using using Binet's formula and considering two cases that $n$ is odd or even, I reduced the equation into a quadratic equation involving $\phi^n$. From this value of $\phi^n$, I found $n$ using Baby-step Giant-step algorithm. There would be two values for $\phi^n$, hence I'd have two values of $n$ at maximum. When $n$ is considered odd, we'd find another two values of $n$ at most. Finally, the minimum value of $n$ was taken. Any idea how to solve the problem when $P$ is any prime?

A family of measurable functions $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable if given $\epsilon >0$ , there exists $M$ such that $$\int_{E_M} |f_n| \ d\mu<\epsilon$$ for each $n$ . The family is uniformly absolutely continuous if given $\epsilon >0$ , there exists $\delta$ such that $$\bigg|\int_A f_n \ d\mu \bigg|< \epsilon$$ for each $n$ if $\mu(A)<\delta$ . Problem Statement Suppose $\mu$ is a finite measure. Prove that $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable if and only if $\sup_n \int|f_n| \ d\mu <\infty$ and $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly absolutely continuous. Attempt Proposition 1: If $\mu$ is finite, $$\lim_{M\to\infty} E_M \rightarrow 0.$$ Proof: If $E_M \to K$ , where $k>0$ , then $\infty=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} K \leq \mu(X)=\mu(\bigcup_{M=1}^{\infty} E_M)$ , since $E_{N+1} \subset E_{N}$ . This contradicts $\mu$ being finite. Next I provide a proof of the problem: Proof: $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose that $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable. Then, for any $\epsilon>0$ , we may find $M$ so that $$ \bigg|\int_{E_M} f_n \ d\mu \bigg| \leq \int_{E_M} |f_n| \ d\mu <\epsilon.$$ Thus, taking $\delta=\mu(E_M)$ is sufficient. Next, note that \begin{align*}
\int |f_n| \ d\mu&=\int_{E_M} |f_n|\ d\mu+\int_{E^c_M} |f_n| \ d\mu\\
&\leq \epsilon + M\mu(E^c_M)\\
&\leq \infty, 
\end{align*} since $\mu$ is finite. SO $\sup_n \int |f_n| \ d\mu\leq \infty$ . $(\Leftarrow)$ On the other hand, assume $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly absolutely continuous and $\sup_n \int |f_n| \ d\mu<\infty$ . Let $E^{'}_M=\{x:f_n(x)>M\}$ and $E^{''}_M=\{x:f_n<-M\}$ . Given $\epsilon>0$ , use proposition 1 to find $E_M$ with $\mu(E_M)<\delta$ and absolute continuity along with the observation that $\mu(E^{'}_M),\mu(E^{''}_M)\leq \mu(E_M)$ to ensure $\bigg|\int_{E^{'}_M} f_n \ d\mu \bigg|$ , and $\bigg|\int_{E^{''}_M} f_n \ d\mu \bigg|$ are both less than $\frac{\epsilon}{2}.$ Then, \begin{align*}
\int_{E_M}|f_n| \ d\mu&=\int_{E^{'}_M}f_n \ d\mu+\int_{E^{''}_M}-f_n \ d\mu\\

(The initial direction is irrelevant.) $+$: Turn $\delta$ degrees to your left. $-$: Turn $\delta$ degrees to your right. (For example, L-systems are drawn using a very similar setup.) I will write $+^n$ and $-^n$ to mean ""turn $n\delta$ degrees to your left/right"", where $n$ is an integer. Given $\delta$, I want to know which points on the plane the turtle can reach. Specifically, I'm interested in whether the set of reachable points is dense in $\Bbb R^2$ or not. If $\delta/2\pi$ is irrational, the set of reachable angles is dense in $[0, 2\pi]$. Informally, this means you can move arbitrarily small distances by making really sharp turns: find some integer $n$ so that $n\delta$ is almost 90 degrees. Then $+^nF-^{2n}F+^n$ will move a very tiny bit in the current direction. Since there's then a way to move arbitrarily small distances at arbitrary angles, I'm quite sure this means the set of reachable points is dense in $\Bbb R^2$. If $\delta/2\pi$ is rational, then $\delta = (a/b)2\pi$ for some irreducible fraction $a/b$. Since $a$ and $b$ are coprime, there is some $n$ so that $n\delta = (1/b)2\pi$ (modulo $2\pi$) , so we can reduce the problem to the case $\delta = 2\pi/b$ for some positive integer $b$. Here's where I'm stuck. I know that for e.g. $b=4$, the turtle can only turn at 90° angles, and is obviously stuck on a square lattice; similarly, if $b=3$ or $b=6$ the turtle is stuck on a triangular lattice moving only at 120° or 60° angles. $b=1$ or $b=2$ means the turtle is stuck on a given line. How can I prove that the set of reachable points is not dense in the plane for precisely these values of $b$? (I think what I'm looking at can be described as the additive subgroup of $(\Bbb C, +)$ generated by the b th roots of unity: the roots $z_0, z_1 \dots z_{b-1}$ correspond to the turtle commands $F$, $-F+$, $-^2F+^2$, etc. For which $b$ is this group's underlying set dense in $\Bbb C$?

$$
E(n) = \sum_{k} k \frac{N_L (n,k)}{n!}
$$ Note that longest increasing segment is different than the longest increasing subsequence , which has been shown to have an expectation value asymptoptic to $2\sqrt{n}$ (see MSE question 347072).  For the example permutation above, the longest increasing subsequence is of length 4
 $(1,4,5,6)$. Work I have tried A hand-waving argument hints that the asymptotic behavior is going to go as some constant times $\log(n)$.  Namely, when you try to extend $k$ to $k+1$ you have roughly a 50% chance of failing, so for the typical maximal monotonic length to increase by one, the size of the permutation would have to double. If $A(n.k)$ is the number of permutations of length $n$ containing a monotonic segment of length at least $k$, then you can try to relate $A(n,k)$ to $A(n-1,k)$ as follows: Choose any number from $1$ to $n$ as the first number.  Then do an order-preserving map of the remaining $n-1$ numbers to $\{1, \ldots, n-1\}$.  $A(n-1,k)$ of the resulting permutations will have a monotonic segment of length at least $k$, meaning that for those, the full permutation will also have such a segment.  So 
$$
A(n,k) = nA(n-1,k) + \sum_r B(n,r,k)$$
where  $B(n,r,k)$ is the number of permutations of length $n$ that start with a monotonic segment of length precisely $k-1$, beginning with $r$, and that contain no monotonic segment of length greater than of equal to $k$ (to avoid double counting. It is easy enough to count the ways of starting with a monotonic segment of length $k-1$. The problem is, those ways interact with the condition of containing no other monotonic segment longer than $k-1$.  So I can't form a recursion that would get a handle on $B(n,k)$.    Still, the recursion ignoring the $B$ term gives some handle on a lower bound to $E(n)$. But I am stuck at that point.",['combinatorics']

1332100,Proofs utilizing the Well-Ordering Property,"This question comes directly from as an example in Chapter 5.2 of Rosen's Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications textbook on page 341. Example Use the well-ordering property to prove the division algorithm. Recall that the division algorithm states that if $a$ is an integer and $d$ is a positive integer, then there are unique integers $q$ and $r$ with $0 \leq r < d$ and $a = dq + r$ . Solution Let $S$ be the set of nonnegative integers of the form $a − dq$ , where $q$ is an integer. This set is nonempty because $−dq$ can be made as large as desired (taking q to be a negative integer with large absolute value). By the well-ordering property, $S$ has a least element $r = a − dq_\text{0}$ . The integer $r$ is nonnegative. It is also the case that $r < d$ . If it were not, then there would be a smaller nonnegative element in $S$ , namely, $a − d(q0 + 1)$ . To see this, suppose that $r ≥ d$ . Because $a=dq_\text{0}+r$ , it follows that $a−d(q_\text{0}+1)=(a−dq_\text{0})−d=r−d \geq 0$ . Consequently, there are integers $q$ and $r$ with $0 \leq r < d$ . My Questions Why we are considering a set $S$ of remainders $r$ ? How does that relate to proving the correctness of the division algorithm? What is a better explanation of why $r < d$ ?

1332119,A proof that $EX_n\to EX$ for uniformly integrable $\{X_n\}$ with $X_n\to X$ a.s.,"I'm having some trouble following someone's proof of the following result: Assume that $\{X_n\}$ are uniformly integrable and that $X_n\to X$ a.s.;
then $EX_n\to EX$. First, the author shows that $X$ is integrable, and I'm fine with that. But I don't understand how exactly she concludes that
$$
\limsup_{n\to\infty}E|X_n-X|=0.
$$ Fix $\epsilon>0$. By the integrability of $X$ and the uniform integrability of $\{X_n\}$, the author can choose an $M$ such that
$$
\sup_n E\ (1_{\{|X_n|\ge M\}}|X_n|)\le\epsilon\quad\text{and}\quad E\ (1_{\{|X|\ge M\}}|X|)\le\epsilon.
$$
I'm also fine with the identity
\begin{align} |x-y| & \le 1_{\{|x-y|\le 2M\}}|x-y|+1_{\{|x-y|\ge 2M\}}|x-y|\\
 & \le 1_{\{|x-y|\le 2M\}}|x-y|+(1_{\{|x|\ge M\}}+1_{\{|y|\ge M\}})(|x|+|y|).
\tag{1}
\end{align} My question is, how exactly does this identity imply that
\begin{align}  \limsup_{n\to\infty}E|X_n-X|  \le &  \limsup_{n\to\infty}E(1_{\{|X_n-X|\le 2M\}}|X_n-X|)\\ &\ +2 \limsup_{n\to\infty}E(1_{\{|X_n|\ge M\}}|X_n|)
 + 2E(1_{\{|X|\ge M\}}|X|)?
\tag{2}
 \end{align} Specifically, how do the four terms in
$$(1_{\{|x|\ge M\}}+1_{\{|y|\ge M\}})(|x|+|y|)$$
become $$2 \limsup_{n\to\infty}E(1_{\{|X_n|\ge M\}}|X_n|)

$$|x-y|  
\le 1_{\{|x-y|\le 2M\}}|x-y|+2|x|1_{\{|x|\ge M\}}+2|y|1_{\{|y|\ge M\}},

\lim_{r\to\infty}\frac{M(r/2)}{M(r)}=0.
$$ I believe I have a proof for this, but I'm concerned because I don't think I'm using the assumption that $f$ is not a polynomial. My proof is the following: First, notice that
\begin{align*}
\log\left(\frac{M(r/2)}{M(r)}\right)&=\log M(r/2)-\log M(r)\\
&=-\frac{r}{2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(\log M(r)\right)\big|_{r=r_0}
\end{align*}
for some $r/2\leq r_0<r$ by the mean value theorem. Let $\log r=x$. By Hadamard's three-circles theorem, $\log M(r)$ is a convex function of $\log r$, i.e., $x$. Hence $\frac{d}{dx}\left(\log M(r)\right)>0$ for sufficiently large $x$. The chain rule shows
$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left(\log M(r)\right)=e^x\cdot\frac{d}{dr}\left(\log M(r)\right).
$$
Since $\frac{d}{dx}(\log M(r)),e^x>0$ for large $x$, $\frac{d}{dr}(\log M(r))>0$ for large $x$ as well. This shows that
$$
\lim_{r\to\infty}\log\left(\frac{M(r/2)}{M(r)}\right)=-\infty
$$
and so $\lim_{r\to\infty}\frac{M(r/2)}{M(r)}=0$. Could someone please enlighten me on where my proof goes wrong or where I may subtlety use the assumption? Alternative proofs are welcome. Thank you in advance for your time.",['complex-analysis']
1332156,Trying to understand a proof about onto/1-1 mappings (from Herstein's Topics in Algebra),"I am working on some problems in a book I have and I want to make sure that I have an accurate possible proof. That is, I want to make sure I actually understand/ can justify the reasoning. (some of it were from hints so that is what I want to be sure I can justify,  even if the problem may be very elementary). The question is, If the set $S$ has a finite number of elements then prove that if $\sigma$ maps from $S$ onto $S$, then $\sigma$ is one-to-one, and if $\sigma$ is one-to-one map from $S$ into $S$ , then show that $\sigma$ is onto. $\mathbf{Proof (in \space progress)}:$ Let $|S|=n$ and let $\sigma: S \to S$ be any mapping from $S$ into $S$. Now, because $\sigma$ is a mapping, every element in S must be mapped somewhere ( is this correct reasoning?), thus we have $$\sigma^{-1}(S)=S$$ So, we can write $$S= \bigcup_{s \in S}\sigma^{-1}(s)$$ which is also true since $\sigma$ is a mapping and since every s is mapped to somewhere the union of all s that are mapped is all of s( is this correct reasoning)?, This I understand so far if my reasoning has held, The next part I am a bit confused on, it is to make use that each subset is disjoint and then use that to imply that $$|S|=\sum_{s \in S} |\sigma^{-1}(s)|$$ Now Im not exactly sure what is happening here. I mean intuitively it seems to makes sense that since each $s \in S$ can only be mapped to one other $s \in S$, then it would hold, but I still feel a bit fuzzy on it. Moving on,  if $\sigma$ is onto then we have $|\sigma^{-1}(s)| \ge 1$ because each s must have at least one s if not more that maps to it. and from above, this gives, $$n=|S|=\sum_{s \in S} |\sigma^{-1}(s)| \ge \sum_{s \in S} 1=n$$ (because cardinality of S is n). And to assure the equality holds i.e. that n=n it forces that $| \sigma^{-1}(s)|=1$ for every $s \in S$ which therefor shows $\sigma$ is one-to-one and the converse is similar, that is, if $\sigma$ is one-to-one then 
$|\sigma^{-1}(s)| \le 1$ for every $s \in S$ because of course if it was more than 1 , it would imply that more then one element in $S$ maps to the same element in $S$ which is directly against the definition of one-to-one. Which again will force us to have $| \sigma^{-1}(s)|=1$ for all $s \in S$, therefor showing that $\sigma$ is also onto. So yea, basically, I am wondering about the validity of it all, any insight/comments on the topic, and I also added some parts in where I asked if my train of thought was valid. I hope this can all help me to understand and work on my proofs better. Thanks everyone for the time! Update: Some of the comments have left me very curious about what methods I should be attempting. So ideally, if someone could give a solution to this using only what was already taught in Hersteins book, then that would be great.

1332294,Strong Induction: Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational,"This question comes directly out of Rosen's Discrete Mathematics and It's Applications pertaining to Strong Induction. Use strong induction to prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. [Hint: Let $P(n)$ be the statement that $\sqrt{2}\neq n/b$ for any positive integer $b$.] Solution : Let $P(n)$ be the statement that there is no positive integer b such that $\sqrt{2}= n/b$. Basis step: $P(1)$ is true because $\sqrt{2} > 1 \geq 1/b$ for all positive integers b. Inductive step: Assume that $P(j)$ is true for all $j\leq k$, where $k$ is an arbitrary positive integer; we prove that $P(k+1)$ is true by contradiction. Assume that $\sqrt{2} = (k+1)/b$ for some positive integer b. Then $2b^2 = (k+1)^2$, so $(k + 1)^2$ is even, and hence, $k+1$ is even. So write $k+1 = 2t$ for some positive integer $t$, whence $2b^2 = 4t^2$ and $b^2 = 2t^2$. By the same reasoning as before, b is even, so $b = 2s$ for some positive integer $s$. Then $\sqrt{2} = (k + 1)/b = (2t)/(2s) = t/s$. But $t \leq k$, so this contradicts the inductive hypothesis, and our proof of the inductive step is complete. My confusion comes from how we've proven our inductive step by contradiction. Using our hint, we assume $P(n)$ is $\sqrt{2} \neq n/b$. When we start our proof by contradiction component, we assume $P(n)$ is $\sqrt{2} = n/b$ for some $b$ in terms of some arbitrary positive integer $k$: $\sqrt{2} = k/b$. How does showing that $t \leq k$ contradict our inductive hypothesis? Is it because we assume $k/b$ is in reduced terms, where $k$ can not be any smaller and the fact that $t \leq k$ contradicts this? What am I lacking in my understanding of the proof by contradiction?

Then $\pi:E\to M$ is a principal $H$-bundle. So if we are given a Lie group homomorphism $f:G\to H$ and a principal $G$-bundle $\pi:E\to M$, we need to come up with a principal $H$-bundle.

for all $x\in P$. If $f$ were a Lie group isomorphism, then this works. But if $f$ is not an isomorphism then this action may not even be well defined.

So then, if a polynomial is in the ideal, then all of its linear factors are. This means that the generator for this ideal must be one of these factors. In fact, any polynomial that is reducible can't be the generator for this ideal, and therefore the prime ideals must be generated by irreducibles. In $\Bbb C[x]$ it would seem by algebraic closure, the only irreducibles are linear polynomials. Therefore all prime/maximal ideals of $\Bbb C[x]$ are of the form $(x-\alpha)$, $\alpha\in \Bbb C$. Note: that although $(0)$ is irreducible, it is not maximal. (I think we just say it is excluded?) Is my proof valid?","['abstract-algebra', 'maximal-and-prime-ideals', 'proof-verification', 'ring-theory']"

1332506,Mistake in the definitions of the linking number.,"I am looking into the definition of the linking number. I've considered these two definitions. Consider a link $L$ with components $K_1$ and $K_2$, and respectively their embeddings $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$. Firstly, $Lk^{(1)}$ defined by counting the positive and negative intersections of a diagram of the link $L$ with +1 and -1 respectively, ultimately dividing this number by 2. Secondly, one can define the linking number of $L$, by $Lk^{(2)}$, by taking the degree of the map $\Psi: S^1\times S^1 \to S^2: (s,t)\mapsto \frac{\gamma_1(s) - \gamma_2(t)}{|\gamma_1(s) - \gamma_2(t)|}$ We now know the linking number is symmetric w.r.t the component knots.
However $Lk^{(2)}(K_2,K_1) = deg(\mu\circ\Psi)$. with $\mu:S^2\to S^2$ that maps points to their antipodal points. However the degree of $\mu$ is -1, and thus $Lk^{(2)}(K_2,K_1) = deg(\mu\circ\Psi) = -deg(\Psi) = -Lk^{(2)}(K_1,K_2) $. And thus $Lk^{(2)}$ is not symmetric.

About a year back I was in Professor Henry Mckean's office and he told me alot of interesting things.  One thing he told me was that if a  pde has resonances then often the resonances dissapear when the same pde is taken on a natural compactification of the space.  Unfortunately at 85 years old he is not in great health anymore and I can't ask him directly what he meant. One example he gave me is that the transformed pde of burgers equation into the heat equation has resonances but when the same pde is taken in $\mathbb{RP^1}=\mathbb{S^1}$, a compactification of $\mathbb{R}$, the resonances dissapear.  He told me that this makes sense because the cole hopf transformation is nonlinear transformation so the resulting pde should have resonances.  But projective space is a nonlinear space so the 2 effects cancel. I really want a reference so I can know what I am talking about.  I have a working knowledge of pde I, II and took these courses(sobolev spaces, well posedness results by fixed fixed point or compactness, direct method of calculus of variations, mountain pass lemma etc). For whatever its worth I have taken courses in differential geometry, lie theory and have a strong background in analysis.  In short I know every term in what he is saying but I don't know what he means by what he is saying if that makes sense. For whatever its worth I have been reading about pde resonances at http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~pgermain/Space_time_resonances.pdf Professor Pierre Germain and Professor Shatah are supposed to be authorities in the subject.","['partial-differential-equations', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology', 'reference-request']"
1332747,Proof that $\mathbb{R}^+$ is a vector space,"I was doing some beginner linear algebra tasks and stumbled upon this one: Proove that $\mathbb{R}^+$ is a vector space over field $\mathbb{R}$ with binary operations defined as $a+b = ab$ (where $ab$ is multiplication in $\mathbb{R}$ and $\alpha *b =b^\alpha$, where $b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R} $. It's easy to prove that $(\mathbb{R}^+,+)$ is an Abelian group and i will leave that part of proof out. However, when proving the following property of vector spaces, there seems to be a problem: $\alpha (x+y) = \alpha x +  \alpha y$ ( where $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^+$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$) By definition:
$$\alpha (x+y) =(x+y)^\alpha $$ and
$$\alpha x + \alpha y = x^\alpha + y ^\alpha $$ In general case: 
$(x+y)^\alpha \ne x^\alpha + y^\alpha$
so this appears not to be a vector space, but even the solution in textbook states it is ( this property proof is completely omitted). Could this be author's error or did I make a mistake? If the mistake is mine, I would like to ask and additional question ,which should probably be posted in a separate thread: How would i find one base of this vector space. By defintion, I need to find a positive real number who's linear combination would generate all  positive real numbers.

1332807,Hermitian Matrices with Repeated Eigenvalues has Codimension 3?,"It is sometimes claimed that the space of $n\times n$ Hermitian matrices with at least one repeated eigenvalue has codimension 3. (See link exercise 10.) The proof of this in dimension two is very simple: by diagonalizing a $2\times 2$ Hermitian matrix $H$,
we easily conclude that if $H$ has the same eigenvalue twice,
then $H$ must be a constant multiple of the $2\times 2$ identity matrix,
and this space has dimension 1, versus 4 for the space of $2\times 2$ Hermitian matrices. However,
I'm having difficulties with (what I believe to be) the standard demonstration of this in higher dimensions (provided in the paper ""On the Behaviour of Eigenvalues in Adiabatic Processes"" by Von Neumann and Wigner).
From what I can tell,
the demonstration (outline) goes goes as follows: An $n\times n$ Hermitian matrix $H$ can be written as $UDU^*$,
where $U$ is unitary and $D$ is diagonal and contains the eigenvalues, say in increasing order. The decomposition $UDU^*$ is not unique,
but if we have $WDW^*$ for another unitary matrix $W$,
then we can write $W=UV$, where $V$ commutes with $D$,
and so one could argue we can fix $U$ and $D$,
and then write $H=(UV)D(UV)^*$,
where $V$ can be any unitary matrix that commutes with $D$. Thus, the number of real parameters one needs to specify the matrix $H$ would be $n^2+f-v$, where $n^2$ is the number of real parameters to specify a fixed unitary matrix $U$, $f$ is the number of parameters to specify the real eigenvalues of $D$, and $v$ is the number of parameters to specify $V$. We can show that, if $f$ is the number of eigenvalues of $H$, and $g_1,\ldots,g_f$ are the multiplicities of the eigenvalues (i.e., $g_1+\cdots+g_f=n$), then $v=g_1^2+g_2^2+\cdots+g_f^2$. Therefore,
if there is a repeated eigenvalue ($g_i\geq 2$ for at least one $i$),
the number of parameters will be at most $n^2-3$,
hence the space of Hermitian matrices with repeated eigenvalues has codimension 3. My problems with this are the following: In the case of $2\times 2$ matrices, it is clear that the space of Hermitian matrices with repeated eigenvalues is a vector space, as it consists of the multiples of the identity matrix. However, it is not at all clear to me that this is the case in higher dimensions. In step 3. above, I don't understand how one just removes the parameters used to specify $V$ from the total amount of parameters. If it were argued that we have double counted some parameters and that we must now remove them, this would be fine, but it seems that we start with $n^2+f$ parameters and that we then somehow remove parameters that are completely unrelated to the previous ones. Finally, I'm not sure I understand the connection between parameters and dimension.  While it is true that Unitary matrices can be specified with $n^2$ numbers, we can't say that the space of Unitary matrices has dimension $n^2$ because unitary matrices do not form a linear subspace. So, I'm not sure how this business of counting parameters rigorously coincides with dimension of subspaces.","['matrix-decomposition', 'matrices']"
