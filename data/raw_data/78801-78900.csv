1009897,Relationship between the diffusion equation and the heat equation,"In physics we have the heat equation which describes the propagation of heat $$\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \kappa \dfrac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},$$ while in biomathematics we have the diffusion equation which describes the random diffusion of a particle across space with time $$\dfrac{\partial P}{\partial t} = D \dfrac{\partial ^2 P}{\partial x^2}.$$ Clearly these two equations are of similar forms, but I'm having some trouble trying to see why heat and diffusion would be related. I've always thought of heat as quite ""orderly"" - i.e. it propagates out in a more or less regular manner from some point of heat. However, I've always thought of diffusion as more ""random"" with a particle performing Brownian motion and the like to eventually reach a point ($P$ is normally related to a probability and it has a discrete recursive form, $P_{x, t+1}$). If anyone could provide some insight, that would be great. Is this purely a coincidence or is there some basic condition which means we get analogous equations?","['soft-question', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"

1009955,Three meanings of étale sheaf on X,"When I am studying stacky stuffs, I am always confused by the notion of étale abelian sheaves on $X$, because conceivably there might be three different meanings of that: Take the global étale site (the category of scheme with topology defined by étale coverings) and consider an abelian sheaf $\mathcal F$ on the global site, together with a map $\mathcal F\rightarrow h_X$ to the  sheaf represented by $X$. Take the big étale site on $X$ (the category of schemes over X with topology defined by étale covering) and consider an abelian sheaf on this site. Take the small étale site on $X$ (the category of schemes étale over X with topology defined by étale covering) and consider an abelian sheaf on this site.

1009969,Finding where $|x^2-1|$ is increasing and where not.,"Consider the function $f: \Bbb R \to \Bbb R$, given by $f(x) = |x^2-1|$. Then, the exercise asks to find $X,Y \subset \Bbb R$ such that $X \cup Y = \Bbb R$, $X \cap Y = \varnothing,$ $f_{\large| X}$ is increasing, and $f_{\large|Y}$ is decreasing. A first naive thought would be $X = ]-1,0[ \cup [1,+\infty[$ and $Y = ]-\infty, -1] \cup [0,1[$, but this fails, since, for example, $-0.5 < 1.1 ,$ but $f(-0.5) > f(1.1)$, in $X$. Maybe the exercise was poorly written, and it actually meant what I wrote above. I'm heavily inclined to saying that such sets doesn't exist, but I don't quite know how to go at it..

1010078,Derivative of conditional expectation,"Let $\left( {{X_t}:t \in \left[ 0 \right.\left. {, + \infty } \right\rangle } \right)$ be a continuous time Markov chain on a probability space $\left( {\Omega ,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}} \right)$ with a finite state space $S$, defined by jump chain/holding times definition. Suppose $A,B \in \sigma \left( {{X_0}} \right)$ and $f\left( t \right) = \mathbb{E}\left[ {\mathbb{P}\left( {A|{X_t}} \right)|B} \right]$ is a decreasing function. Suppose I want to calculate $f'\left( t \right)$. We can assume that $f'\left( t \right)$ is always finite. There are two ways to go about this, and the other one is probably wrong, but I want to know why. 1) Since $S$ is finite, $\mathbb{E}\left[ {\mathbb{P}\left( {A|{X_t}} \right)|B} \right] = \sum\limits_{x \in S} {\mathbb{P}\left( {A|{X_t} = x} \right)\mathbb{P}\left( {{X_t} = x|B} \right)}  \Rightarrow f'\left( t \right) = \sum\limits_{x \in S} {\frac{d}{{dt}}\left( {\mathbb{P}\left( {A|{X_t} = x} \right)\mathbb{P}\left( {{X_t} = x|B} \right)} \right)} $. 2) Since ${f'}$ is finite, $\frac{d}{{dt}}\mathbb{E}\left[ {\mathbb{P}\left( {A|{X_t}} \right)|B} \right]$ is finite so $\frac{d}{{dt}}\mathbb{P}\left( {A|{X_t}} \right)$ is finite $\mathbb{P}\left( { \cdot |B} \right)$-almost surely. Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem then implies $f'\left( t \right) = \mathbb{E}\left[ {\frac{d}{{dt}}\mathbb{P}\left( {A|{X_t}} \right)|B} \right] = \sum\limits_{x \in S} {\frac{d}{{dt}}\left( {\mathbb{P}\left( {A|{X_t} = x} \right)} \right)\mathbb{P}\left( {{X_t} = x|B} \right)} $. Suppose 1) and 2) are both true. That would imply $\sum\limits_{x \in S} {\mathbb{P}\left( {A|{X_t} = x} \right)\frac{d}{{dt}}\left( {\mathbb{P}\left( {{X_t} = x|B} \right)} \right)}  = 0$, which I have strong reasons to believe is wrong. Suppose that my line of reasoning is wrong when I conclude that differentiation and expectation commute. Does 2) hold when they do commute? Under what (usual) applicable assumptions do they commute? EDIT: The following holds for a discrete random variable $X$: $\mathbb{E}\left[ {g\left( X \right)} \right] = \sum\limits_x {g\left( x \right)\mathbb{P}\left( {g\left( X \right) = g\left( x \right)} \right)}  = \sum\limits_x {g\left( x \right)\mathbb{P}\left( {X = x} \right)} $, where the first equality follows from definition, and the second is the law of unconscious statistician . Let $g\left( x \right) = \frac{d}{{dt}}\mathbb{P}\left( {A|{X^{\left( t \right)}} = x} \right)$, then $\mathbb{E}\left[ {\frac{d}{{dt}}\mathbb{P}\left( {A|{X^{\left( t \right)}}} \right)|B} \right] = \mathbb{E}\left[ {g\left( {{X^{\left( t \right)}}} \right)|B} \right] = \sum\limits_x {g\left( x \right)\mathbb{P}\left( {{X^{\left( t \right)}} = x|B} \right)}  = \sum\limits_x {\left( {\frac{d}{{dt}}\mathbb{P}\left( {A|{X^{\left( t \right)}} = x} \right)} \right)\mathbb{P}\left( {{X^{\left( t \right)}} = x|B} \right)} $.","['markov-chains', 'probability-theory', 'proof-verification', 'conditional-expectation', 'fake-proofs']"
1010085,Correctness of counting with product of generating functions,"In generating functions we can related the coefficients of the generating function with as sequence. $$f(x) = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0}f_nx^n$$ and the sequence that corresponds to it: $$( \ f_0 \ , \ f_1 \ , \ f_2 \ , \ ... \ , \ f_n \ , \ ...)$$ and these coefficients might be related to some counting problem and its kind of a way to ""organize"" the counting of some set. Now when we consider the product of two generating functions $A(x)B(x)$. The product can be interpreted the following way: Let $A(x)$ be the generating function for selecting items from set A,
  and let $B(x)$ be the generating function for selecting items from set
  B. If A and B are disjoint, then the generating function for selecting
  items from the union $A \cup B$ is the product $A(x) \cdot B(x) = C(x)$. This is the statement that I am seeking to understand better, either with a proof or an intuitive argument (ideally both). Recall that if the generating function of the product is $C(x) = A(x) \cdot B(x)$, then the coefficients of $C(x)$ is the convolution: $$c_n = \sum^{n}_{j=0} a_j b_{n-j}$$ What is incredible for me is that the convolution rule for counting, remains valid for many interpretation of ""selection"" (selection, as in the paragraph). I want to understand what are the limits of this word ""select"" and why. Also for two sets of objects we are interested in counting, say coefficients for$a_n$ and $b_n$, might have different combinatorial interpretations for the word ""select"", right? If the interpretation of the word select is different, does the product of the generating functions still hold as a valid method for computing mountings of the union of A and B? i.e. when we use the word select for counting things in $a_n$ and $b_n$, if the word select mean different things for $a_n$ and $b_n$, does $c_n$ still count the intended arrangements of objects? For example, I was told that, we could insist that distinct items be selected or we might allow the same item to be picked a limited number of times or any number of times. However, there are only 2 restrictions for our convolution coefficients to yield correct counting numbers and these are: the order in which items are selected is disregarded. restrictions on the selection of items from sets A and B also apply in selecting items from $A \cup B$. Why do we need those two rules to ensure the correctness that $c_n$ counts the number of ways to select n items from $A \cup B$? I was told that these two restrictions can be equivalently expressed as follows: Formally, there must be a bijection between n-element selections from
  $A \cup B$ and ordered pairs of selections from A and B containing a total
  of n elements. I was having trouble understanding how those two statements are related and thus, why the restrictions correspond to that bijection. Once we have those restrictions and we understand them, as far as I know the following sum gives the desired count.  If we let $c_n$ is the number of ways to select n items from $A \cup B$, then (for some reason) we observe that we can select n items by choosing j items from A and n - j items from B, where j is any number from 0 to n. This can be done in $a_j b_{n-j}$ ways. Summing over all the possible values of j gives a total of: $$c_n = \sum^{n}_{j=0} a_j b_{n-j}$$ ways to select n items from $A \cup B$. I was unsure why that was the case and how it would break if the conditions that were pre specified would break it. Why does the convolution give indeed the correct count?

1010123,Is there a rationality-preserving order isomorphism between $\mathbb{Q}$ and two disjoint open intervals?,"I have a homework question in a intro logic course, part of which requires me to Find an order preserving isomorphism between $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q} \cap ((0,1) \cup (2,3))$. So, I need an isomorphism between $\mathbb{Q}$ and two open intervals that preserves both order and rationality. I am familiar with how to do this for any single open interval. For example, $$f(x) = \frac{x}{1+|x|}$$ maps $\mathbb{Q}$ bijectively on to $(-1,1)$, preserving order and rationality. From this I can compose $f$ with some other simple bijection to map $\mathbb{Q}$ to any open interval. I figure it is convenient to begin again by apply the function $f$ so that the task boils down to finding a map from $(-1,1)$ on to $\mathbb{Q} \cap ((0,1) \cup (2,3))$. My initial thought was that if I attempted to split $(-1,1)$ at a rational number $q \in (-1,1)$, then I would have the dilemma of where to map $q$ to preserve the order. So then I figured that I needed to split $\mathbb{Q}$ at an irrational number $\alpha \in (-1,1)$. This way I don't need to map $\alpha$ to anything, and the order will be preserved automatically, provided I can find a map that send $(-1,\alpha)$ to $(0,1)$ and $(\alpha, 1)$ to $(2,3)$. However I cannot find a way to do this that preserves rationality. I would guess what I am trying to do is impossible, but Cantor's theorem on unbounded countable dense linear orders guarantees that some isomorphism exists. (If I am interpreting it correctly). Is there a way to get around the irrationality problem? Or am I way off?","['general-topology', 'model-theory', 'real-analysis']"
1010130,"""Uniform"" Convergence in Distribution (bounded Lipschitz metric)","I have been thinking about the following problem. Let me know if the notation below makes sense. Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the set of Borel probability measures on a metric space $(\mathbb{R}^{k}, ||\cdot ||)$. Consider two collections of measures $\mathbf{P}_1 \equiv \{P_1^{\theta}\}_{\theta \in \Theta}$ and $\mathbf{P}_2 \equiv \{P_2^{\theta}\}_{\theta \in \Theta}$, where $P^\theta_i \in \mathcal{P}$ for all $\theta \in \Theta$ and $i=1,2$ ($\Theta$ is some parameter space). I am interested in defining a notion of ""distance"" for the collections $\mathbf{P}_1$ and $\mathbf{P}_2$. For a fixed $\theta \in \Theta$, I can start by considering the bounded lipschitz metric on $\mathcal{P}$: \begin{equation}
\beta (\mathbf{P}_1, \mathbf{P}_2; \theta) \equiv \sup \Big\{ \Big| \int f dP_1^{\theta}-\int f dP^\theta_2 \Big| \: : \: ||f||_{\text{BL}} \leq 1  \Big\}  
\end{equation} where $||f||_{\text{BL}} \equiv \max \{ |f(x)| , \inf_{c}\{c : |f(x,y)| \leq c d(x,y) \}$ (see Van der Vaart and Wellner p. 73). It seems that I can then define the following notion of distance between the collections $\mathbf{P}_1$ and $\mathbf{P}_2:$ $$ \sup_{\theta \in \Theta} \beta(\mathbf{P}_1, \mathbf{P}_2; \theta),$$ and use this notion to say that a sequence of collections $\mathbf{P}_n$ converges to a collection $\mathbf{P}$ (uniformly in $\Theta$) if: $$\sup_{\theta \in \Theta} \beta (\mathbf{P}_n, \mathbf{P};\theta) \rightarrow 0,$$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. The question that I have is the following. Suppose that $g$ is a uniformly continuous function. Is it true that $$\mathbf{P}_n \rightarrow \mathbf{P} \implies \sup_{\theta} \sup \Big\{ \Big| \int f \circ g dP_n^{\theta}-\int f \circ g dP^\theta \Big| \: : \: ||f||_{\text{BL}} \leq 1  \Big\} \rightarrow 0.$$ I would appreciate any comments or ideas.

1010199,Fermat's Last Theorem: Contemplation.,"So my friend and I are studying elliptic curves and Fermat's Last Theorem appeared several times in the subject matter. So the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem was settled by Andrew Wiles with the work of many prominent mathematicians which I won't list because the list is rather long! At any rate, my friend suggested an alternative simple way to ""proof"" the last theorem. I am very skeptical and pessimistic about he's argument and; in fact, I believe there is a fundamental error somewhere in his logic that I haven't caught. However, his line of attack seems attractive at first. Here is his argument: It has been established, by Sophie Germain in the 1800's, that  $x^{3}+y^{3} \neq z^{3}$ for integral integers $x,y,$ and $z.$ Now this, equivalently, means that $(\frac{x}{z})^{3}+(\frac{y}{z})^{3}\neq 1$. Hence, it ""must"" be the case that either $(\frac{x}{z})^{3}+(\frac{y}{z})^{3} < 1$ or $(\frac{x}{z})^{3}+(\frac{y}{z})^{3} > 1$. Suppose the former. Assume that the $(\frac{x}{z})$ and $\frac{y}{z}$ are positive. Then we have that $\frac{x}{z}<1$ and $\frac{y}{z}<1$. Thusly, it can be shown inductively that $*$ $\quad$ $(\frac{x}{z})^{n} < (\frac{x}{z})^{n-1}< \cdots <(\frac{x}{z})^{3}<(\frac{x}{z})^{2}<\frac{x}{z}<1,$ for any integer $n>0.$ Similarly, we have $\dagger$ $\quad$  $(\frac{y}{z})^{n} < (\frac{y}{z})^{n-1}< \cdots <(\frac{y}{z})^{3}<(\frac{y}{z})^{2}<\frac{y}{z}<1,$ for any integer $n>0.$ Now, we know that for some appropriate $x,y,z \in \mathbb{Z}$, $x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}$ so that, in particular $(\frac{x}{z})^{2}+(\frac{y}{z})^{2}=1$. Then if we sum up $\dagger$ and $*$, we get $**$ $\quad \quad \quad$$(\frac{x}{z})^{n}+(\frac{y}{z})^{n} < \cdots <(\frac{x}{z})^{3}+(\frac{y}{z})^{3}<(\frac{x}{z})^{2}+(\frac{y}{z})^{2}<1,$ for any integer $n>0.$ Then he claims, here, that as $x^{3}+y^{3}=z^{3}$ has no solution, then $(\frac{x}{z})^{3}+(\frac{y}{z})^{3}< 1$, and so by $**$ $(\frac{x}{z})^{4}+(\frac{y}{z})^{4}<1$,...,$(\frac{x}{z})^{n}+(\frac{y}{z})^{n}<1$, and therefore, $x^{n}+y^{n}\neq z^{n}$ for $n>2$.

1010268,Can a principal ideal contain a non-principal ideal?,"I am trying to show that if $R$ is an integral domain such that every prime ideal of $R$ is principal then every ideal of $R$ is principal. To start this, suppose that $P$ is the set of ideals of $R$ that are not principal. Suppose that $P$ is nonempty. I am trying to apply Zorn's Lemma to show that $P$ has a maximal element and to do this, I want to show that every chain in $P$ is bounded above by $R$ itself. This leads to my question of whether a principal ideal can contain a non-principal ideal. Claim: Suppose that $R$ is a principal. Then any ideal $I$ of $R$ is a principal ideal. Proof: $R$ is principal so for some element $\alpha\in R$, $R=(\alpha)$. Suppose that $I$ is any ideal of $R$. Furthermore, suppose that $I$ is generated by two elements, say $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ so $I=(a_{1},a_{2})$. Since $I\subseteq R$, $a_{1},a_{2}\in R$ so since $R=(\alpha)$ there exist elements $\beta_{1},\beta_{2}\in R$ such that $\alpha\beta_{1}=a_{1},\alpha\beta_{2}=a_{2}$. Then since any element of $I$ is of the form $a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}$ where $b_{1},b_{2}\in R$, it follows that the elements of $I$ are of the form $\alpha(\beta_{1}b_{1}+\beta_{2}b_{2})$ where $\beta_{1}b_{1}+\beta_{2}b_{2}$. Since any element of $I$ is of this form, $I=(a_{1},a_{2})=(\alpha)$ so $I$ is a principal ideal. I then move onto the next part of the exercise which says to show that if $I$ is a non-principal ideal in $R$, then $I_{a}=(I,a)$ for some $a\in R$ is a principal ideal. $I\subseteq I_{a}$ so principal ideals can contain non-principal ideals.

On page 2, it says: Definition: Partial Derivatives Let $U \subset \mathbb R^m$ be open, let $F: U \to \mathbb R^m$ , and let $\mathbf a \in U$ . If $i \in \{1, \ldots , m\}$ , the partial derivative of $F$ with respect to $x_i$ at $\mathbf a$ is defined as follows: $$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{F(\mathbf a + h\mathbf e_i) - F(\mathbf a)}{h}.$$ Here $\mathbf e_i$ denotes a unit vector in the xi direction. Then, later it says: As we have defined it, the partial derivative $(\partial F)/(\partial x_i)(\mathbf a)$ is a vector. Specifically, if $F(\mathbf x) = (f_1(\mathbf x), \ldots, f_n(\mathbf x))$ , then $$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf a) = \left(\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf a), \ldots, \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf a)\right)$$ I don't see how the limit expression can be a vector.

1010591,What is the number of intersections of diagonals in a convex equilateral polygon?,"Question: [See here for definitions]. Consider an arbitrary convex regular polygon with $n$ -vertexes ( $n\geq 4$ ) and the $n$ -sequence $\langle \alpha_i~|~i<n\rangle$ of its angles which $\alpha_i$ is the angle corresponding to vertex labeled by $i$ and vertexes labeled by successive numbers are neighbors.  What is the number of intersection points of diagonals of such a shape with respect to $n,\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n$ ? Note that it is always less than or equal to $\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24}$ because in an ideal case when each intersection point is corresponding to a unique pair of diagonals (not two or more pairs) then by choosing $4$ vertexes of $n$ we will have two diagonals and this pair of diagonals determines an intersection point and this point is not an intersection point for any other pair of diagonals. But the difficulty is that even in the simplest case which our convex equilateral polygon is a convex regular polygon there are cases which more than one pairs of diagonals share a same point as an intersection and this decreases the total number of intersection points of diagonals. For example diagonals of a regular convex polygon with $6$ vertexes have only $13$ intersection points but $\frac{6\times 5\times 4\times 3}{24}=15$ because three pairs of diagonals shared a single point in the center as their intersection. Note that in more complicated regular convex polygons with $n\geq 6$ these shared points will occur in many other places as well as center of the shape.

A + B is compact if and only if for every bounded sequence $\lbrace x_n \rbrace$ in X, the sequence $\lbrace (A + B) x_n \rbrace$ has a convergent subsequence; certainly both $\lbrace A x_n \rbrace$ and $\lbrace B x_n \rbrace$ each have a convergent subsequence, and I've seen a few proofs that seem to think it straightforward that this implies $\lbrace (A + B) x_n \rbrace$ has one. This doesn't seem quite right to me. The way it appears one should try to make a convergent subsequence is to intersect the indices of the convergent subsequences for A and B individually. So, for example, if $\lbrace A x_{n_j} \rbrace$ and $\lbrace B x_{n_k} \rbrace$, then the idea is to take the set of indices $\lbrace n_m \rbrace := \lbrace n_j \rbrace \cap \lbrace n_k \rbrace$ and say that $\lbrace (A + B) x_{n_m} \rbrace$ converges as a sum of two further subsequences of the convergent subsequences for A and B. But what if that intersection is empty, for example if $\lbrace n_j \rbrace = 1, 3, 5, ...$ and $\lbrace n_k \rbrace = 2, 4, 6, ...$? Instinctively I would say ""if they're disjoint, just pick a different pair"", but how can one be sure that the intersection isn't empty for any chosen pair of convergent subsequences?

1011322,Optimal Strategy Game of Communicating without Overlap,"Today, I had a conversation which proceeded very poorly; indeed, I had this conversation with $n$ people, including myself, and everyone had something to say. Problem was that, for an unreasonably long time, it was always two or more people trying to speak at once - and everything was indecipherable. Then, people backed off and there were periods when no one was talking - only to trigger a few people to try to jump into the conversation, and overlap again! Eventually , by pure chance, one person got to talking alone (and never had to talk again), and, slowly but surely, everyone got their turn to speak. Now, being the mathematician that I am, I figured, hey, I can solve this problem. I want to give all $n$ people a sheet of paper describing the rules of conversation - a simple solution would be to assign each a time to speak, but that's not fair to the people who have to wait. So, I want to give all $n$ people the same set of rules to follow. I assume I recognize that, this means, at the first opportunity to speak, everyone will speak with equal probability, and it seems likely that there will be overlap - but then the strategies can differentiate based on the results of that first opportunity (though these people are poor listeners; from each opportunity, they only know whether they tried to speak, and whether there were multiple people, a single person, or no one speaking). To be very formal, define the problem as follows: A conversation is a series of discrete opportunities to talk, at which each player may choose either to attempt to talk, or to be silent. Anyone who successfully talks without interruption will not attempt to speak again. The conversation ends when everyone has spoken. The history of a conversation, will be a finite sequence of the three possible outcomes of an opportunity (no one talks, one person talks, many people talk) - it does not distinguish between $2$ and $3$ people talking. A strategy is a map taking the history of a conversation, and determining whether a given player will talk.  A mixed strategy is a probability distribution over of the set of possibly strategies, and represents, essentially, a non-deterministic strategy. And my question is thus: For what mixed strategy is the expected length of the conversation (measured in opportunities missed) minimized when $n$ people play the strategy against itself? What I know so far are the following strategies: $n=1$: The person should talk at the first opportunity. The conversation will have length $1$ and will be very lonely. $n=2$: The people should maximize the probability that exactly one of them talks at each turn - and, if they both choose to talk or both not to, they gain no useful information about the other, and hence should continue with the same strategy. Thus, the best strategy is to talk with probability $\frac{1}2$ until one of them is successful, after which the other one speaks, yielding an expected length of $3$. $n=3$: This one is trickier and I don't have a proof. I'm fairly certain that the following strategy is locally optimal, and I suspect that it is the best, but I'm not sure. We use three states for which a person can be in - everyone starts in state A: (State A) Speak with probability $p$ at the next opportunity. If no one speaks, remain in state A. If one person speaks, transition to the two person game. If many people, including yourself, speak, go to state B. If many people, not including yourself speak (implying the two others spoke), go to state C. (State B) Don't speak at the next opportunity, then transition to state A if no one speaks. If one person speaks, transition to the two state game. (No more than one person will ever speak in this state) (State C) Speak at the next opportunity; you are guaranteed to be successful. The idea here is that we either escape the dilemma when one person speaks out of the three, or when two people do (and then the other person talks while the two who overlapped are in state B, silent). Using that the expected length of a conversation for two people is $3$, we can find the expected length $\ell$ of this conversation as
$$\ell = p^3\cdot(2+\ell)+3p^2(1-p)\cdot (2+3)+3p(1-p)^2\cdot (1+3)+(1-p)^3\cdot(1+\ell)$$
which yields the minimum, according to Mathematica
$$p=\frac{1}{4} \left(2-\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{4 \sqrt{6}-6}\right)\approx .37$$
$$\ell=\frac{1}{6} \left(21+\sqrt{9+24 \sqrt{6}}\right)\approx 4.87.$$ Given that the problem of characterizing the optimal strategy for arbitrary $n$ may be extremely difficult, I would not expect answers to find one (but, if you find one, or have something you suspect to be optimal, I'd love to see it)- indeed, even the case of $n=4$ is interesting to me, since I have no handle on what the strategy might be.

1011354,Banach Matchbox Problem,"Banach Matchbox Problem: Suppose a mathematician carries two matchboxes at all times: one in
  his left pocket and one in his right. Each time he needs a match, he
  is equally likely to take it from either pocket. Suppose he reaches
  into his pocket and discovers for the first time that the box picked
  is empty. If it is assumed that each of the matchboxes originally
  contained $n$ matches, what is the probability that there are exactly $k$
  matches in the other box? I'm wondering whether the following reasoning is right, because it doesn't match up with the correct probability. But here goes my reasoning: Assuming there are $k$ matches left in the other box, we have had to take $2n-k+1$ matches to notice there are none left. The total number of ways in which we could have picked those is $2 {2n - k \choose n}$, for either the matchbox in the left or right pocket has $k$ matches left inside, and in the $(2n-k+1)$th pick we would have found an empty box. The total number of possibilities, taken over all possible sizes $k$, would then be $\sum_{m=0}^{n} 2{2n-m \choose n}$. So I'd assume the overall probability would be $\frac{2 {2n - k \choose n}}{\sum_{m=0}^{n} 2 {2n-m \choose n}} =\frac{{2n - k \choose n}}{\sum_{m=0}^{n} {2n-m \choose n}}$. However, the mentioned solution is ${2n - k \choose n} (\tfrac{1}{2})^{2n-k}$. Where is my reasoning wrong? Thanks in advance.",['probability']

1011361,Outlier Contained in Prediction Interval (Tme series Forecasting Problem),"In my stats class today, the professor was showing us some output from MINITAB on a prediction interval that was calculated (from time series data using standard linear regression). For one of the prediction intervals (which I believe was a forecast in the future), MINITAB had an X marked with the statement that there was an outlier in the prediction interval. I searched the MINITAB documentation and can't find a satisfactory explanation for how a computed prediction interval can contain an outlier. Does anyone know what this means? I know the SE of the PI increases with distance from xbar, but what criterion would you judge to determine the PI is ""too wide"" (which is what I assume the program is doing) TIA, Matt","['statistics', 'regression', 'time-series', 'statistical-inference']"
1011363,Why are infinite sums so much harder to calculate than the associated infinite integral?,"It seems that with continuous functions, we have in calculus an apparatus for ""short cutting"" an infinite sum. However, when we move to the discrete case, it seems that we don't have the equivalent theoretical machinery. What is it about sums that makes them so much more intractable than their associated integrals? In other words, why isn't there a fundamental theorem of infinite sums like there is for calculus?","['summation', 'calculus', 'big-picture', 'soft-question']"

1011451,Let $G$ denote an arbitrary group. Prove: The center of any group $G$ is a normal subgroup of $G$,"Let $G$ denote an arbitrary group. Prove: The center of any group $G$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ Let $G$ be a group and $C$ the center, i.e., for any $a \in C$ and any $x \in G$, $xa=ax$. So, $a = xax^{-1}$. Thus $xax^{-1} \in C$. So, $C$ is normal. Is this proof correct? It seemed too trivial for me to think so. Something tells me I need to show that for any $y \in G$, $xax^{-1}y=yxax^{-1}$. Would this be correct?

1011466,An interesting proof using Green's representation formula?,"Let $B_R(0)$ be a ball in $\mathbb R^3 $ and define $$u(x)=\int_{B_R(0)}\frac{1}{|y-x|}dy$$ Prove that $$ u(x) =

    \frac{4}{3}\pi \frac{R^3}{|x|} & \quad \text{for $|x|>R$}
  \end{cases}$$ My attempt: For $|x|>R$, $u$ is harmonic and it goes to zero as $|x|$ goes to infinity, so we can use the fundamental solution $\frac{c}{|x|}$, c is some constant. By the continuity of $u(x)$, we get $u(x)=\frac{4}{3}\pi \frac{R^3}{|x|}$. For $|x| \le R$, I found that the function $w(x)=\frac{2}{3}\pi(3R^2-|x|^2)$ solves $\Delta w=-4\pi$, and $w(x)=\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3$ on $\partial B_R(0)$. Therefore I can use the Green's representatio formula in a ball.
So I get something like this, when $n=3$: $$u(x)=\frac{R^2-|x|^2}{R^2}\int _{\partial B_R(0)}\frac{1}{|x-y|^3}ds(y)+\frac{3}{R^3}\int_{B_R(0)}\frac{1}{|x-y|}-\frac{R|y|}{|y|^2x-R^2y}\,dy,$$ t hen I don't know what to do next to get the desired equation $u(x)=\int_{B_R(0)}\frac{1}{|y-x|}dy$.

1011471,Continuous function that has limit at infinity is uniformly continuous (another viewpoint),"I know how to prove that, given a continuous $f:[0,\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $\displaystyle \lim _ {x \rightarrow \infty} f(x)=L$, then $f$ is uniformly continuous (by means of taking a big enough compact set etc) But I had a different idea... If I compactified $[0,\infty)$ by adjointing $\infty$, and defining $f(\infty)=L$, I would have a continuous function on a compact set... hence, a uniformly continuous function. But this is not yet right, since I have no metric in $[0,\infty]$ a priori. I could infuse a metric on the space (for example, using the fact that this space is regular and has countable basis), but I don't have a way to relate the metrics from $[0,\infty)$ to $[0,\infty]$ in order to ""preserve"" uniform continuity. Can this problem be solved?","['general-topology', 'analysis']"

But when I tried to search information about this space, I could not find any reference or wiki document. I would like to know if there is a density argument relating schwartz function and $L^p$ Lipschitz space(with respect to $\Lambda_\alpha^p$ norm). Does anybody know good reference about this? My question arose when studying the following theorem. Let $f\in \Lambda_\alpha^1$ and $\displaystyle p<1+\frac{\alpha}{d}$. Then, $f\in L^p$ and $\lVert f \rVert_{L^p}\leq B\lVert f\rVert_{\Lambda_\alpha^1}$ In the lecture note it is proved that this is true if $f$ is in addition schwartz function. But it does not say more and ends proof, so I was wondering if any density argument was used here. (The argument in the lecture note proceeded as follows. $S$ and $S'$ will denote the space of schwartz function and the space of tempered distribution respectively. It defines particular $\psi_j\in S'(j\in\mathbb{N})$ such that 
$\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^\infty\psi_j=\delta_0$ where the limit is in $S'$sense. Then $f=f*\delta_0=f*\sum_{j=1}^\infty\psi_j$ pointwisely. (Note that this makes sense only when $f\in S$). using particular $\psi_j$, author shows that the last term converges to some function(say $g$) in $L^p$ sense, and this function $g$ should be $f$.
