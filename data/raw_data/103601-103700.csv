1451349,"Looking for a special class of ideals such that If every ascending chain of ideals from this class stabilizes, then $R$ is a Noetherian ring.","A commutative ring $R$ is called Noetherian if  any one of the following holds: $1.$ Every ascending chain of ideals in $R$ stabilizes, that is,
$$
I_1\subseteq I_2\subseteq I_3\subseteq\cdots
$$
implies the existence of $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $I_n=I_{n+1}=I_{n+2}=\cdots$. $2.$ Every ideal in $R$ is finitely generated. But I. S. Cohen proved that for a ring to be Noetherian it suffices that every prime ideal is finitely generated. So for a ring to be Noetherian we need to check above condition $2$ only for prime ideals. So the natural question is there any class of ideals for choosing ideals $I_i$ of Ascending Chain Condition for proving that $R$ is Noetherian? Here are two cases which does not work: $1.$ Every ascending chain of prime ideals terminates even $R$ is not noetherian. So we can not choose $I_i$ only from Spec($R$). Example: $R=\dfrac{k[x_1,x_2,...]}{I^2}$, where $I=(x_1,x_2,...)$ $2$. Every chain of primary ideals terminates even $R$ is not Noetherian. Example:  $\prod_{i\in\Bbb N} F_i$ where the $F_i$ are fields. This is clearly not Noetherian, and because it is commutative and von Neumann regular, all of its primary ideals are maximal.

1451632,Extension of bounded convex function to boundary,"Suppose $U$ is a convex open set in $\mathbb R^n$, and $f$ is a bounded convex function on $U$. $f$ is then automatically continuous on $U$. The question is: Can we always extend $f$ continuously to $\bar{U}$? I know boundedness of $f$ is necessary, otherwise we can construct $g=1/[x-x^2]$ on unit open interval. Boundedness of $f$ is also sufficient in one dimensional case. If the extension in general exists, the only reasonable way to construct it is via: find a fixed point $x_0$ in $U$; for each point x on $\partial U$, consider the line $L$ joining $x_0$ and $x$; $f$ restricting on $L \cap U$ is convex; we do the extension in this one dimensional case.

Now \begin{align*} \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 2x - 1 = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \end{align*} and \begin{align*} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = - (-2y) = 2 y = \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \end{align*} Hence the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied, which is a necessary condition for being analytic, but not sufficient.

The case $a=2$ reduces to the existence of a prime $p$ such that $p+2$ and $p+4$ are also prime. The only such tuple is $p=3\rightarrow (3,5,7)$. A modular argument takes care of uniqueness. The tuple $(a,b,c)=(2,5,7)$ follows from $p=3$. I was wondering if there is a more elegant approach utilizing many number theoretic tools (i.e. elliptic curves, algebraic number theory, ect.)?

Out of curiosity, I tried to rotate the book by holding the spine and observe how much it can rotate, until three of the vertices touched a point of the drawer. A question came to me as I had reached a point of time when the book could no longer rotate further: By keeping the height of the drawer constant, what is the minimum length of the drawer such that the book can be stored inside it? (A silly question, I know, considering that drawers are always quite long, but aroused my interest nevertheless..) I proceeded by measuring the dimensions I think I need to solve my problem. I have measured:
The height of the drawer, $17 cm$ The length of the spine of the book, $2.2 cm$ The height of the spine of the book, $17.8 cm$ And I have attempted to represent the problem in the diagram below, solving for $x$ With my mathematics knowledge up to grade 10, initially, I had thought that this will be solved using simultaneous equations, but after pondering for quite some time, I had managed to come up with an approach using R-Formula: I started by setting $\angle WDA=\theta$ , and since the drawer and my book are rectangular, $\angle BAX=\angle DCZ=\theta$ Using these information, I expressed $x$ in trigonometric terms: $x=17.8 \sin\theta + 2.2 \cos\theta$ Using the R-Formula, I get $x=\sqrt(321.68)\sin(\theta+7.045769125^\circ)$ . Next, I attempt to solve for $\theta$ by expressing $WZ=17$ in trigonometric terms as well. I get: $17=17.8\cos\theta+2.2\sin\theta$ $17=\sqrt(321.68)\cos(\theta-7.045769125^\circ)$ $\theta\approx 25.63217562^\circ$ Finally, I substituted this value of $\theta$ into $x$ and I get: $x=\sqrt(321.68) \sin(32.67794475^\circ)$ $x\approx 9.683637217cm$ My actual measurement of the value of $x$ is $10.5cm$ . I did expect inaccuracy as I measured just with a fifteen-centimetre ruler, a pair of wobbly hands and considered parallax error, although I did not expect the discrepancy to be nearly $1cm$ .
