1250975,A proof involving the Euler phi function,"Problem: Let $\varphi$ be the Euler phi function, where for any $n \in \mathbb{Z^+}$ , $\varphi(n)$ is the number of positive integers less than $n$ that are relatively prime with $n$ . Show that if $d \mid n$ , then $\varphi(d) \mid \varphi(n)$ , where $d$ and $n$ are positive integers. My attempt: Because $d \mid n$ , there exist some $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $da = n$ . If $d = 1$ , then $\varphi(d) = 1$ , so $\varphi(d) \mid \varphi(n)$ for any $n \in \mathbb{Z^+}$ and we are done. So instead, suppose that $d \neq 1$ . Now I'm trying to show that $\{\Delta \in \mathbb{Z^+}\mid \Delta < d, \ \gcd(\Delta, d) = 1\}\subseteq \{\Delta \in \mathbb{Z^+}\mid \Delta < d, \ \gcd(\Delta, n) = 1\}$ by showing that whenever an integer $\Delta < d$ is relatively prime with $d$ (so that it is ""inside"" $\varphi(d)$ ), then it is also relatively prime with $n$ . However, I realised that this is not possible to show. If $n = \Delta \cdot d$ , then the premise $d \mid n$ is true, but if $\gcd(\Delta, d) = 1$ ,  then $\gcd(\Delta, n) = \Delta$ , so the subset relation from a few lines above cannot be true in this situation. So I think this can't be the right approach. If someone can please give me a pointer, I will be very grateful.","['number-theory', 'proof-verification', 'modular-arithmetic', 'elementary-number-theory']"

Proof: $AA^{-1}=I$ So we must have: $$\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n(A)_{ij}(A^{-1})_{ji}=1$$ For this to occur, the instances where $(A)_{ij}=1$ must exactly occur when the instances where $(A^{-1})_{ji}=1$ occur [otherwise our $1$ 's would multiply with zero, and the sum would be zero]. This will be in the first row and column, and then the second row and column, etc. $(A)_{ij}=(A^{-1})_{ji}=1$ and we can take the transpose of both sides here and see that: $$(A^T)_{ij}=(A^{-1})_{ij}$$ and hence $A^T = A^{-1}$","['permutations', 'matrices', 'solution-verification', 'abstract-algebra', 'permutation-matrices']"

Here is my attempt: Since $1000000 = 2^6 \cdot 5^6$, each of its divisors has the form $2^a \cdot 5^b$, and a decomposition of 1000000 into a product of five factors has the form
$$
1000000 = (2^{a_1} \cdot 5^{b_1})(2^{a_2} \cdot 5^{b_2})(2^{a_3} \cdot 5^{b_3})(2^{a_4} \cdot 5^{b_4})(2^{a_5} \cdot 5^{b_5})

conditions
$$
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 6, b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 + b_5 = 6
$$
The total number of systems of $a_i$ which satisfy the first equation is $210$ and the same number is for $b_i$. Thus the total number of decompositions is $210 \cdot 210 = 44100$. 
However, in this enumeration, factorizations which differ only in the brder of the factors have been counted separately; that is, some factorizations are counted several times each. To get the number of distinct unordered decompositions I must, at first, substract the number of ordered decompositions with at least two identical factors and, at second, divide resulting number by $5!$ to leave only unordered ones. And I'm stuck at the step of counting the number of ordered decompositions with at least two identical factors. 
The number of decompositions with $k$ identical factors is $(\lfloor\dfrac{a}{k}\rfloor + 1)(\lfloor\dfrac{b}{k}\rfloor+1){5 \choose k}$, that is, the number of decompositions with two identical factors is $16 \cdot {5 \choose 2} = 160$, three identical factors - $9 \cdot {5 \choose 3} = 90$, four ones - $4 \cdot {5 \choose 4} = 20$ and five ones - $4 \cdot {5 \choose 5} = 4$. Thus the number of distinct decompositions must be equal $\dfrac{44100-160-90-20-4}{5!}$, but this number is not integral. I suppose that the numbers of decompositions with $k$ identical factors overlap and I misuse inclusion-exclusion principle. But I have no idea how I can count that overlapped decompositions.

1251306,How to prove the cubic formula without root extraction,"I'm trying to prove the cubic formula, in the following form: Given a field $F$ and $x,p,q\in F$, define $m=\frac p3$ and $n=\frac q2$, and suppose also that $\gamma,\tau$ are given such that $\gamma^2=n^2+m^3$ and $\tau^3=\gamma-n\ne0$. Then $x^3+px+q=0$ if and only if $x=\omega\tau-\frac m{\omega\tau}$ for some $\omega$ satisfying $\omega^3=1$. (I have already reduced the statement from the more general $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0$ by a linear transformation.) The usage of $\gamma$ and $\tau$ substitutes for the extraction of square and cube roots, and allows me to stick to just field axioms in the proof - ideally I want this proof to work for any field with characteristic other than $2$ or $3$. But making this approach work with Cardano's method is giving me some issues. Since the reverse implication is just a matter of algebra with the given expressions of $\tau,\gamma$, suppose that we are given $x$ such that $x^3+px+q=0$; we want to find some root of unity $\omega$ satisfying $x=\omega\tau-\frac m{\omega\tau}$. The key of Cardano's method is to observe that the conditions $u+v=x$, $uv+m=0$ together with the condition on $x$ yields a quadratic polynomial $z^2+qz-m^3=0$ whose roots are $u^3$, $v^3$, and solving this with the quadratic equation gives something amenable to a cube root extraction. But why can we choose such $u,v$ in the first place? Equivalently, why should we expect a priori that the ""substitution"" $x=u-\frac mu$ has a solution in $u$? It follows from the quadratic formula, with discriminant $x^2+4m$, but I see no reason to believe that this is a square given only $\gamma$ and $\tau$. If we assume that there is a $\Delta^2=x^2+4m$, then $u=\frac x2+\Delta$ and $v=\frac x2-\Delta$ solve the equations, so we can proceed as normal: $u^6+qu^3-m^3=0$, so by the quadratic formula with discriminant $q^2+4m^3=(2\gamma)^2$, we get $u^3=-n\pm\gamma$ and $v^3=-n\mp\gamma$; in one case we have $u^3=\gamma-n=\tau^3$ so $\frac u\tau$ is the desired root of unity, and in the other case $\frac v\tau$ is the desired root of unity (since $x=u-\frac mu=v-\frac mv$).","['abstract-algebra', 'diophantine-equations', 'systems-of-equations', 'real-analysis']"

So i am thinking something like that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}  = (\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{i \partial v}{\partial x}$) ; $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y } = (\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} +\frac{i \partial v}{\partial y}$) and the cauchy rieman equation is $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} =- \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$. Now i really do not know how to go about this problem, i kept asking what exactly am i looking for here. Help anyone.","['differential-operators', 'complex-analysis']"

I substitute this in, and now I have $$FG''= c^2F''G +L$$ I don't know how to make this separable--obviously if I divide both sides with $FG$ as usual, then I will have that annoying constant $\frac {L}{FG} $ and I don't know how to make it separable then. Can anybody help me?

One of the goals, as I understand, is to answer the following question: Given $L/K$ abelian, $g$ a divisor of $[L : K]$ , describe all those primes $\mathfrak p$ of $K$ which are unramified in $L$ and split into exactly $g$ primes. When $K = \mathbb{Q}$ , I can see how to answer the question: find some number $m$ , divisible only by ramified primes, for which $L \subseteq F :=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ , where $\zeta$ is a primitive $m$ th root of unity. Via the mapping $x \mapsto (\zeta \mapsto \zeta^x)$ , one can identify $(\mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z})^{\ast}$ with $Gal(F/\mathbb{Q})$ , and therefore identify $H = \Gal(F/K)$ as a subgroup of units modulo $m$ . Then, an unramified, positive prime number $p$ splits into $g$ primes in $K$ , if and only if $g$ is the smallest number for which $p^g \in H$ .  Obviously such primes may be characterized by ""congruence conditions"" modulo $m$ . Similarly, I can sort of see that for a principal prime ideal $\pi \mathcal O_K$ of $K$ , with $\pi$ being ""positive"" (in terms of the various embeddings $K \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ ), one can embed $K$ into a cyclotomic extension $K(\zeta)$ and put congruence conditions modulo $m \mathcal O$ on how $\pi$ splits. But what does class field theory say about the splitting of a nonprincipal prime ideal?

(Besides mapping each automorphism to its corresponding coset in $\text{Aut}(G) / \text{Inn}(G)$ .) Any group $G$ acts on itself via conjugation: $g * h = ghg^{-1}$ . So there is a corresponding homomorphism $\varphi : G \to \text{Sym}(G)$ defined by $\varphi(g) = (h \mapsto g*h)$ . The kernel of this action is clearly $Z(G)$ , so $Z(G) \trianglelefteq G$ . The image of $\varphi$ is clearly $\text{Inn}(G)$ , the set of all conjugation automorphisms of $G$ , so $\text{Inn}(G) \leq \text{Sym}(G)$ . By the first isomorphism theorem, $G / Z(G) \cong \text{Inn}(G)$ . It follows that $\text{Inn}(G) \leq \text{Aut}(G)$ . What we DON'T get from this argument is that $\text{Inn}(G)$ is normal in $\text{Aut}(G)$ . So far I've only seen proofs that analyze what happens when you conjugate an inner automorphism by an automorphism: Inner automorphisms form a normal subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ , Set of all inner automorphisms is a normal subgroup .

That may be trivial, but I am stumped. Second question (quantitative): Let $f \in Lip (M \times N)$ be generic. Let $\varepsilon > 0$. How well can we approximate $f$ by products of Lipschitz functions on $M$ and $N$? More precisely, if $C(\varepsilon)$ is the least $C \geq 0$ such that there exist $n \geq 0$ and $(g_1, \cdots, g_n) \in Lip (M)^n$, $(h_1, \cdots, h_n) \in Lip (N)^n$ with: $$\|f-\sum_{k=1}^n g_k \otimes h_k \|_\infty \leq \varepsilon,$$ $$\sum_{k=1}^n  \|g_k\|_{Lip(M)} \|h_k\|_{Lip(N)} \leq C,$$ then what is the behaviour of $C(\varepsilon)$ as $\varepsilon$ goes to $0$?

(b) Conversely, show that if $\delta = 0$ and $b^2 - 4ac \neq 0$ then there is a unique singular point on $C$. Given these two conditions we can classify the curve as two intersecting lines or a single point. So there is one singular point on the curve. This is from wikipedia . (c) Let $L$ be the line $y = \alpha x + \beta$ with $\alpha \neq 0$. Show that the intersection of $L$ and $C$ consists of either zero, one, or two points. Substitute the equation of the line into the equation of the conic. Then we get a quadratic equation $(a + \alpha b + \alpha^2 c)x^2 + (\beta b + 2\alpha\beta c + d + \alpha e)x + (c\beta^2 + \beta e + f) = 0$. This equation has zero, one, or two solutions.

1252144,Does every cover have an irredundant subcover?,"While composing an answer for this question , I got troubled by a technical point. I wanted to assert the existence of an irredundant subcover of a given open cover, but realized I'm not sure how to guarantee that this exists. I got around this technicality in that particular situation by using other aspects of the setup, but now I want to understand the general situation. I'll phrase the question in the language of topology, but it is really purely a set-theoretic question. Let us call an open cover $\{U_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$ irredundant if no $U_\lambda$ can be dropped, i.e. if $\{U_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda'}$ is never a cover if $\Lambda'$ is a proper subset of $\Lambda$; equivalently, if for each $\lambda\in\Lambda$, $\bigcap_{\mu\neq \lambda} (U_\mu)^c$ is nonempty. Given a topological space $X$ with an arbitrary open cover $\{U_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$, does there always exist an irredundant subcover? Why? Clearly there is no problem if $\Lambda$ is finite (or if $X$ is compact so that we can first pass to a finite subcover): just drop redundant $U_\lambda$'s one at a time until the cover is irredundant. But what if $\Lambda$ has much bigger cardinality? At first I thought we ought to be able to construct an irredundant subcover using some appropriate form of the axiom of choice. After all, I thought, all we have to do is drop the redundant $U_\lambda$'s. (I.e. those such that $\bigcap_{\mu\neq \lambda}(U_\mu)^c$ is empty.) We can't drop them all at once, unfortunately, since we might not be left with a cover. But if we drop them one at a time, and reevaluate which are redundant after each drop, then, well, AC is designed for organizing an infinite sequence of choices of this kind. For example we could try: by the well-ordering theorem, impose a well-order on $\Lambda$. Then the set of $\lambda$'s corresponding to redundant $U_\lambda$'s has a least element, and this is what we drop first. Rinse and repeat. Or (this was my first idea), the setup seems custom made for Zorn's lemma: the subcovers of a given cover form a nonempty poset under reverse inclusion, and the irredundant covers are precisely the maximal elements of this poset. The problem is that in the end, I don't actually think one can generally arrive at an irredundant cover, even when it exists, by dropping redundant $U_\lambda$'s one at a time. The example I have in mind is, let $X$ be any nonempty space at all, let $\Lambda = \mathbb{N}$, and let $U_1,U_2,\dots = X$. This example shows that both of the above approaches will fail. If we try to construct an irredundant subcover by repeatedly dropping the first redundant $U_n$, we get the sequence of subcovers $$ \{U_n\}_{n\geq 1}\supset \{U_n\}_{n\geq 2}\supset \dots$$ and the procedure never lands on an irredundant one since the limit is empty, which isn't a cover. This very sequence also shows the hypotheses of Zorn's lemma aren't met (in the attempt above to use Zorn's lemma): here is an increasing chain in the poset of subcovers that does not have an upper bound. This example seems to me to show that the AC-based approaches are barking up the wrong tree. On the other hand, evidently there is an irredundant cover here: any individual $U_n$ will do the job. So maybe there is still hope that the question's answer is yes?","['set-theory', 'general-topology']"

1252249,Quotient Maps and Compact Hausdroff Spaces,"The book I am using for my Introduction of Topology course is Principles of Topology by Fred H. Croom. Prove that if $X$  and $Y$ are compact Hausdroff space and $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous surjection, then $f$ is a quotient map. This is what I understand: A space $X$ is compact provided that every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover. A Hausdorff Space is a space in which distinct points have disjoint neighborhoods. Since $X$ and $Y$ are two topological spaces and $f: X\rightarrow Y$ a surjective map. The map $f$ is said to be a quotient map provided a subset $U$ of $Y$ is open in $Y$ if and only if $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$. Equivalently, subset $U$ of $Y$ closed in $Y$ if and only if $f^{-1}(U)$ closed in $X$. From what we are given from the problem statement: The map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is surjective. Thus for any $B\subset Y$, we have $f^{-1}(Y-B)=X-f^{-1}(B)$. The map $f: X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous. In other words, $U$ open in $Y\Rightarrow$ $f^{-1}(U)$ open in $X$. All I need to show is $U\subseteq Y$, $f^{-1}(U)$ open in $X\Rightarrow U$ open in $Y$. My question is, how would I use the fact that $X$ and $Y$ are compact Hausdroff spaces to prove point 3? Now every compact space is locally compact, meaning for every $x\in X$, there is an open set containing $x$ for which $\overline{U}$ is compact. I'm probably incorrect with many of the following implications but it's a really rough start with what I had in mind. Let $A$ be a neighborhood of $a\in X$ that is disjoint from other neighborhoods of distinct points from $a$ in $X$. Now, $f(A)$ is a neighborhood of some $b$ in $Y$. Then $\overline{f({A})}$ is a compact subset of $Y$. Granted that last part is probably a big jump that I can't assume. My idea was to some how eventually show that $f(A)\subset Y$, $f^{-1}(f(A))$ open in $X\Rightarrow f(A)$ open in $Y$. It's just a rough idea. If I am on to something with what I just stated, how would I go about constructing the proof? Any suggestions? Sorry for the long read.

1252590,$\int_a^b f(x) g'(x) dx = 0$ implies $f$ is constant,"Given $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, $\forall g$ which is a continuously differentiable function on $[a,b]$, with $g(a)=g(b)=0$, the following equation is satisfied: $\int_a^b f(x) g'(x) dx = 0$. I want to show that $f$ is a constant. This is a question similar to this , but that question ask $\int_a^b f(x) g(x) dx = 0$. I have tried taking $g = (x-a)(b-x)$, but since I don't know whether $f(x)$ is differentiable, I cannot take $g = f(x-a)(b-x)$ as in that question. Thank you.","['calculus', 'real-analysis']"
1252602,Analysis of sorting Algorithm with probably wrong comparator?,"It is an interesting question from an Interview, I failed it. An array has $n$ different elements $[A_1 , A_2, ..., A_n]$ （random order）. We have a comparator $C$, but it has a probability  $p$ to return correct results. Now we use $C$ to implement sorting algorithm (any kind, bubble, quick etc..) After sorting we have $[A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, ..., A_{i_n}]$ (It could be wrong) . Now given a number $m$ ($m < n$), the question is as follows: What is Expectation of size $S$ of Intersection between $\{A_1, A_2, ...， A_m\}$ and $\{A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, ..., A_{i_n}\},$ in other words, what is $E[S]$? Any relationship among $m$, $n$ and $p$ ? If we use different sorting algorithm, how will $E[S]$ change ? My idea is as follows: When $m=n$, $E[S] = n$, surely. When $m=n-1$, $E[S] = n-1+P(A_n$ in $A_{i_n})$.
I don't know how to complete the answer but I thought it could be solved through induction.. Any simulation methods would also be fine I think.","['probability-theory', 'algorithms', 'combinatorics', 'sorting', 'probability']"
1252621,"Find the value of $a$, $b$ and $c$ for the given limit.","Question - Find the values of $a$, $b$ and $c$ so that $$ \lim_{x\to 0} \cfrac{ae^x - b\cos x +c e^{-x} }{x\sin x} = 2 $$ This is what I've tried yet : For $ x\to 0 $ the numerator must also tend to zero as : $ e^x , \ \cos x, e^{-x} $ all $\to 1$   for $x \to 0$ . Therefore, we have: 
$$ 
a - b + c = 0 \\
\color{blue}{\text{OR}} \\  b = a + c \\ 
$$ Now, plugging this in the original equation: $$\lim_{x\to 0} \cfrac{ae^x -(a+c)\cos x + ce^{-x} }{x^2 \times \frac{\sin x}{x} } = 2 $$ Which implies - $$\lim_{x\to 0} \cfrac{a(e^x - \cos x) + c(e^{-x} - \cos x) }{x^2} =2 $$ I do get a positive wave that there is some application of expansion series of $e^x \ \& \ \cos x $ . I tried that too but that just didn't work. May be I'm not doing right simplification. Any help will be greatly appreciated.","['taylor-expansion', 'limits']"
