1337678,My brother asked me to explain a algebra problem. How should I explain it?,"So the problem is: $$\frac{4}{x}+\frac{6}{2}=x$$
And we solved it using the pq formula. But than he asked me: How do I know when I should apply pq to similar equations like this
  and not just: $$4 + 3 = x^2$$ $$x = \sqrt{7}$$ ? Do I have to just test to find out if its wrong, and than just try all
  possible solutions until I find the correct one or can I see it some
  how? I saw right away how to solve it but I do not really know why, so long ago I dealt with problems like this. Anyone have a idea how to explain it?","['quadratics', 'algebra-precalculus']"
1337703,why does Lie bracket of two coordinate vector fields always vanish?,"This is really puzzling me. Say we are dealing with a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ . Suppose $\nabla$ is the unique torsion free connection on $M$ that is compatible with $g$ . Suppose we are in a neighbourhood $U$ with coordinate map $(x^1,\cdots, x^m )$ . Since the connection is torsion free, $$\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i},\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\right]=\nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}}{\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}}-\nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}}{\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}}.$$ And since the $\Gamma_{i,j}^k$ is symmetric on $i,j$ , the right hand side of the above equation will vanish. So the Lie bracket will be $0$ . Now here is my confusion. If I start out with $m$ linearly independent vector fields $Y_1, \cdots, Y_m$ , then I can find a coordinate system $(y_1,\cdots, y_m)$ such that $Y_i = \frac{\partial }{\partial y_i}$ (Correct me if I am wrong, because I am not sure about this) . Then arguing as above, I can show that the Lie bracket of $Y_i$ and $Y_j$ vanishes. I know Lie bracket shouldn't vanish on any two random vector fields I pick. So there must be something wrong with my argument here. Thank you in advance!","['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry']"
1337704,Two different trigonometric identities giving two different solutions,"Using two different sum-difference trigonometric identities gives two different results in a task where the choice of identity seemed unimportant. The task goes as following: Given  $\cos 2x =-\frac {63}{65} $ , $\cos y=\frac {7} {\sqrt{130}}$, under the condition $0<x,y<\frac {\pi}{2}$, calculate $x+y$. The first couple of steps are the same: finding  $\sin$ and $\cos$ values for both $x$ and $y$. From $\cos 2x$ we have: \begin{align*}
\cos 2x &=-\frac {63}{65} \\
\cos2x &= \cos^2x-\sin^2x = \cos^2x - (1-\cos^2x)=2\cos^2x -1 \\
2\cos^2x -1 &= -\frac {63}{65} \\
2\cos^2x &=\frac {-63+65}{65} \\
\cos^2x &=\frac {1}{65} \\
\cos x &=\frac {1} {\sqrt{65}} 
\end{align*}
(taking only the positive value of $\cos x$ because $\cos x$ is always positive under the given domain) \begin{align*}
\sin^2x &=1-\frac {1}{65} \\
\sin^2x &=\frac {64}{65}   \\
\sin x &=\frac {8} {\sqrt{65}} 
\end{align*}
(again, only positive value) From $\cos y$ we have: \begin{align*}
\cos y &=\frac {7} {\sqrt{130}} \\
\cos^2y &=\frac {49} {130} \\
\sin^2y &=1-\frac {49} {130} \\
\sin^2y &=\frac {81} {130} \\
\sin y &=\frac {9} {\sqrt{130}}
\end{align*} Now that we've gathered necessary information, we proceed to calculate value of some trigonometric function of $x+y$, hoping we will get some basic angle: sin(x+y) :
\begin{align*}
\sin(x+y) &=\sin x \cos y + \sin y \cos x =\frac {8} {\sqrt{65}} \frac {7} {\sqrt{130}} + \frac {9} {\sqrt{130}}\frac {1} {\sqrt{65}} \\
\sin(x+y) &=\frac {65} {\sqrt{65}\sqrt{130}} \\
\sin(x+y) &=\frac {\sqrt{2}}{2} 
\end{align*}
Thus,
$x+y =\frac {\pi}{4}+2k{\pi}$  OR  $x+y =\frac {3\pi}{4}+2k{\pi}$ Since $x$ and $y$ are in the first quadrant, their sum must lie in first or second quadrant. Solutions are: $x+y= \{\frac {\pi}{4}, \frac {3\pi}{4} \}$ cos(x+y) :
\begin{align*}
\cos(x+y) &= \cos x \cos y - \sin x \sin y =\frac {1} {\sqrt{65}} \frac {7} {\sqrt{130}} - \frac {8} {\sqrt{65}}\frac {9} {\sqrt{130}} \\
\cos(x+y) &=-\frac {65} {\sqrt{65}\sqrt{130}} \\
\cos(x+y) &=-\frac {\sqrt{2}}{2}
\end{align*}
Thus,
$x+y =\frac {3\pi}{4}+2k{\pi} $   OR   $x+y =\frac {5\pi}{4}+2k{\pi}$ Now we can only have one solution: $x+y=\{\frac {3\pi}{4}\}$ Similar happens with $\cos(x-y)$. My question is: why do these two formulas give two different solutions? General insight would be great, since I found a lot of examples with similar problems. Thank you in advance.",['trigonometry']
1337734,What can we say about the graph when many eigenvalues of the Laplacian are equal to 1?,"The Laplacian of the graph has all the eigenvalues real and non-negative, the smallest being 0.

In fact, the multiplicity of this eigenvalue is quite high: in other words, many eigenvalues of the Laplacian are equal to $1$ . What can we say about the graph when many eigenvalues of the Laplacian are equal to 1? For example, eigenvalue $0$ implies that the row sum is $0$ . What about eigenvalue $1$ with high multiplicity?

1337774,Finite Difference for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman without boundary conditions,"Let $t\in\mathbb{R}_+$ denote time, $x \in X$ is the state and $u \in U$ the control. The objective function is $F:X \times U \to\mathbb{R}$ and $f:X \times U \to\mathbb{R}$ is the law of motion for the state, i.e. 
\begin{align}
\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t),u(t))
\end{align}
Define the value function $v:X\to\mathbb{R}$ by 
\begin{align}
v(x_0):=\max_{\{u(t)\}_{t \geq 0}}\left[\int^\infty_0{e^{-\rho t}F(x(t),u(t))dt}\right]
\end{align}
where $x_0:=x(0)$ is a given initial condition and $\rho\in\mathbb{R}_{++}$
is a parameter (time preference rate). The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in current time reads
\begin{align}
\rho v(x) = \max_u[F(x,u) + v'(x)f(x,u)]
\end{align}
which is an ODE. If one can solve for $v(\cdot)$ we can recover the optimal path \begin{align}
\{u^*(t):t\in\mathbb{R}_+\}  = \arg\max_{\{u(t)\}_{t \geq 0}}\left[\int^\infty_0{e^{-\rho t}F(x(t),u(t))dt}\right]

I try to solve the HJB equation by value function iteration. That is guessing an initial value function and then iterate until it converges to the true value. I update via an implicit method a la
\begin{align}
\frac{v_{j+1}(x_n)-v_j(x_n)}{\Delta} + \rho v_j(x_n) = F(x_n,u^*_n) + v'_{j+1}(x_n)f(x_n,u^*_n)
\end{align}
where $\Delta$ is a scaling paramter, $j=0,1,2,\ldots$ the number of iterations and $x_n$ an element of the grid of the state space
\begin{align}
\mathbf{x} := [x_n]_{n=1}^N\in X^N
\end{align}
and $u_n$ is the solution of
\begin{align}
u^*_n = \arg\max_u [F(x_n,u_n) + v'_{j+1}(x_n)f(x_n,u_n)]
\end{align} To get an expression for $v'(\cdot)$ we shall define slope coefficients by
\begin{align}
v'(x_n) :\approx
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle\frac{v(x_{n+1}) - v(x_n)}{\Delta x}\quad&\text{forward difference}\\[2mm]
\displaystyle\frac{v(x_{n+1}) - v(x_{n-1})}{2\Delta x}\quad&\text{central difference}\\[2mm]
\displaystyle\frac{v(x_n) - v(x_{n-1})}{\Delta x}\quad&\text{backward difference}\\
\end{cases}
\end{align} where $\Delta x$ denotes the equidistance between the elements of $\mathbf{x}$, i.e.
\begin{align}
\Delta x:=x_{n+1} - x_n = x_n - x_{n-1}~\forall n 
\end{align} Problem It's known that for forward and backward difference one derivative is missing and for central difference two. We can deal with this issue by a boundary condition on either side. However, consider that there is no boundary condition given. I can still approx $v'(x)$ by a combination of forward, backward and central difference. For instance (case 1)
\begin{align}
v'(x_n) \approx
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle\frac{v(x_{n+1}) - v(x_n)}{\Delta x}\quad&n=1\\[2mm]
\displaystyle\frac{v(x_{n+1}) - v(x_{n-1})}{2\Delta x}\quad&1 < n <N\\[2mm]
\displaystyle\frac{v(x_n) - v(x_{n-1})}{\Delta x}\quad&n=N
\end{cases}
\end{align} or (case 2) \begin{align}
v'(x_n) \approx
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle\frac{v(x_{n+1}) - v(x_n)}{\Delta x}\quad&1\leq n <N\\[2mm]
\displaystyle\frac{v(x_n) - v(x_{n-1})}{\Delta x}\quad&n=N
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Note that in the second case $v'(x_{N-1})=v'(x_N)$. I was wondering what's common practice in the math profession. I'm asking because I get significant different results for the different cases (irrespective of $N$). PS: Note that I'm neither a mathematician nor a native english speaker.

1337808,base change of an equivalence relation of fppf sheaves,"Let $S$ be a scheme, $R,U$ be $S$-schemes and $s,t : R \to U \times_S U$ be an equivalence relation i.e. it's a monomorphisme such that for every $S$-scheme $T$, $R(T) \to U(T) \times U(T)$ is and equivalence relation in the usual sense. We denote by $Q$ the $fppf$ sheaf associated to the presheaf
$$T \mapsto U(T)/\sim_{R(T)}
$$ The arrow $\pi : U \to Q$ is the coequalizer, in the category of $fppf$ sheaves, of the maps $s,t : R \to U$ seen as maps of $fppf$ sheaves. Note that as such it is an epimorphism. Let $\pi : Q' \to Q$ be any morphism. We define $R' = R \times_Q Q'$ and $U' = U\times_Q Q'$. I want to show that $Q'$ is the coequalizer of the maps $(s',t') : R' \to U' \times_{R'} U'$. So what I want to show is that the formation of quotients of equivalence relations commutes with base change in the category of $fppf$ sheaves I know that $(s,t) : R \to U \times_Q R$ is an isomorphism of $fppf$ sheaves (it isn't absolutely obvious but it's not very hard to see). This implies very easily that $R' \cong U' \times_{Q'} U'$. So the question becomes to show it that $U' \to Q$ is the equalizer of $p_1,p_2 : U' \times_{Q'} U' \to U'$. My idea was to show that $U' \to Q$ is an epimorphism because I've already shown that this implies the result, but I haven't been able to show this. So another (and maybe clearer) question would be : in the category of $fppf$ sheaves, are epimorphisms stable by base change ? Let me remind you that a morphism $\alpha : F \to G$ of $fppf$ sheaves (on the category of $S$-schemes) is an epimorphism if for every $S$-scheme $T$ and for every section $s \in G(T)$ there exists and $fppf$ covering $\{T_i \to T\}_{i \in I}$ such that $s_{|T_i}$ is in the image of $F(T_i) \to G(T_i)$. It is certainly true in the category of sets that epimorphisms are stable by base change so I imagine the result would be true for epimorphisms of sheaves over any site. Anyway, if it is not the case, then how can one show that $Q'$ is the co-equalizer of $(s',t')$ ?","['algebraic-geometry', 'topos-theory', 'category-theory']"

1337839,Is my answer correct? Expected number of coin flips to get 5 consecutive heads,"I found this puzzle online. Before my question gets flagged or on hold, I know the question has already been answered here but since I tried to solve it on my own I want to check if it's correct or not. The puzzle is ""What is the expected Number of Coin Tosses to Get Five Consecutive Heads"". My answer is the following: Because a coin has two sides, one for tails and one for heads, let $p$ be the probability of getting heads. Then the probability of getting tails is $1-p$ . For obvious reasons I shall assume that the coin is fair, thus the probability of getting heads is $\dfrac{1}{2}$ and tails $\dfrac{1}{2}$ as well. Let $X_i$ be a random variable indicating the number of flips required to get heads, when $i-1$ was heads. What we are looking for is the number of tries for a single success, thus we shall assume the random variable $X_i$ is following the Geometric Distribution with Probability $P(X_i = x) = p (1-p)^{x-1}$ . The expected number of coin flips to get 5 consecutive heads is given by the expected average $E(X) = \dfrac{1}{p}$ . The probability of the random variable $X_i$ is $\dfrac{1}{2^{i}}$ since the coin is fair. Thus for $5$ consecutive heads $E(X) = E(X_1) + ... + E(X_5) = \sum_{i=1}^{5}E(X_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{5}2^i = 62$ So the expected number of coin flips to get $5$ consecutive heads is $62$ .","['puzzle', 'probability', 'statistics']"

1337968,Reconciling two different definitions of constructible sets,"This question is really about sets and topology, but it is motivated from commutative algebra, hence the tag. Setup: Let $X$ be a set and let $\{U_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}\subset 2^X$ be a family of subsets of $X$ ( $\Lambda$ is just an index set for the family) closed under finite intersection. Then the $U_\lambda$ 's form the base of a topology; call it $\mathscr{T}$ . Let $\mathscr{F}\subset 2^X$ be the smallest family of subsets of $X$ containing $\mathscr{T}$ and closed under finite intersection and complementation. Meanwhile, let $\mathscr{G}\subset 2^X$ be the coarsest topology in which every $U_\lambda$ is clopen. It seems to me, though I haven't written down the proof to my satisfaction yet, that if it happens that $(X,\mathscr{T})$ is a noetherian space, then $\mathscr{F}=\mathscr{G}$ . However, it seems to me that in general, without the noetherian hypothesis, they should not be equal and neither can be guaranteed to contain the other. E.g. it seems to me that $\mathscr{F}$ needn't be a topology, and that $\mathscr{G}$ needn't be closed under complementation. Also, in principle, while $\mathscr{F}$ clearly depends only on $\mathscr{T}$ , $\mathscr{G}$ might actually depend on the base $\{U_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$ chosen for $\mathscr{T}$ . But my attempts to give examples of all this haven't been successful so far. So my questions are: Is it true that $\mathscr{F}$ needn't contain $\mathscr{G}$ ? If so, what's an example? If $\mathscr{F}$ must contain $\mathscr{G}$ , what's the proof? Same question with the roles of $\mathscr{G}$ and $\mathscr{F}$ reversed. Is it true that $\mathscr{G}$ may depend on the base $\{U_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$ chosen for $\mathscr{T}$ ? If so, what's an example? If not, what's the proof that it is determined entirely by $\mathscr{T}$ ? Context: $\mathscr{F}$ and $\mathscr{G}$ are two different definitions of the constructible sets given in Atiyah-MacDonald. ( $\mathscr{F}$ is in exercises 20-23 of chapter 7; $\mathscr{G}$ is in exercises 27-30 of chapter 3.) It seems to me that in the case of the Zariski topology on the Spec of a noetherian ring, they will coincide, but not in general.

1338011,"Does this product over the primes converge, and if so, to what?","I've been trying to play around with the product:
$$\prod_{p \text{ prime}}\frac{1}{1-(-p)^{-1.5}}$$
Where the product runs over all the prime numbers.
The product is similar in appearance to the famous Euler product for the zeta function, evaluated at $1.5$:
$$ \prod_{p \text{ prime}}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1.5}}=\zeta(1.5)$$ However, the sign of $p$ is switched, so instead of staying in the reals, as the zeta function does, this new product enters the complex numbers. I have tried approaching it in an interesting way, however my results seem to differ greatly from numerical data, so I would like to know where the issue is and if an answer is known. My work is very largely based off the derivation of Euler's product formula: We begin by defining:
$$\zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s)=\ldots+(-3)^{-s}+(-2)^{-s}+(-1)^{-s}+1^{-s}+2^{-s}+3^{-s}+\ldots$$
Now, if we multiply by $(-2)^{-s}$, we get:
$$ (-2)^{-s}\zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s)=\ldots+6^{-s}+4^{-s}+2^{-s}+(-2)^{-s}+(-4)^{-s}+(-6)^{-s}+\ldots$$
$$=  \ldots+(-6)^{-s}+(-4)^{-s}+(-2)^{-s}+2^{-s}+4^{-s}+6^{-s}+\ldots$$
And by subtracting, we get:
$$ \left( 1-(-2)^{-s} \right)\zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s)=\ldots+(-5)^{-s}+(-3)^{-s}+(-1)^{-s}+1^{-s}+3^{-s}+5^{-s}+\ldots$$
Similarly, by multiplying by $\left(1-(-p)^{-s} \right)$, we remove all the multiples of $p$, so by multiplying by $\left(1-(-p)^{-s} \right)$ for all prime numbers, we get rid of everything except for $(-1)^{-s}+1^{-s}$. Thus we have:
$$ \prod_{p \text{ prime}}\left( 1-(-p)^{-s} \right) \cdot \zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s)=(-1)^{-s}+1^{-s}=(-1)^{-s}+1$$
Thus, whenever $(-1)^{-s}+1$ is not equal to zero, we can say:
$$ \prod_{p \text{ prime}}\left(\frac{1}{ 1-(-p)^{-s} }\right)=\zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s)\cdot \frac{1}{(-1)^{-s}+1}$$ Now, on the other hand, by definition, we have:
$$ \zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{n^{-s}}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{(-n)^{-s}} =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{n^{-s}}+(-1)^{-s}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{n^{-s}}$$
$$ =\left( 1+(-1)^{-s} \right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{n^{-s}}=\left( 1+(-1)^{-s} \right)\zeta(s)$$ Therefore we have:
$$ \prod_{p \text{ prime}}\left(\frac{1}{ 1-(-p)^{-s} }\right)=\zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s)\cdot \frac{1}{(-1)^{-s}+1}= \left( 1+(-1)^{-s} \right)\zeta(s)\cdot \frac{1}{(-1)^{-s}+1}=\zeta(s)$$ By plugging in $s=1.5$, we get:
$$\prod_{p \text{ prime}}\left(\frac{1}{ 1-(-p)^{-1.5} }\right)=\zeta(1.5)$$ The reason I don't believe this result is because it is an entirely real number, and also WolframAlpha tells me that the product over the first $50,000$ primes is approximately $0.62+0.68i$. My question also extends to values of $s$ other than $1.5$. When $s$ is an even integer, the product formula is identical to the Euler product formula, so it is clear that the product is equal to the zeta function. When $s$ is an odd integer, my technique of analysis does not apply because $(-1)^{-s}+1$ does equal zero in this case, and in fact the product certainly is not equal to the zeta function. For example (according to WolframAlpha):
$$ \prod_{p \text{ prime}}\left(\frac{1}{ 1-(-p)^{-3} }\right) = \frac{\pi^6}{945 \zeta(3)}\neq \zeta(3) $$ My question is, what about all the non-integer values (for example $1.5$)? I cannot find an issue with my work, however much of it is informal and I have never actually taken a course in complex analysis (which I assume would help). None of this is any sort of homework; it is just a piece of curiousity. Any help is appreciated.","['number-theory', 'complex-analysis', 'riemann-zeta']"

1338059,Why are there palindromic subsequences at random among this sequence?,"So I was thinking about the Goldbach conjecture and I rephrased it to myself as the following: Prove that every number N is either prime or else lies halfway between two primes A and B, where A < N and N < B < 2N . This is equivalent, because if it were true, then the following would apply: For any even number X where X/2 is prime, you know X is expressible by the sum of two primes: X/2 + X/2. (e.g. for 10, 10/2 is 5 and 5+5=10) For any even number X where X/2 is NOT prime, you know X is expressible by the sum of two primes: A + B, where A and B are whichever two primes X/2 lies between. (e.g. for 12, 12/2 is 6 and 6 is halfway between 5 and 7, and 5+7=12) And thus the Goldbach Conjecture would be proven true, because all even numbers are proven to be expressible as the sum of two primes. So then I went and generated the first 400 values for N of the sequence where N is ""the shortest distance  from X to the nearest prime number both above and below it"" where X is the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. If X is prime, N is 0. Example: 2 yields 0 because it is prime. 3 yields 0 because it is prime. 4 yields 1 because it is 1 away from both 3 and 5. 5 yields 0 because it is prime. 6 yields 1 because it is 1 away from both 5 and 7. .... 10 yields 3 because it is 3 away from  7 and 13. 11 yields 0 because it is prime. 12 yields 1 because it is 1 away from 11 and 13. So, the sequence starts off: 001 010 323 010 323 010. Already tantalizing, like everything with primes. But then, that segues into this: 23 010 32 9056349 010 9436509 23 010 32 A palindrome!

Also bolded the center of the palindrome.) These are just the ones I've spotted, I think there are others. And there are many others I've seen that are one value away from being palindromic.

1338071,Is this a way to construct mathematics?(logic vs. set theory),"I recently asked a question about the fact that logic and set theory seems circular. link I got a lot of good and thoughtful answers, that probably explain everything, but I must admit I did not understand them all (not the fault of any of the people who answered). 
So I am wondering if someone can check the ""recipe"" I have below, and if this is a sufficient or ok way to view the construction of mathematics? Before creating mathematical logic we just have to know what some something means. We assume we know these things: 1.1 We know what a string is, and we know what symbols is. We also know what ordered sequences of symbols is, even though we have not formalized what it is. 1.2 We can talk about function symbols and relation symbols, and we know that there are rules when writing these things. But we have not yet made a formal definition of functions and symbols. 1.3 We know what the equality symbol is, and we create rules on how to use it in our logic language. But we do not have any more precise definition of what it is, other than a symbol, and our own intuitive meaning. 1.4 We have an idea about the natural numbers, and we are allowed to use these as symbols, even though we have not created them. 1.5 We can use the induction principle on proving things about our logical language. We assume that if something holds for ""the base""-object, and if something should hold for an arbitrary object then it also also for its ""successor"", then it must hold for all the objects starting with the base-object and all the successors. We just assume that this holds, and that we can use it? We then create the language of mathematical logic. We create set-theory: 3.1 Here we formalize ordered pairs in terms of sets. 3.2 We formalize what a function and a relation is in terms of sets (cartesian-product etc.). 3.3 We formalize equality as a particular relation. 3.4 We define and create the natural numbers in terms of sets. 3.5 We create an axiom of mathematical induction in terms of the natural numbers? In other words, we assume that induction holds, just as we did before we created the logical language? And hence we do not have any circularity in using set theory before it was created? Is this a correct way to view the construction of mathematics? If it is wrong I would love answers, but I would very much love answers in a list form, where it is explicitly stated what we do from the start and where we end up etc..","['foundations', 'elementary-set-theory', 'logic']"

Any guidance hints or help would be truly greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance :) So anyway, here the problem goes: In the game of Keno, from the numbers $1-80$ , a player chooses three, and makes a $\$1$ bet. Then twenty numbers are drawn. If all three of his numbers are among the twenty, he is paid $\$42$ (gain of $\$41$ ). If two of his numbers are among the twenty, he is paid $\$1$ (break even). If fewer than two of his numbers are among the twenty, he loses. What are his chances ? How can this be made a fair game ? My thoughts: A player's entry can be any of $C(80,3)$ combinations $= 82160$ From the the $20$ numbers there are $C(20,3)$ winning combinations $= 1140$ $\frac{1140}{82160} = .0138753 =$ Probability of having three winning numbers.

\epsilon_{t} =  iid\  \mathcal{N} (0,1)
$$ Assume that x starts at 0 what is the expected number of times x will cross the 0 point for N number of periods? I am more interested in the method of obtaining the answer than the answer  itself. What I have so far: I was looking at simple case where N = 2, and in this case expected number of crosses seems to be 0.25 . Intuitively, this makes sense, in the first period we moved somewhere, and on the second the probability that we move in the right direction is 0.5, and of that 0.5, the probability (on average) that we move back far enough to cross is 0.5, so 0.5 * 0.5 => 0.25.

1338125,Substituting a value of sine function in a trigonometric equation,"I am trying to really understand trigonometric equations and I've stumbled upon a rather confusing example. Solve the following equation: $\sin x= 2|\sin x|+ {\sqrt{3}}\cos x$ First step is to define the absolute $\sin x$:
$$|\sin x| = 
\begin{cases}
\sin x & \sin x \in [0, 1]\\
-\sin x & \sin x \in [-1, 0)
\end{cases}
$$ Let's see what happens in the first case: $$\sin x \in [0,1] \Rightarrow\, x \in {[2k{\pi}, (2k+1){\pi}]}$$ which means x is in the first or second quadrant. Bringing everything to the right side: $$\sin x+{\sqrt{3}}\cos x=0$$ Now we notice terms ${\sqrt{3}}$ with $\cos x$ and $1$ with $\sin x$ and do the following: \begin{align*}
\sin x+{\sqrt{3}}\cos x& =0 \quad /:2\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\sin x+{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}\cos x& = 0
\end{align*} Now, the goal is to try and substitute integer terms with trigonometric functions they are solutions to, in order to apply one of the trigonometric identities for solving the problem. Let's aim at the following formula: $\sin(x+y)=\sin x\cos y + \sin y\cos x$ .We have several options: $\frac {1}{2} $is value of $\cos$ for either $x=\frac {\pi}{3} + 2k\pi$ OR $x=\frac {5\pi}{3} + 2k\pi$. Of all of these angles, only $x=\frac {\pi}{3} $ falls under our domain. ${\frac {\sqrt{3}}{2}} $is value of $\sin$ for either $x=\frac {\pi}{3} + 2k\pi$ OR $x=\frac {2\pi}{3} + 2k\pi$. Out of all of these angles, there are two of them that fall under our domain. $x=\frac {\pi}{3}$ and $x=\frac {2\pi}{3}$. This is where the problem is. I feel I should consider both of the $\sin$ values and solve two different versions of the equation. The first one is by substituting $\frac {1}{2} = \cos\frac {\pi}{3}$ and $\frac {\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sin\frac {\pi}{3}$, which is easily solved using the identity mentioned above. The second case is when substituting $\frac {\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sin\frac {2\pi}{3}$. This does not conform to any trig. identity. I tried treating $\sin\frac {2\pi}{3}$ as $\sin$ of double angle, but ended up at the beginning. I typed this equation into Symbolab and examined their step-by-step solution. It turns out that at some point they divided the equation with $\cos x$. Even when $\cos x$ is definitely not zero, I was taught dividing a trigonometric equation with anyting other than integers was a risky move very likely to result in a loss of solutions. So, my questions are: Should you just ignore possible angles that won't make you a simple trigonometric identity? Can you divide trigonometric equation with some trigonometric function and when? I hope I explained myself clearly enough. Thank you in advance.",['trigonometry']

No versions of 6 or 8 may be repeated within any single solution For clarity, assume we have [8,8]. There are 4 ""versions"" of 8 that may be used, but not repeated within a solution. [8a,8a] for instance is not valid. This could be [8a,8b] or [8a,8c] or [8a,8d] or [8b,8a] or [8b,8c] etc. Assume you had [2,2]. Because you CAN repeat ""versions"" of 2, you could use [2a,2b] or [2b,2a] or [2a,2a] or [2b,2b]. There you have it. Following all of the restrictions, how many different ways can you add up to 32?","['combinations', 'combinatorics', 'permutations']"

I know appealing to the Heine-Borel theorem finishes the argument if I can show the hint. It's also pretty obvious that if $g(y) = P(a,y)$ is non-constant, then we can factorize $g$ by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and let $b$ be one of the roots to conclude. I don't understand why we can do this at all but finitely many $a$ though. It seems like having $g(y) = k_a$ where $k_a\in\mathbb{C}$ for infinitely many $a\in \mathbb{C}$ should give some kind of contradiction. It would be easy if it were the same constant $k_a$ every time, since we could factorize $g(y) - k_a$ as a polynomial of $a$ to show that the number of $a$'s where this occurs is bounded by the polynomial degree.

1338493,Uses of stalks of sheaves and germs,"I am trying to understand the motivation behind defining stalks of sheaves, but I suppose my complex geometry is a little weak. I know they are meant to represent germs of holomorphic functions at a point, but generalized to any sheaf. Here is what I have in mind currently: holomorphic functions are complex differentiable locally, so it doesn't make sense to talk about holomorphic functions at a point $z \in \mathbb{C}$. However, we can talk about the germs of holomorphic functions at $z$ (so identify all those functions that agree on some arbitrarily small neighborhood of $z$). In this way, it seems we can try to talk about complex functions ""holomorphic at a point"" by just using direct limits. So my question is, why do we use germs/stalks at all? How can they reveal (geometric/local) structure that cannot be deduced by simply looking at small neighborhoods (which is what I think of when I think local). Are there any theorems that become easy to prove using germs (or maybe almost impossible/unclear without using germs)? Also, why do we want morphisms of sheaves to induce maps on the stalks? Is this just a convenient bookkeeping mechanism, or is there some genuine geometric meaning to it all?","['intuition', 'algebraic-geometry', 'soft-question', 'complex-geometry']"

1338524,Some possible mistakes in Bott and Tu [closed],"Closed . This question needs to be more focused . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 5 years ago . Improve this question I've been reading Bott and Tu's book ""Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology"" and it seems that this book has an enormous list of errors. Therefore I would like to confirm if the parts that I will cite are, in fact, wrong and, if I'm correct, I would like to know how to solve these problem. Here is a link to the edition of the book that I'm using http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/botttu.pdf . 1) In page 43 (proof of theorem 5.1), they claim that finite intersections of geodesically convex open sets are geodesically convex. However choosing two open sets covering the circle, would give a counterexample to this. Maybe the correct notion of good cover (in page 42), should be a covering such that finite intersections are diffeomorphic to finite disjoint copies of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . (As noted by Kevin Carlson and Mariano Suárez-Alvarez the geodesics must be minimizing, therefore I was wrong) 2) In page 65, they define a sequence of vector bundles to be exact if they're fiberwise exact. This is not the correct definition, since the kernel of a morphism that collapse some fiber will be $0$ . 3) In page 69, there is a diagramm and they claim it's commutative, but there's no reason at all. And just above the diagram they say: ""If $f: M \rightarrow M'$ is an orientation preserving map of oriented manifolds, $T$ is a tubular neighborhood of the closed oriented sub manifold $S$ in $M$ , and $f(M')$ is transversal to $S$ and $T$ , then $f^{-1}T$ is a tubular neighborhood of $f^{-1}S$ in $M$ ."". However $T$ has always codimension $0$ , so how can $f(M')$ not be transversal to $T$ , clearly, there's something wrong going on here. Furthermore there is no reason (beyond the intuition) to $f^{-1}T$ be a tubular neighborhood of $f^{-1}S$ . So this part, clearly, needs some clarifications. 4) In page 70, execise 6.32 may not be right for any deformation retract, since the composition $(ir)^* \in \text{End}(\Omega(\mathbb{R}^n\setminus  \{0 \}))$ (for some retraction $r$ and an inclusion $i$ ) is not the identity. Therefore $dr\wedge r^{*}(d\theta|_{S^2})$ may not be positive, for instance. 5) In page 79  (just before the beginning of the section 7), they claim that $s\pi: E_0 \rightarrow E$ is clearly homotopic to the inclusion $i: E_0 \rightarrow E$ , where $E_0$ is the complement of the zero section, $s$ is the zero section and $\pi: E \rightarrow M$ is the vector bundle. This looks like very weird. For instance, consider $M = *$ (a point), then they are claiming that the map $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0\} \rightarrow \{0 \}$ is homotopic to the inclusion $i: \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0 \} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ , so the sphere would be homotopic to a point! (As noted by Kevin Carlson, in fact, this is equivalent to the contractibility of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , therefore I was wrong. I don't know why, but I was thinking about isotopies fixing the circle) 6) In page 102 and 103, they claim that the collating formula (page 102) is a morphism $f: C(\mathcal{U}, \Omega) \rightarrow \Omega(M)$ that induces an isomorphism in level of cohomology by using a a homotopy operator (in the beginning go the page 103). However the collating formula is not well defined since in the second sum $\sum_{i=0}^{n+1}K(-D''K)^{i-1} \beta_i$ the term $K(-D''K)^{-1}$ is not well defined. I tried to exclude this term, but then everything goes wrong (for instance, the first computations in page 104 does not hold). 7) In page 104 (proposition 9.8), they claim to have created an explicit isomorphism between \v{C}ech cohomology and de Rham cohomology $f(\eta) = (-D''K)^n \eta$ by using the collating formula. However as stated above (in 6), the collating formula is ill defined, so this explicit isomorphism may not be true. However, in page 120-122, they use this isomorphism to prove that the Euler class and the global angular form coincides with their previous definition. So, again, this may not be right, since the collating formula was ill defined. 8)In page 108 (example 9.14), they claim that for $M = \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ and $F = \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ the Kunneth formula does not hold by claiming that $H^{0}(M) \otimes H^{0}(F)$ consist of finite sums of integer matrices of rank one. However $H^{0}$ is contravariant, so $H^{0}(F) = H^{0} (M) = H^{0} (\mathbb{Z}^+) = H^{0} (\coprod^{0 <i < \aleph_0} *) = \prod_{0<i< \aleph_0} \mathbb{R}$ , hence $H^{0} (M) \oplus H^{0} (F)$ is not isomorphic to $\bigoplus_{0<i< \aleph_0}\mathbb{R}$ as they claim. 9)In page 109, the definition of a constant presheaf is wrong. They define a presheaf $\mathscr{F}$ to be constant with abelian group $G$ if for every connected open set $U$ and any open set $V \subset U$ the restriction $\mathscr{F}(U) \rightarrow \mathscr{F}(V)$ is the identity. This is clearly wrong, since when $V$ is disconnected $\mathscr{F} (V) = G^{\pi_0 (V)}$ when $\mathscr{F}$ is a constant sheaf. The correct definition should be that $\mathscr{F}(U) \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_x$ is the identity for every connected set $U$ and $x \in U$ . (As noted by Kevin Carlson, they intended to define just a pre sheaf. I thought that they wanted to define a constant sheaf without talking about equalizers. Anyway, the requirement for $U$ to be connected still weird, since there would be no locally constant presheaves on a totally disconnected space, but this is just an unfortunate choice made by the authors) (I've double checked the book and they really use the constant SHEAF instead of the constant presheaf as they've defined. There are a lot of occurrences where this is problematic. For instance, in page 189 (Remark), they claim that the zeroth \v{C}ech cohomology has dimension equal to the number of connected components. Furthermore, in page 97, they define the constant ""presheaf"" $\mathbb{R}$ as the sheaf of locally constant functions. So, clearly, there's a problem here) 10)In page 133 (remark 12.4.2), they claim that a section of an oriented vector bundle $s^{*}: H_{cv}(E) \rightarrow M$ ( $s: M \rightarrow E$ ) must factorize through the inclusion $i: H_{cv} (E) \rightarrow H(E)$ . However this is not always true, since $i$ may not be injective. 11)In page 135 (proof of proposition 12.8), they claim that $\int_{S_x}\Phi = \int_{E_x} \Phi$ because $E_x$ is homotopic to $S_x$ modulo the region in $E$ where $\Phi$ is zero. However this makes no sense, since the integral is not invariant under homotopy of the domain. Although homotopic maps have the same integral. 12)In page 140 (exercise 12.12.1), the index of the sum should start at $0$ and not at $1$ . 13)In page 147 (the extension principle), they claim that a map $\partial I^k \rightarrow X$ may be extended to $I^k \rightarrow X$ if $\pi_q (X) \cong 0$ for $q \leq k-1$ . However they provide no references for this result and, since this book has so many errors, I'm starting to doubt if this is true. 14)In page 177 (""The Gysin Sequence""), they claim that in an oriented sphere bundle every locally constant pre sheaf has no monodromy and, therefore, is constant. However I could not see why this is true (by using the already introduced machinery). I think they're confusing it with the fact that a locally constant presheaf in an oriented vector bundle is constant (by using the argument in page 131-132 that restrict the Thom class). Maybe it's possible conclude this for sphere bundles coming from vector bundles (by using the fact for vector bundles), however not every sphere bundle may have its structure group (as a $G$ -bundle) reduced to $O(k)$ . 15)In page 178 (in the bottom of the page), they claim that an element of $H^{n-k}(M) \otimes H^k(S^k)$ may be represented by $\pi^{*}\omega \wedge (-\psi)$ where $\omega \in H^{n-k} (M)$ and $\psi$ the global angular form. However this is not, in general, true since Leray-Hirch theorem does not hold in this case and $\psi$ is not closed (though it's locally closed). 16)In page 183, the face operator is not defined correctly. The correct definition should be $\partial_q^i (\sum_{j = 0}^{q-1} t_j P_j) = \sum_{j = 0}^{i-1}t_jP_j + \sum_{j = i+1}^{q}t_{j-1}P_j$ . 17)In page 189 (in the bottom of the page), the exact sequence for singular cohomology is wrong. Instead of direct sums, it should be products since the functor $\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})$ is left exact (in the opposite category), hence it sends colimits to limits. Sorry for the long list. If someone know about any other possible mistakes in the book, please, let me know. Thanks in advance. EDIT I've checked the new edition of the book and some mistakes were corrected. More specifically, 6, 7, 9, 12, 16 and 17 were corrected. I should mention too that, as commented above, 1, 5 and 13 are not mistakes.","['differential-geometry', 'algebraic-topology']"

Any guidance hints or help would be truly greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance :) So anyway, here the problem goes: Two boxes each contain $4$ cupcakes. One box has $3$ chocolate and $1$ vanilla, and the other box has $2$ chocolate and $2$ vanilla. A box is randomly selected, opened, and a cupcake is randomly selected. This first cupcake is vanilla. If one more cupcake is randomly selected from the same box, what is the probability that it will be vanilla ? My working so far: If we pick a box at random, and pick a vanilla cupcake,
then there is a $\frac23$ probability we picked the second box.
( $2$ chances for having picked vanilla from there, against $1$ from $1$ ), and $\frac13$ for the first box. If we DID pick the first box, the chances of $2nd$ vanilla are $0$ , since
there isn't one, so $\frac13 × 0$ for that. Now I am stuck.","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

$k+n=Q, \;\;\; k^2+n^2=2A, \;\;\; kn=\sqrt{A^2-B^2}$ $$k^2+n^2+2kn=\left ( k+n \right )^2=Q^2$$

1338880,Local parametrizations and coordinate charts on manifolds,"I have recently had discussions on related questions about coordinate charts on here which has started to clear up some issues in my understanding of manifolds. Apologies in advance for the long-windedness of this post, but there are several points that I feel are crucial for me to understand to further my studies of differential geometry, and as they are fairly closely related I thought it better to ask/check them in one post. Several of the notes/textbooks that I've been reading on the subject have mentioned about the inverse map of a coordinate map as giving a local parametrization to a point in a given patch on a manifold. By this is it meant that, given an $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ and a homeomorphism $\phi:U\subset M\rightarrow V\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ from a patch on the manifold $U\subset M$, then we can parametrize a point $p\in U$ via the inverse map $\phi^{-1}:V\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow U\subset M$? More explicitly, if $\phi (p)=(x^{1},\ldots,x^{n})$ are the coordinates labelling $p$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then is it correct to say that one can describe a point in a given patch on the manifold directly via its parametrization with respect to its coordinates, i.e.
$$p=(\phi^{-1}\circ\phi)(p)=\phi^{-1}(\phi(p))=\phi^{-1}(x^{1},\ldots,x^{n})=(u^{1},\ldots,u^{n})$$
where $(u^{1},\ldots,u^{n})$ is the local parametrization of $p$ on $M$, and $u^{i}=u^{i}(x^{1},\ldots,x^{n})$ are functions whose domain is $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. If so, what really is the difference between parametrizations of points and their corresponding coordinates? (Is it simply that the coordinates are labels that allow one to distinguish individual points in a patch on the manifold, and then we can use these to parametrize the patch such that each value of the coordinates describes a given point on the manifold (in terms of the parametrization)). If I have understand this notion of parametrization correctly, then is the following discussion correct? If we take the example of a 2-sphere $S^{2}\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$, then is the 2-tuple $(\theta,\phi)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$ the coordinates of a point on the manifold (with the mapping defined by $p\mapsto (\theta,\phi)$) and its corresponding local parametrization on the manifold, $(\sin(\theta)\cos(\phi),\sin(\theta)\sin(\phi),\cos(\theta))\in S^{2}\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$ (with the inverse mapping defined by $(\theta,\phi)\mapsto (\sin(\theta)\cos(\phi),\sin(\theta)\sin(\phi),\cos(\theta))$) ? From reading John Lee's books on smooth manifolds and Riemannian geometry (and from a previous discussion on here), I think it is correct to say that (when a metric is defined on the manifold) one can only use local Cartesian coordinates (or local Euclidean coordinates) to label points in a patch on a manifold if the curvature of the manifold is zero (i.e. it is ""locally flat"") as then there will exist a local isometry between the manifold between the manifold and flat Euclidean space. Mathematically, if $(M,g)$ is locally flat (i.e. has vanishing local curvature) then there will be an isometry $\psi$ to an open set in $(\mathbb{R}^{n},\bar{g})$(where $g$ is the metric defined on the $n$-dimensional manifold $M$, and $\bar{g}$ is the Euclidean metric defined on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$). (Would it also be correct to say that the Cartesian coordinate system is the identity map $\text{id}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ defined by $(x^{1},\ldots,x^{n})\mapsto (x^{1},\ldots,x^{n})$, such that the parametrization of each point is simply given by $(x^{1},\ldots,x^{n})$?)

The error vectors $\epsilon_i$ are uncorrelated for different $i$. The response variable is $Y_i=\|C(w_i-B)\|=1$ for all $i$. $C$ is a 3x3 matrix that can be eigendecomposed by $C=R(\psi,\theta,\phi)\,E\,R(\psi,\theta,\phi)^T$, where $R$ is a rotation matrix parametrized by the three angles $\psi,\theta,\phi$. $E$ is a diagonal matrix where each entry in the diagonal is positive and bounded from above by a known value. $B$ is a 3x1 vector.

1338971,Study this function $f(x) = \frac{\sqrt[3]{x-1}}{(x+2)^2}$,"I need to study this function: $$f(x) = \frac{\sqrt[3]{x-1}}{(x+2)^2}$$ and I need to show Max and Min point. The first thing is define the Domain, so: $$\left\{\begin{matrix}

(x+2)^2 \neq 0
\end{matrix}\right.$$ $$\left\{\begin{matrix}
x > 1\\ 
x \neq -2

$$ D: x = -2 $$ And I have no intersection with y .
I have checked the limit in $1$ and $+\infty$: $$ \lim_{x \rightarrow +\infty} \frac{\sqrt[3]{x-1}}{(x+2)^2} = 0$$
$$ \lim_{x \rightarrow 1^+} \frac{\sqrt[3]{x-1}}{(x+2)^2} = 0$$
$$ \lim_{x \rightarrow 1^-} \frac{\sqrt[3]{x-1}}{(x+2)^2} = 0$$ I have calculated the first derivative as suggested here , the result is: $$ f'(x) = \frac{8-5x}{3\sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2}(x+2)}$$ Now how should I precede to study Max and Min? Are my steps correct?",['functions']
1338980,Curve fitting of a set of data,"Suppose you have a set of data $\{x_i\}$ and $\{y_i\}$ with $i=0,\dots,N$. In order to find two parameters $a,b$ such that the line

1338984,Limit of a binomial probability,"I am doing some self-study on measure theory and probability. This question is taken from Jacod and Protter's Essentials of Probability, Chapter 5 (Q15): Let $X$ be a binomial random variable, $X\sim \mathrm{Binomial}(p=\frac{1}{2}, n)$, where $n=2m$. Let $a(m,k)=\dfrac{4^{m}}{2m \choose m} P(X=m+k)$. Show that $\lim_{m\to \infty} (a(m,k))^{m}=e^{-k^{2}}$. So far I have been able to get: \begin{align*}
[a(m,k)]^{m}&=\left[ \frac{4^{m}}{2m \choose m} P(X=m+k) \right]^{m}\\
&=\left[ \frac{4^{m}}{2m \choose m} {2m \choose (m+k)}p^{m+k}(1-p)^{2m-(m+k)} \right]^{m}\\
&=\left[ 4^{m} \frac{(m!)^2}{(m-k)!(m+k)!}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{m+k} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{m-k} \right]^{m}\\
&=\left[\frac{(m!)^2}{(m-k)!(m+k)!}\right]^{m}\\
&\approx\left[\left(\frac{m}{\sqrt{(m-k)(m+k)}}\right)\left(\frac{m}{e}\right)^{2m}\left(\frac{e}{m-k}\right)^{m-k}\left(\frac{e}{m+k}\right)^{m+k}\right]^{m}\text{, by stirling}\\

1338990,Show: An entire function $g$ with $\vert g(x) \vert \to \infty$ for $|x| \to \infty$ is a polynomial.,This is part of an exercise sheet in complex analysis. It should by solvable by rather elementary methods like the main theorems of complex analysis. I succeded to show that $g$ has only finitely many zeros by using Bolzano-Weierstraß's theorem. If you divide $g$ by all its zeros you get a holomorphic function without zeros. I now fail to show that this new function is constant.,['complex-analysis']
1338996,Describe the space of solutions of the matrix equation $UV^T=VU^T$,"I would like to describe the space of solutions to the following matrix equation. Here $U$ and $V$ are two unknown real matrices with $n$ lines and $p$ columns (i.e. they belong to $M_{n,p}(\mathbb{R})$) : $$ U V^T - V U^T = 0$$ Note : The result is a square matrix with $n$ lines and $n$ columns. What I found up to now : if $p=1$ then the equations are equivalent with the statement $U$ and $V$ are colinear. The system can be rewritten under the following form : Let $X$ be the following matrix with $2p$ lines and $n$ columns (the unknown) :
$$ X = \left[ \begin{matrix}U^T\\V^T\end{matrix}\right]$$
Let $\Omega$ be the following square matrix with $2p$ lines and $2p$ columns : 
$$ \Omega = \left[ \begin{matrix}0_{p \times p} & I_{p \times p}\\-I_{p \times p} & 0_{p \times p}\end{matrix}\right]$$
Then my equations can be re-written like this :
$$ X^T \Omega X = 0$$ This formal similarity with isotropic spaces in symplectic geometry makes me think that there is some litterature on the subject (the difference with symplectic geometry is that we do not have a ""form"" since the result is not a scalar when $n \neq 1$). I however cannot find anything relevant yet. Any hint or partial answer is most welcome. Edit : Trying to generalize the special $p=1$ case to general $p$, I found the following sufficient condition : 
If there exists a symmetric $p\times p$ matrix $P$ such that $U=VP$ then $(U,V)$ is a solution to the equation. Is this condition sufficient ? Can it be re-written so that it highlights the symmetric role of $U$ and $V$ ?","['matrices', 'bilinear-form', 'matrix-equations', 'symplectic-linear-algebra', 'symplectic-geometry']"

1339012,what does `ensemble average` mean?,"I'm studying this paper and somewhere in the conclusion part is written: ""Since this rotation of the coherency matrix is carried out based on the ensemble average of polarimetric scattering characteristics in a selected imaging window, we obtain the rotation angle as a result of second-order statistics."" Also I've seen the term ensemble average in several other papers of this context. Now I want to understand the exact mathematical or statistical definition of ensemble averaging not only in this context but the exact meaning and use of ensemble averaging in statistics and mathematics. I googled the term ensemble average and here in wikipedia we have the definition as ""In statistical mechanics, the ensemble average is defined as the mean of a quantity that is a function of the microstate of a system (the ensemble of possible states), according to the distribution of the system on its microstates in this ensemble."" But I didn't understand this definition because I don't even know what does the microstate of a system or possible states of system mean in mathematics. Could you please give me a simple definition with some examples for ensemble averaging ? Compare time averaging and ensemble averaging ? And also introduce me some good resources to study more especially resources that can be helpful in image processing too?","['average', 'order-statistics', 'statistics', 'stochastic-processes']"

However, how hard would it be to do the other way around, to compute the derivative of $e^x$? I.e., is it possible to show the derivative of $(\sum_n 1/n!)^x$ with respect to $x$ is equal to itself, somewhat ""directly"", without showing the summation formulation of $e$ is equivalent to the typical limit definition of $e$?","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'derivatives']"
