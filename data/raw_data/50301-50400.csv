Of course this depends on the space $X$ itself. One can assume that this space is nice, for example a complete separable metric space. It would be nice if we can exclude compactness of $X$. Is then anything known about the dual? In particular, we have for $P(X)$, the space of Borel probability measure on $X$, that $P(X)\subset C_b(X)'$, where the latter denotes the dual. The pairing is given by $$\phi_\mu(f):=\langle \mu,f\rangle=\int fd\mu$$ which defines for every $f\in C_b(X), \mu\in P(X)$ bounded linear functional. But do we have ""equality""?

515420,Deligne's formula,"Let $M$ be some $A$-module and $f \in A$. Why do we have an isomorphism
$$\varinjlim_n \hom_A(f^n A,M) \cong M_f \text{ ?}$$ Background . Let $X$ be a scheme, $U$ an open subscheme, and $F,G$ quasi-coherent sheaves on $X$. There is a canonical homomorphism
$$\varinjlim_{J \subseteq \mathcal{O}_X , J|_{U} = \mathcal{O}_U} \hom_{\mathcal{O}_X}(JF,G)  \to \hom_{\mathcal{O}_U}(F|_U,G|_U).$$
Deligne has shows that this is an isomorphism when $X$ is noetherian and $F$ is of finite type (see EGA I (1970), Prop. 6.9.17). In particular, we have the following explicit description of the quasi-coherent sheaf $\tilde{M}$ on $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ for a noetherian ring $A$ and some $A$-module $M$:
$$\tilde{M}(U) = \varinjlim_{J \subseteq A, \tilde{J}|_U = \mathcal{O}_U} \hom_A(J,M)$$
Note that, when $U$ is the complement of $V(I)$, the condition $\tilde{J}|_U = \mathcal{O}_U$ means $I \subseteq \sqrt{J}$, or equivalently $I^n \subseteq J$ for some $n$. This gives an even more explicit formula
$$\tilde{M}(\mathrm{Spec}(A) \setminus V(I)) = \varinjlim_n \hom_A(I^n,M).$$
In the paper ""Sections of quasi-coherent sheaves"" it is claimed that this formula also holds when $U$ is a basic-open subset i.e. $I$ is principal and $A$ is not assumed to be noetherian. But I cannot prove this. The colimit becomes
$$\cong \varinjlim_n ~\hom_A(f^n A,M) \cong \varinjlim_n ~\{m \in M : \mathrm{Ann}(f^n) \subseteq \mathrm{Ann}(m)\}.$$
The transition maps multiply with $f$. This colimit has a canonical injection to $\varinjlim_n ~ M \cong M_f = \tilde{M}(D(f))$. But I don't see why it should be surjective. Even when $A$ is noetherian, I don't see a direct argument, without repeating Deligne's proof (which essentially uses the Artin-Rees Lemma).","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'quasicoherent-sheaves']"

515659,cubic equations which have exactly one real root,"Question is to check : For any real number $c$, the polynomial $x^3+x+c$ has exactly one real root . the way in which i have proceeded is : let $a$ be one real root for $x^3+x+c$ i.e., we have $a^3+a+c=0$ i have seen that $(x-a)(x^2+ax+(a^2+1))=x^3+x-a^3-a$ But, $a^3+a+c=0$. So, $-a^3-a=c$. so, $(x-a)(x^2+ax+(a^2+1))=x^3+x-a^3-a=x^3+x+c$ i.e, $(x-a)(x^2+ax+(a^2+1))=x^3+x+c$ Now, determinant for quadratic $x^2+ax+(a^2+1)$ is $a^2-4(a^2+1)=-3a^2-4 <0$ for any real number $a$ Thus, quadratic has no real root and so is the cubic $x^3+x+c$ I would like to know if this justification is sufficient and if this can be generalized.

EDIT 1: With MvG's observation, we can prove the following fact. If we set on a point $O$ in $\triangle{ABC}$ such that $\triangle{OBC}$ is a regular triangle, then $O$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle{BCD}$. First, we will show if we set a point $E$ on the segment $AC$ such that $OE=OB=OC=BC$, then $D=E$. Becuase $\triangle{ABC}$ is a isosceles triangle, the point $O$ is on the bisecting line of $\angle{BAC}$. $\angle{OAE}=20^\circ/2=10^\circ$. And because $OE=OC$, $\angle{OCE}=\angle{OEC}=20^\circ$, $\angle{EOA}=20^\circ-10^\circ=10^\circ=\angle{EAO}$. Therefore $\triangle{AOE}$ is an isosceles triangle such that $EA=EO$. so $AD=BC=AE$, $D=E$.

But in the case of a graph, what exactly is the topology (open sets) defined on it to talk about fundamental groups and homotopy? Or am I wrongly mixing up very different notions with the same name? Also, could someone provide elementary references on this with examples? The references I found are all too rigorous with algebraic topology machinery, and unsuitable for big picture intuition and quick learning through examples, which is what I want to start with for now. If that is not possible, do suggest a linear sequence of topics I need to be familiar with so that I can get a working knowledge of fundamental groups of graphs (I noticed mentions of covering spaces, but I digressed with that and am not sure how to proceed).
I am interested in its relationship with Cayley graphs and the Ihara zeta function, which I hope to get into once I clear up the fundamentals. Thanks.","['algebraic-topology', 'graph-theory', 'homotopy-theory', 'group-theory']"

Here is my attempt: Define $G: [a,b] \to $$\mathbb R$ by $G(x) = x - g(x).$  Then $G$ is continuous on $[a,b].$ Since $a  \leq g(a)\leq b$ and  $a  \leq g(b)\leq b$ we find $G(a) = a -g(a) \leq 0 $ and $G(b) = b -g(b) \geq 0 $. By the intermediate value theorem, there is a $c ∈ [a,b]$ such that $G(c) = 0$ or $c - g(c) = 0.$ Thus, $g(c) = c.$ (b) Suppose further that $g$ is differentiable and that there exists a $\lambda <1$ with  $|g'(x)|\leq \lambda$ for all $x ∈ [a,b]$. Prove that there is exactly one number $c ∈ [a,b]$ with $g(c) = c$. Here is my attempt: Since there exists two different fixed points $\xi<\xi'$.

Obviously the set of all positive integer sequences is uncountable, so this feels like a bit of a long shot, but I'm hoping the pairwise eventually disjoint condition might put a cap on the cardinality. One thing I've been able to do, using a sort of diagonal argument, is to show that given such a set, if it's countable, I can find a new sequence that's eventually pairwise disjoint to every element in the set, and yet has no number assigned to it. But this new sequence won't actually be in the set, so this doesn't produce a contradiction like a diagonal argument is supposed to.

With Brian's help and suggestion I add the following: Define a function $g$ from $\wp(\Bbb P)$ to $A$ as follows: take $X \in \wp(\Bbb P)$ and send it to $X\cup\Bbb Q$. The function $g$ is injective, this is easy to see as $X$ and $\Bbb Q$ are disjoint sets. Now, the codomain of g is $A$, so we would have to check that $X\cup\Bbb Q$ is still a dense subset in $\Bbb R$. Pick a real number, as $\Bbb Q$ is dense in $\Bbb R$, we know that for a given $r>0$, there exists $q \in \Bbb Q$ such that $q \in B(x,r) \cap \Bbb Q$. But $B(x,r) \cap \Bbb Q$ is included in $B(x,r) \cap X\cup\Bbb Q$, it follows that  $X\cup\Bbb Q$ is dense in $\Bbb R$. From the existence of the injective functions $f$ and $g$, we can conclude that $|P(\mathbb R)|\le|A|\le|P(\mathbb R)|$, then $|A|=|P(\mathbb R)|$.","['general-topology', 'cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory', 'analysis']"

Not much is proven about the classes of probability measures in general, and I wanted to know whether much is known when they are considered as metric spaces or topological spaces. For example, given two positive real numbers $\beta, L > 0$, Tsybakov defines the ${\bf Nikol'ski ~ class}$ ${\cal H}(\beta, L)$ to be the set of functions $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that the derivative $f^{(l)}$ of order $l = \lfloor \beta \rfloor$ exists and satisfies $\left[ \int \left( f^{(l)}(x+t) - f^{(l)}(x) \right)^2 dx \right]^{\frac{1}{2}} \leq L|t|^{\beta - l}$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$.

To show that $A \times B$ is well ordered: Take two elements: $(a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2) \in A \times B$.
Then there are three cases:
1. $a_1 < a_2$. in this case $(a_1,b_1) < (a_2,b_2)$
2. $a_1 > a_2$. in this case $(a_1,b_1) > (a_2,b_2)$

if $b_1 < b_2$ then $(a_1,b_1) < (a_2,b_2)$. and if $b_1 = b_2$ then $(a_1,b_1) = (a_2,b_2)$. To show that $U$ has a minimal element:
Take $U \subseteq A \times B$, a non empty set. $U = \{ (a_i,b_j)| a_i \in A, b_j \in B \}$. Where $i,j \in I$ and $I$ is a linearly ordered set of indexes. Then the set $\{a_i | (a_i,b_j) \in A \times B\}$ has a minimal element: $a_{i_0}$. Also the set $\{ b_j | (a_{i_0},b_j) \}$ has a minimal element $b_{j_0}$.

So, since $C(x)$ contains $Z(G)$ for every $x$ not in $G$ then $|C(x)|> |Z(G)|$ i.e. $|C(x)|> p$. But $C(x)$ is always a subgroup of $G$ so it’s order must divide the order of $G$ and so $|C(x)= p^2$. (If $|C(x)|= p^3$ then $|G:C(x)|= |G|/|C(x)| = p^3/p^3 = 1$, so the number of elements in every conjugacy class would be 1, which would imply that every element is in the center of $G$, which in turn would mean that $G$ is abelian, which is not what we're after.)
If $|C(x)|= p^2$ then $|G:C(x)|= |G|/|C(x)| = p^3/p^2= p$.

Any problems? is that all?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"
516610,Function of a complex variable; must the real and imaginary parts be functions of two variables?,"Quoting Saff & Snider's ""Fundamentals of Complex Analysis"" (3rd. edition): If w denotes the value of the function $f$ at the point $z$ , we then write $w=f(z)$ . Just as $z$ decomposes into real and imaginary parts as $z=a+ib$ , the real and imaginary parts of $w$ are each (real-valued) functions of $z$ or, equivalently, of $x$ and $y$ , and so we customarily write $w=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$ with $u$ and $v$ denoting the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of $w$ . Thus a complex valued function of  a complex variable is, in essence, a pair of real functions of two real variables. My question is, does $u$ and $v$ have do be functions from $\mathbb{R}^2$ ? If $z=x+iy$ and $w=a+ib$ , can you have just $h(x)=a$ and $g(y)=b$ so that $w=h(x)+ig(y)$ ? What about stuff like $w=u(x,y,0)+iv(x,y,0)$ ? Basically, why is it obvious that $f(z)$ should decompose into functions of two variables? Is there a nice way to think about this?",['complex-analysis']
516620,How does this differentiation come about ?,"The question is that: If $f(z)$ is analytic, show that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \bar z} = 0$ Now, assuming $f(z) = u + iv$ $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \bar z} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar z}(u + iv)$ What the book does is this: $$
(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}.\frac{\partial x}{\partial \bar z} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}.\frac{\partial y} {\partial \bar z})
$$ for the $u$ part. Similarly for the $v$ part Can someone please explain how that is done ?","['complex-numbers', 'derivatives', 'complex-analysis']"
516622,marble probabilities,"A bucket has 3 marbles numbered 1, 2, and 3. Choose one and put it back along with another marble with the same number. Now choose a second and put it back along with a marble with the sum of your first two picks. Choose one more marble. Find P(the first number was a 3 | third was a 3). So what I did was draw out the entire tree of possibilities and then used the equation P(1st =3 AND 3rd =3)/P(3rd =3) and got 4/9 as the answer. Can anyone confirm this is correct? Also, is there an easier was to do this without drawing out the whole tree? Thanks!",['probability']
