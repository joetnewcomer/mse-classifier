1624933,What's the distributional derivative of a Banach space valued almost surely continuous stochastic process?,"Let $(\Omega,\mathcal A,\operatorname P)$ be a probability space and $\lambda$ be the Lebesgue measure on $[0,\infty)$ $(H,\left\|\;\cdot\;\right\|)$ be a Banach space over the field $\mathbb F\in\left\{\mathbb R,\mathbb C\right\}$ $(X_t)_{t\ge 0}$ be a $H$-valued almost surely continuous stochastic process on $(\Omega,\mathcal A,\operatorname P)$ Let $\omega\in\Omega$ with $X(\omega)\in C^0([0,\infty);H)$.
Then $$X_{[a,b]}(\omega)\text{ is compact in }(H,\left\|\;\cdot\;\right\|)\;\;\;\text{for all }0\le a\le b<\infty\;$$ Especially, $X(\omega)\in\mathcal L_{\text{loc}}^p(\lambda;H)$ and hence $$X(\omega)\varphi\in\mathcal L^p(\lambda;H)\;\;\;\text{for all }\varphi\in C_c^\infty([0,\infty);H)$$ for all $p\in [1,\infty)$. Thus, we can view $X(\omega)$ as being a distribution $$C_c^\infty([0,\infty);H)\to H\;,\;\;\;\varphi\mapsto\int X(\omega)\varphi\;{\rm d}\lambda\;.\tag 1$$ Is there anything I'm missing? Are some of my conclusions wrong? And what's the distributional derivative of $X$? [I've read the Wikipedia article about the distributional derivative, but I don't know how we need to translate the definition to the setting described here]. EDIT : The question arose as I saw people talking about the distributional derivative of a (cylindrical) Brownian motion on a Hilbert space without giving a definition of what they mean. As @charlestoncrabb pointed out, my attempt in $(1)$ seems to be wrong, since the product $X(\omega)\varphi$ is not defined. Maybe we need to let $H$ be a Hilbert space with inner product $\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle$ and replace $X(\omega)\varphi$ by $\langle X(\omega),\varphi\rangle$. By the same argumentation as before, the integral would exist. But honestly, I'm only guessing. Until now, I failed to generalize the usual notion to this scenario, but since people are using it, there must be some notion of distributional derivative of $X$.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'distribution-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'stochastic-analysis']"
1624955,The Inverse of a Fourth Order Tensor,"Suppose that we have a fourth order tensor ${\bf{A}}$ $${\bf{A}}=A_{ijkl} {\bf{e}}_i \otimes {\bf{e}}_j \otimes {\bf{e}}_k \otimes {\bf{e}}_l$$ in the orthonormal basis $\{{\bf{e}}_1,{\bf{e}}_2,{\bf{e}}_3\}$ for $\mathbb{R}^3$ . Here, we have used Einstein summation convention which assume sum over any repeated index. Then we define the inverse of ${\bf{A}}$ denoted by ${\bf{B}}$ as follows $${\bf{A}} : {\bf{B}} = {\bf{B}} : {\bf{A}} = {\bf{I}}$$ where ${\bf{I}}$ is the fourth order identity tensor $$\begin{align}
{\bf{I}} &=I_{ijkl} {\bf{e}}_i \otimes {\bf{e}}_j \otimes {\bf{e}}_k \otimes {\bf{e}}_l\\

However, I could not find any good resource on the net that gives the elements of ${\bf{B}}$ in terms of the elements of ${\bf{A}}$ . How should I compute ${\bf{B}} = {\bf{A}}^{-1}$ ? An application of this can be found in the theory of elasticity, where the fourth order tensor have the following symmetries $$A_{ijkl}=A_{jikl}=A_{ijlk}=A_{klij}.$$ That would be great if you can also touch upon this.","['matrices', 'tensors', 'mathematical-physics', 'multivariable-calculus']"

1624991,Classify all groups of order $p^2q^2$ up to isomorphism,"Let $p,q \in \mathbb{N}$ be prime numbers with the properties $2 < p < q$  and $q - 1 , q + 1 \notin \left\langle p \right\rangle$ Classify all groups of the order $p^2q^2$ up to isomorphism. This was a question given by my algebra professor and quite frankly I am stumped.
My initial thought was that this question is referring to p-Sylow subgroups and one would need to apply the Sylow-theorems. If this is true, how would you apply them? Then what does ""up to isomorphism"" exactly mean? I also thought to try and break it down and look at different possible cases. For example something like this: Since 
$$q - 1 \notin \left\langle p \right\rangle \Rightarrow p \nmid q - 1 $$
$\Rightarrow \exists! $ subgroup of order $p$  $\Rightarrow \exists p - 1 $elements of order $p$ and $q-1$ elements of order $q$. But honestly I am not sure how to answer this question. I would really appreciate if someone could try and explain this to me. Thank you in advance!","['abstract-algebra', 'p-groups', 'group-theory', 'sylow-theory']"

1625017,Dirac's delta in 3 dimensions: proof of $\nabla^2(\|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0\|^{-1})=-4\pi\delta(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0)$,"If $T_f$ is a distribution, i.e. a linear functional, continuous according to the convergence defined here , defined on the space $K$ of the functions of class $C^\infty$ that are null outside a bounded interval (which is not the same for all functions), its derivative is defined as $$\frac{dT_f}{dx}(\varphi):=-T_f(\varphi')$$where $\varphi'$ is the derivative of $\varphi$. The symbolic writing $T_f(\varphi)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\varphi(x)dx$ is often used to write such a functional, since, if $g$ is (Riemann or Lebesgue) integrable on every bounded interval, then $\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x)\varphi(x)dx$ indeed is such a continuous functional. In this context, we can symbolically define the ""derivative"" $f'$, for any $T_f$, even if the symbolic writing $f$ does not refer to an integrable function, according to the expression$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f'(x)\varphi(x)dx:=-\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\varphi'(x)dx=:\frac{dT_f}{dx}(\varphi).$$ Let us come to my question. While studying physics, in particular the theory of electromagnetism and the derivation of the Biot-Savart law from Ampère's law , I always find the equality$$\nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{\|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0\|}\right)=-4\pi\delta(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0)$$where $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian $^1$. I suppose that, in the tridimensional case, with $\phi:\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}$, $\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\frac{\partial f(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_i}\phi(\boldsymbol{x}) dx_1dx_2dx_3$ is analogously defined as $\frac{\partial T_f}{\partial x_i}(\varphi)$, which I suppose to be analogously defined, in turn, as $-\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}f(\boldsymbol{x})\frac{\partial \phi(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_i} dx_1dx_2dx_3$, although I say I suppose because I have not found a rigourous definition of such derivatives on line nor in cartaceous texts; as to mathematical resources, I have studied Kolmogorov-Fomin's Элементы теории функций и функционального анализа , which only focuses on the monodimensional $\varphi:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ case. Once fixed a proper definition of such derivatives, how can it be proved that $\nabla^2(\|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0\|^{-1})=-4\pi\delta(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0)$? $^1$ The link contains a derivation of $\nabla^2(\|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0\|^{-1})=-4\pi\delta(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0)$ (equations (18)-(24)) , but I do not understand it: I would understand it if we could apply Gauss's divergence theorem at (20), but I know it for functions of class $C^1(\mathring{A})$, $\overline{V}\subset\mathring{A}$, only, while $\nabla\left(\frac{1}{\|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0\|}\right)$ is not even defined for $\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{x}_0$; the other derivation of the identity $\nabla^2(\|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0\|^{-1})$ $=-4\pi\delta(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0)$ that I have found uses a ""weak limit"", but it does not use the formal definiton of derivative of a distribution that I have written above.

1625223,confusion on exercises from LEE's Book on Riemannian Manifold,"I am reading John Lee's  "" Riemannian Manifolds an Introduction to Curvature "" .
At page 15 exercise 2.3 asks to prove that there exist a smooth extension of a function defined on a embedded submanifold. The exercise is wrong for example we can take f(x)= 1/x defined on positive reals which is a embedded submanifold of $

1625256,Game with coloring squares in rectangular board,"Bob and Susan play a game on an $a\times b$ board by alternating turns. In each turn, the player chooses a square comprising only uncolored cells, and color all of the cells. The first player who is unable to move loses the game. If Bob starts, for which $(a,b)$ can he win? If $a=b$, then clearly he can win by choosing the whole board. Otherwise, say $a<b$, one choice is to color an $a\times a$ square and leave Susan with an $a\times (b-a)$ board, so this points to an induction approach.

1625368,Proving weak convergence of random probability measures,"I don't understand the following as I read along a proof in a paper: We denote by $\mathcal{P}({M})$ the space of probability measures on a metric space $M$ , equipped with the weak topology.

Also, let $\mathbb{Q}$ be a deterministic probability measure on the same probability space. We can then treat $\delta_{\mathbb{Q}}$ be a constant $\mathcal{P}(E)$ -valued random variable. Since both $\text{Law} ( \mu_n) $ and $\text{Law} ( \delta_{\mathbb{Q}})$ are measures on $\mathcal{P}(E)$ , the paper defines that $\mu_n$ converges in law to $\mathbb{Q}$ if $$\text{Law} ( \mu_n) \implies \text{Law} ( \delta_{\mathbb{Q}}). \quad \quad \quad \quad \, \, \, \, (*)$$ However, in the paper, the fact that $\mu_n$ converges in law to $\mathbb{Q}$ is concluded by establishing that $$\mathbb{E} \bigg[ \bigg| \int_E f \,d \mu_n - \int_E f \,d \mathbb{Q} \bigg| \bigg] \rightarrow 0, \quad \quad \quad (**)$$ for all continuous bounded functions $f$ on $E$ .

1625413,"Arithmetic-quadratic mean and other ""means by limits of means""","For $x,y$ positive real numbers, and $p\neq 0$ real, define the Hölder $p$-mean $$M_p(x,y) := \left(\frac{x^p+y^p}{2}\right)^{1/p}$$
whereas
$$M_0(x,y) := \sqrt{xy}$$
is the limit of $M_p(x,y)$ when $p\to 0$, i.e., the geometric mean. Furthermore, when $p,q$ are two real numbers, define $L_{p,q}(x,y)$ as the obvious fixed point satisfying the equation
$$L_{p,q}(x,y) = L_{p,q}(M_p(x,y),M_q(x,y))$$
—meaning that $L_{p,q}(x,y)$ is defined as the common limit of the sequences $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ such that $(x_0,y_0) = (x,y)$ and $(x_{n+1},y_{n+1}) = (M_p(x,y),M_q(x,y))$.  (Showing convergence is easy, and evidently, $L_{p,q} = L_{q,p}$.) Thus, $L_{0,1}(x,y)$ is the famous arithmetic-geometric mean . Among other things, all these functions satisfy $\min(x,y) \leq F(x,y) \leq \max(x,y)$, as well as $F(y,x) = F(x,y)$ and $F(\lambda x, \lambda y) = \lambda F(x,y)$ — so we could just define them from $F(1,x)$, which is continuous and monotonically increasing with value $1$ at $1$.  It is well-known that $M_p(x,y) < M_q(x,y)$ whenever $x\neq y$ and $p<q$, so of course $M_p(x,y) < L_{p,q}(x,y) < M_q(x,y)$ under those circumstances. Surprisingly, I can find no reference to the $L_{p,q}$ in the literature except for $(p,q)=(0,1)$ (mentioned above), and $(p,q)=(-1,1)$ which this page points out is just $M_0$.  More generally, we have
$$L_{p,-p}(x,y) = M_0(x,y)$$
and
$$L_{0,p}(x,y) = \big(L_{0,1}(x^p,y^p)\big)^{1/p}$$

Experimentally, it satisfies $L_{1,2}(x,y) \leq M_{3/2}(x,y)$, something which is probably easy to prove and not interesting enough to try, so that's not my question.  Instead, my question will be: Can $L_{1,2}$, or more generally $L_{p,q}$ (with $0<p<q$), be expressed in closed form using elementary functions and the arithmetic-geometric mean $L_{0,1}$?  Or at least using ""standard"" special functions (e.g. elliptic integrals)?

My first question is this : Does this behavior (i.e. the peak shifting toward higher $m$ as $k$ grows) continue indefinitely, or will the peak stabilize at some point? The latter seems unlikely but I can't be sure. My second question is this : Approximately how fast does the peak-value $m_{peak}$ move as $k$ grows? I briefly looked at the Erdõs-Kac Theorem , but this involves distinct primes and I don't really know much number theory, so any help would be greatly appreciated!","['number-theory', 'recreational-mathematics', 'factoring', 'analytic-number-theory']"
1625457,Riemannian metrics on homogeneous spaces,"Let G be a Lie group and H be a compact subgroup. The (left) coset space G/H is, up to an isomorphism, equivalent to the smooth homogeneous manifold M . My question is, is it possible to impose an explicit Riemannian structure on this manifold by specifying G as an isometry group with corresponding isotropy group H ? For example, consider the group SO(3) . The coset space SO(3)/SO(2) is then isomorphic to the 2 sphere. If one specifies SO(3) as the group of isometries, is it possible to recover an explicit expression for the metric?

1625473,Study of algebraic structures analogous to the ring of smooth functions and module of vector fields,"$\newcommand{\Ga}{\Gamma}$ Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. $\Ga(TM)$ is a module over the ring of smooth (real) functions (which is also an algebra, and denoted by $C^{\infty}(M)$). Also, each $X \in \Ga(TM)$ defines a derivation on $C^{\infty}(M)$. That is , we have two operations: $(1)$ ""scalar multiplication"" (satisfies the module axioms): $C^{\infty}(M) \times \Ga(TM) \to \Ga(TM) \, , (f,X) \mapsto fX$, $(2)$ ""differentiation"": $\Ga(TM) \times C^{\infty}(M) \to C^{\infty}(M) \, , (X,f) \mapsto Xf$ satisfying: $(1) \, (X+Y)f=Xf+Yf$ $(2) \, (gX)f=g(Xf)$ $(3) \, X(fg)=g(Xf)+f(gX)$ (derivation property) Is there any literature from an algebraic perspective, on this situation; i.e on pairs $(M,R)$ where $M$ is an $R$-module , and we also have a ""differentiation"" operation: $M \times R \to R \, , (m,r) \mapsto mr$, satisfying: $(1)$ $(m+m')r=mr+m'r$ $(2)$ $(r'm)r=r'(mr)$ $(3)$ $m(rr')=r(mr')+r'(mr)$ Can we say anything interesting on this interplay algebraically?

1625478,An approximation of $\log \frac{n+1}{n}$ inside of a limit,"This question arises from a question posed here : $$\lim_{n \to \infty} n - n^2 \log \frac{n+1}{n} = \frac{1}{2}$$ I figured we could approximate $\log \frac{n+1}{n} = \int_{n}^{n+1} \frac{1}{x} \, dx \approx \frac{1}{2} ( \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n+1} )$ and we get the right answer if we plug that in and then take the limit. This method is worrying, however, since we seem to have applied limits separately. Indeed, if we take any different approximation of the $\log$ term of the form $\frac{\alpha}{n} + \frac{(1 - \alpha)}{n+1}$ with $\alpha \in (0,1)$ we get the limit to be $1 - \alpha$. I would actually think some $\alpha < 1/2$ would be ideal since $\log$ is concave, but I suppose as $n \to \infty$ the behavior of log on any interval $[n, n+1]$ becomes more and more linear, hence why we take $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$. This is a lot of text; I suppose the question is: is it rigorous to approximate $\log$ like this and then apply the limit separately to the rest of the term, or are we just lucky that it works out? If it is not rigorous, what arguments can we make to better understand why and convince ourselves that it works out?","['real-analysis', 'limits']"

But interestingly enough, Wolfram Alpha gives the same result. Using Residue calculus we get $$ \int_{-R}^{R} e^{ix^2} dx = - \int_{\gamma} e^{iz^2} dz, $$
where $\gamma$ is a semicircle in the upper half plane of radius R. With $t\to Re^{it}$ the rhs becomes: $$ \int_{0}^{\pi} e^{iR^2 e^{2it}} iRe^{it} dt. $$

1626042,"counterexample to a ""theorem"" on continuity of largest deltas for continuous functions $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$","""Theorem 12"" in these notes states the following (verbatim): Let $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ be continuous and let $\epsilon>0$. For $x\in[a,b]$, let 
  $$\Delta(x)=\sup\left\{\delta\,\,|\,\,\text{for all}\,y\in[a,b]\,\text{with}\,|x-y|<\delta,\,|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon\right\}$$
  Then $\Delta$ is a continuous function of $x$. In other words (this is my paraphrase of the imprecise statement about the supremum), $\Delta(x)$ is the largest $\delta$ we can pick at $x$ that keeps the variation of $f$ within $\epsilon$. (Of course, for a specified $x$, the set of $\delta$'s is nonempty because $f$ is continuous.) Following the statement of the theorem, we're invited to use it to prove that continuous functions on closed and bounded intervals are uniformly continuous. But I think this theorem is false. Take $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ on $[0,1]$ and $\epsilon=0.5$. I claim $$\Delta(x)=\begin{cases}\sqrt{x}-0.25&x>0.25\\\sqrt{x}+0.25&0\leq x\leq0.25\end{cases}$$ which has a jump discontinuity at $x=0.25$. This follows from a straightforward calculation I carried out for arbitrary $\epsilon$, which gives $$\Delta(x)=\begin{cases}2\epsilon\sqrt{x}-\epsilon^2&x>\epsilon^2\\2\epsilon\sqrt{x}+\epsilon^2&0\leq x\leq\epsilon^2\end{cases}$$ with a jump discontinuity at $x=\epsilon^2$. This contradicts the quoted theorem. (As a side note, this computation gives a very nice brute-force way to discover that choosing $\delta=\epsilon^2$ suffices for the uniform continuity of $\sqrt{x}$ on $[0,\infty)$. Indeed it shows more: this choice of $\delta$ is the largest we can make, because it is the infimum of $\Delta$. I wish I'd done this computation in college.) I have two questions: Am I missing something, or does my counterexample show this claim is false? I've reworked the calculation and don't believe I'm wrong, but I could spell out the details if someone asks. If the claim is false, can it be repaired to do what the instructor wanted to do with it? (Please note that with question 2 I'm not asking for any old proof of the special case of the Heine-Cantor theorem that says continuous functions on closed and bounded intervals are uniformly continuous. I know the proof of the general result in arbitrary metric spaces. I'm asking: what theorem could the instructor possibly have had in mind instead of Theorem 12, as stated?) ADDED : a sketch of the calculation of $\Delta(x)$ for $\sqrt{x}$ on $[0,\infty)$ for arbitrary $\epsilon$. Break the work into cases. Case one: $\sqrt{x}>\epsilon$, i.e. $x>\epsilon^2$. The inverse image of the interval $(\sqrt{x}-\epsilon,\sqrt{x}+\epsilon)$ is $\big((\sqrt{x}-\epsilon)^2,(\sqrt{x}+\epsilon)^2\big)$. Therefore $$\Delta(x)=\min\big(x-(\sqrt{x}-\epsilon)^2,(\sqrt{x}+\epsilon)^2-x\big)=x-(\sqrt{x}-\epsilon)^2=2\epsilon\sqrt{x}-\epsilon^2$$ Case two: $\sqrt{x}\leq\epsilon$, i.e. $x<\epsilon^2$. Now we just look at the inverse image of $[0,\sqrt{x}+\epsilon)$, so it's only the right-hand boundary of the inverse image that matters for controlling the variation of $f$. The right-hand boundary is still $(\sqrt{x}+\epsilon)^2$, so $\Delta(x)=(\sqrt{x}+\epsilon)^2-x=2\epsilon\sqrt{x}+\epsilon^2$. CORRECTION (1/27/16): John Ma correctly points out in the comments that the correct calculation for $\sqrt{x}$ is the lower semicontinuous function $$\Delta(x)=\begin{cases}2\epsilon\sqrt{x}-\epsilon^2&x\color{red}{\geq}\epsilon^2\\2\epsilon\sqrt{x}+\epsilon^2&0\leq x\color{red}{<}\epsilon^2\end{cases}$$ rather than my original upper semicontinuous $$\Delta(x)=\begin{cases}2\epsilon\sqrt{x}-\epsilon^2&x\color{blue}{>}\epsilon^2\\2\epsilon\sqrt{x}+\epsilon^2&0\leq x\color{blue}{\leq}\epsilon^2\end{cases}$$","['real-analysis', 'examples-counterexamples', 'proof-verification', 'continuity', 'uniform-continuity']"

The following problem is Exercise 3.16 from Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry by Reid: Let $I=\ker \{k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\rightarrow k[a_1,\dots,a_n]=A\}$ , and consider $V=V(I)$ in $k^n$ . Let $Y_1,\dots,Y_m$ be general linear forms in $X_1,\dots,X_m$ , and write $\pi: k^n\rightarrow k^m$ for the linear projection defined by the $Y$ 's. Set $p = \pi |V : V → k^m$ . Prove that for every $P \in k^m$ , $p^{−1}(P)$ is a finite set, and nonempty if $k$ is algebraically closed.

I am confused about the concept finite extension. I saw an example of $A=\mathbb C[x_1,x_2]/(x_1x_2-1)$ . Apparently the assumption is $x_1$ is transcendental over $\mathbb C$ .

1626335,The étale fundamental group as a functor,"The usual ""topological fundamental group"" $\pi_1 (X,x)$ of a pointed topological space $(X,x)$ is functorial in the sense that a pointed continuous map $f\colon (X,x)\rightarrow (Y,y)$ induces a homomorphism $f_* \colon \pi_1 (X,x)\rightarrow \pi_1 (Y,y)$ via composition with $f$ i.e. $[\alpha]\mapsto [f\circ\alpha]$ where $\alpha$ is a loop in $X$ based at $x$. I know that the étale fundamental group of a variety over $K$ with a distinguished $K$-point is supposed to be functorial in the same way (i.e. gives a functor from the category of pointed varieties over $K$ to the category of groups) but there are two technical issues I need to settle. Here is my definition of the étale fundamental group: Let $X$ be a variety over $K$, let $x\in X(K)$ and let $\textbf{Cov}(X,x)$ denote the category of finite pointed étale covers $(Y,y)\rightarrow (X,x)$ where $y\in Y(K)$. Let $\Phi_x\colon \textbf{Cov}(X, x)\rightarrow \textbf{Set}$ denote the fibre functor sending a covering $\phi: (Y,y)\rightarrow (X,x)$ to the fibre $\phi^{-1}(x)\subseteq Y$. Then the étale fundamental group of $(X,x)$ is defined as $\pi_1^{\text{ét}} (X,x) = \operatorname{Aut}(\Phi_x)$. Now I want to show that if $f\colon (X,x)\rightarrow (Y,y)$ is a pointed morphism of varieties, it induces a homomorphism $f_* \colon \pi_1^{\text{ét}} (X,x)\rightarrow \pi_1^{\text{ét}} (Y,y)$. I read right at the start of these notes how to begin: pick a cover $\phi\colon (Y', y')\rightarrow (Y,y)$ in $\textbf{Cov}(Y,y)$. Then apparently the pullback $\phi^*\colon X\times_Y Y'\rightarrow X$ is a finite étale cover of $X$ (i.e. an object in $\textbf{Cov}(X,x)$) and the fibre of $\phi^*$ above $x$ is isomorphic to the fibre of $\phi$ above $y$. My questions are: Why is $\phi^* \colon X\times_Y Y' \rightarrow X$ a finite étale cover of $X$? How can I show the claim that $\Phi_x (X\times_Y Y', \phi^*) \cong \Phi_y (Y', \phi)$? I will mainly be restricting my varieties $X$ and $Y$ to be elliptic curves , so an explanation assuming this would also be very welcome. Edit : Kevin Carlson's comments below have helped me solve question 2 by myself. I include a proof here for completeness, but because I still don't have an answer to question 1 I have not posted this as an answer. To get a canonical isomorphism $\Phi_x (X\times_Y Y')\cong \Phi_y (Y)$, note that $\Phi_x (X\times_Y Y') = \text{Spec}(K)\times_X (X\times_Y Y')$ and $\Phi_y (Y') = \text{Spec}(K)\times_Y Y'$ where $X\xleftarrow{x}\text{Spec}(K)\xrightarrow{y} Y$ are the $K$-points. Then since $f\circ x = y$, we have a commutative diagram where the two inner squares are pullbacks: Then from the pullback pasting lemma (see the section ""pasting of pullbacks"") the outer rectangle is a pullback diagram and so it follows that $\Phi_x (X\times_Y Y')$ has the UMP of the fibre product $\text{Spec}(K)\times_Y Y' = \Phi_y (Y)$, so must be isomorphic.","['category-theory', 'etale-cohomology', 'group-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1626336,A random variable is symmetric if and only if its characteristic function is real-valued,"Quick summary: I am stuck on the implication: $\phi_X$ real-valued $\rightarrow$ $X$ symmetric. Assume you have a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F},P)$, and a random varaiable $X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R^d}$, it is measurable with respect to $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R^d})$. We define the characteristic function $\phi_X: \mathbb{R^d}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$. With $\phi_X(u)=\int_\Omega e^{i<u,X(\omega)>}dP=\int_{\mathbb{R^d}}e^{i<u,x>}d\,u_x$, the measure $u_x$ is the distribution function:$u_x(B)=P(X^{-1}(B)), B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R^d}))$. We say that X is symmetric iff $P(X\in B)=P(X\in-B)), B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R^d})$. Or equivalently $\mu_X(B)=\mu_X(-B)$. I am supposed to show that X is symmetric if and only if the characteristic function of X: $\phi_X$ is real valued. One part I seem to have managed: If we start with that X is symmetric, by then splitting $\mathbb{R^d}$ in all its hyperdimensional ""octants"" or ""quadrants"" and $\{0\}$, the result follows(but there is some work involved, but I think it is ok this way). The problem is the other way: If I start with the knowledge that the characteristic function is real valued, how should I then work to show that X is symmetric? I tried assumeing that there is one set B such that $P(X \in B)\ne P(X \in -B)$,  and then try to arrive at a contradiction: If I split $\mathbb{R}^d$ in: $\{0\}, L_1=(+,+,+..,+), L_2=(-,-,-,,-), L_3=(+,+,+,..,-)L_4=(-,-,-,..,+)$ etc. So that I get $\{0\}$ and $2^d$ $L_k$s. Where $L_{2i-1}=-L_{2i}$. Then I must have that $P(X \in B)\ne P(X \in -B)$, implies that there is atleast one i, such that $P(X \in B\cap L_{2i-1})\ne P(X \in -B\cap L_{2i})$ or $P(X \in B\cap L_{2i})\ne P(X \in -B\cap L_{2i-1})$, because if all these were equal, and since they are a partition of $\mathbb{R}^d$(with $\{0\}$) we would end up with: $P(X \in B)= P(X \in -B)$. But this is as far as I got, beacuse even if I have that: $P(X \in B\cap L_{2i-1})\ne P(X \in -B\cap L_{2i})$ I can't see how this would contradict the characteristic function beeing real valued. My only idea is to chose one u, such that we get a complex number when we integrate, my only idea is choosing u for instance 1 in those parts that is a + in $L_{2_i-1}$, but I can't really see this leading anywere, since 0 in a exponential funciton, doesnt lead to a 0 in the function itself.

The intuition is somewhat clear to me: ""separate"" the singularities or smooth them out (for curves at least). However, in practice, finding the integral closure of a ring in its field of fractions is not so clear. I was reading through this thread and the comments, but I couldn't quite figure out how to see that you need to need to add ""x"" amount of points above a singularity. Example: Take the curve defined on the affine plane $y^2 = x^6 - 1$. It is smooth, and its projective closure is the curve defined by $Y^2Z^4 = X^6 - Z^6$ in the coordinates $[X,Y,Z]$ on $\mathbb{P}^2$. When $Z = 0$, we get $X = 0$ and $Y$ is free, so we add one point at infinity, $[0,1,0]$. By calculating the Jacobian or looking at the affine patch where $Y \neq 0$, we see that the projective closure is singular at this point. We are supposed to get two points from this one point in the normalization (since we know it is a hyperelliptic curve and there should be no ramification at $\infty$ in this case), but how am I supposed to see it? If I were to do it algebraically I would have to look at the integral closure of $\left(\frac{k[x,z]}{(x^6 - z^6 - z^4)}\right)_{(\bar{x},\bar{z})}$ in $k(\bar{x},\bar{y})$, and this doesn't look too enticing.

1626589,A combinatorial problem arising from an exercise on the weil conjectures,"I am trying to learn a little bit about the Weil conjectures and specifically i'm trying to do exercise 5.5 in appendix C of Hartshorne. I'll try to explain quickly the problem so you don't have to read it in the book  but I think that I have reduced the problem to a purely combinatorial question so if you don't know algebraic geometry you can skip this preliminary part and go directly to the combinatorial question below. So let's $C$ be a curve of genus $g$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Define $N_r = \# C(\mathbb{F}_{q^r})$. The question in Hartshorne is Show that $N_1,...,N_g$ determines $N_r$ for all $r \in \mathbb N$ using the weil conjectures So let me explain what the Weil conjectures tell us (again you can skip this and go to the combinatorial formulation of the question at the end).
We define the zeta function of $C$ to be
$$
Z(C,t) = exp (\sum_{i=1}^\infty N_r\frac{t^r} r )
$$ The Weil conjectures in the case of curves then tells you that in fact there exists a polynomial $P$ of degree $2g$ such that 
$$
Z(C,t) = \frac{P(t)}{(1-t)(1-qt)}
$$
where $P(0)=1$. It also tells you that if you write $a_1,...,a_{2g}$ for the reciprocals of the roots of $P$ (i.e. $P(t) = \prod (1 - a_it)$) then then you can order them so that $a_i = q/a_{2g-i}$ for all $i$ in $1,...,g$ and $|a_i|=q^{1/2}$. Now it is easy to see that this implies that for all $r \in \mathbb N$ we have $$
\sum_{i=1}^g a_i^r + \left(\frac q {a_i}\right)^r = q^r +1 - N_r
$$ So here is my combinatorial question : Suppose you are given $g$ complex numbers $a_1,...,a_g$ such that $|a_i| = q^{1/2}$ for $q$ the power of a prime number.. For all $r \in \mathbb N$, write 
$$C_r = \sum_{i=1}^g a_i^r + \left(\frac q {a_i}\right)^r.
$$
 Then is it true that knowing $C_1,...,C_g$ implies that you know all the $C_r$ and if so why ?","['combinatorics', 'algebraic-geometry']"

1626810,How to pick the same color spheres out of two boxes,"For the following problem: There are two boxes $A$ and $B$. Box $A$ contains $3$ red, $8$ white and $13$ green spheres, while box $B$ contains $5$ red, $7$ white and $6$ green spheres. If we pick one sphere from each box at random, what is the probability that they have the same color? I followed this way of thinking: I assume the following events: $A_1:=\{ \text{Sphere from box A is red} \}, \quad \quad B_1:=\{ \text{Sphere from box B is red} \} $ $A_2:=\{ \text{Sphere from box A is white} \}, \quad B_2:=\{ \text{Sphere from box B is white} \} $ $A_3:=\{ \text{Sphere from box A is green} \}, \quad B_3:=\{ \text{Sphere from box B is green} \} $ Then the probability that they have the same color will be:
\begin{equation}
P[(A_1 \cap B_1)\cup (A_2 \cap B_2)\cup (A_3 \cap B_3)]
\end{equation}
But those events are both independent and mutually exclusive therefore for two events $A$ and $B$ it generally holds:
\begin{equation}
P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B), \quad P(A \cap B)=P(A)P(B)
\end{equation}
So our equation above is rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
P[(A_1 \cap B_1)\cup (A_2 \cap B_2)\cup (A_3 \cap B_3)]=P(A_1)P(B_1)+P(A_2)P(B_2)+P(A_3)P(B_3)
\end{equation}
which now is just a matter of arithmetics. Anyway, my question is the following: Is my thinking above correct? And if yes, I am pretty sure there is a faster way to go with this one. Any ideas? Thank you!","['statistics', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"
1626825,External ballistics: Prove that the range is a concave function of the elevation,"Consider a projectile moving in a plane. One of many different models for this problem is the following ordinary differential equation \begin{align} 
x''(t) &= -Ex'(t), \\
y''(t) &= -Ey'(t)- g,
\end{align} together with the initial condition \begin{alignat}{2}
x(0) &= 0, \qquad x'(0) &= v_0 \cos(\theta), \\
y(0) &= 0, \qquad y'(0) &= v_0 \sin(\theta).
\end{alignat} Here $E \ge 0$ is a non-negative function which specifies the friction, $g > 0$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $v_0$ is the muzzle velocity of the gun and $\theta$ is the elevation of the gun. The case of $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$ corresponds to shooting straight into the air. Cases of special interest include 
\begin{equation}
E = f(v)v,
\end{equation} 
where $f$ reflects the geometry of the projectile or the more general 
\begin{equation}
E = E(v,y),
\end{equation}
which also allows the atmosphere to vary with the height of the projectile above the ground level $y=0$. The time of flight $\tau = \tau(\theta)$ from the muzzle of the gun to the point of impact is the unique positive solution of the equation \begin{equation}
y(\theta,\tau(\theta)) = 0.
\end{equation} The range $r$ of the gun is defined as \begin{equation}
r(\theta) = x(\theta,\tau(\theta)),
\end{equation} i.e. the $x$ coordinate of the shell at the point of impact. I have enough numerical evidence to suggest that the range is a concave function of the elevation, but no proof. I imagine that this is a result which is at about 90 years old, but I have not found a proof in the literature and I have not had any luck myself. The result is significant in the context of computing a firing solution for a target with coordinates $(d,0)$, i.e. solving the non-linear equation \begin{equation}
r(\theta) = d
\end{equation} with respect to elevation $\theta$. While a precomputed firing table should always be used to generate a good initial guess $\theta \approx \theta_0$, I have observed that the secant method as well as Newton's method for this equation are both globally convergent. These observations would be explained if the range function could be shown to be concave. I welcome ideas and suggestions about how to attack this problem, but since I suspect that this is an old result, I am primarily looking for a reference to a specific paper.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems']"
1626826,Null Functional on $l^2$,"Let $l^2$ be the hilbert space of all complex sequences $\psi= (\psi_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ such that $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} |\psi_j |^2 < \infty$. Let $\phi= (\phi_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of complex numbers, and $S$ a vector subspace of $l^2$ which is dense in $l^2$. Assume that for all $\psi = (\psi_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ in $S$, we have 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \bar{\phi_n} \psi_n = 0.
\end{equation}
Can we conclude that $\phi=0$? What if we only suppose that $S$ is a dense subset of $l^2$? Please note that I am not assuming that $\phi$ is in $l^2$, otherwise the answer to both questions is trivially yes (take a sequence $\psi^{(N)}$ in $S$ converging to $\phi$ and use the continuity of the scalar product). PS The motivation for this question is the following. Set $D= \{ \phi \in l^2 : \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} j |\phi_j |^2 < \infty \}$ and consider the operator $X$ on $D$ which associates to each $\phi \in D$ the vector $X \phi$ whose j-th component (j=0,1,2,...) is $(X \phi)_j = \sqrt{j+1} \psi_{j+1} + \sqrt{j} \psi_{j-1}$, where we set $\psi_{-1}=0$. We have for every $\phi \in l^2 , \psi \in D$ 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \bar{\phi_j} [\sqrt{j+1} \psi_{j+1} + \sqrt{j} \psi_{j-1}] = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \psi_j \overline{ [\sqrt{j+1} \phi_{j+1} + \sqrt{j} \phi_{j-1}]},
\end{equation} 
where again we set $\phi_{-1}=0$.
So in particular, $X$ is a symmetric operator. But it is not self-adjoint. To see this, consider the vector $\phi$ whose j-th component is $\phi_j = (-1)^{\lfloor j/2 \rfloor} j^{-\beta}$, where $1/2 < \beta <1$. Is is easy to see that $\phi \in l^2 \backslash D$, and that the vector whose j-th component  is $\sqrt{j+1} \phi_{j+1} + \sqrt{j} \phi_{j-1}$ is in $l^2$, so $\phi$ belongs to the domain of the adjoint. I conjectured that the domain of the adjoint $X^{*}$ is exactly the set of all vectors $\phi \in l^2$ such that $ \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}  |\sqrt{j+1} \phi_{j+1} + \sqrt{j} \phi_{j-1} |^2 < \infty$. This is the point where my question comes into play. If the answer to the question I posted were affirmative, then it would be easy, by using riesz theorem, to prove my conjecture.","['functional-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'hilbert-spaces']"
