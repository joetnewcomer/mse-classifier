175896,Finding a point along a line a certain distance away from another point!,"Let's say you have two points, $(x_0, y_0)$ and $(x_1, y_1)$. The gradient of the line between them is: $$m = (y_1 - y_0)/(x_1 - x_0)$$ And therefore the equation of the line between them is: $$y = m (x - x_0) + y_0$$ Now, since I want another point along this line, but a distance $d$ away from $(x_0, y_0)$, I will get an equation of a circle with radius $d$ with a center $(x_0, y_0)$ then find the point of intersection between the circle equation and the line equation. Circle Equation w/ radius $d$: $$(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 = d^2$$ Now, if I replace $y$ in the circle equation with $m(x - x_0) + y_0$ I get: $$(x - x_0)^2 + m^2(x - x_0)^2 = d^2$$ I factor is out and simplify it and I get: $$x = x_0 \pm d/ \sqrt{1 + m^2}$$ However, upon testing this equation out it seems that it does not work!

After doing some more advanced analysis it becomes clear that the Riemann integral has some serious flaws. The most natural way to fix all the drawbacks of the Riemann integral is to develop some measure theory and construct the Lebesgue integral. Recently, someone pointed out to me that the Daniell integral is ‘equivalent’ to the Lebesgue integral. It uses a functional analytic approach instead of a measure theoretic one. However, most courses in advanced analysis do not cover the theory of the Daniell integral and most books prefer the Lebesgue integral.

176068,Are minimal prime ideals in a graded ring graded?,"Let $A=\oplus A_i$ be a graded ring. Let $\mathfrak p$ be a minimal prime in $A$. Is $\mathfrak p$ a graded ideal? Intuitively, this means the irreducible components of a projective variety are also projective varieties. When $A$ is Noetherian, I can give a proof, as follows. There is some filtration of $A$, as an $A$ module, 
$$0=M_0\subset M_1\subset\cdots\subset M_n=A$$ such that $M_i/M_{i-1}\cong A/\mathfrak p_i$, for some graded prime ideal $\mathfrak p_i$. Then I claim that the nilradical is $\cap\mathfrak p_i$. This is because $$x^n=0 \Rightarrow x^nA=0 \Rightarrow x^nM_i\subset M_{i-1}\forall i \Rightarrow x^n\in \cap \mathfrak p_i \Leftrightarrow x\in \cap \mathfrak p_i $$ and $$ x\in \cap \mathfrak p_i \Rightarrow xM_i\subset M_{i+1},\forall i  \Rightarrow x^nA=0 \Leftrightarrow x=0.$$
Hence the mininal primdes are just the minimal elements in $\{\mathfrak p_i\}$. I would like to know if this assertion is still true if we drop the Noetherian condition, or if anyone has some more direct proofs. Thanks!","['commutative-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'graded-rings']"

176093,"Proof that if $s_n \leq t_n$ for $n \geq N$, then $\liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} s_n \leq \liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} t_n$","This is half of Theorem 3.19 from Baby Rudin. Rudin claims the proof is trivial. What I've come up with so far doesn't seem trivial, however, and is probably also wrong (my problem with it is pointed out below). This makes me wonder whether I'm overlooking some useful fact and/or using an unprofitable approach. Theorem. If $s_n \leq t_n$ for $n \geq N$, where $N$ is fixed, then $$ \liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} s_n \leq \liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} t_n. $$ Proof. Suppose that $s_n \leq t_n$ if $n \geq N$, but that $$ \liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} s_n > \liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} t_n. $$ Let $E_s$ denote the set of all subsequential limits of $\{s_n\}$, and let $E_t$ denote the set of all subsequential limits of $\{t_n\}$. Then $$ \inf E_s > \inf E_t. $$ This implies that there exists some $x \in E_t$ such that $\inf E_s > x > \inf E_t$, since otherwise $\inf E_t$ would not be the greatest lower bound of $E_t$. Hence some subsequence of $\{t_n\}$, say $\{t_{n_i}\}$, converges to $x < \inf E_s$. Lemma. (from Rudin) If $x < \liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} s_n$, then there exists an integer $N$ such that if $n \geq N$, then $s_n > x$. By the lemma, there exists an integer $N_0$ such that if $n \geq N_0$, then $s_n > x$. Now, let $\epsilon = \inf_{n \geq N_0} \{s_n - x\}$. This is where I think my proof breaks down. Can't $\epsilon$ be zero? Then, since $\{t_{n_i}\}$ converges to $x$, there exists an integer $N_1$ such that if $n_i \geq N_1$, then $|t_{n_i} - x| < \epsilon$. But this means that, if $n_i \geq \max\{N, N_0, N_1\}$, we have both $$ s_{n_i} > t_{n_i}, $$ as well as $s_{n_i} \geq t_{n_i}$, a contradiction.","['limsup-and-liminf', 'inequality', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

176114,Count the number of n-bit strings with an even number of zeros.,"I am currently self-studying introductory combinatorics by reading Introduction to combinatorial mathematics. I am currently in the first chapter, and I have a question regarding one of the examples. The question was asking to count the number of n-bit strings with an even number of zeros. The answer is of course $2^{n-1}$. The author gave 2 solutions. I however didn't completely understand what I think is the straightforward one. The solution I got was that he took out 1 bit, leaving $(n-1)$ bits, if the number of zeros is even in the $(n-1)$-bit number, then he will just append a 1, if not then he will append a zero. So in the end we just needed to count the number of $(n-1)$-bit strings. The other solution (the straightforward one) that I didn't understand examined the symmetry that half of the $2^n$ must have an even number of zeros, and the other half will have an odd number of zeros. I just don't get why this property must hold. I can understand that half of the $2^n$ numbers will have even parity, but I can't see how it holds for the parity of the number of zero or one bits. If anyone can show me how that property holds, I'd be very grateful. I'd also be interested to see different explanations and proofs if possible. Thank you.","['binary', 'combinatorics']"
176129,Quick Question About Dynamical Systems,"Consider the two-dimensional autonomous system 
\begin{equation*}\vec{\frac{dx}{dt}}(t)=\vec{f}(\vec{x}(t)):\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}^{2}.\end{equation*} Suppose the system has a conserved quantity of motion associated with it (i.e. an energy conservation law):
\begin{equation*}E(\vec{x}(t))=E_{0}\;\forall\;t\Longrightarrow\frac{dE}{dt}=0.\end{equation*} Then here are some questions. (1) Is it possible to have a second conserved quantity of motion which is different from $E$? (2) Is it necessarily the case that $E(x_{1},x_{2})=E_{0}$ corresponds to the integral family of curves which satisfes
\begin{equation*}\frac{dx_{2}}{dx_{1}}=\frac{f_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})}{f_{1}(x_{1},x_{2})}\mapsto F(x_{1},x_{2})=E_{0}\end{equation*}
(i.e. the solution curves in the phase-plane?).  For conservative mechanical systems such as $x''=-f(x)$ this is evidently the case (if one uses the standard physical conservation of energy).  But what about for general systems.  And why or why not is this the case (i.e. a proof)? Actually, I think I can prove (2): If $E$ represents the conserved quantity, then along trajectories, $E(\vec{x})=E_{0}\;\forall\;t$, so that the trajectories must correspond to the level sets of the function $E(\vec{x}):\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}$.  From another point of view, the initial conditions determine (and are determined by) the initial energy $E_{0}$.  Then... (3) Assuming (2) is indeed true, then if the system has a conservative quantity, presumably it can always be obtained by integrating the differential equation obtained by eliminating $t$ from the system?  Of course there are other ways to obtain energy functions (for example, in the mechanical system one can multiply both sides of the equation by $\frac{dx}{dt}$ and integrate).  But what (2) tells me, is that any method which is used to obtain $E$ is necessarily equivalent to integrating the trajectories. (4) Assuming (3), once one integrates the t-eliminated ODE, then all one must do is check that $\frac{dE}{dt}=0$.  If this holds, then the system is conservative and you have your energy function (I am tacitly assuming (1) is NOT true; i.e. that the conserved quantity is unique).  If it does not, then you have your trajectories yes, but there is no conserved quantity along such trajectories. I might add some more questions to this later, but I'll leave it at that for now. Thanks! EDIT: (4) Was kind of a dumb question/observation.  Of course, when you get the integral family of curves you get something like $F(x_{1},x_{2})=C$.  Differentiating this with respect to $t$ of course gives you $0$, so $F$ is obviously constant along trajectories.  But doesn't this effectively say every system is conservative then? ...

176184,Minimize sum of smallest and largest among integers on the real line.,"Suppose there are 3 non-negative integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ on the real line.
We are told that $x + y + z = 300$. Without loss of generality, assume
 $x$ to be the smallest integer, and $z$ to be the largest. How do I minimize $(x + z)$? Attempt: $x + z = 300 - y$, so for a start I should maximize y. This occurs at $y = z - 1$. So, we have $x + 2z = 301$. Now, $z = \dfrac {301}2 - \dfrac x2$. $\dfrac {dz}{dx} = -\dfrac 12$. Increasing $x$ by $1$ decreases $z$ only by $\dfrac12$. So, I should pick the smallest possible $x$, which is $1$. Then, $z = 150$. $\min (x+z) = 151$. Questions Is my logic correct? Is there a systematic way to solve questions of this kind? i.e. given non-negative numbers on the real line that sum up to a fixed value, how to minimize the sum of the largest and smallest of them?","['optimization', 'integer-programming', 'algebra-precalculus']"

Since every subgroup contains the identity, and the identity is in a class by itself, every normal subgroup already contains the conjugacy class of the identity. So when is a normal subgroup comprised of exactly two conjugacy classes? $N = \{1\} \cup \mathcal K$ Here is what I see so far: Unless $|N|=2$ and $N \leq Z(G)$, the subgroup must have trivial intersection with the center, since each element in the center is contained in its own conjugacy class. Since $|\mathcal K|$ is the index of the centralizer $C_G(k)$ of any $k\in\mathcal K$, and $|G:C_G(k)| = |N|-1$ divides $|G|$, we must have that G is divisible by the product $|N|(|N|-1)$ of two consecutive numbers. This also implies $|G|$ is even. Any inner automorphism fixes $N$, but I don't know about outer automorphisms, so $N$ may not have to be a characteristic subgroup.

176263,Is First Order Logic (FOL) the only fundamental logic?,"I'm far from being an expert in the field of mathematical logic, but I've been reading about the academic work invested in the foundations of mathematics, both in a historical and objective sense; and I learned that it all seems to reduce to a proper -axiomatic- formulation of set theory. It also seems that all set theories (even if those come in ontologically different flavours, such as the ones which pursue the "" iterative approach "" like ZFC, versus the "" stratified approach "" -inspired by Russell's and Whitehead's type theory first formulated in their Principia - such as Quine's NFU or Mendelson's ST) are built as collections of axioms expressed in a common language , which invariably involves an underlying first order predicate logic augmented with the set-membership binary relation symbol. From this follows that FOL makes up the ( necessary ) ""formal template"" in mathematics, at least from a foundational perspective. The justification of this very fact, is the reason behind this question. All the stuff I've read about the metalogical virtues of FOL and the properties of its ""extensions"" could be summarized as the statements below: FOL is complete ( Gödel, 1929 ), compact and sound, and all its particular formalizations as deductive systems are equivalent ( Lindström, 1969 ). That means that, given a (consistent) collection of axioms on top of a FOL deductive system, the set of all theorems which are syntactically provable, are semantically satisfied by a model of the axioms. The specification of the axioms absolutely entails all its consequences; and the fact that every first order deductive system is equivalent, suggests that FOL is a context-independent (i.e. objective), formal structure. On the other hand, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies that FOL cannot categorically characterize infinite structures, and so every first order theory satisfied by a model of a particular infinite cardinality, is also satisfied by multiple additional models of every other infinite cardinality. This non-categoricity feature is explained to be caused by the lack of expressive power of FOL. The categoricity results that FOL-based theories cannot achieve, can be obtained in a Second Order Logic (SOL) framework. Examples abound in ordinary mathematics, such as the Least Upper Bound axiom, which allows the definition of the real number system up to isomorphism. Nevertheless, SOL fails to verify an analog to the completeness results of FOL, and so there is no general match between syntactic provability and semantic satisfiability (in other words, it doesn't admit a complete proof calculus). That means that, even if a chosen collection of axioms is able to categorically characterize an infinite mathematical structure, there is an infinite set of wff's satisfied by the unique model of the axioms which cannot be derived through deduction. The syntactic-semantic schism in SOL also implies that there is no such a thing as an equivalent formulation of potential deductive systems, as is the case in FOL and stated by Lindström's theorem. One of the results of this fact is that the domain over which second order variables range must be specified, otherwise being ill-defined. If the domain is allowed to be the full set of subsets of the domain of first order variables, the corresponding standard semantics involve the formal properties stated above (enough expressive power to establish categoricity results, and incompleteness of potential, non-equivalent deductive systems). On the other hand, through an appropriate definition of second order domains for second order variables to range over, the resultant logic exhibits nonstandard semantics (or Henkin semantics ) which can be shown to be equivalent to many-sorted FOL; and as single-sorted FOL, it verifies the same metalogical properties stated at the beginning (and of course, its lack of expressive power). The quantification extension over variables of successive superior orders can be formalized, or even eliminate the distinction between individual (first order) variables and predicates; in each case, is obtained -for every N- an Nth Order Logic (NOL), and Higher Order Logic (HOL), respectively. Nevertheless, it can be shown ( Hintikka, 1955 ) that any sentence in any logic over FOL with standard semantics to be equivalent (in an effective manner) to a sentence in full SOL, using many-sorting. All of this points to the fact that the fundamental distinction, in logical terms, lies between FOL (be it single-sorted or many-sorted) and SOL (with standard semantics ). Or what seems to be the case, the logical foundations of every mathematical theory must be either non-categorical or lack a complete proof calculus, with nothing in between that trade-off. Why, so, is FOL invariably chosen as the underlying logic on top of which the set theoretical axioms are established, in any potentially foundational formalization of mathematics? As I've said, I'm not an expert in this topic, and I just happen to be interested in these themes. What I wrote here is a summary of what I assume I understood of what I read (even though I'm personally inclined against the people who speaks about what they don't fully understand). In this light, I'd be very pleased if any answer to this question involves a rectification of any assertion which happened to be wrong. P.S. : this is an exact repost of the question I originally asked at Philosophy .SE , because I assumed this to be an overly philosophical matter, and so it wouldn't be well received by the mathematics community. The lack of response there (be it because I wrong, and this actually makes up a question which can only be answered with a technical background on the subject, or because it's of little philosophical interest) is the reason why I decided to ask it here.

176271,Collision of eigenvalues of a linear ODE (Krein collisions),"I am trying to understand the so called Krein collisions in Hamiltonian mechanics but I shall formulate the question in a rather general way. Suppose we have the following linear ODE: $ \dot{v}= Kv $ in a space of dimension  $2n$  where $K$ is a constant coefficient matrix with real valued coefficients satisfying the following properties: the characteristic polynomial of $K$ is even and if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of multiplicity $k$, then $-\lambda$ is also an eigenvalue of multiplicity $k$ and if $0$ is an eigenvalue, then it has even multiplicity. Now suppose that the eigenvalues depend continuously on a parameter $\mu$ and suppose the system has an equilibrium point for which it is linearly stable (i.e, all the eigenvalues start off on the imaginary axis because the even nature of the characteristic polynomial prevents a scenario where the eigenvalues can only have a negative real part). Assume also that zero cannot be an eigenvalue associated with the equilibrium point. It is then asserted that the eigenvalues cannot leave the imaginary axis unless they first collide. Why is this necessarily true? I am trying to envision the following scenario. Consider a four dimensional system so that at $\mu=\mu_0$, there are two eigenvalues $\pm 2i$ of multiplicity $2$ which then move, as $\mu$ varies towards $\pm i$ and at $\mu=\mu_0 + T$, they are at $\pm i$. Now why cannot they split off so into a quartet of eigenvalues (the so called Krein quartet) $\pm i \pm \varepsilon$ at the next instant of time.

176390,Statement about the order of $2$ modulo prime powers,"I computed the factorization of $2^n-1$ for many $n$'s and came up with the following conjecture that for any odd prime $p$, 
$$
p^k || 2^n-1 \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad O_p(2) p^{k-1} \, | \, n \quad with \quad p^{k-1} \, || \, n.
$$
where $O_p(2)$ is the order of $2 \pmod p$. Here are my thoughts on the question. We clearly need to assume $O_p(2) \, | \, n$ if $k \ge 1$, so the statement can be made easier to prove because we only need to show that by assuming this, $p^k \, | \, 2^n-1$ iff $p^{k-1} \, | \, n$. Let's prove $(\Longleftarrow)$ by induction. For $k = 1$ we have nothing to show. Say we take a general $k$, then by induction on $k$, 
$$
p^{k-1} \, | \, n \quad \Longrightarrow  \quad 2^{p^{k-1} O_p(2)} - 1 = (2^{p^{k-2}O_p(2)})^p-1^p = (2^{p^{k-2}O_p(2)} - 1)(1 + 2^{p^{k-2}O_p(2)} + \dots + (2^{p^{k-2}O_p(2)})^{p-1} ) \equiv (p^{k-1}m)(\underset{p \text{ times}}{\underbrace{1 + \dots + 1}})\equiv 0 \pmod {p^k}.
$$
So I've proved one direction. (Note that when $2$ is a primitive root $\pmod p$, this is actually quite trivial because my statement in the direction I proved it says 'since $\varphi(p^k) \, | \, n$, then $2^n \equiv 1 \pmod {p^k}$'.) In the other direction the question seems quite hard though. For instance, if I just want to show this for $k = 2$, I need to prove that if $p^2 \, | \, 2^n-1$ then $p \, | \, n$. If I try to show that, then working modulo $p^2$ I get
$$
0  \equiv 2^n-1 = 2^{O_p(2) m} -1 = (2^{O_p(2)}-1)(1 + 2^{O_p(2)} + \dots + 2^{O_p(2)(m-1)}) \\\

176394,A prime number pattern,"The algorithm Given a natural number $n$ define a procedure as follows: Generate a list of primes upto and possibly including, $n$ Assign $Z = n$ If $Z > 0$, subtract the largest prime from list which we haven't considered yet. Otherwise, add it to $Z$. If $n$ is prime, it is assumed accounted for by the first step. Repeat until all primes have been considered. For example, take $25$. The list of primes would be $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$. Subtracting $23$ from $Z=25$, we get $Z=2$. Next, we get $Z=2-19= -17$. And so on. Consequently, $Z$ assumes the values $25, 2, -17, 0, 13, 2, -5, 0, 3, 1$. Note : Only an example. The conjecture as stated deals with applying the algorithms on primes. However, other numbers also seem to exhibit interesting patterns. The Pattern Beginning at $3$ and every other prime thereafter, following the algorithm always (seems to) land us at $1$. For the rest of the primes, $Z$ has a final value of either $0$ or $2$. The problem Please read @alex.jordan's answer as he cleverly limits the range of values $Z$ can reach (say, terminal Z, or $Z_t$) to $\{-1,0,1,2\}$.

176411,Example of application of the Uniform Boundedness Principle,"I've been trying to come up with an easy example of an application of the uniform boundedness principle (or Banach-Steinhaus theorem). I was thinking of something like the following, which is unfortunately a non-example: Non-example: Consider the Banach space $(B(X), \|\cdot\|_\infty)$, i.e. the space of bounded functions with the sup norm. Let's choose $X=\mathbb R$ and let $\mu$ be a measure that is finite on compact sets, like for example the Lebesgue measure. Define 
$$ T_t : (B(X), \|\cdot\|_\infty) \to \mathbb R$$ as
$$ f \mapsto \int_{[-t,t]} f d \mu$$ Then $T_t$ is linear and bounded: If $\|f\|_\infty = 1$ then $\|T_t f\| = |T_t f| = \int_{[-t,t]} f d \mu \leq 2t$ so that the operator norm $\|T_t\| \leq 2t  < \infty$. The condition that fails that prevents me from applying Banach-Steinhaus is that the family $\{T_t\}_{t \in \mathbb R}$ is not pointwise bounded: For $f$ with $\|f\|_\infty$ we have $\sup_{t \in \mathbb R} \|T_t\| \geq \sup_{t \in \mathbb R} 2 t = \infty$. My non-example was supposed to conclude that the integral operator is continuous on the whole space. Of course it's not on $\mathbb R$ for bounded functions but you see what I'm trying to do. Although one might consider showing that the integral is a continuous operator by applying Banach-Steinhaus ""cracking nuts with a sledge hammer"", this one is for educational purposes so it's acceptable.

There is an uncountable family $(A_r)_{r \in \mathbb{R}}$ of almost disjoint infinite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$, i.e., $|A_r \cap A_s| < \infty$ for $r \neq s$. The proof is standard, let $f : \mathbb{Q} \stackrel{\sim}{\to} \mathbb{N}$ and $A_r := \{f(r_1), f(r_2), \ldots\}$ for $(r_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ a sequence of distinct rationals whose limit is $r$. Of course, these must be chosen simultaneously for all $r$, but any choice will work. Now the family $f_r : \mathbb{N} \to k$, $f_r(x) = 1$ for $x \in A_r$ and $0$ elsewhere is linearly independent, since $a_1f_{r_1} + \cdots + a_kf_{r_k} = 0$ yields $a_1 = 0$ if applied to $x \in A_{r_1} \backslash (A_{r_2} \cup \cdots \cup A_{r_k})$, etc. Curiously, this shows that $\dim(k^\mathbb{N}) \ge |\mathbb{R}|$, which is ""a bit more"".

176543,Torsion in two dimensions?,"This question is about the notion of a connection with torsion in differential geometry, i.e., a connection that is not Levi-Civita. (It's not about the torsion of a curve in three dimensions.) Torsion has various physical applications in $\ge 4$ dimensions (Einstein-Cartan theory, string theory, experimental searches for coupling of spin to torsion) and in 3 dimensions ( crystallography ). The simplest examples of any given concept are always good to study, and lower-dimensional spaces are simpler. It seems that torsion should be a reasonable thing to study in two dimensions, although you can't have torsion that preserves tangent vectors, since there can't be a rotation around a fixed axis in two dimensions. This is equivalent to the fact that you can't have a totally antisymmetric torsion tensor $\tau_{abc}$ in two dimensions. Is there any mathematical reason why torsion in two dimensions is impossible, dull, or trivial? It would seem that if $\tau_{abc}$ is only required by definition to be antisymmetric on the two final indices, not all three, then you have 2 independent quantities, $\tau_{112}$ and $\tau_{212}$. Geometrically, I'm not clear on why there are two independent quantities and not just one. It seems to me that the only intrinsic quantity should be the failure of a parallelogram to close, and this should only give one degree of freedom, since I don't think the orientation of the parallelogram can make a difference in two dimensions. (A 90-degree rotation is the same as interchanging the two axes, which won't give an independent result.) If there is no mathematical reason why the 2-dimensional case doesn't work, are there any interesting real-world applications of torsion in two dimensions? Failing that, I would still be interested in any discussion of mathematically interesting, simple examples in two dimensions, e.g., a discussion of what phenomena  occur in a flat space with constant torsion, or a space of constant curvature with constant torsion. For example, I suppose that in the flat case with constant torsion, curves of extremal length are lines, whereas curves that parallel-transport their own tangent vectors are circles. In the positive-curvature case, I haven't thought this through carefully, but it seems that constant torsion on a sphere would be impossible due to something like the hairy ball theorem. Are there simple models of such geometries, in roughly the same sense that elliptic geometry can be modeled by identifying antipodal points on a sphere? (I know that you can't model a two-dimensional space with torsion in exactly this way, since all you naturally induce is the torsion-free structure.)","['applications', 'differential-geometry']"

176723,Are non-circular swords possible?,"I was reminded of this by our recent discussion of the old chestnut about possible shapes for utility hole covers . Perhaps this question is less familiar. A sword can be made in any shape at all, but if you want to be able to put it into a scabbard, only certain shapes will do.  For simplicity, let us neglect the width of the sword, and take it to be the image of a continuous mapping  $[0,1]\to {\Bbb R}^3$.  Clearly, a sword in the shape of a circular arc will fit into a similar scabbard, as long as the arc is less than about half of a full circle: (For non-mathematical reasons, such swords are rarely more than about $\frac1{36}$ of  circle.) If we let the curvature go to zero, we get the special case of a straight segment, which can be of any length: It seems to me that if one had a sword which was a helical segment, it would go into a matching scabbard. The circular and straight swords are special cases of this, where the helical pitch is zero. (A cursory search for helical swords or scabbards turned up nothing—unsurprisingly, since a sword which has to be worked into the enemy like a corkscrew is a really stupid idea.) Are there any other shapes of swords which will go into scabbards?",['geometry']
176736,Permutations of a set with a conditional subset,"Using the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 0 only once, how many 4-digit numbers could be constructed if the number is even? This is an exercise from an online course I'm taking. The given solution suggests splitting the calculation into two cases, the sum of which gives our answer. Case 1: The last digit is 0. This is simple enough; we have P(6,3) permutations in Case 1. Case 2: The last digit is one of 2, 6, 8. In Case 2, there are fewer choices for the last digit than there are digits. There is a chance that we'll have no numbers for the last digit if they are included in the counting for the previous digits. The written solution suggests 5*5*4*3 is the number of permutations in Case 2. It seems they're not counting 0 for the first digit. Evidently they're also withholding one even number from the calculation to ensure there's at least one available for the last digit. This is the part that I'm having trouble accepting. To my understanding, the reasoning behind using factorials to calculate permutations in the first place is that, throughout a calculation such as with the above Case 1, whenever an object is counted, it is then omitted from the rest of the calculation. In Case 2, the even numbers have a distinguishing property: How is it that we can count 3 possibilities for the last digit and still get the right answer if we are also counting some of those possibilities in the previous digits?","['permutations', 'combinatorics']"
176747,Easy Fourier series example: where is my mistake?,"I'm doing exercise 15 on page 255 in Kreyszig: To illustrate that a Fourier series of a function $f$ may converge even at a point where $f$ is discontinuous, find the Fourier series of $$ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
0 & x \in [-\pi, 0) \\
1 & x \in [0, \pi)
\end{cases}$$ My solution: (i) For the $n$-th character, $n \in \mathbb N$, we compute the $n$-th coefficient as follows:
$$ \hat{f}(e^{inx}) =  \langle f, e^{inx} \rangle = \int_0^\pi e^{-inx} dx = \frac{i}{n}(e^{in \pi} - 1)$$ (ii) For the $-n$-th character we compute 
$$\hat{f}(e^{inx}) = \langle f, e^{-inx} \rangle = \frac{-i}{n}(e^{in \pi}-1)$$ (iii) For the $0$-character $e^{i0x} = 1$ we compute
$$\hat{f}(e^{i0x}) = \langle f, e^{-i0x} \rangle = \int_0^\pi 1 dx = \pi$$ So that the Fourier series of $f$ is
$$ F(f(x)) = \pi , \hspace{1cm} x \in [-\pi, \pi)$$ Which is clearly wrong. What did I do wrong? Thanks for your help.","['fourier-series', 'fourier-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"
176770,Complex and real forms of the Poisson integral formula,"In my complex analysis book there is the expression
$$\frac{1 - |z|^2}{|1 - \bar z e^{it}|^2}$$ and it says that when $z = re^{it}$, we can write the above expression as
$$P_r(t) = \frac{1 - r^2}{1 - 2r\cos t + r^2} = \text{Re}\left( \frac{1 + z}{1 - z} \right)$$ I do not see where the $\cos t$ comes from though. Isn't $\bar z = re^{-it}$, so the top is $1 - r^2$ and the bottom is $|1 - r|^2 = 1 - 2r + r^2$. I have not really figured out where the $\text{Re}(1 + z)/(1 - z)$ comes from either.","['harmonic-functions', 'partial-differential-equations', 'complex-analysis']"

176817,Domain of an operator in functional analysis,"I used to think that if we say $f$ is a function from a set $X$ to $Y$ then this implied that $f$ was defined on all of $X$. Because the definition of function is that it's a set $\{(x,y) \mid \text{ for every } x \in X \text{ there is exactly one } (x,y) \text{ where }  y \in Y \}$. Now I'm reading the definition of closed graph of a linear operator: So a linear operator is somehow not a function. But then what is it? Why does it make sense to say that $T$ is a map from $X$ to $Y$ when it's not even defined on all of $X$?

It is clear that it has dimension at least $2n$, since the $\frac{1}{(z-z_i)^k}$, $k=1,2$, form a free family.
