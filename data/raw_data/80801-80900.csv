1046298,How do I give the inverse of a bijective function,"I have proved the function being bijective, but I don't know how to inverse it. So if someone could please show the steps how to do it I would be very grateful. Below is the provided proofs for injective and surjective. Given: f : $\mathbb{Q} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$, f(x) = 2x+1 Let a,b $ \in \mathbb{Q}$, now assume f(a) = f(b) Show that a=b : 2a+1=2b+1 2a=2b Thus a=b function is injective. Let a $\in \mathbb{Q}$, claim that $\frac{a-1}{2}$ maps to a . $\frac{a-1}{2} \in \mathbb{Q}$ since a $ \in \mathbb{Q}$ f($\frac{a-1}{2}$) = 2($\frac{a-1}{2}$)+1 = a-1+1 = a Thus function is surjective.","['algebra-precalculus', 'elementary-set-theory']"

How to prove this from scratch? Attempt Choose orthonormal bases:
$$\mathcal{S}\otimes\mathcal{T}:=\{\sigma\otimes\tau:\sigma\in\mathcal{S},\tau\in\mathcal{T}\}$$ One obtains some candidates:
$$\sigma_k\otimes\tau_l\in\mathcal{S}\otimes\mathcal{T}:\quad\sum_{kl=1}^\infty\frac{1}{kl}\sigma_k\otimes\tau_l\quad\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{kl}\delta_{kl}\sigma_k\otimes\tau_l$$

$$\sum_{kl=1}^\infty\frac{1}{kl}\sigma_k\otimes\tau_l=\left(\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{k}\sigma_k\right)\otimes\left(\sum_{l=1}^\infty\frac{1}{l}\tau_l\right)$$

1046394,"Is the on-diagonal heat kernel ""local"" with respect to the metric?","Question Let $X$ be a manifold, and $\mu_A$, $\mu_B$ two Riemannian metric on it which agree on an open subset $U\subset X$, i.e. $\mu_{A\,|U} = \mu_{B\,|U}$. Let $K_A(t;z,w)$ resp. $K_B(t;z,w)$ be the heat kernel associated to the metric $\mu_A$ resp. $\mu_B$, is then the formula
$$K_A(t;z,z) = K_B(t;z,z) \qquad \forall z \in U $$
true? My Progresses We want to prove that
$$h(t;z) :=  K_A(t;z,z) - K_B(t;z,z) = 0 \qquad \forall z \in U.$$ The Laplacian is clearly local in the metric, i.e. $\Delta_{A\,|U} = \Delta_{B\,|U}$. Denoting by $\mu$ any such metric and by $\Delta$ any such Laplacian, by the properties of the heat kernel we deduce that $h(t;z)$ can be continuously extended to $t=0$ and is a solution of the problem
$$\begin{cases}
\left( \partial_t + \Delta\right)h(t;z) = 0& \quad\forall t>0,\, z\in U,\\

1046457,"How can $\mathbb Q$ be countable, when there is no ""next"" rational number?","I understand this proof that $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable: The rational numbers are arranged thus:

  Thus it is possible to set up a bijection between each rational number and its position in the list, which is an element of $\mathbb N$. $\square$ However, given any rational number, say $3$, there is no ""next"" rational number,  as $\mathbb Q$ is dense in $\mathbb R$. But, given any natural number, we can determine the next natural number (i.e. its successor, given by $S(n)=n+1$).

1046552,Prove that any subfield of $\mathbb C$ must contain $\mathbb Q$,"I just started reading Linear Algebra by Hoffman and Kunze, and I came across the following line: The interested reader should verify that any subfield of $\mathbb C$
  must contain every rational number. Of course, I am interested, so I tried to come up with a proof. I just need verification on the correctness of my proof, and any feedback on how I can improve it. So here it goes. Proof A subfield is simply a subset of a field. A field $\mathbb F$ must obey the following axioms: 1. Addition is commutative, i.e. $x + y = y + x$ for all $x, y$ in $ \mathbb F$. 2. Addition is associative, i.e. $x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z$ for all $x, y, z$ in $\mathbb F$. 3. There exists a unique additive identity $0$ such that $x + 0 = x$ for all $x$ in $\mathbb F$. 4. There exists a unique additive inverse $-x$ such that $x + (-x) = 0$ for all $x$ in $\mathbb F$. 5. Multiplication is commutative, i.e. $x \cdot y = y \cdot x$ for all $x, y$ in $\mathbb F$. 6. Multiplication is associative, i.e. $x \cdot (y \cdot z) = (x \cdot y) \cdot z$ for all $x, y, z$ in $\mathbb F$. 7. There exists a unique multiplicative identity $1$ such that $x \cdot 1 = x$ for all $x$ in $\mathbb F$. 8. For every nonzero $x$ in $\mathbb F$, there exists a unique multiplicative inverse $x^{-1}$ such that $x \cdot x^{-1} = 1$. 9. Multiplication is distributive over addition, i.e. $x \cdot (y + z) = x \cdot y + x \cdot z$ for all $x, y, z$ in $\mathbb F$. 10. Closure under addition, i.e. for all $x, y$ in $\mathbb F$, $x + y$ must also be in $\mathbb F$. 11. Closure under multiplication, i.e. for all $x, y$ in $\mathbb F$, $x \cdot y$ must also be in $\mathbb F$. From the above it follows that any subfield $\mathbb F$ of $\mathbb C$ must contain the elements $0$ and $1$ (as the additive and multiplicative identity respectively). This satisfies axioms $3$ and $7$. By our axiomatic definition of fields, any subfield of $\mathbb C$ must also satisfy axioms $1, 2, 5, 6, 9$. To satisfy axiom $10$, we see that $\mathbb F$ must contain $\mathbb Z^+$ by induction (I do not know how to prove this). To satisfy axiom $4$, it follows that $\mathbb F$ must contain $\mathbb Z^-$ as well. Hence $\mathbb F$ contains $\mathbb Z$. To satisfy axiom $8$, we need to include all scalars of the form $\frac 1x$, where $x \in \mathbb Z \setminus\{0\}$. To accomodate axiom $11$, we must include all scalars of the form $\frac 1x \cdot y$, where $x \in \mathbb Z \setminus \{0\}, y \in \mathbb Z$. Hence $\mathbb F$ must contain $\mathbb Q$. Now every axiom is satisfied and we see that any subfield of $\mathbb C$ must at least contain $\mathbb Q$.","['proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

1046691,How can using a different definition for the integral be useful?,"It's often said that the Lebesgue integral is superior to the Riemann integral because it satisfies nicer properties, for instance things like $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \int f_n = \int \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n$$ But if in the course of a problem we're blocked by the fact that our (Riemann) integrals aren't satsifying some mathematical property, how could it possibly solve our problem to change the definition of the integral ? The original problem statement, after all, was formulated for Riemann integrals, so by changing the definition of the integral, we're surely addressing a different problem . I realize the Lebesgue and Riemann definitions agree when they're both defined, but that's just the thing - the cases in which the Lebesgue integral is useful are precisely those cases in which the Riemann integral isn't defined. Imagine I was doing algebra, investigating some particular ring, and I was bothered by the fact that the ring wasn't principal. I wouldn't be able to get out of that trouble by simply changing the definition of ""principal"". Otherwise I may as well just say ""by definition, all rings are Jack Principal, so my ring is principal"". What the question really boils down to is: Why does changing the definition of an integral not change the nature of the problem so much as to make any conclusions irrelevant to the original problem?

We say that a representable natural transformation $f:F\rightarrow G$ is an open immersion if for every $S$-scheme $X$ and every natural transformation $g:h_X\rightarrow G$, the second projection $F\times_G h_X \rightarrow h_X$ corresponds (by Yoneda Lemma) to an open immersion of $S$-schemes $Z\rightarrow X$, where $Z$ is a representative for $F\times_G h_X$. In the particular case of the proof of the theorem, $F_i\rightarrow F$ is a representable open immersion of functors and the $F_i$ are representable functors for every $i$. Then, citing the book ""The morphisms $F_i\rightarrow F$ are representable open immersions and open immersions are monomorphisms. Therefore the Yoneda Lemma implies that for all $S$-schemes $T$ the maps $F_i(T)\rightarrow F(T)$ are injective."" Are they meaning that we can prove that $F_i\rightarrow F$ is a monomorphism in the category of functors $Sch_S^{op}\rightarrow Sets$? Assuming this is easy to show the last assertion, but how can one prove this fact? Or do they just want to say that from the fact that open immersion are monomorphism in the category of $S$-schemes one can deduce that the $F_i(T)\rightarrow F(T)$ are injective? I am not able to prove this weaker result neither.",['algebraic-geometry']

To me it seems unavoidable that the containing set will always have one more additional level of depth compared to all the sets which it contains, just like those russian matryoshka-dolls where every doll contains at least one more doll than all the dolls inside it. Of course one can define something like ""the set of all sets with at least one element"" which of course would include a lot of sets and therefore by definition should also include itself, but does it necessarily need to include itself just because its definition demands so?

There are only finitely many extensions of given degree of a finite extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ If $L/K$ is are extensions of $\mathbb Q_p$, both with normalised absolute values, and $m$ is a prime ideal of $\mathcal O_K$ (i.e. the unique maximal ideal), then there is exactly one prime ideal lying over $m$. Unlike in the number fields case, where a prime ideal $\mathcal P$ can have multiple distinct primes lying over it.

Or, can $$\int \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\sin^{a_i}(b_ix)\cos^{c_i}(d_ix)}{\sum_{j=1}^m\sin^{e_j} (f_jx) \cos^{g_j}(h_jx)} \, dx$$ be integrated, where $b_i, d_i, f_j, h_j \in \mathbb{R}$ , and $a_i, c_i, e_j, g_j \in \mathbb{N}$ ? This, however, is a monstrosity, so let's assume that each $f_j$ and $h_j$ is equal to some $b_i$ and $d_i$ , respectively, so we can remove the denominator: $$\int \sum_{i=1}^n\sin^{a_i} (b_ix) \cos^{c_i} (d_ix) \, dx$$ (Now, $a_i, c_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ ).
I'm also interested in the case where all the arguments are just $x$ , that is $b_i, d_i  = 1$ , if that helps: $$\int \sum_{i=1}^n\sin^{a_i}(x)\cos^{c_i}(x) \, dx$$","['trigonometry', 'calculus', 'integration']"
1048374,Find the probability that $B$ obtains a new kidney.,"Look at this problem: Two individuals, $A$ and $B$, both require kidney transplants. If she
  does not receive a new kidney, then $A$ will die after an exponential
  time with rate $\mu_A$, and $B$ after an exponential time with rate
  $\mu_B$. New kidneys arrive in accordance with a Poisson process
  having rate $\lambda$. It has been decided that the first kidney will
  go to $A$ (or to $B$ if $B$ is alive and $A$ is not at that time) and
  the next one to $B$ (if still living). What is the probability that $B$ obtains a new kidney? The solution that the author has offered for this problem is $$\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu_B}\frac{\lambda+\mu_A}{\lambda+\mu_A+\mu_B}$$ but I have another answer to this problem as below: $$\begin{align*}Pr(B\text{ obtains kidney})&=Pr(B\text{ obtains kidney}\mid\space A\space is \space alive)\cdot Pr(A\space is \space alive)\\[0.2cm]&+Pr(B\text{ obtains kidney}\mid\space A\space is\space not \space alive)\cdot Pr(A\space is\space not \space alive)\\[0.2cm]&=\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu_B}\frac{\mu_A}{\lambda+\mu_A}+\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu_A}Pr(B\text{ obtains kidney}\mid \space A\space is \space alive)\end{align*}$$ Now as when $A$ is alive while the first kidney arrives, $B$ must wait for the second kidney and the distribution of the second kidney arrival time is a Gamma distribution with parameters $n=2,\lambda$ and hence 
$$Pr(B\text{ obtains kidney}\mid \space A\space is \space alive)=Pr(X_1+X_2<X_B)$$
in which $X_1+X_2$ is the time of arrival of the second kidney, and $X_B$ is the death time of $B$, so we have 
$$Pr(B\text{ obtains kidney}\mid \space A\space is \space alive)=Pr(X_1+X_2<X_B)=\left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu_B}\right)^2$$
So we have 
$$\begin{align*}Pr(B\text{ obtains kidney})&=\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu_B}\frac{\mu_A}{\lambda+\mu_A}+\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu_A}Pr(B\text{ obtains kidney}\mid \space A\space is \space alive)\\&=\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu_B}\frac{\mu_A}{\lambda+\mu_A}+\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu_A}\left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu_B}\right)^2\end{align*}$$

1048496,"Question on Generic Freeness, ref. [Matsumura, page 185]","I am sure this must have been answered somewhere but I can't find them, so I shall try my luck here. Let $A$ be a Noetherian integral domain and $M$ a finitely generated $A$-module. Then there exists $0 \neq f\in A$ such that $M_f$ is a free $A_f$-module. I have tried reading several sources but it boils down to the proof that we may write $M$ as a composition series, say $$0\subseteq M_1\subseteq\cdots\subseteq M_{n-1}\subseteq M$$ where each $$M_i/M_{i-1}\cong A/\frak p_i$$ for some prime $\frak p_i$. According to the remark in [Matsumura, page 185], it suffices to choose $a$ in the intersection of all those $\frak p_i$ which are not zero and we get the localisation of $M_i/M_{i-1}$ at $a$ a free $A_a$ module. How is this possible? If we make things very simple say $M=Am$ with $Ann(m)=\frak p$, why would choosing $p\in\frak p$ would allow $M_p$ to be a free $A_p$ module? And second question (a bit different, but related nonetheless) is that returning to the special case where $M=Am$, why should the set $$U=\{{\frak{q}} \in Spec A: M_{\frak{q}}\text{ is a free }A_{\frak{q}}\text{ module}\}$$ be non empty? I am reasoning out this way that given an exact sequence $$0\rightarrow {\frak{p}} \rightarrow A\rightarrow Am\rightarrow 0$$ if we localise at the zero ideal, we get $$0\rightarrow {\frak{p}}_{(0)} \rightarrow K(A)\rightarrow Am\otimes_{A} K(A)\rightarrow 0$$ so by dimension counting, ${\frak{p}}_{(0)}$ should be a zero vector space, and hence $U$ should be non empty by taking the zero ideal, but here I am contradicting myself in some sense that if $\frak p$ is not zero, then its localisation is probably not zero.

The exercise is finding an alternative proof using the images of the functions. Here is my, attempt: I'll show that if $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to A$ are both injective, then there exists a bijection between $A$ and $B$. Note that $g^{-1}: g(B) \to B$. Let $G = \{x \in A : g^{-1}(x) \in B \backslash f(A) \}$. Thus, consider
$$ h(x) = \begin{cases} 
       g^{-1}(x) & x \in G \\
      f(x) & x \in A\backslash G
   \end{cases} $$ I'll do three verifications. That the domain of $h$ is $A$, and that $h$ is both injective and surjective. First, $h$ is defined for $x \in G$ and $x \in A\backslash G$. If $G = \emptyset$, then $f$ is already a bijection. Otherwise, $A \backslash G \cup G = A$ so every $x \in A$ is evaluated by $h$. Secondly, I'll show $h$ is injective. Suppose there exists $x_1 \neq x_2 \in A$ with $h(x_1) = h(x_2)$. Because $g^{-1}$ and $f$ are injective, with loss of generality, I can let $g^{-1}(x_1) \in B \backslash f(A)$ and $g^{-1}(x_2) \in f(A)$. Since $g^{-1}(x_2) \in f(A)$, $h(x_2) = f(x_2)$. Then by our assumption, since $h(x_1) = h(x_2)$, we have $g^{-1}(x_1) = f(x_2)$. But this implies that $g^{-1}(x_2) \in f(A)$ which is a contradiction. * This contradiction is my first concern. My contradiction does not actually show that $x_1 = x_2$. Seems off.* For the surjection, let $y \in B$. There are two cases. First, if $y \in B \backslash f(A)$, then $g(y) = x \implies g^{-1}(x) = y$. And $g^{-1}(x) \in B \backslash f(A)$, so $h(x) = y$. Next, let $y \in f(A)$. Because $g: B \to A$, there exists $x_1,x_2 \in A$ such that $f(x_1) = y$ and $g(y) = x_2 \implies g^{-1}(x_2) = y$. But $g^{-1}(x_2) \in f(A)$ so $y = h(x_1)$. * Major red flag for me here. It seems weird that there are two potential candidates for the the $x$ mapped to $y$. * Despite my concerns, I can't see exactly what the problem is. I've tried searching for solutions and alternative proofs, but most online seem to use some variation of the König proof, as shown here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Bernstein_theorem Okay, so I've found this answer to another question: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/225633/135367 I think this resolves my question, but I do not understand it. He says that my function is not bijective. In particular, he says ""namely the values of $f(x)$ where $x \in g(B\backslash f(A))$ but $f(x) \notin B \backslash f(A)$."" However, $f(x) \notin B \backslash f(A)$ is always true. And if $x \in g(B\backslash f(A))$, then $g^{-1}(x) \in B\backslash f(A)$ so $g^{-1}(x) = h(x)$.

1049112,Eigenvalues of a row-reduced matrix on the main diagonal still?,"It is widely known that if a matrix is given in upper triangular form, then one can just read off the eigenvalues (and their algebraic multiplicity) on the main diagonal of the matrix. My question is:  what if I get a non-upper triangular matrix to start, and I then put it into row-echelon form - not the row-reduced echelon form with all 1's in the pivot variables.  Can I spot any of the eigenvalues of the original matrix from this upper triangular matrix? Thanks,","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

I've tried Taylor expansion, partial fraction decomposition, but I can't really find anything useful. Some help would be really appreciated. I'm much more interested in the method than in the actual result.","['definite-integrals', 'calculus', 'limits']"
1049124,Bayesian posterior variance,"Let $Var[\omega]$ be the variance of a population parameter $\omega$ prior to the collection of a random sample $\mathcal{X}=\left\lbrace X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n\right\rbrace$ from the population.  Prove or disprove the claim that the posterior variance is, on average, less than or equal to the prior variance. This is a homework problem for introduction to Bayesian statistics.  I want to say that the claim is false, because I could pick any prior distribution that I want, and if I picked a distribution with a super tiny variance, it is likely that the posterior variance would actually be larger. I just think the wording of the problem is a bit vague.  Any insights would be appreciated.","['statistics', 'bayesian', 'probability']"
1049152,How can the sniffer dog find the bag of drugs?,"There are $n$ bags. In one of the bags are drugs. There is a dog that when given a group of bags, can tell whether there are drugs in the group or not. Each sniff counts as a ""turn"". What is the best strategy, the strategy that find the bag with drugs in the smallest amount of turns? So for example, say there are $60$ bags and the drugs are in bag $5$. The dog sniffs bags $17, 6, 2$ and determines that there are no drugs in them. If the dog sniffs in bags $30, 35,5$ then the dog confirms that the drugs are in that group of bags. I think that the best strategy is to sniff half of the bags at a time. So when $n=60$, the dog would sniff thirty bags in the first turn, 15 bags in the second turn, 8 bags in the third turn and so on, eventually finding the one bag with drugs in it. But how can I prove that it is the best strategy? Thanks.","['discrete-mathematics', 'recreational-mathematics', 'algorithms', 'combinatorics']"

Obviously this isn't etale or smooth over $k$ so its cotangent complex is not contractible. Now, I wish to compute $\mathbb{L}_{A/k}$. So first we have maps $k \rightarrow k[x,y] \rightarrow A$ which induces the transitivity sequence $$\mathbb{L}_{k[x,y]/k} \otimes_{k[x,y]} A \rightarrow \mathbb{L}_{A/k} \rightarrow \mathbb{L}_{A/k[x,y]}.$$ By Iyengar's notes ( http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0609151.pdf ) we know that: $\mathbb{L}_{A/k[x,y]} \simeq \Sigma A$ $\mathbb{L}_{k[x,y]/k} \simeq \Omega_{k[x,y]/k}$ Hence am I right to conclude that Andre-Quillen homology is just $\Omega_{k[x,y]/k} \otimes_{k[x,y]} A$ in degree $0$ and $A$ in degree 1?
