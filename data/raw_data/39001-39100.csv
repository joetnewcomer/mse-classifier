382174,Ways of merging two incomparable sorted lists of elements keeping their relative ordering,"Suppose that, for a real application, I have ended up with a sorted list A = {$a_1, a_2, ..., a_{|A|}$} of elements of a certain kind (say, Type-A), and another sorted list B = {$b_1, b_2, ..., b_{|B|}$} of elements of a different kind (Type-B), such that Type-A elements are only comparable with Type-A elements, and likewise for Type-B. At this point I seek to count the following: in how many ways can I merge both lists together, in such a way that the relative ordering of Type-A and Type-B elements, respectively, is preserved? (i.e. that if $P_M(x)$ represents the position of an element of A or B in the merged list, then $P_M(a_i)<P_M(a_j)$ and $P_M(b_i)<P_M(b_j)$ for all $i<j$) I've tried to figure this out constructively by starting with an empty merged list and inserting elements of A or B one at a time, counting in how many ways each insertion can be done, but since this depends on the placement of previous elements of the same type, I've had little luck so far. I also tried explicitly counting all possibilities for different (small) lengths of A and B, but I've been unable to extract any potential general principle in this way.",['combinatorics']

382245,"Localization of $K[x,y|x^2-y^3]$ and $K[x,y|xy]$ at $\langle x,y\rangle$ and non-zero-divisors (exercise in SICA)","In Greuel & Pfister's A Singular Introduction to Commutative Algebra , p. 38, there is written: (1) Consider the two rings
  $$ A=\mathbb C[x,y]/\langle x^2-y^3\rangle\text{ and } B=\mathbb C[x,y]/\langle xy\rangle$$
  and the multiplicative sets: $S$ the set of non-zerodivisors of $A$, respecrively of $B$, and $T:= A\backslash \langle x,y\rangle_A$, respectively $T:=B\backslash\langle x,y\rangle_B$. Determine the localizations of $A$ and $ B$ with respect to $T$ and $S$. (2) Are any two of the six rings $A,B,S^{-1}A,S^{-1}B,T^{-1}A,T^{-1}B$ isomorphic? So we have rings 
$$\begin{array}{l l}
R_1:= K[x,y|x^2\!-\!y^3], & R_4:= K[x,y|xy],\\
R_2:= K[x,y|x^2\!-\!y^3]_{\langle x,y\rangle}, & R_5:= K[x,y|xy]_{\langle x,y\rangle},\\
R_3:= Q(K[x,y|x^2\!-\!y^3]), & R_6:= Q(K[x,y|xy]).\\

The polynomial $x^2\!-\!y^3$ is irreducible, so $\langle x^2\!-\!y^3\rangle \unlhd K[x,y]$ is a prime ideal. Hence $R_1$ is a domain, $R_3$ is a field, and $R_1 \subseteq R_2 \subseteq R_3$, so all three rings are domains. But $R_4,R_5,R_6$ contain $x,y$ with $xy=0$, so they are not domains, hence $R_i \ncong R_{3+j}$ for any $i,j\!\in\!\{1,2,3\}$. Furthermore, $R_1$ contains maximal ideals $\langle x,y\rangle$ and $\langle x\!-\!1,y\!-\!1\rangle$ (we have $x^2\!-\!y^3= (x\!+\!1)(x\!-\!1)-(y^2\!+\!y\!+\!1)(y\!-\!1)$), but $R_2$ is local, i.e. contains only one maximal ideal, hence $R_1\ncong R_2$. Similarly, $R_1\ncong R_3$, since $R_3$ contains only one prime ideals (namely $0$), and $R_2\ncong R_3$, by the argument of the number of ideals. Question: how can I distinguish between $R_4,R_5,R_6$?","['localization', 'ring-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'commutative-algebra']"

382326,About the category $\mathrm{Set}(G)$,"I'm not good with categories. I've attempted several times to understand what a natural transformation is, and so far I've failed. But I'm trying to learn algebraic topology now, and it seems that I have to give it a try. In particular, I need to understand the category of left $G$-sets for a group $G$ because of the classification theorem for covering maps. Of course I know what a $G$-set is, and I know some examples. I know that any set can be made a $G$-set for any group $G$ by defining $$gx=x$$ for all $g\in G$ and $x\in X$. When $X$ and $Y$ are sets of different cardinalities, such $G$-sets are not isomorphic, which means that the isomorphism classes of objects in $\mathrm{Set}(G)$ don't form a set. So I'm guessing a classification could be impossible. But I'm wondering if the important examples of $G$-sets are somehow special (maybe definable) in this category. By important examples I mean expecially these: the left coset spaces of subgroups of $G$ (in particular, the homomorphic images of $G$) acted on by multiplication; the normal subgroups of $G$ acted on by conjugation; the power set of $G$ acted on by multiplication. If I haven't put something important on this list, I would like to learn about it too. I would like to know if there's something that characterizes these examples up to isomorphism in $\mathrm{Set}(G)$ and whether perhaps there is some (maybe partial) classification or characterization of $G$-sets using these examples. For example, something like this would be good: every $G$-set is isomorphic to a left coset space of some subgroup of $G$. This is clearly false, but this is the kind of thing I have in mind. I'm not sure I can explain myself better. I would love to learn some category theory from the answers, but please keep in mind that my understanding of it is very limited so I will probably need more explanation than others might.","['category-theory', 'group-theory', 'group-actions']"

382654,Proving that $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ are not isomorphic.,"I am trying to prove that $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ are not isomorphic. I was thinking of arguing the following: Suppose there exists an isomorphism $\varphi: \mathbb{Z}[x]\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}[x]$. Because isomorphisms are by definition surjective, there exist $x, y \in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that $\varphi(x) = c \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ and $\varphi(y) = d \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ for any $c, d\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$. Because $\varphi$ is an isomorphism we must have $\varphi(x+y) = \varphi(x) + \varphi(y)$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$. Namely, because polynomial addition is defined componentwise, we must have that the constant term of $\varphi(a + b) = c_{0} + d_{0}$ (where $c_{0}, d_{0}$ are the constant terms of $c$ and $d$ respectively. I would then argue that because $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are not isomorphic as additive groups, no such isomorphism $\varphi$ exists. Is this a valid proof? I've seen proofs that argue that because $\varphi(1) = 1$ for any homomorphism we have $1 = \varphi(2(1/2)) = 2(\varphi(1/2))$ so $\varphi(1/2)$ must be contained in $\mathbb{Z}[x]^{\times}$. Then because $\mathbb{Z}[x]^{\times} = \mathbb{Z}^{\times} = \{\pm1\}$ we have $2 \times \pm1 \neq1$, a contradiction.

Does this generalize in some way to other contexts? N.B. It is a result of  Shoda in characteristic zero and of Albert and Muckenhoupt for any field, that every matrix of trace zero is a commutator, so Hall's identity tells us that the square of a traceless $2\times 2$ matrix is central. N.B. If $Q$ is a quaternion algebra over a field $k$, then there is a an extension $K/k$ such that the result of extending scalars $Q_K$ from $k$ to $K$ in $Q$ is isomorphic to the $K$-algebra $M_2(K)$ of $2\times 2$  matrices.

382792,Direct (Inductive) limit of (locally convex) TVEs and universal property,"This is not really a question, I'd just like to discuss a little about universal properties (more specifically, the direct limit) in TVEs. I'm trying to work with universal properties in Topological Vector Spaces (TVEs)
(over $\mathbb{K}\in\left\{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\right\}$), constructing the universal objects, etc... If we were to define an inductive limit of TVEs, according to the categorical definition, it'ld be the following: Fix a directed set $(I,\leq)$, that is, an ordered set $(I,\leq)$ such that for every $i,j\in I$ there exists $k\in I$ such that $i\leq k$ and $j\leq k$ (although it's common to drop antissimmetry). Definition : Let $(I,\leq)$ be a directed set and $\left\{V_i:i\in I\right\}$ be a family of TVEs and $\left\{T_{ji}:i\leq j\in I\right\}$ be a family of functions $T_{ji}\in\mathscr{L}(V_i,V_j)$, that is, continuous linear functions from $V_i$ to $V_j$ satisfying: $T_{ii}=id_{V_i}$ $T_{ki}=T_{kj}T_{ji}$, for all $i\leq j\leq k$. A direct limit of those two families is a TVE $\mathbb{V}$ together with a family $\left\{\phi_i\in\mathscr{L}(V_i,\mathbb{V}):i\in I\right\}$ satisfying
  $\phi_i=\phi_jT_{ji}$ for $i\leq j$ and such that for every other TVE $\mathbb{W}$ with a family of morphisms $\left\{\psi_i\in\mathscr{L}(V_i,\mathbb{W}):i\in I\right\}$ satisfying $\psi_i=\psi_jT_{ji}$ for $j\leq i$, there exists an unique function $\Phi\in\mathscr{L}(\mathbb{V},\mathbb{W})$ satisfying $\psi_i=\Phi\phi_i$. The same definition works for locally convex TVEs. Although, most books define the direct limit of locally convex spaces in the following way: Definition ( H. H. Schaefer, Topological Vector Spaces ): Let $\left\{V_\lambda:\lambda\in\Lambda\right\}$ be a family of locally convex spaces (where $\Lambda$ is only an index set), $\mathbb{V}$ a vector space and $\left\{T_\lambda\in L(V_\lambda,\mathbb{V}):\lambda\in\Lambda\right\}$. The direct limit topology on $\mathbb{V}$ is the finest locally convex topology for which each $T_\lambda$ is continuous. It's not obvious to me that those two definition are equivalent. I think that the first definition is more ellegant than the second. Is there a good reason why we should use the second one? One thing that is funny is that the direct sum of locally convex TVEs is defined as the algebraic direct sum (the subspace of $\prod_{\lambda\in\Lambda}V_\lambda$ of elements $(v_\lambda)$ for which $v_\lambda=0$ except for a finite number of indexes) with the direct limit topology, and it satisfies the universal property of the direct sum. When working in categories, this is usually done the other way: the direct limit is a quotient of the direct sum (if that makes sense, of course).","['general-topology', 'vector-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'universal-property']"

  bounded at some neighborhood about $x$ Using definition of continuity on $f'(x)$, I say that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there is $\delta > 0$ such that for any $y$, we have $|x - y| < \delta => |f'(x) - f'(y)| < \epsilon$. After some works, I realize that $f'(y)$ is in the neighborhood of $(f'(x) - \epsilon, f'(x) + \epsilon)$. So if I let my $N = max${$f'(x) + \epsilon, -f'(x) + \epsilon$}, I reach the conclusion that $f'(x)$ is bounded (at least below) 3/ Then, I plan to use (*) to say this : If function $f$ has a derivative $f'$ such that $f'$ is bounded by
  some number K $ \implies f$ satisfies Lipschitz condition on any interval

This is a subject I was interested in before taking this course, particularly in some of the stranger aspects and implications of set theory and incomputable numbers. While I personally philosophically question the validity of claiming the existence of something you cannot write down, I understand formally the arguments that leading to the conclusion that there are more real numbers than there are computer programs; i.e. I can translate each possible finite length string of a finite selection of characters into an integer, and then show there is no bijection from the integers to the reals). My question here is if we are as limited in what we can write down as is typically assumed, namely: this proof assumes there are a finite number of characters. But is this in fact true? Given a piece of paper and a pen, are there really only a finite number of ways to arrange ink molecules on the paper to create a characters? (From my understanding of quantum mechanics, molecules are not limited in possible arrangements in position space; rather it limits the accuracy with which you can know a particle's state in position-momentum space, though this is besides the point). If there are, in fact, an uncountable number of characters we can write on a paper, does this make every real number computable? Can we make compilers that could handle this, or does this violate some part of the definition of a Turing Machine (with which I am admittedly only vaguely familiar). I tried a quick google search for this idea, and nothing seemed to come up, so I am curious if this has been explored.

383194,Free objects in $\mathrm{Set}(G).$,"What are the free objects in the category of $G$-sets for a group $G$? After considerable deliberation (I'm not very bright), I'm pretty sure they are the $G$-sets $X$ on which $G$ acts freely, that is in such a way that only $e$ fixes any elements in $X$. I can prove it -- almost. Suppose $X$ is a $G$-set on which $G$ acts freely. Let's take a transversal $B$ of the set of orbits $X/G$. I will show that $X$ is a free object in the category of $G$-sets, and $B$ is its basis. Let $Y$ be an arbitrary $G$-set, and let $f:B\to Y$ be any function. Suppose $\tilde f:X\to Y$ is a $G$-set morphism extending $f$. Let $x\in X$. Then there exist $b\in B$ and $g\in G$ such that $gb=x.$ Then $$\tilde f(x)=\tilde f(gb)=g\tilde f(b)=gf(b).$$
Hence the extension $\tilde f$ is unique. For the existence of $\tilde f$, it's enough to check that the above is a good definition, or that it doesn't depend on the choice of $g$. Suppose $gb=x$ and $g'b=x$. Then $b=g^{-1}g'b$, and since $G$ acts freely on $X$, we must have $g=g'.$ Therefore the extension $\tilde f$ exists and is unique, and so $X$ is a free object in the category of $G$-sets. Now suppose $X$ is a free object in the category of $G$-sets. Suppose for a moment that the following lemma is true. Lemma. If $X$ is a free object in the category of $G$-sets, then its bases are exactly the transversals of $X/G.$ With this lemma I can show that $G$ must act freely on $X$. For let $x\in X.$ Then there exist a (unique, but I don't think I need this) $b\in B$ and $g\in G$ such that $gb=x.$ Suppose for an $h\in G$ we have $hx=x.$ This means that $$g^{-1}hgb=b.$$ Now let $f:B\to G$ be any function. Since $B$ is a basis, we can extend it uniquely to a $G$-set morphism $\tilde f$. ($G$ acts on itself by multiplication.) This implies that $$g^{-1}hgf(b)=f(b).$$ But $f(b)$ can be chosen arbitrarily, which means that $g^{-1}hg$ must fix every element of $G$, and so $h=e.$ So what I need to do is prove the lemma. Actually, I just need the ""exactly"" part. I just need to know that if $X$ is a free object in the category $G$-sets, then its basis must be a transversal of $X/G.$ Suppose $X$ is a free object. A transversal is a subset of $X$ such that there is exactly one element of each orbit in it. I think the uniqueness is analogous to linear independence in a vector space, and the existence is analogous to spanning the whole space. I can show the uniqueness (but as I said, I don't think I need it actually). Suppose $B$ is a basis of $X$. Suppose there are $b,b'\in B$ such that $b'=gb$ for some $g$. Again, by considering the functions $f:B\to G$, I can show that $g=e.$ But I don't see how to show that every orbit must have a representative in $B$. (Please keep in mind that at this point I still haven't proven that $G$ acts freely on $X$.) Since this is analogous to the fact that a vector space basis must generate the whole space, I've looked at the proof of that, the one in which we generate a subspace by the basis, quotient it out and show that the quotient is $0$. Can it be done here? I don't know how to define a quotient of a $G$-set. Or maybe I just need to prove it in some other way?","['category-theory', 'group-theory', 'group-actions']"

What I tried to do is to show that $Z(F)$ is a submanifold of $RP^2$: given a point $p=[x_0 x_1 x_2] \in RP^2$ w.l.o.g. assume $x_0 \neq 0$ so take the neigboorhood $U_0$ of points with $x_0 \neq 0$. In $U_0$, $Z(F)$ is given by the zeros of $f(x,y)$ which is defined as $f(x,y):=F(1,x_1/x_0,x_2/x_0)$. My idea is to prove that the rank of $f$ is 1 on $Z(F)$, and then in the new coordinates of $U_0$ (assuming $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \neq 0 $), $(f,y)$ the set $Z(F)$ is given by $f=0$.

Similarly, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} (\alpha,\beta)= \frac{\partial F}{\partial x_2} ([1,\alpha,\beta]) $, and since $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x_0}$, $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x_1}$ , $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x_2}$ are not all simultaneously $0$ on $Z(F)$, $f$ has rank 1 on $Z(F)$.

383256,Nimber of selective compound games,"Background/Definitions . Let $\alpha,\beta$ ordinal numbers. The Hessenberg sum $\alpha \# \beta$ is defined recursively as the smallest ordinal which is $>\alpha' \# \beta$ and $> \alpha \# \beta'$ for all $\alpha' < \alpha, \beta' < \beta$. One can show that $\alpha \# \beta$ is then also the mex of $\{\alpha' \# \beta : \alpha' < \alpha\} \cup \{\alpha \# \beta' : \beta' < \beta\} \cup \{\alpha' \# \beta' : \alpha' < \alpha, \beta' < \beta\}$ (the proof is not hard, but does somebody know a reference?). For $\beta < \omega$ we have $\alpha \# \beta = \alpha + \beta$. If $G$ is an impartial combinatorial game, we denote by $\alpha(G)$ its nimber , which is defined recursively as the mex of the $\alpha(G')$ with $G' \in G$. If $G,H$ are impartial combinatorial games, we denote by $G \vee H$ their selective compound game. Question. How can we compute $\alpha(G \vee H)$ in terms of $G$ and $H$? If $G,H$ are Nim games with only one pile, we have $\alpha(G \vee H) = \alpha(G) \# \alpha(H)$ (this is precisely the mex-description of the Hessenberg sum). In general, one can prove $\alpha(G \vee H) \geq \alpha(G) \# \alpha(H)$. We have equality when $G$ satisfies $\alpha(G') < \alpha(G)$ for all $G' \in G$, and likewise for $H$. But unfortunately, inequality seems to be quite typical. For example, if $G=\star 1$ and $H=\{\star 0,\star 2\}$ we have $\alpha(G)=\alpha(H)=1$, hence $\alpha(G) \# \alpha(H)=2$, but $G \vee H = \{\star 2,\star 1 ,\star 1 \vee \star 2,\star 0\}$, hence $\alpha(G \vee H)=4$. This shows, in particular, that selective compounds do not preserve equivalence of games (isn't this ugly?), or in other words that $\alpha(G \vee H)$ does not only depend on $\alpha(G)$ and $\alpha(H)$.

For the first question: I tried to write $\tau$ as the composition of disjoint permutations but failed miserably. However, I made an explicit definition for the permutation $\tau$: \begin{eqnarray*}
\tau(1) &=& 4\\
\tau(2) &=& 1\\
\tau(3) &=& 6\\

\tau^4(7) &=& 7\\
\tau^4(8) &=& 8\\
\tau^4(9) &=& 9\\

where $\tau^n(k)$ means you apply the permutation $\tau$ to $k$, and then apply it to the result etc. for $n$ times. The powers appearing are $2,3,4$ so the order of $\tau$ is the smaller common multiple and since $\gcd(3,4)=1$ this is equal to 12. Therefore the order of $\tau$ is 12. So I found what I think is the correct answer but I do not really like the method and was wondering if anyone knows a better more elegant way to solve this. For the second part I re-wrote $\tau$ as:
$$\tau = (5\ 6)(6\ 7)(7\ 8)(8\ 9)(3\ 4)(4\ 5)(5\ 6)(2\ 3)(3\ 4)(1\ 2)$$
which is the composion of ten 2-cycles which means $\tau$ has order $(-1)^10=-1$. I am pretty confident about this last part but I just wanted to add it for completion.

By closed form solution I mean any solution that I can nicely write like

Unfortunately I'm not really familiar enough with Transcendence Theory or Galois Theory to see this on my own. Thanks! Assuming that $(\ast)$ has no ""closed form"" solution, I also thought about a workaround . Since $\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} (1 + \tfrac{x}{n})^n = \mathrm{e}^x$, I could write write
$$
\mathrm{e}^x - \mathrm{e}^a\cdot(1 + x) = 0 \,

I thought about this as an approximation for finite $n$.
Unfortunately for finite $n$, $(1 + \tfrac{x}{n})^n < \mathrm{e}^x$ yields and this approximation would clash my basic inequality $(\ast)$.

$$
\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} (1 + \tfrac{x}{n})^{n+2} = \mathrm{e}^x

$$
(1 + \tfrac{x}{n})^{n+2} > \mathrm{e}^x

383419,Why all odd numbers not ending with 5 divide exactly into a number comprising only 9's?,"Help me!!It's really frustrating I can't understand this simple thing.The maths instructor in my video,the renowned Arthur Benjamin,states (clip linked below) the following: All odd numbers, that don't end in 5, divide exactly into a number that consists only of 9's. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PufXAVtwmXk&feature=youtu.be He takes 2009 as an example and goes on to explain it this way: Take 2010(one more than 2009) numbers, with the first beginning with one 9,and the last comprising 2010 9's. 9,99,999,9999,................9999999
                               ^ 2010 9's Since there are 2010 numbers and 2009 possible remainders when divided by 2009,two of these numbers must have the same remainder.Let them be the following: 999999...... i 9's= 2009p+r
  99999........j 9's=2009q+r Subtracting both sides in above equations we get : (number with i 9's - number with j 9's)= 2009(p-q) So 2009 divides exactly into a number with i-j number of 9's followed by j 0's. Now begins the part where I am so confused.At this point the instructor says that since 2009 is not a multiple of 2 or 5, we can remove the zeros from the left number .How is it justified? Please answer these three questions arising from this premise: A) How can we remove the zeroes and expect the number to be still divisible by 2009?Like 200 is divisible by 25,but it's no longer divisible by 25 if we take out the last zero!! 40 is divisible by 8, but not if we take out the 0? Since Mr.Benjamin can't be wrong,can you tell me the reason why we can remove the zeroes? B) Why can we remove the zeroes just because 2009 is not a multiple of 2 or 5?I know I am missing something simple here.....maybe I am having a mental burnout...so please answer this. C) I tried to tinker with the instructor's explanation about how every odd number not ending with 5 divides into a number consisting of all 9's.And it seems ANY odd number not ending with 5 divides exactly into a number consisting only of ANY odd number, not essentially 9.Is it so?Is my assumption wrong?If so,why?Why can't we use the same logic and proof for numbers comprising only of 7's or 3's or 1's? Please go easy on me this time as not only is this bottleneck from my very first video lecture on Discrete Mathematics,it is also my first question on Math.Stackexchange.Thank you!!","['factoring', 'discrete-mathematics']"

383436,Why is it important to study combinatorics?,"I was having a discussion with my friend Sayan Mukherjee about why we need to study combinatorics which admittedly, is not our favorite subject because we see very less motivation for it (I am not saying that there does not exist motivation for studying it, it's just that I have not found it). Here are some of the ""uses"" of combinatorics that we could come up with: Counting - the number of ways in which we can perform a finite sequence of operations and how objects can be arranged or selected. For example,the number of ways in which we can select $k$ odd and even elements from the set $S=\{1,2,\dots, 2n\}$ so that at most 3 odd elements consecutive elements could occur in the section. Drawing bijections- The classic Stars and bars problem provides us key ideas to count the number of integral solutions to equations of the form $x_1+x_2+\dots x_n=k$ . The Seven Bridges of Königsberg which captivated me as a child. I have refrained from mentioning recursions and generating functions as I see them more as tools. But I am looking for more motivation; counting, as described in problems seems to be tip of the iceberg and I will appreciate more examples where combinatorics and graph theory can be powerful tools. Can we please have a list of uses of combinatorics? I am not looking for applications to industry, just pure math. It is  not essential that the answers be pitched at high-school level; additional info will certainly be fun to revisit!","['motivation', 'big-list', 'combinatorics']"
383440,Can the number of numbers in two intervals over $\mathbb{R^+}$ be compared?,"Every number in the interval $[2.1,4]$ can be mapped to its square in the interval $[4.41, 16]$. Conversely, every number in the interval $[4.41,16]$ can be mapped to its respective square root in the interval $[2.1,4]$. If every number in the interval $[4.41,16]$ has a unique corresponding square root in the interval $[2.1,4]$, this would imply that the number of numbers in both intervals are the same magnitude of infinity. This implies comparing the length of two intervals does not indicate which interval has more numbers in it, as $[4.41, 16]$ is obviously longer than $[2.1, 4]$, yet has the same number of numbers.","['cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"

383488,From universal measurability to measurability,"Let $(\Omega,\Sigma)$ be a measurable space and $K$ be a compact
  metrizable space endowed with its Borel $\sigma$-algebra
  $\mathcal{B}(K)$. Let $A\subseteq\Omega\times K$ be universally
  measurable and such that $$C_\omega=\{x\in K:(\omega,x)\in A\}$$ is
  closed for all $\omega\in\Omega$. Let $\Sigma_u$ the universal
  completion of $\Sigma$.  Is it then the case that $A$ is in
  $\Sigma_u\otimes \mathcal{B}(K)$? I face the problem when I want to obtain a certain set-valued function that satisfies a strong measurability condition. It is enough for my purposes to get a closed-valued set-valued function with a graph measurable with respect to the completion on my underlying probability space. I can obtain the desired set-valued function as a projection, but this only gives me universal measurability of the graph. As a first step, it might be intersting to know whether the conjecture holds in the case that $A(\omega)$ contains a single element for all $\omega$, so that it really is a function. If $f:\Omega\to K$ has a universally measurable graph, is $f$ then
  $\Sigma_u$-$\mathcal{B}(K)$-measurable? I have asked this now also on Mathoverflow.","['set-theory', 'measure-theory', 'descriptive-set-theory']"
