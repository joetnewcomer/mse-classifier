3366262,"Let $f:[0,n]\to \Bbb R$ be continuous with $f(0)=f(n)$. Then there are $n$ pairs of numbers $x,y$ such that $f(x)=f(y)$ and $y-x\in\Bbb N$.","Theorem. Let $f:[0,n]\to \Bbb R$ be continuous with $f(0)=f(n)$ ( $n\in\Bbb N$ ). Then there exist (at least) $n$ distinct pairs of numbers $x,y$ which satisfy $f(x)=f(y)$ and $y-x\in \mathbb{N}$ (where $0$ is not a natural number). Partial results (see the two answers below): Proposition. For $f$ as in the Theorem there exists a $x\in[0,n]$ such that $f(x)=f(x+1)$ . Proof. Define $g(x)=f(x+1)-f(x)$ where $x\in[0,n-1]$ . Note that $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}g(i)=f(n)-f(0)=0$ . If all $g(i)=0$ then the proposition holds trivially. Otherwise there must be $i\neq j$ such that $g(i)$ and $g(j)$ have different sign. The proposition now follows from the Intermediate Value Theorem. Proposition. The Theorem holds under the additional assumption that $f$ is concave or convex. Proof. See the answer by @Maximilian Janisch. *Remark.*It is not for each $0<m\leq n$ , there must exist $x$ s.t. $f(x)=f(x+m)$ . For example, if $f_{[0,1]}(x)>0 \wedge f_{[n-1,n]}(x)<0$ , then there doesn't exist $x$ s.t. $f(x)=f(x+n-1)$ . However,for some $m$ , it may have more than one $x$ satisfying $f(x)=f(x+m)$ .","['continuity', 'functions', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"
3366276,Free homotopy class of Riemannian manifold represented by closed geodesic,"I'm trying to prove the following result, which is Problem 6-17 in Lee's Introduction to Riemannian Manifolds : Suppose $(M,g)$ is a compact connected Riemannian manifold. Show that every nontrivial free homotopy class in $M$ is represented by a closed geodesic that has minimal length among all admissible loops in the given free homotopy class. This problem comes with a hint, which breaks the solution down into the following steps: Show the given free homotopy class is represented by a geodesic loop; Show the lengths of such loops have positive greatest lower bound; Choose a sequence of geodesic loops whose lengths approach this bound, and show that a subsequence converges uniformly to a geodesic loop whose length is equal to this greatest lower bound; Show the limiting curve is in the given free homotopy class; Apply the first variation formula to show that the limiting curve is in fact a closed geodesic. I have most of these steps down except 3 and 5. First of all, if I have such a sequence, finding a universally convergent subsequence seems similar in spirit to Arzelà-Ascoli, but finding the right uniformly bounded and equicontinuous sequence of functions so far has eluded me. Second of all, in proving 5, the first variation formula says that if $\Gamma_s(t)$ is a variation (i.e. a homotopy) between the limiting curve $\gamma(t)$ and one of the sequence curves $\gamma_n(t)$ , then $$
\frac{d}{ds}\bigg|_{s=0} L_g(\Gamma_s) = -\int_a^b \langle V, D_t\dot\gamma\rangle\:dt - \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \left\langle V(a_i), \Delta_i \dot\gamma\right\rangle + \langle V(b),\dot\gamma(b)\rangle - \langle V(a), \dot\gamma(b)\rangle
$$ where $V(t) = \frac{d}{ds}\big|_{s=0} \Gamma_s(t)$ is the variation field along $\gamma$ , $(a_0, \ldots, a_k)$ is an admissible partition for $V$ , and $\Delta_i \dot\gamma = \dot\gamma(a_i^+) - \dot\gamma(a_i^-)$ is the ""jump"" in the velocity vector field at $a_i$ . In this case, $V(a) = V(b)$ , so we need to show $\dot\gamma(a) = \dot\gamma(b)$ and $\Delta_i \dot\gamma = 0$ for all $i$ . Since $\Gamma_0$ is a critical point for this variation, this forumula becomes $$
\int_a^b \langle V, D_t\dot\gamma\rangle\:dt = - \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \left\langle V(a_i), \Delta_i \dot\gamma\right\rangle + \langle V(b),\dot\gamma(b)\rangle - \langle V(a), \dot\gamma(a)\rangle
$$ But why does this show the limiting curve $\gamma$ is geodesic? Where in here does it follow that $D_t\dot\gamma \equiv 0$ ? Edit 1: I think I can use the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem for $\mathbb R^n$ -valued functions of a compact space in a geodesic ball in normal coordinates around a limit point of an appropriate sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $M$ ; say, for example, $x_n = \gamma_n(0)$ , where $\{\gamma_n\}$ is the sequence of geodesic loops. Edit 2: Using the sequence $\{x_n\}$ coming from $x_n = \gamma_n(0)$ , take a convergent subsequence $x_n \to p \in M$ , and then let $w_n = \dot\gamma_n(0) \in T_{x_n}M$ for each $n$ . Assume after reparametrization that each $\gamma_n$ is unit-speed, so the parallel translations $v_n \in T_pM$ along radial geodesics from $p$ to $x$ are unit tangent vectors. In particular, they too have a convergent subsequence $v_n \to v$ . I think the resulting geodesic we want is then just $\gamma(t) = \exp_p(tv)$ .","['geodesic', 'smooth-manifolds', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

3366302,Morphisms between two projective varieties,"I know similar questions have been asked, but I don't think this specific question has been asked. I wish to prove the following Let $X\subset \mathbb{P}^n$ and $Y\subset \mathbb{P}^m$ be two projective varieties. Show that $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a morphism if and only if there exists a collection of $m+1$ homogeneous polynomials $F_{0},...,F_{m}\in k[X_{0},...,X_{n}]$ of the same degree such that $f([x_{0}:...:x_{n}])=[F_{0}(x):...:F_{m}(x)]\in Y$ , and such that for each $x\in X$ , at least one of $F_{i}(x)\neq 0$ The ""only if"" part is giving me a lot of grief. The definition of morphism I am using is from Hartshorne which is the following Definition: Let $k$ be a fixed algebraically closed field. A variety over $k$ (or simply variety) is any affine, quasi-affine, projective or quasi-projective variety as defined above. If $X$ and $Y$ are two varieties, a morphism $\phi: X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous map such that for every open set $V\subset Y$ , and for every regular function $f:V\rightarrow k$ , the function $f\circ \phi: \phi^{-1}(V)\rightarrow k$ is regular. My attempt: Describe the co-ordinates of $\mathbb{P}^n$ by $[x_{0},...,x_{n}]$ and describe the co-ordinates of $\mathbb{P}^m$ by $[y_{0},...,y_{m}]$ . Assume $\phi$ is a morphism. Let $V_{0}\subset \mathbb{P}^m$ be the open subset of $\mathbb{P}^m$ corresponding to the subset $y_{0}\neq 0$ . Then we have that $V_{0}\cap Y$ is an open subset of $Y$ which corresponds to an affine variety in $\mathbb{A}^m$ . Now since $\phi$ is a morphism it follows that for $f:\phi^{-1}(V_{0}\cap Y)\rightarrow k$ a regular function that $f\circ \phi$ is regular. This doesn't give me a lot to work with. So now consider $f\circ \phi$ restricted to $U_{0}\cap\phi^{-1}(V_{0}\cap Y)$ , here $U_{0}$ is the open subset of $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ corresponding to $x_{0}\neq 0$ . This looks promising, but the map $f\circ \phi: U_{0}\cap\phi^{-1}(Y\cap V_{0})\rightarrow Y\cap V_{0}$ is a map from a QUASI affine variety to an affine variety. Had $U_{0}\cap\phi^{-1}(Y\cap V_{0})$ been an affine variety I could have used the fact that morphisms between affine varieties are made up of polynomials in each co-ordinate and then used the construction in Hartshorne proposition 2.2 to ""projectify (apply $\beta$ "" to these polynomials to obtain a map of the form stated in the question. However, even if I could do this, this would only be from $U_{0}\cap\phi^{-1}(Y\cap V_{0})\rightarrow Y\cap V_{0}$ and I could repeat this process for $U_{i}\cap\phi^{-1}(Y\cap V_{j})\rightarrow Y\cap V_{j}$ for various $i$ and $j$ but then how would I ""stick them together"" to get one polynomial map as stated in the question.

I will add some of my thoughts. The problem should only involve elementary results from mathematical analysis. Thus I have tried to use the discrete form of L’Hopital to evaluate the limit with denominator $1/n^3$ and calculate the quotient of the difference of the $i$ and $i+1$ ’s term, respectively.

3366517,Uniqueness of solution to nonlinear first-order ODE in non-standard form,"I have an ODE of a reasonably simple form: $$
-x(y')^2 + 2yy' + x = 0 \qquad \qquad (\ast)
$$ for $y$ only assumed to be a differentiable function of $x$ (note: not necessarily $C^1$ !) The proof I saw took another derivative and then used some reduction of order to get something separable. I found the solution to $(\ast)$ with my regularity assumption through doing a substitution, getting a separable DE, solving it, etc. And even then, I already knew the form of the solution, so I wasn't particularly surprised. But someone pointed out that I didn't need to actually grind out the solution, because I could check the pretty-much-known solution satisfied the DE, and then with suitable initial conditions (also known) a uniqueness theorem takes over. However, it's not clear to me what theorem to use. In principle, I could make the substitution and then apply the Picard–Lindelöf theorem to get the uniqueness for the new ODE, but the substitution still feels like inspired magic (it kinda is: I just tried something at random, and was surprised when it worked). Using uniqueness also feels like magic, but of a different sort. At the very least, the solution is well-motivated.

Let $\hat{d}(a,b) = \log( \frac{ab}{\gcd(a,b)^2})$ for $ab \neq 0$ which is a metric on the natural numbers without $0$ (see Encyclopedia of Distances).

There are $N$ fishermen on a lake with a fixed, yet unknown, number of fish in the lake. Each fisherman fishes at the same time and for a length of time $T$ . When a fisherman catches a fish, the fisherman annotates the time when the fish was caught. There is no catch and release. At the end of the fishing period, a person collects all times, sorts them and computes the inter-catch (inter-arrival) times. He notes that they are power-law distributed according to \begin{equation}
\frac{\beta \alpha^\beta}{x^{1+\alpha}} I_{[\alpha,\infty)}(x)

I want to find the center of a circle (in my case, its coordinate is the origin of a sound wave). Let's call the center of this circle $c$ . Imagine then I have a set of three points $p1...p3$ which are equidistant from each other, but all different distances from the origin of the sound, $c$ . Imagine a circle travelling outward from $c$ (this is the sound wave propagating). It will ""hit"" one of these points first - let's call this point $p_1$ . This point then, by definition, intersects with the circle propagating from $c$ at this point in time. Imagine for the sake of this explanation that this circle then stops propagating outwards, and instead, circles begin propagating from each of the remaining points $p_2$ and $p_3$ until these circles lie tangentially on the circle centered on $c$ at the moment that it intersects with $p_1$ . I'm hoping that this can be visually intuited with the graph below (The green point is $c$ , the point in the bottom right is $p_1$ , and the other two points whose circles lie tangentially to the circle centered on $c$ are naturally $p_1...p_2$ ): In actuality though, I only have a subset of the data depicted above known to me. That subset is: The coordinates of $p_1$ , $p_2$ , and $p_3$ . The radii of the circles centered on $p_2$ and $p_3$ . My question: with only these known quantities, is it even possible for me to deduce the center of $c$ ? If so, how?

Adding axiom of choice is a lot, so maybe you don't have to add so many new homomorphisms. Question(s): Can the set of self homomorphisms of the reals have cardinality strictly between the two cardinalities discussed above?(see edit below but the more natural upper bound is $\frak {c^c}$ ) With cardinality gaps can you chose which cardinal in between arbitrarily?

(This is inspired by a question I recently answered, and technically an answer to this could be an answer to that, although this is more focused) Edit: There might be some subtlety in the upper bound cardinal, since without choice things get a weird where $\kappa^\kappa$ , $\kappa !$ (cardinality of bijections), and $2^\kappa$ might be different. Not sure if that is true for $\frak c$ but we at leat have the set of endomorphisms has cardinality less than or equal to $\frak {c^c}$ .

Ideally I would like to know all coefficients of the polynomial in $n$ . The leading coefficient (i.e., coefficient of $n^{d(d+1)/2}$ ) is of particular interest. For example, when $d=2$ , our sum becomes $\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{n}\displaystyle\sum_{j=i+1}^{n}(j-i) = \frac{1}{6}n(n+1)(n+2)$ , and the leading coefficient (of $n^3$ ) is $1/6$ .

3367851,"Intuition behind ""flatness"" in differential geometry","I have been reading introductory material on differential geometry and have come across the term flatness a lot. Intuitively a layman would assume ""flatness"" means that the underlying manifold is flat-shaped (like a hyper-plane), but from my readings I don't believe that is the case. I believe you can have many shapes of manifolds which are also "" flat "", according to the differential geometric definitions. I believe ""flatness"" refers solely to having a covariant derivative (a connection) which has zero torsion (Christoffel symbols evaluate to zero). Thus to help solidify my intuition I'm hoping someone can help 1. Verify what I have written thus far, and 2. Answer the following questions: Does flatness have any implication for the shape of the underlying manifold? If no, then does the property of flatness exist on any manifold we choose? Since flatness seems to depend on having an ""affine connection"" which can be constructed without explicit reference to any intrinsic shape of the manifold (and by extension there exist infinite types of parallel transport - so what's stopping me from always selecting zero curvature covariant derivatives) Is flatness a desirable attribute and or property of an underlying manifold? In Amari's work on information geometry, he defines a notion of dual flatness on a statistical manifold. Would dual flatness change any of the interpretations of the previous answers?","['euclidean-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'geometry', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

\cong S^1$ and has the stated property: $A$ is not a retract of the Torus $A$ is a deformation retract of the Torus For the first property, I'm tempted to say no, but I'm not sure. I know that if we fix $m \in S^1$ , the subspace $S^1 \times \{m\}$ is homeomorphic to $S^1$ and is a retract of the Torus via the mapping $f: S^1 \times S^1 \to S^1 \times \{m\}$ given by $f(x,y) = (x,m)$ . So, if a subspace $A$ of the Torus, is homemorphic to $S^1$ , we would necessarily need to have $S^1 \times \{m\} \cong A$ via some homemorphism $h: S^1 \times \{m\} \to A$ . I was trying to show that $h \circ f: S^1\times S^1 \to A$ is a retraction, but I have thus far been unable to show that the restriction of $h \circ f$ to $A$ is the identity on $A$ . Now, I'm thinking that perhaps there may be subspace $A$ satisfying property 1, but I have no idea how to go about constructing it. Intuitively, for property 2, I'm also thinking no. My intuition relies on the idea that a deformation retraction $g_t$ of the torus onto a subspace $A$ would inevitably allow us to obtain a deformation retraction $k \circ g_t$ (where $k: A \to S^1 \times \{m\}$ is a homeomorphism) of the torus onto $S^1 \times \{m\}$ .

Then I define $T = t/\varepsilon$ and let $X(\varepsilon, T) = x(\varepsilon, t)$ and write the re-scaled equation $$X'' + X' + \varepsilon TX = 0.$$ Then solve this at the corresponding orders of $\varepsilon$ for the expansion $$X(\varepsilon, T) = \varepsilon X_1(T) + \varepsilon^2 X_2(T) + o(\varepsilon^3).$$ Assuming $X$ is my solution 'inside' the boundary layer, I let $X$ satisfy the initial conditions $X(0) = 0, X'(0) = \varepsilon$ .

3368565,Why symmetry transformations must have inverses (i.e they must be bijective)?,"A symmetry transformation is a transformation which maps a geometric object to itself. And as far as i know, the definition of a group stems from their properties. (As the definition of the equivalence relations stems from the properties of equality: Since there is no other way of objectively defining concept of equality. Same holds true for the concept of symmetry) So, combining any two symmetry transformation gives us another symmetry transformation, i.e. set of symmetry transformations is closed (which is very intuitive) We have an identity element ( $T_x = x$ kind of transformation, which also very intuitive). And we know that operation must be associative (since function composition is). But then we say any symmetry transformation (or group element) must have an inverse (i.e must be a bijection). Why is this? This is not obvious at all. Can anyone please explain this?","['group-theory', 'symmetry']"
3368566,Intersection of powers of distinct maximal ideals,"Does there exist a Noetherian regular domain $R$ (necessarily non-local) and distinct maximal ideals $\mathfrak{m}_n$ for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , such that $$\bigcap_n (\mathfrak{m}_n)^n \neq 0.$$ May be this is impossible by a clever application of Krull's intersection theorem, but I don't see why. I am interested in the case where R has prime characteristic, but I suspect if an example exists it will be characteristic independent. In prime characteristic, I can show that such examples are impossible for regular domains which are essentially of finite type over a Noetherian local ring $A$ whose formal fibers are geometrically regular (i.e. a $G$ -ring) using techniques which seem overkill. In low dimension, note that this is also cannot happen for a Dedekind domain because any non-zero element of a Dedekind domain is only contained in finitely many maximal ideals. I tried playing with some of the constructions of large Noetherian rings  such as Nagata's Noetherian ring of infinite Krull dimension, but I think this ring also has the property that any element is contained only in finitely many maximal ideals based on the answer here: Noetherian ring with infinite Krull dimension (Nagata's example).","['algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'commutative-algebra']"

3368743,Can an isometry be thought of as biholomorphism?,"I am slightly confused about the interchangeability of the terms isometry and biholomorphism . This confusion is rooted in the following statement, which I have seen more than once in some discussions on equivalent versions of the Uniformization Theorem. Suppose $(M,g)$ is a complete, simply connected, $2$ -dimensional Riemannian manifold with constant curvature. By the Killing-Hopf theorem, it is isometric to either $\mathbb{R}^2$ , $S^2$ , or $\mathbb{H}^2$ . Identify $M$ as a simply connected Riemann surface and identify $\mathbb{R}^2$ , $S^2$ , and $\mathbb{H}^2$ as, respectively, $\mathbb{C}$ , $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ , and $D_1$ . Then $M$ is biholomorphically equivalent to $\mathbb{C}$ , $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ , or $D_1$ . To me, an isometry between two Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ and $(M',g')$ is a diffeomorphism $f:M\longrightarrow M'$ such that $g=f^*g'$ . Thus, it preserves angles and can be described as a conformal mapping. On the other hand, given two Riemann surfaces $M$ and $N$ , a biholomorphism is a bijective map $f:M \longrightarrow N$ such that both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are holomorphic. So, in the context of the italicized statement, does it really follow that the isometry turns into a biholomorphism just because we switched from Riemannian manifolds to Riemann surfaces, and because both isometries and biholomorphisms preserve angles? Or is there something more subtle going on here?","['riemann-surfaces', 'conformal-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

Is there such an example? My solution: Consider Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$ . If we assume that set $E$ is a non-measurable set(such as Vitali set which is not Lebesgue measurable), then consider the collection of all indicator function of $e\in E$ , that is, A:= $\{1_{e}: e\in E\}$ which is uncountable. In fact, if $E$ is not uncountable, then at most countable set $E$ is measurable. Notice that the the supremum of $A$ is $\mathbb{1}_{E}$ . Indeed, if $\forall x\in E$ , then $\mathbb{1}_{E}(x)=1\geq \mathbb{1}_{e}(x)$ . If $\forall x\notin E$ , then $\mathbb{1}_{E}(x)=0=\mathbb{1}_{e}(x)$ . Also, we claim that if there exists function $f$ such that $f<\mathbb{1}_{E}$ , then $f<\mathbb{1}_{e}$ which means $\mathbb{1}_{E}$ is the supremum of $A$ . Indeed, if $\forall x\in E$ , then $f(x)<\mathbb{1}_{E}(x)=1$ which implies $f(x)<\mathbb{1}_{x}(x)$ . Also, If $\forall x\notin E$ , then $f(x)<\mathbb{1}_{E}(x)=0$ which implies $f(x)\geq 0=\mathbb{1}_{e}$ .","['measure-theory', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"
