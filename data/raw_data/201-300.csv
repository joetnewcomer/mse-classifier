1333,Is there a possibility to choose fairly from three items when every choice can only have 2 options,"Me and my wife are often not knowing which DVD to watch. If we have two options we have a simple solution, I put one DVD in one hand behind my back and the other DVD in the other hand. She will randomly choose a hand and the DVD I have in that hand will be the one to watch. This procedure is easy to expand to any power of 2. If we have 4 DVD's I hold 2 in one hand, 2 in the other. When a pair of DVD's is chosen, I split them out to two hands and she choses again. The question is, what can we do when we have  3 DVD's. The assumptions we make are: I am not impartial. If I can influence the result somehow I will try to do that My wife really choses randomly a side every-time, independent of what she chose earlier. I don't have any other place to hide the DVD's, so every DVD is either visible or in one of the two hands. As requirement we have that it must be a procedure with a predetermined number of steps. Not more, not less. If this is not possible, a solution that guarantees to finish with an upperbound, this is a good second choice. Off course the DVD we choose must be really random!","['probability-theory', 'algorithms']"

One way to do it is to project the plane onto $XY$ and $YZ$ plane, but I don't really favor this approach as you have to check the orientation of the coplanar plane first before doing the projection and computing the centroid. More specifically, I'm looking for a natural extension of the 2D centroid plane algorithm in 3D: \begin{align}
C_x&=\frac1{6A}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(x_i+x_{i+1})(x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i)\\

1344,Examples/other references for EGA 0.4.5.4,"Proposition 0.4.5.4 in EGA appears to be a general representability theorem. It reads: Suppose $F$ is a contravariant functor from the category of locally ringed spaces over $S$ to the category of sets. Suppose given representable sub-functors $F_i$ of $F$, such that the morphisms $F_i \to F$ are representable by open immersions. Suppose furthermore that if $Hom(-, X) \to F$ is a morphism and the functors $F_i \times_F Hom(-,X)$ are representable by $Hom(-,X_i)$, the family $X_i$ forms an open covering of $X$. (That $X_i \to X$ is an open immersion follows from the definitions.)  Finally, suppose that if $U$ ranges over the open subsets of a locally ringed space $X$, the functor $U \to F(U)$ is a sheaf.   Then, $F$ is representable. I haven't yet been able to grok the proof, but it appears to be some sort of extended gluing construction. This result appears to be used in proving that fibered products exist in the category of schemes. However, it's fairly easy to directly construct fibered products by gluing open affines. Are there examples where this result actually makes the life of algebraic geometers easier?  Also, I'd appreciate any links to examples (outside of EGA) where this result is used.","['algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request']"
1347,Studying Euclidean geometry using hyperbolic criteria,"You've spent your whole life in the hyperbolic plane. It's second nature to you that the area of a triangle depends only on its angles, and it seems absurd to suggest that it could ever be otherwise. But recently a good friend named Euclid has raised doubts about the fifth postulate of Poincaré's Elements . This postulate is the obvious statement that given a line $L$ and a point $p$ not on $L$ there are at least two lines through $p$ that do not meet $L$. Your friend wonders what it would be like if this assertion were replaced with the following: given a line $L$ and a point $p$ not on $L$, there is exactly one line through $p$ that does not meet $L$. You begin investigating this Euclidean geometry, but you find it utterly impossible to visualize intrinsically. You decide your only hope is to find a model of this geometry within your familiar hyperbolic plane. What model do you build? I do not know if there's a satisfying answer to this question, but maybe it's entertaining to try to imagine. For clarity, we Euclidean creatures have built models like the upper-half plane model or the unit-disc model to visualize hyperbolic geometry within a Euclidean domain. I'm wondering what the reverse would be.","['hyperbolic-geometry', 'geometry', 'euclidean-geometry']"

1382,Counting subsets with r mod 5 elements,"Some time ago Qiaochu Yuan asked about counting subsets of a set whose number of elements is divisible by 3 (or 4) . The story becomes even more interesting if one asks about number of subsets of n-element set with $r\bmod 5$ elements. Denote this number by, say, $P_n (r \bmod 5)$. An experiment shows that for small $n$, $P_n(r \bmod 5)-P_n(r' \bmod 5)$ is always a Fibonacci number (recall that for ""$r \bmod 3$"" corresponding difference is always 0 or 1 and for ""$r \bmod 2$"" they are all 0). It's not hard to prove this statement by induction but as always inductive proof explains nothing. Does anybody have a combinatorial proof? (Or maybe some homological proof — I've heard one for ""$r \bmod 3$""-case.) And is there some theorem about $P_n(r \bmod l)$ for arbitrary $l$ (besides that it satisfies some recurrence relation of degree growing with $l$)?","['binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"
1388,How to solve a cyclic quintic in radicals?,"Galois theory tells us that $\frac{z^{11}-1}{z-1} = z^{10} + z^9 + z^8 + z^7 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1$ can be solved in radicals because its group is solvable. Actually performing the calculation is beyond me, though - here what I have got so far: Let the roots be $\zeta^1,\zeta^2,\ldots,\zeta^{10}$, following Gauss we can split the problem into solving quintics and quadratics by looking at subgroups of the roots. Since 2 is a generator of the group $[2,4,8,5,10,9,7,3,6,1]$ we can partition into the five subgroups of conjugate pairs $[2,9]$,$[4,7]$,$[8,3]$,$[5,6]$,$[10,1]$. Now put $q_1 = \zeta^2+\zeta^9$,$q_2 = \zeta^4+\zeta^7$,$q_3 = \zeta^8+\zeta^3$,$q_4 = \zeta^5+\zeta^6$,$q_5 = \zeta^{10}+\zeta^1$. So if we can solve the quintic $(q - q_1)(q - q_2)(q - q_3)(q - q_4)(q - q_5) = q^5 + q^4 - 4q^3 - 3q^2 + 3q + 1 = 0$ we would just be left to solve a few quadratic equations. Now pari/gp tells me this quintic has the cyclic group C(5): ? polgalois(x^5 + x^4 - 4*x^3 - 3*x^2 + 3*x + 1)
%1 = [5, 1, 1, ""C(5) = 5""] I've worked through examples of solving quadratic and cubic equations based on the galois group but when it comes to this quintic I'm completely stumped so any advice would be tremendously helpful! Thanks. Edit: Thanks to Robin Chapman the problem is reduced significantly. Let $\omega$ be a primitive 5th root of unity (which is easy to express in radicals), it only remains to express $(q_1 + \omega q_2  + \omega^2 q_3  + \omega^3 q_4  + \omega^4 q_5)^5$ in terms of rationals and powers of $\omega$ (and then everything can be substituted back and solved easily). We know this is possible because the term is fixed by the quintics galois group, how to actually perform this evades me but I will try to find a way.","['abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

1393,Relative sizes of sets of integers and rationals revisited - how do I make sense of this?,"I already asked if there are more rationals than integers here... Are there more rational numbers than integers? However, there is one particular argument that I didn't give before which I still find compelling... Every integer is also a rational. There exist (many) rationals that are not integers. Therefore there are more rationals than integers. Obviously, in a sense, I am simply choosing one particular bijection, so by the definition of set cardinality this argument is irrelevant. But it's still a compelling argument for ""size"" because it's based on a trivial/identity bijection. EDIT please note that the above paragraph indicates that I know about set cardinality and how it is defined, and accept it as a valid ""size"" definition, but am asking here about something else. To put it another way, the set of integers is a proper subset of the set of rationals. It seems strange to claim that the two sets are equal in size when one is a proper subset of the other. Is there, for example, some alternative named ""size"" definition consistent with the partial ordering given by the is-a-proper-subset-of operator? EDIT clearly it is reasonable to define such a partial order and evaluate it. And while I've use geometric analogies, clearly this is pure set theory - it depends only on the relevant sets sharing members, not on what the sets represent. Helpful answers might include a name (if one exists), perhaps for some abstraction that is consistent with this partial order but defined in cases where the partial order is not. Even an answer like ""yes, that's valid, but it isn't named and doesn't lead to any interesting results"" may well be correct - but it doesn't make the idea unreasonable. Sorry if some of my comments aren't appropriate, but this is pretty frustrating. As I said, it feels like I'm violating some kind of taboo. EDIT - I was browsing through random stuff when I was reminded this was here, and that I actually ran into an example where ""size"" clearly can't mean ""cardinality"" fairly recently (actually a very long time ago and many times since, but I didn't notice the connection until recently). The example relates to closures of sets. Please forgive any wrong terminology, but if I have a seed set of {0} and an operation $f x = x+2$ , the closure of that set WRT that operation is the ""smallest"" set that is closed WRT that operation, meaning that for any member $x$ of the set, $x+2$ must also be a member. So obviously the closure is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ...} - the even non-negative integers. However, the cardinality of the set of even non-negative integers is equal to the cardinality of the set of all integers, or even all rationals. So if ""smallest"" means ""least cardinality"", the closure isn't well-defined - the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...} is no larger than the set {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ...}. Therefore, the meaning of ""smallest"" WRT set closures refers to some measure of size other than cardinality. I'm not adding this as a late answer because it's already covered by the answers below - it's just a particular example that makes sense to me. Another addition - while skimming the first chapter of a topology textbook in a library some time ago, IIRC I spotted a definition of the set closure which did not use the word ""smallest"", and made no direct reference to ""size"". That led me to think maybe the common ""definition"" of closures I'm familiar with is just a stopgap for those of us who aren't ready for a formally precise definition. However, while searching for another source, I instead found this answer to a topology question that uses the word ""smallest"" in its definition of closure (and ""largest"" in its ""dual definition of interior""). And then I found this answer which describes a concept of size based on partial ordering of topological embeddings. I think that's another example to add to those in answers below.",['elementary-set-theory']

1413,Why should I care about fields of positive characteristic?,"This is what I know about why someone might care about fields of positive characteristic: they are useful for number theory in algebraic geometry, a theory of ""geometry"" can be developed over them, and it's fun to see how this geometry works out Some people might read this and think, ""What more could you need?"" But I've never been able to make myself care about number theory, so (1) doesn't help me. (2) is nice for what it is, but I'm hoping there's something more. My understanding of (2) is that this is only geometry in a rather abstract sense and, for instance, there's no generally useful way to directly visually represent these fields or varieties over them the way we can over the reals or complex numbers. (Drawing a curve in R^2 and saying it's the curve over some other field may be helpful for some purposes, but it's not what I'm after here.) Is there anything else? The ideal (surely impossible) answer for me would be ""Yes, such fields are very good models for these common and easy to understand physical systems: A, B, C. Also, we can visualize them and varieties over them quite easily by method D. Finally, here's a bunch of surprising and helpful applications to 500 other areas of mathematics."" UPDATE: to answer Qiaochu's comment about what I do care about. Let's say I care about: algebraic & geometric topology differential geometry & topology applications to physics and I certainly care about algebraic geometry over C (this is to say I understand the motivations behind these subjects and the general idea, not necessarily that I know them in depth)","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

I have tried playing around with the implicit function theorem but haven't gotten far.  It feels like I may be missing something very obvious. Some related questions: A necessary condition in the case of $n = 1$ is that $f$ cannot attain the same value infinitely many times (since a polynomial has only finitely many roots).

In particular, he asks you to show that it has many subgroups of finite index which are not closed. So here's what I've got so far, which may be wrong. I can write the compositum as F = Q [√–1, √2, √3, √5, √7 ...] (can I?) and then the Galois group G = Gal(F/ Q )  is isomorphic to a direct product Π p ( Z /2 Z ) where the product is taken over all primes p, as well as p=-1, and the pth component is generated by the conjugation σ p defined by √p -> –√p. An example of a subgroup which isn't closed would be the subgroup H consisting of finite products of conjugations, since for example, H contains the sequence σ 2 , σ 2 σ 3 , σ 2 σ 3 σ 5 , σ 2 σ 3 σ 5 σ 7 ... which converges to the automorphism ""conjugate everything"", and this automorphism is not contained in H . However this subgroup is nowhere near being finite index--it has the cardinality of the natural numbers, whereas G has the cardinality of the reals.

1519,Visualising $\mathbb CP^2$: a problem of attaching cells with a dimension gap >1,"For the uninitiated Morse theory , as many other early algebraic-topology widgets, leads to a picture of smooth manifolds as being built up from 'cells', copies of $\mathbb{D}^n$ for varying $n$ , 'glued' to each other by the usual topological tools; giving rise to (in some sense) a more natural picture of homology as 'coming from' cellular homology . Example As an example, consider the torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ : we begin with empty space, attach a 0-cell ( $\mathbb{D}^0=$ a point), attach a 1-cell ( $\mathbb{D}^1=$ a line) to your point (both ends of the line are attached to the point, creating a circle), attach another 1-cell (in the same way, to the same point, creating a sort of figure 8). The hardest bit to visualise is next: attaching a 2-cell ( $\mathbb{D}^2=$ a disk, which we will think of as its homeomorphism equivalent, a square). Begin by twisting your figure 8 so that one circle is in the xy-plane, the other in the xz-plane, now attach the top and bottom of your square (coloured red in picture below) to the xy circle (creating a 'curling round' tube) and the left and right edges (coloured blue below) of your square (now a tube) either side of the xz circle, completing the torus. Problem The above takes some thinking, but a little reading around shows that this is fairly easy to see. What makes it so easy is that the cells we are attaching are of adjacent dimensions , that is; we may easily identify the boundary of one with the entirety of another. Where it gets harder to visualise is when the dimensions of the cells we are attaching to one another differ by >1- the canonical example of this is the complex projective plane $\mathbb{CP}^2$ , a 4-manifold built by attaching a disk to a point (making a sphere) and then attaching a 4-ball to that sphere. The latter attaching map (wherein points are identified with their images), I know, may be thought of as the Hopf fibration $\partial \mathbb{D}^4=S^3 \to \mathbb{CP}^1=S^2 $ , but I have no way of visualising this, particularly with regard to the interior of the 4-disk. How does a 4 cell wrap around a 2 cell without producing a singularity of some kind? Is this analagous in some sense to Dehn surgery in which one uses a thickening?

1576,'(Pseudo)-random functions' by seeding of PRNGs?,"I have an application that wants controllable random functions from $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\mathbb{Z}^3$ to $2^{32}$ , where by controllable I basically mean seedable by some parameters (say, on the order of 3 to 5 32-bit integers) such that the same seeds will always produce the same functions.  The most obvious way of doing this (for the two-dimensional case, say) would seem to be computing the value at some point $(x,y)$ by using $x$, $y$, and the seed parameters as seeds for something like an LFSR generator or a Mersenne Twister, then running the RNG for some fixed number of steps and taking the resultant value as the value of the function at that point. My question is, how can I be certain that this procedure won't keep too much correlation between adjacent 'seed points', and is there either a straightforward analysis or even just some general guideline for how many iterations would be necessary to eliminate that correlation?  My first back-of-the-envelope guess would be that each iteration roughly doubles the decorrelation between given seed values, so that 32 iterations would be necessary to achieve the requisite decorrelation over a range of $2^{32}$ values (and in practice I'd probably double it to 64 iterations), but that's strictly a guess and any proper analysis would be welcome! Edited for clarification: To further outline the issue, I may be sampling this random function $f$ (for some given seed parameters) at arbitrary values, and need those samples to be identical between passes; so for instance, if a first application computes $f(0, 0)$, $f(437, 61)$, $f(-23, 129)$, and then $f(5,3)$, and a second (potentially concurrent) application computes $f(1,0)$ and then $f(5,3)$, both passes need to find the same value of $f$ at $(5,3)$.  I may also be sampling $f$ at arbitrary points, so I'd like the evaluation to take constant time (and in particular, evaluating $f(x,y)$ shouldn't take time linear in $x+y$).","['numerical-methods', 'computer-science', 'algorithms', 'number-theory']"

Also suppose that each $A_\alpha$ is disjoint from the closure of the union of the other sets. Show that $\bigcup_{\alpha} A_\alpha$ is a Baire space.

If $\alpha$ is a limit ordinal: we want to show that for every sequence of open dense subsets of $\bigcup_{\beta<\alpha} A_\alpha$ their intersection is open dense. This sequence of open dense sets in the union is defined as the union of all open dense sets in each of the sets since they all are Baire spaces and by induction hypothesis the union up to $\beta$ is a Baire space. Suppose this is not the case. Then there exists an open set $U$ such that the intersection of these open dense sets misses $U$. There is some ordinal $\beta$ such that $U \in A_\beta$, but this is a contradiction since we supposed that the union up to $\beta$ was a Baire space.

1632,Analysing an optics model in discrete and continuous forms,"A discrete one-dimensional model of optical imaging looks like this: $$I(r) = \sum_i e_i P(r - r_i)$$ Here, the $e_i$ are point light sources at locations $r_i$ in the object and $P$ is a point spread function that blurs each point. We can assume that $P$ is even, non-negative and has a finite extent, ie $P(x) = 0$ for $|x| > p$. The $e_i$ are all positive. A more complex imaging process instead produces an image like this: $$I(r)^2 = \sum_{i,j} e_i e_j P(r - r_i) P(r - r_j) \cos (r_i - r_j)$$ (The $^2$ is a consequence of the reconstruction method. In practice we normally take the square root, but per my earlier question here , I think the salient structural features of the resulting image should be unchanged by this transformation.) Numerical simulations suggest that the latter method allows better resolution of the points when $p \sim \pi$, and is not materially different when $p \ll \pi$. (We ignore the case where $p \gg \pi$ as not physically tenable.) Intuitively, this is because the ""trough"" in the $\cos (r_i - r_j)$ term reduces the interaction between points at some intermediate separations. I'd like to be able to be more analytical about this. We can readily extend the above to a continuous model with an object function $O$ in place of the $e_i$. The ordinary image becomes a convolution integral $$I(r) = \int O(s) \: P(r - s) \; \mathrm{d}s$$ for which there are standard analytical approaches available. However, the more complex reconstruction looks something like this: $$I(r)^2 = \int \int  O(s) \; O(t) \; P(r-s) \; P(r-t) \; \cos (s - t) \;\mathrm{d}s\, \mathrm{d}t$$ This looks fairly intractable to me, and I'm not really sure where to begin with it. So, my first question is: is there any point in trying to look at the continuous model, or should I just concentrate on the discrete? On the one hand, every single practical use case for the technique will actually be using discrete measurements, so in that sense the discrete model is more realistic. On the other, it may be that there are things one could demonstrate using the continuous model that are not available otherwise. (But even if that's the case, I'm probably not capable of doing so without at least being nudged in the right direction!)

For example, for $n=3$ one needs to prove that number of b 1 , b 2 , b' s.t. $a_1\le b_1<a_2\le b_2<a_3$ , $b_1\le b'<b_2$ is exactly $\frac{(a_3-a_2)(a_3-a_1)(a_2-a_1)}{3}$ . As one can guess from the name “Gelfand-Zetlin”, this fact is well-known in representation theory (namely, in LHS we count dimension of a $gl_n$ -representation by Weyl formula, and in RHS we count elements in Gelfand-Zetlin basis of the same representation). But maybe someone can come with more or less direct proof? (Some kind of bijective proof, maybe.) Informal probabilistic argument For simplicity, consider the case $n=3$ : D(a_1,a_2,a_3) counts the number of triangles s.t. $a_1\le b_1<a_2\le b_2<a_3$ , $a_1\le b'<a_3$ — and we're interested only in G-Z triangles, i.e. in triangles s.t. $b_1\le b'< b_2$ . Now, mathematical expectation of the length of the interval $(b_1,b_2)$ is exactly one half of the length of the interval from which $b'$ is chosen. So one may expect that the probability that random triangle is G-Z is $1/2$ — and the answer is indeed $D(a_1,a_2,a_3)/D(1,2,3)$ . (The main problem with this computation is that we're multiplying probabilities for events that are clearly not independent.

1877,Uniform semi-continuity,"Background It is a standard and important fact in basic calculus/real analysis that a continuous function on a compact metric space is in fact uniformly continuous.  That is, suppose $(X,d)$ is a compact metric space and $f\colon X \to\mathbb R$ is such that for every $x\in X$ and $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $\delta>0$ such that $d(x,y)<\delta$ implies $|f(x)-f(y)|<\varepsilon$.  Then in fact, such a $\delta$ can be chosen independently of $x$. Question Does a similar statement hold regarding semi -continuous functions?  For concreteness, let's consider upper semi-continuous functions, so suppose $(X,d)$ is compact and $f\colon X \to\mathbb R$ has the property that for every $x\in X$ and $\varepsilon >0$ there exists $\delta >0$ such that $d(x,y)<\delta$ implies $f(y) < f(x)+\varepsilon$.  (Note the asymmetry of $x$ and $y$ in this definition.)  Then is it true that $\delta=\delta(\varepsilon)$ can be chosen independently of $x$? Reformulation Given $\delta, \epsilon > 0$, consider the set
$$
X_\delta^\epsilon := \lbrace x\in X \mid f(y) < f(x) + \epsilon \text{ for every } y\in B(x,\delta) \rbrace.
$$
Then $f$ is upper semi-continuous if and only if $\displaystyle\bigcup_{\delta>0} X_\delta^\epsilon = X$ for every $\epsilon > 0$, and $f$ is uniformly upper semi-continuous if and only if this union stabilises -- that is, if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta>0$ such that $X_\delta^\epsilon = X$.",['real-analysis']
1896,Local equation for the manifold from its principal curvatures,"If $k_1,k_2,...,k_n$ are principal curvatures of a hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ then one can apparently locally parametrize the manifold as $(x_1,x_2,...,x_n,y)$ such that, $y = \frac{1}{2}(k_1 x_1^2 +...+k_n x_n^2) + O(\vert x \vert ^3) $ I would like to know how this is proven. I guess the coordinates are obtained by ""integrating"" the eigen-vectors of the shape operator whose eigen-values are the principal curvatures anyway. I suppose one has to be able to find out curves passing through a point which have as velocity at that point the principal directions. But I have no experience of doing such a calculation on arbitrary manifolds and hence I can't see how to do this. Further I would like to understand how for dimension 2 the principal curvatures (as defined above) become the minimum and the maximum of geodesic curvatures and also minimum and maximum of curvatures of curves obtained by intersecting the manifold with planes orthogonal to the tangent space. (in elementary surface theory the principal curvatures get defined as the maximum and the minimum of the above quantities)",['differential-geometry']

1919,Ignoring elements of small order in the simple group of order $60$,"The simple group of order $60$ can be generated by the permutations $(1,2)(3,4)$ and $(1,3,5)$, but all you need to do is square the first one and it becomes the identity.  Can't we find a version of the simple group where the elements of small order can be ignored? For a group $H$, define $Ω_n(H)$ to be the subgroup generated by elements of order less than $n$.  For instance, if $n=3$ and $H=\operatorname{SL}(2,5)$ is the perfect group of order $120$, then $Ω_n(H)$ has order $2$, and $H/Ω_n(H)$ is the simple group of order $60$.  If $n=4$ and $H=\operatorname{SL}(2,5)⋅3^4$ is the perfect group of order $(60)⋅(162)$ whose $3$-core is not complemented, then $Ω_n(H)$ has order $162$ and $H/Ω_n(H)$ is again the simple group of order $60$. My first question is if there are smaller examples for $n=4$, since the jump $1$, $2$, $162$ seems a bit drastic for $n=2, 3, 4$. Is there a group $H$ of order less than $(60)⋅(162)$ such that $H/Ω_4(H)$ is the simple group of order $60$? Probably, for each positive integer $n$, there is a finite group $H$ such that $H/Ω_n(H)$ is the simple group of order $60$.  I am interested in whether such $H$ can be chosen to be ""small"" somehow. Is there a sequence of finite groups $H_n$ and a constant $C$ such that $H_n/Ω_n(H_n)$ is the simple group of order $60$ and such that $|H_n| ≤ C⋅n$? I would also be fine with some references to where such a problem is discussed.  It would be nice if there was some sort of analogue to the Schur multiplier describing the largest non-silly kernel, and a clear definition of what a silly kernel is (I think it is too much to ask for a non-silly kernel to be contained in the Frattini subgroup, and I think it might be unreasonable to ask for the maximum amongst minimal kernels). In case it helps, here are some reduced cases that I know can be handled: A simpler example: if instead of the simple group of order $60$, we concentrate on the simple group of order $2$, then we can choose $H_n$ to be the cyclic group of order $2^{1+\operatorname{lg}(n−1)}$ when $n≥2$, and the order of $H_n$ is bounded above and below by multiples of $n$.  We can create much larger $H_n$ for $n≥3$ by taking the direct product of our small $H_n$ with an elementary abelian $2$-group of large order, but then $Ω_n(H_n×2^n) = Ω_n(H_n)×2^n$ has just become silly since the entire elementary abelian $2$-group part, $2^n$, is unrelated and uses a lot of extra generators, that is, it is not contained within the Frattini subgroup. A moderate example: if instead of the simple group of order $60$, we take the non-abelian group of order $6$, then I can find a natural choice of $H_n$ with $|H_n| ≤ C⋅n$, but I am not sure if there are other reasonable choices.  My choice of $H_n$ has $Φ(H_n)=1$, which suggests to me that Frattini extensions may not be the right idea.","['group-theory', 'simple-groups']"

1949,Explicitly proving invariance of curvatures under isometry,"I would like to know how to explicitly prove that Riemann Curvature,Ricci Curvature, Sectional Curvature and Scalar Curvature are left invariant under an isometry. I can't see this explained in most books I have looked at. 
They atmost explain preservation of the connection. I guess doing an explicit proof for the sectional curvature should be enough (and easiest?) since all the rest can be written in terms of it. Given Akhil's reply I think I should try to understand the connection invariance proof better and here goes my partial attempt. Let $\nabla$ be the connection on the manifold $(M,g)$ and $\nabla '$ be the Riemann connection on the manifold $(M',g')$ and between these two let $\phi$ be the isometry. Then one wants to show two things, $D\phi [\nabla _ X Y] = \nabla ' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [Y]$ $R(X,Y)Z = R'(D\phi [X],D\phi [Y]) D\phi [Z]$ Where $R$ and $R'$ are the Riemann connection on $(M,g)$ and $(M',g')$ respectively. One defines the map $\nabla ''$ on M which maps two vector fields on M to another vector field using $\nabla '' _X Y = D\phi ^{-1} (\nabla' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [Y]$. By the uniqueness of the Riemann connection the proof is complete if one can show that this $\nabla ''$ satisfies all the conditions of being a Riemann connection on M. I am getting stuck after a few steps while trying to show the Lebnitz property of $\nabla ''$. Let $f$ be some smooth function on M and then one would like to show that,
$\nabla '' _X fY = X(f)Y + f\nabla '' _X Y$ which is equivalent to showing that,
$D\phi ^{-1} (\nabla' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [fY]) = X(f) + f D\phi ^{-1} (\nabla' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [Y])$ knowing that $\nabla '$ satisfies the Leibniz property on $M'$. Some how I am not being able to unwrap the above to prove this.
I can get the second term of the equation but not the first one. Proving symmetry of $\nabla ''$ is easy but again proving metric compatibility is stuck for me. If $X,Y,Z$ are 3 vector fields on M then one would want to show that, $Xg(Y,Z) = g(\nabla ''_X Y,Z) + g(Y, \nabla '' _X Z)$ which is equivalent to showing that, $Xg(Y,Z) = g(D\phi ^{-1} (\nabla' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [Y]),Z) + g(Y,D\phi ^{-1} (\nabla' _{D\phi[X]} D\phi [Z]) )$ knowing that $\nabla'$ satisfies metric compatibility equation on $M'$ It would be helpful if someone can help me fill in the steps.
