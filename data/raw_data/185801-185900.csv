3435619,Easy approach for the expected number of dice throws to achieve a run of identical numbers,"In a hypothetical world, consider a dice which has $k$ faces labelled from 1 to $k$ and the probability that any face comes up is the same i.e. $1/k$ . We use $X_t$ to denote the number that comes up in the $t$ -th throw. Given $m\in\Bbb N^+$ , and define the number of throws until a run of $m$ identical numbers: $$N:=\inf_{t>0}\{X_{t-m+1},\cdots,X_t \text{ are identical}\}$$ Then what is $\Bbb E(N)$ ? My thought: let $A_n$ be event that we have achieved a run of $n$ identical numbers, and $\Bbb E(N\mid A_n),\,n<m$ be the expected additional throws we need to achieve an $m$ -run. Then we have: \begin{align}
\Bbb E(N\mid A_m)&=0\\
\Bbb E(N\mid A_n)&=1+\frac1k\Bbb E(N\mid A_{n+1})+\frac{k-1}{k}\Bbb E(N\mid A_1),\quad 1\le n \le m-1\\
\Bbb E(N)&=\Bbb E(N\mid A_1)+1
\end{align} Then the we only have to solve (1), (2) for $\Bbb E(N\mid A_1)$ , since (3) is trivial. So it's $m$ equations and $m$ unknowns and we just have to solve this linear system. This method is perfectly okay, but it is slow by hand even for relatively small $k,m$ . Does there exist any other significantly slicker approach that can lead to a solution easily obtainable by hand, say in an interview?","['stopping-times', 'markov-chains', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

It is easily seen that this implies that $\psi$ is constant which was ruled out by assumption. Well, I'm not easily seeing the implication, so far I have that for every $A,B\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ with $\int_\mathbb{A}1dt=\int_\mathbb{B}1dt$ we get $\int_\mathbb{A}\psi(t)dt=\int_\mathbb{B}\psi(t)dt$ but of course that can also be the case for non-constant $\psi$ .

3435815,Number of groups of order $31p^2$ (up to isomorphism),"Let $p$ be a prime and let $f(p)$ be the number of groups of order $31p^2$ up to isomorphism. I have a homework problem which involves finding which choices for $p$ make $f(p)$ as large as possible. In order to solve the problem, I suspect that I will essentially need to classify groups of order $31p^2$ . There will, of course be two cases to consider: either $p=31$ or $p \neq 31$ . If $p=31$ , then we are looking for the number of groups of order $p^3$ , hence $f(p)=5$ by this . Now assume $p\neq31$ . Then for a group $|G|=31p^2$ we have $n_p \equiv 1$ (mod $p$ ) and $n_p|31$ , implying $n_p \in \{1,31\}$ . So it seems there are two cases to consider. If $n_p=31$ , we have $31 \equiv 1$ (mod $p$ ) and hence $p|30$ , so $p \in \{2,3,5\}$ . Using OEIS , we see that (up to isomorphism) there are $4$ groups of order $31*2^2$ , $4$ groups of order $31*3^2$ , and $4$ groups of order $31*5^2$ . Hence, since we are trying to maximize $f(p)$ , we can assume WLOG $p \notin \{2,3,5\}$ , which forces $n_p=1$ . If $n_p=1$ , $G$ has a normal Sylow-p subgroup. But does this help at all? I know the Fundamental Theorem of (finitely generated) Abelian Groups. So if it turns out that all the groups of order $31p^2$ are abelian (for a given $p$ ), then finding $f(p)$ will be stupidly easy. This homework, by the way, coincides with our study for semidirect products, hence I wouldn't be surprised if semidirect products play a vital role in the solution.","['finite-groups', 'semidirect-product', 'abstract-algebra', 'sylow-theory', 'group-theory']"

So my method for solving this was to let $y(x)=x^r$ and then substituting that into the original equation: $x^3\cdot r(r-1)(r-2)x^{r-3}+2x^2r(r-1)x^{r-2}-4xrx^{r-1}+4x^r=0$ Then solving $r(r-1)(r-2)+2\cdot r(r-1)-4r+4=0$ I guessed the solution $r=1$ Then used polynomial long division to get $r(r-1)(r-2)=0$ And so have the general solution $y(x)=c_1+c_2x+c_3x^2$ So I believe my $3$ linearly independent solutions should be $x^0, x^1, x^2$ however when I try these solutions, the only one that seems to work is $y(x)=x$ . So my first question is, is my general solution correct? And then are solutions supposed to be any linear combination of $x^0,x^1,x^2$ or do only some linear combination actually solve the equation? As for showing they are linearly independent I was going to use a theorem that polynomials of different degrees are linearly independent.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
3435920,Looking for more properties & references for what I call backward harmonic functions,"While analyzing a discrete version if Ito's Lemma, I became interested in a family of functions defined by the following: $$
f(n, k) = \frac{f(n+1, k+1) + f(n+1, k-1)}{2}
\tag{$1$}
$$ If $f$ satisfies (1), then we call $f$ a backwards harmonic function. For example, $f(k, n) = k^2 - n$ satisfies the above, as does $f(n, k) = k$ and $f(n, k) = \text{const}$ . I've been able to prove the following about backward harmonic functions: Extreme values: If $f$ satisfies equation (1), then $f$ has
its maximum value and minimum value on the boundary ${(n, ·)}$ . Vector space: If $g$ and $h$ are backwards harmonic functions and $a, b \in R$ , then $a · g + b · h$ is also a backward harmonic function. Uniqueness: If $f$ and $g$ are backwards harmonic and $f(N, ·) = g(N, ·)$ , then $f(m, k) = g(m, k), 0 \le m \le N, \forall k$ Suppose $f(n, k)$ is backwards harmonic and satisfies $f(n + 1, k) = f(n, k)$ for all $n, k$ , then $f(n, k) = (f_0 − f(n, −1))\cdot k + f_0$ for any $n$ What more can we learn about these functions? Are they already studied under a different name? The reason I am interested in these functions is related to another theorem I have proved. If $B_n$ is a random walk defined by $B_0=0$ and $P(\Delta B_n = 1) = P(\Delta B_n = -1) = 0.5$ , then $f$ is a backwards harmonic function iff $f(n, B_n)$ is a martingale with respect to $B_n$ . If $f$ is a backwards harmonic function, then $E[|f(n + 1, B_{n+1})|] \ge E[|f(n, B_n)|]$ Edit 1. The question When is a polynomial of an unbiased random walk a martingale? gives other polynomials, which generally seem to be related to Hermite polynomials. (Correction: see Edit 2.)

3435937,How can I safely make statistical inferences on abnormal data?,"I have a data set in which the key data point is lap times in seconds around a small set of known tracks in a small set of known vehicles. (Karts around an indoor kart track.) The data comprises about two months of business and growing; about 4000 racers have participated, completing about 200k laps. When bucketed into tenth-of-second results, the data looks mostly like a normal distribution, with one important caveat: it is not possible to be faster than (insert theoretical limit here), where that limit is only marginally quicker than the peak of the curve. A small number of racers approach that limit, but the left tail of the bell curve is dramatically smaller than the right tail. The right tail goes on impressively; sometimes racers spin out or otherwise find themselves in a jam and it can take several minutes to straighten things out and get running again. The longest lap time I've seen is 8.5 minutes; a typical lap is around 24-28 seconds. The fastest time anyone has ever run is 23.036 seconds. I'm working on improving my input data; ideally I would discard any lap where the racers stopped entirely as junk data. For now, I'm discarding anything >40 seconds as a rough approximation. The mean, when discarding >40, is 27.1 -- a decent bit to the right of the peak of the curve, which is ~26.0. My stats knowledge is spotty at best. I'd like to be able to work with standard deviations and other common statistical operations on this data. Can I do so safely with this data set? If not, what should I do, and more importantly, how do you know? For context, things I’d like to be able to do with the data: Compare individual racers against the norm, against each other, against their past selves See if the distribution changes over time (and correlate that with, for example, tire changes on the karts) Identify “hot” and “cold” karts Identify outliers and flag them for inspection (the timing system sometimes produces bad data) Rank drivers on their consistency Identify times when the track is likely to be warm (consecutive sessions warm the track, and a warm track yields better traction and therefore faster times) To be clear, I’m not asking how to do the above, although I would appreciate any guidance. And yes, the raw lap data includes identifiers for karts and racers, as well as dates.",['statistics']

The notes don't make any assumption about what the sets $\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}$ might be, so it seems very awkward to suddenly assume they carry some topology.

In other words, we let $$
S(y) = \int_{-a}^a2\pi y\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}dx,\quad V(y) = \int_{-a}^a\pi y^2 dx

I'm expecting to end up with $y$ a semicircle, in which case $a = \frac12\sqrt{\frac A\pi}$ . Solving this using Lagrange multipliers and Euler-Lagrange equations however has proven tedious. The augmented problem I end up with is that of finding the stationary functions of the functional $$
\tilde{J}(y; a) = \int_{-a}^a\left(-\pi y^2 + 2\pi\lambda y\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}\right) dx

-f + y'f_{y'} = \text{const}

\pi y^2 - 2\pi \lambda y\sqrt{1 + (y')^2} + \frac{2\pi\lambda y(y')^2}{\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}} = C

If we do some rearranging, we can end up with $$
(\pi y^2 - C)\sqrt{1 + (y')^2} - 2\pi\lambda y = 0

y = \lambda\left(\cos\theta\pm\sqrt{\cos^2\theta+c}\right)

3436167,How is this expression relating circumference to 2D curvature derived? From MTW Gravitation,"The excerpt below is from Box 14.1 of Misner Thorne and Wheeler's Gravitation.

How is it established?
I'm adding the first paragraph of Box 14.1, since it might provide a clue as to how they derived the expression in question. This is an illustration of how I see the situation.  The surface is given by the binary quadratic form of the second degree Taylor series expansion about a critical point (MacLauren series?).  The principle curves are axis aligned.  The closed curve on the surface is the graph of the image of the unit circle under the mapping $q.$ That is $\left\{\cos \theta,\sin \theta,q[\cos \theta,\sin \theta]\right\}$ .  This is not the ""circle"" for which we seek the circumference.  That set of points is determined by constant ""radial"" pathlength within the surface.

But it is also one of those problems that keeps me up at night.  I feel like I ""should"" be able to solve it. This is an illustration showing intrinsic ""circles"" on a quadratic surface.

3436254,Collatz Conjecture Numbers up to n,"I was playing around with the Collatz sequences of numbers up to a number. My question was, for which numbers $n$ does no integer below $n$ reach $n$ in its iteration? 
So I wrote a program to find all the ones that have that property and I quickly realized all multiples of 3 do. Obviously, because $3n + 1$ can never be a multiple of 3 and if it's not already a multiple of 3, dividing by 2 obviously won't make it one. However, what I noticed after that is that the rest of the numbers are almost all primes. Only some primes, however, and I'm not sure what the criteria for it is. A small percent of them are also numbers that have some number of prime factors, and as you go up into the higher numbers of course the number of prime factors on average increases. None of these numbers are even for unknown reasons to me that I'm sure I could figure out if I looked hard enough. Consequently, the percent of these numbers that are prime decreases as you go for higher values of $n$ , but remains higher than you'd expect. Of course, there are lots of primes because any number in the list has to be odd, and can't be divisible by 3 because I excluded those because they're trivial. However, my question is, what, if any, are the criteria for any number that satisfies this property (no integer below $n$ reaches $n$ in its iteration)? Besides not being a multiple of 3 I couldn't come up with any solid reasoning. As a bonus, is it really true that all numbers even and not divisible by 3 have some number below it whose sequence includes it? And if so, why?","['collatz-conjecture', 'number-theory']"

Let $e \in G$ be the identity of $G$ . Let $p \in M$ . Let $G_p$ denote the stabiliser subgroup of $G$ , $G_p :=$ $\{g \in G$ $| \alpha(p,g) = \alpha_p(g) = p\}$ , where $\alpha_p$ is the smooth map $\alpha_p: G \to M$ , known as the orbit map, with $\alpha_p(g) = \alpha(p,g)$ . Observe the image of $\alpha_p$ is $\alpha_p(G)= \alpha(p,G)$ , the orbit of $p$ . Observe that $\alpha^{-1}(p) = G_p$ . The continuity of $\alpha$ gives us the following: Since $M$ is a T1 space, since $M$ is a T2 space, we have $G_p$ to be a closed subset of $G$ . It can be shown $G_p$ is a subgroup of $G$ . Since $G_p$ is a closed subgroup of $G$ , it follows by the closed subgroup theorem that $G_p$ is not merely a Lie group that is also a subset of $G$ but an embedded Lie subgroup of $G$ . (Also, you can show something like $\alpha_p$ is equivariant and thus has constant rank and thus $G_p$ is embedded.) For the inclusion map $i: G_p \to G$ , we have its differential at $e$ to be $i_{\{*,e\}}: T_e(G_p) \to T_eG$ , an injective $\mathbb R$ -linear map of $\mathbb R$ -Lie algebras. The image of $i_{\{*,e\}}$ is $i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ , an $\mathbb R$ -vector subspace of $T_eG$ and is isomorphic to $T_e(G_p)$ . Consider the exponential map $\exp: T_eG \to G$ . Since $T_eG$ is an $\mathbb R$ - vector space, $tA \in T_eG$ for all $A \in T_eG$ and for all $t \in \mathbb R$ . Therefore, the expression ' $\exp(tA)$ ' is defined. Question : For all $A \in T_eG$ , is $A \in i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ (or $A \in T_e(G_p)$ under the aforementioned isomorphism) if and only if for each $t \in \mathbb R$ , $\exp(tA) \in G_p$ ? Note: That $\exp(tA) \in G_p$ for each $t \in \mathbb R$ is I think equivalent to that the map $s_p : \mathbb R \to G$ , with $s_p = \exp \circ \hat{A}$ has image as a subset of $G_p$ , where $\hat{A}: \mathbb R \to T_eG$ , $\hat{A}(t) = tA$ . Also, I believe $s_p$ and $\hat{A}$ are smooth maps. It seems like $(\alpha_p \circ \exp)^{-1}p = i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ or something, but I really don't know how to begin proving this. This is supposed to be a lemma in proving that for the fundamental vector field $\xi(A)$ , of $A$ under $\xi: T_eG \to C^{\infty}(M,TM)$ , we have $\xi(A)_p = Z_p$ if and only if $A \in i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ , where $Z_p \in T_pM$ is the zero element of $T_pM$ . Also, I'm aware that $c_p := \alpha_p \circ s_p$ is the integral curve of $\xi(A)$ starting at $p$ . Thanks in advance! My answer : Okay I think I discovered the answer, which is affirmative, and I think I can answer without using, for a second time, the fact that $G_p$ is closed. The 'only if' direction is shown under the naturality of the exponential map, which states that for a Lie group homomorphism $F: G \to B$ , $F \circ \exp_B = \exp_G \circ F_{\{*,e\}}$ , where $\exp_B: T_{e_B} \to B$ and $\exp_G: T_eG \to G$ where $e_B$ is the identity of $B$ . Here, we have ' $F$ ' as $i$ , ' $B$ ' as $G_p$ . For $A \in i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ , let $C = i_{\{*,e\}}^{-1} A \in T_e(G_p)$ . Then $$(F \circ \exp_B)(C) = (i \circ \exp_{G_p})(C) = \exp_{G_p}(C) \in G_p,$$ and $$(F \circ \exp_B)(C) = (\exp_G \circ i_{\{*,e\}})(C) = \exp_G (A).$$ Therefore, $\exp_G (A) \in G_p$ if $A \in i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ . This applies for any $A \in i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ including its multiples $tA \in i_{\{*,e\}}(T_e(G_p))$ , where $tC = t(i_{\{*,e\}}^{-1} A) = i_{\{*,e\}}^{-1} (tA) \in T_e(G_p)$ .

    \mathrm{P} (Y_i = 1) = \sum_{i = k}^{\infty} \mathrm{P} (Y_i = 1 | X_i = k) \mathrm{P} (X_i = k) = \\ = \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} \mathrm{P} (X_1 \neq k, \ldots X_{i - 1} \neq k) \mathrm{P} (X_i = k) = \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} (1 - p_k)^{i - 1} p_k.
$$ Then, since $Z_n = \sum_{i = 1}^n Y_i$ : $$
    \mathrm{E} Z_n = \sum_{i = 1}^n \mathrm{E} Y_i = \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} (1 - p_k)^{i - 1} p_k.
$$ So far so good. I checked my calculations with simulations from Poisson distribution - they agree very closely. Now to variance. Since $Z_n - Z_{n - 1}$ differs at most by one, for function with bounded differences by Efron-Stein inequality we have an estimation on variance: $$
    \mathrm{Var} (Z_n) \leq \frac{n}{4}.

3437002,How many white squares can be surrounded by $n$ black squares?,"The question Square Fencing [combinatorics] was put on hold because what was being asked was unclear. However, some progress had been made, especially by @MikeEarnest, and some very clear questions can be asked about the situation. Here is one such question, together with a rough solution which people might be interested to improve/extend. In the picture below: $4$ black squares surround $1$ white square $7$ black squares surround $3$ white squares. https://i.sstatic.net/4xJDW.jpg Prove that $4n$ black squares can surround at most $2n^2-2n+1$ white squares. Consider an arrangement for which the number of white squares is maximal. Assume the white squares are in solid rows of squares. Let there be $c$ white squares in the longest row and let there be $k+l+1$ rows. In order from top to bottom let the numbers of squares in the top $k+1$ rows be $$a,a+e_1,a+e_1+e_2, ... , a+e_1+e_2+...+e_k=c.$$ In order from bottom to top let the numbers of squares in the bottom $l+1$ rows be $$b,b+f_1,b+f_1+f_2, ... , b+f_1+f_2+...+f_l=c.$$ It would need proving, but it does seem self-evident that each $e_i$ and $f_i$ is non-negative because, if not, we could adjust the arrangement to enclose at least no fewer white squares. Each white square has 4 boundary edges which must join it to either another white square or a black square. The two ends of each row require $2(k+l+1)$ black squares. Now consider, say, the third row which contains $a+e_1+e_2$ squares. Its upper edges will need to be joined to $e_2$ black squares at most two of which could already have been counted at the ends of the second row. Furthermore, if $e_2>2,$ then an extra white square can be put at one or other end of the second row without requiring any extra black squares. In general, we can suppose that all of $a,b,e_i,f_i$ are at most $2$ . The total number of black squares which are required is therefore $$2(k+l+1)+a+b.$$ Without loss of generality suppose that $a+2k\ge b+2l$ . As we have seen, without increasing the number of black squares, the numbers of squares in the rows can be increased (or at least kept the same) to $$a,a+2,a+4, ... , a+2k,a+2k-2, ..., a+2(k-l).$$ Also, as noted earlier we could increase the number of white squares if either $a$ or $b$ was greater than 2. We can therefore suppose $a=b$ is either $1$ or $2$ and so $k=l$ . For $4n$ black squares we now have the type of arrangement noted by @MikeEarnest. $a=b=1$ and $n=k+1$ . The number of white squares is $n^2+(n-1)^2=2n^2-2n+1$ . Extra result For $4n+2$ black squares the same arrangement but with $a=b=2$ and $n=k+1$ has $2n^2$ white squares.","['contest-math', 'combinatorics']"

There exists for all $x \in U \cap V$ an open subscheme $W \subseteq U \cap V$ with $x \in W$ such that it is principal open in $U$ as well as in $V$ . If $A$ is a ring, $f \in A$ , the principal opens are subsets of $Spec(A)$ , of the form $D(f):= Spec(A) \setminus V(f)$ . Proof: Replacing $V$ by a principal open subset of $V$ containing $x$ , if necessary, we assume that $ V \subseteq U$ .  Now choose $f \in \Gamma(U,O_X)$ such that $x \in D(f) \subseteq V$ and let $f|_V$ denote the image of $f$ under the restriction homomorphism $\Gamma(U,O_X) \rightarrow \Gamma(V,O_X)$ . Then $D_U(f) = D_V(f|_V)$ My question is about the last equality and sheaves in general? I assume the last equality $D_U(f) = D_V(f_{|V} )$ is obtained because of our choice of $f \in \Gamma(U,O_X)$ such that $x \in D(f) \subseteq V$ , is this correct? Question: I am a little bit unclear about $D_U(f)$ which relates to prime ideals in $\Gamma(U,O_X)$ and $D_V(f_{|V} )$ , which relates prime ideals in $\Gamma(V,O_X)$ . In general, $\Gamma(U,O_X)$ and $\Gamma(V,O_X)$ are two different rings and $O_X$ from what I understand gives only restriction maps on open subsets, hence how to move a section f from U to $f_{|V}$ in V, but I do not understand what the whole ring is when $O_X$ acts on open sets $U \subset V$ . For instance, are the points in U prime ideals of $Spec \Gamma(U,O_X)$ ? Hence, when we restrict to V, since $x \in D(f) \subseteq V$ , then it means the points in D(f) are in V and hence represent prime ideals in $\Gamma(V,O_X)$ , implying equal $D_V(f_{|V} )$ since the same 'points' D(f) are preserved in V as a topological space?

Let $n$ be a natural number and let $q$ be a positive natural number. Then there exist natural numbers $m$ , $r$ such that $0 \leq r < q$ and $n = mq + r$ . I'm fairly new to proving so I initially got stuck so I looked at the hint which was to fix $q$ and induct on $n$ . And now I currently have the following: Proof. We fix $q$ and use induction on $n$ . We first prove the base case $n=0$ . If we set $m=0$ and $r=0$ then we have $n = 0 \cdot q + 0 = 0$ but $0 \leq 0 < q$ , so we are done with the base case. Now suppose inductively that $n = m \cdot q + r$ for some natural numbers $m$ , $r$ such that $0 \leq r < q$ and $n = mq + r$ . We wish to show that there exist natural numbers $m'$ and $r'$ such that $n+1= m' \cdot  q + r'$ where $0\leq r'< q$ . From the inductive hypothesis we have $n+1 = mq + (r+1)$ . Since $r<q$ , $r+1 \leq q$ that is $r+1 = q$ or $r+1 <q$ . If $r+1 = q$ , we set $m' = m+1$ and $r'=0$ then $m' \cdot q + r' = (m+1) \cdot q + 0$ but $n+1 =(m+1) \cdot q + 0$ , so $n+1 = m' \cdot  q + r'$ and $0\leq r'< q$ . If however $r+1 <q$ then we set $m' = m$ and $r' = r+1$ then we have that $n+1 = m' \cdot  q + r'$ and $0\leq r'< q$ .

3437436,"Good examples of violations to the ""law of sufficiently large intervals""","Tis a common mistake among us mere mortals (laypeople, students, physicists, and the like) to assume that because a function (or sequence) has a certain property over some sufficiently large interval, it must maintain this property as its argument tends to infinity. Some particularly prominent examples are the ""apparent"" asymptote, the ""looks-like"" limit at infinity, and the ""almost"" Cauchy sequence. Well, I was trying to explain why this is not the case when I realised that for every example I could think of, the idea of looking at a ""sufficiently large"" interval did suffice to predict the limiting behaviour of the function. In fact, I've started noticing that even mathematicians will casually use this kind of reasoning when the situation does not require otherwise. The problem is that most ""ordinary"" functions have relatively consistent behaviour over their entire domain. If $f(x)$ is continuous, increasing, $f(x)<3$ for all $x<10,000$ , and $f(10,000)=2.999999978$ , then odds are that $\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=3$ . Of course, there might be some absurdly large value where $f$ starts increasing much faster but unless it's being done intentionally there isn't . This brings me to my question. What are some ""natural"" examples of functions (or classes thereof) that appear to obey the ""law of sufficiently large intervals"" but do not? By ""natural"" I  mean something that might appear in a high-school or undergrad textbook and could plausibly fool a TA if they weren't careful; a definable function whose formula does not immediately spoil the reveal. Obviously, something like... $$f(x)=\frac{x}{10^{21}}-\frac 1x$$ ...won't work because anyone who looks at it more than once will realise that $f(x)$ is only ""small"" when $x<10^{21}$ . I'm looking more for examples where, without further work, it still seems reasonable that the limiting behaviour of the function is predicted by its behaviour over a large interval.","['examples-counterexamples', 'real-analysis', 'calculus', 'limits', 'soft-question']"

I was looking into the sequence of numbers such that $a(1)=1$ and $a(n)$ is the smallest number such that $a(k)n+1$ is not prime for any $k<n$ . After computing this sequence, it appeared to be exactly the odd integers. The absence of even integers interested me, as that suggested that for every even integer $n$ there exists an odd $m<n$ such that $mn+1$ is prime. After checking with Mathematica, this appeared to be true. In fact, this suggested the more general conjecture in the title: For all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ with $n>1$ there exists an $m\in\mathbb{N}$ with $m<n$ such that $mn+1$ is prime.

The book shows a standar(i guess) way to find an energy function, so I tried to emulate it as follows, We amplify $\ddot x = -\mu \dot x - sin(x)$ by $\dot x$ and we get $\ddot x \dot x= -\mu \dot x^{2} - sin(x)\dot x$ which can be writen as $\frac{d}{dt} \frac{{\dot x}^{2}}{2} = -\mu \dot x^{2} - sin(x)\dot x  $ . Now we will call $- \dot U(x)=-\mu \dot x - sin(x)$ , then, $\frac{d}{dt} \frac{{\dot x}^{2}}{2} = -\dot U(x) \dot x$ which leads us to $\frac{d}{dt} (\frac{{\dot x}^{2}}{2} + U(x))=0$ . And this should represent the derivative of the energy function of the double pendulum.

Do you know any other proof? 1: $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is a cyclic group for multiplication. The order is $p-1$ . Thus, by using the generator, $g$ , and Fermat's little theorem, we get $\prod_{i=1}^{p-1}i=g^{0+1+...+p-1}\equiv g^{p(p-1)/2}\equiv g^{(p-1)/2}\equiv-1$ . 2: From Fermat's little theorem and factor theorem, $(x-1)...(x-p+1)=x^{p-1}-1 \bmod p$ is satisfied for any $x\in\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ . By comparing the constant term, we get Wilson's theorem. 3: Since $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is group for multiplication, for any $a\in\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ except $a=1,p-1$ , we can make a pair $(a,a^{-1})$ s.t. $a \not\equiv a^{-1}\in\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ . Thus, we get Wilson's theorem. 4: Using $a(p-a)\equiv -a^2\bmod p$ , we get $\prod_{i=1}^{p-1}i\equiv\prod_{i=1}^{(p-1)/2}(-i^2)$ . From Euler's criterion and factor theorem, for any $x\in\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ , $\prod_{i=1}^{(p-1)/2}(x-i^2)\equiv x^{(p-1)/2}-1$ is satisfied. Thus, by comparing constant term, we get Wilson's theorem. 5: Consider $p$ vertices placed on a circle at regular intervals. Then the number of ways to make a Hamilton cycle is $(p-1)!$ . The number of graphs which does not change even if we rotate it by $2\pi/p$ is $p-1$ . Thus, the number of graphs which will change by rotating $2\pi/p$ is $(p-1)!-(p-1)$ . If we collect graphs which will match each other by rotating $(2\pi/p)\mathbb{Z}$ from this $(p-1)!-(p-1)$ graphs, the size of the set is $p$ . Thus we get $(p-1)!-(p-1)\equiv0\bmod p$ .

I suspect the answer to the above question is 'yes' because the answer in this post seems to suggest so. However, I am stuck.","['functional-analysis', 'weak-topology']"
