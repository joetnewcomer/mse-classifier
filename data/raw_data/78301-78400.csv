1000535,$\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}3ax^3$ not equal to $9x^2$?,"Okay, so I'm doing some Khan Academy stuff and they ask me to take $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}$ of this function: $f(x)=3ax^3+ax^2$ where $f''(0.5)=3$. They say that the derivative of $f(x)$ is $9ax^2 + 2ax$. This doesn't make sense to me though. The constant rule states that $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}(cf)=cf'$.
The product rule states that $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}(fg)=fg'+f'g$. $3$ is a constant.  $a$ is not.  $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}(x^3)=3x^2$. So $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}(3ax^3)=3\cdot\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}(a)\cdot\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}(x^3)=3\cdot 1\cdot\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}(x^3)$, where $3$ is a constant and $x^3$ is not. $3\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}(x^3)=3\cdot3x^2=9x^2$. Khan Academy says that $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}(3ax^3+ax^2)=9ax^2+2ax$.  Why all the $a$'s? So where am I going wrong?  Is $3$ a constant of $a$, and so when you take the derivative of $3a$ (which is $3$) and multiply it by $x^3$ you need to use the product rule? Or do you do $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}(3)\cdot\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}(ax^3)$? $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}(ax^3)$ with the product rule? Moreover, they say that $f''(0.5)=18a(0.5)+2a$. Where did the $x$ go?  If $x=0.5$ then $2ax$ should be equal to $a\cdot 2\cdot 0.5=a$. I'll copy the entire problem down for you below. If $f(x)=3ax^3+ax^2$ and $f′′(0.5)=3$, then what is the value of $a$? a. $3/11$, b. $1/4$, c. $3/7$, d. $1/2$, e. None of the above We need to find the second derivative of the function $3ax^3+ax^2$.  The power rule is given by $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm{d}x}(x^n)=nx^{n−1}$.  Using the power rule, we find the first derivative of $f(x)$. $f'(x)=9ax^2+2ax$ Using the power rule again, we find the second derivative of $f(x)$. $f''(x)=18ax+2a$ Finally, since we know that $f′′(0.5)=3$, we set $x=0.5$ and solve for $a$. $f''(0.5)=18a(0.5)+2a$ $3=11a$ $a=3/11$","['calculus', 'derivatives']"

$$\int_0^{\sqrt{2}/2}\frac{\arcsin(x)}{x} \ dx$$ that is pretty straightforward by variable change combined with the integration by parts.

  $\infty$, such that the weights $a_{n,m,k}$ of the points $(n,m,k)$ of

  $\gamma$ doesn't stay inside any ball, and such that

1000905,Equivalent conditions of a Galois extension (Exercise VI.4 in Lang's Algebra),"let $k$ be a field of characteristic $\neq 2$. Let $c\in k, c\notin k^2$. Let $F=k(\sqrt{c})$ . Let $\alpha=a+b\sqrt{c}$ with $a,b\in k$ not both $a,b=0$. Let $E=F(\sqrt{\alpha})$. Prove that the following are equivalent : $E$ is Galois over $k$. $E=F(\sqrt{\alpha'})$ where $\alpha'=a-b\sqrt{c}$. Either $\alpha\alpha'\in k^2$ or $c\alpha \alpha'\in k^2$. Show that when these conditions are satisfied, then $E$ is cyclic over $k$ of degree $4$ iff $c\alpha\alpha'\in k^2$. What i have tried so far is : $E=F(\sqrt{a+b\sqrt{c}})=k(\sqrt{c},\sqrt{a+b\sqrt{c}})=k(\sqrt{a+b\sqrt{c}})$ As $\sqrt{a-b\sqrt{c}}$ is another root  of minimal polynomial of $\sqrt{a+b\sqrt{c}}$ and as $E/k$ is galois we see that $E=F(\sqrt{a-b\sqrt{c}})$ (adjoining any root should give same extension).. So,  first statement implies second.. Suppose $\alpha\alpha'\in k^2$ i.e., $a^2-b^2c\in k^2$ then i can write $\sqrt{a+b\sqrt{c}}=\sqrt{m}+\sqrt{n}$ with $m,n\in k$. To be precise, $m=\frac{1}{2}(a+\sqrt{a^2-b^2c})$ and $n=\frac{1}{2}(a-\sqrt{a^2-b^2c})$ Then i have $E=k(\sqrt{a+b\sqrt{c}})=k(\sqrt{m}+\sqrt{n})=k(\sqrt{m},\sqrt{n})$ We have a result that says $k(\sqrt{m},\sqrt{n})$ is of degree $4$ if $mn $
 is not a square in $k$.. In this case we have $mn=c$ which is not a square in $k$ so $E$ is of degree $4$ over $k$... More over i can see in this case we have galois group to be $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$. So,  i have proved that if $c\alpha\alpha'\notin k^2$ then Galois group is not cyclic..  As there are only two possible groups of order $4$ i have prove that $E$ is cyclic over $k$ of degree $4$ iff $c\alpha\alpha'\in k^2$.

1000916,Archimedes trisection of equilateral triangle?,"Equilateral triangle paradox Consider triangle  ABC: Each side is trisected - AE, FC, GB each = 1/3 of their sides. First we established that triangle HIJ was equilateral. This was accomplished rather simply by establishing ACE=CBF=BAG via SAS; then the smaller triangles FCH=EIA=GJB via ASA. Using the vertical angle rule, we can establish that HIJ is equilateral. The second challenge was to show that area of triangle HIJ = 1/7 the area of triangle ABC. While I would have liked to do this strictly through proof, I gave up like the rest of our group and resorted to establishing arbitrary coordinates (i.e. A = (0,0); B = (6,0)), to calculate the areas of each congruent triangle AJB, BHC, and CIA. These came to equal 2/7 each. Multiplied by three of them = 6/7, leaving 1/7 remaining area for HIJ. I was disappointed that we had to resort to this method. I would prefer a generalized geometric proof. If anyone could illuminate a path for that if it is possible, that would be great. Once again utilizing arbitrary values given to the triangle, I also used the law of cosines to determine measure of AG (and therefore CE,BF). From here, standard stuff with law of sines to determine angles of triangle AGB (and their congruent buddies). Same fashion for AIE and the congruent triangles there. Thus area of HIJ = area ABC - area 3AGB - area 3AIE. Ta da! 1/7 (or suuuuper really close) Geometry says that with GB being 1/3 of CB, GAB cannot be exactly 1/3 of CAB.(it actually works out to approx. 19.11 degrees using the methods I describe above - any rays trisecting a vertex of an equilateral triangle going through trisection points of opposite sides create approx. 19.11/21.78\19.11 set of angles at each vertex) Also, we know this because trisection of an angle can only create three equal distances along the arc of the circle made from a radius AB. But,the strange thing is that looking at just straight edge and compass Archimedes method of proving 1/3 of an angle which determines that IAE should be 20 degrees almost appeared to work. I applied this method to my triangle ABC by using a compass to measure length AI. Pivoting about point I, the arc intersects AB and here I mark origin O. From origin O, I add a line parallel to AC that intersects AB at origin point O. I then followed Archimedes method as shown here: http://mathschallenge.net/library/constructions/trisecting_angle At first, I thought I had found some paradox! It seemed true! The angle was trisected by compass, straight edge and a little basic algebra. Please explain where this is incorrect.",['geometry']

I've already found that the stereographic parametrization of $S^2-\{(0,0,1)\}$ is given by: $$(x,y) \mapsto (\dfrac{2x}{1+x^2+y^2},\dfrac{2y}{1+x^2+y^2},\dfrac{x^2+y^2-1}{1+x^2+y^2})$$ Normally, if I want to find a basis for $T_p(M)$, I can find $\dfrac{\partial{\varphi} }{\partial x}$ and $\dfrac{\partial{\varphi} }{\partial y}$ and then consider the plane that is spanned by $<\dfrac{\partial{\varphi} }{\partial x},\dfrac{\partial{\varphi} }{\partial y}>$ at each point $p$. I've already found these two vectors to be: $$\dfrac{\partial{\varphi} }{\partial x}=<\dfrac{2(1-x^2+y^2)}{(1+x^2+y^2)^2}, \dfrac{-4xy}{(1+x^2+y^2)^2}, \dfrac{4x}{(1+x^2+y^2)^2}>$$ $$\dfrac{\partial{\varphi} }{\partial y}=<\dfrac{-4xy}{(1+x^2+y^2)^2}, \dfrac{2(1+x^2-y^2)}{(1+x^2+y^2)^2}, \dfrac{4y}{(1+x^2+y^2)^2}>$$ The vectors are orthogonal at all points and therefore create a basis for $T_p(M)$. The problem is that calculation with this basis looks very very hard, almost impossible to be done by hand. Now the exercise asks me to show that the surface element on $M$, i.e. $dS$ is given by the differential form $\omega = x \space dy \wedge dz + y \space dz \wedge dx + z \space dx \wedge dy $. Apparently, the surface element on $M$ at the point $p$ should be given by $\|\dfrac{\partial{\varphi} }{\partial x} \times \dfrac{\partial{\varphi} }{\partial y} \|_p $. So I should show that when we input $<\dfrac{\partial{\varphi} }{\partial x},\dfrac{\partial{\varphi} }{\partial y}>$ into $w$ it gives the same result. Am I right? But how can we do that?

Suppose that $\bf x$ is orthogonal, that is, $F = \langle {\bf x}_u,{\bf x}_v\rangle = 0$. Let $\nabla$ be the Levi-Civita connection on $M$. I have checked that $E_1 = \frac{{\bf x}_u}{\sqrt{E}}$ and $E_2 = \frac{{\bf x}_v}{\sqrt{G}}$ is an orthonormal frame on ${\bf x}(U)$, and that its dual forms are $\theta_1 = \sqrt{E} \ {\rm d}u$ and $\theta_2 = \sqrt{G} \ {\rm d}v$ (here, ${\rm d}u$ is dual to ${\bf x}_u$ and ${\rm d}v$ is dual to ${\bf x}_v$). Also, I computed the connection form $$\omega_{12} = -\frac{(\sqrt{E})_v}{\sqrt{G}} \ {\rm d}u + \frac{(\sqrt{G})_u}{\sqrt{E}} \ {\rm d}v.$$ Then, the exercise asks to check that: $$\omega_{12}({\bf x}_v) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{E}G}\langle  \nabla_{{\bf x}_u}{\bf x}_v, {\bf x}_v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{E}G}\langle  \nabla_{{\bf x}_v}{\bf x}_u, {\bf x}_v\rangle \quad \mbox{and} \\ \omega_{12}({\bf x}_u) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{E}G}\langle  \nabla_{{\bf x}_v}{\bf x}_u, {\bf x}_u\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{E}G}\langle  \nabla_{{\bf x}_u}{\bf x}_v, {\bf x}_u\rangle.$$ I'm not sure this is right. I think that there's a typo, and should be $\sqrt{EG}$ instead of $\sqrt{E}G$ everywhere above. I'll show what I have done in this part: We have $\omega_{12}({\bf x}_v) = \frac{(\sqrt{G})_u}{\sqrt{E}}$. Then: $$\frac{\partial}{\partial u}\sqrt{G} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{G}}\frac{\partial}{\partial u}\langle {\bf x}_v, {\bf x}_v\rangle = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{G}} 2\langle \nabla_{{\bf x}_u}{\bf x}_v,{\bf x}_v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{G}}\langle \nabla_{{\bf x}_u}{\bf x}_v,{\bf x}_v\rangle.$$
This way, $\omega_{12}({\bf x}_v) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{EG}}\langle  \nabla_{{\bf x}_u}{\bf x}_v, {\bf x}_v\rangle$ instead of what the question said. And $\omega_{12}({\bf x}_u)$ is analogous.

1001878,A finite alternative to Hilbert's Hotel?,"Here, I propose a finite alternative to Hilbert's hotel as the intuition for logically developing Dedekind's definition of infinite. I would like to know if this analogy entirely justifies the given formalism. If not, can anyone suggest changes? A walk through a finite village Suppose you start at any house in this finite village, and set out on a walk through the village, going from one house to another. Suppose further that, after you set out, you do not go to any house in the village (including your starting point) more than once . And after you set out, you also do not stop unless you return to your starting point.  You may or may not go to every house in the village. Intuitively, you could not avoid returning to your starting point under these conditions.  You could, of course, return to your starting point without first going to every other house in the village. If you kept going, however, you would eventually run out of different places to go, and you would have to return to your starting point. Going anywhere else would be going there more than once. This would be true of any finite village. (It would not be true of any infinite village.) How can we describe such paths mathematically? We can let $S$ be the set of houses in the village. Every path as described above can be represented (up to and including the point of return) by an injective function $f: S\to S$. If you are at house $x$, then the next house on your walk would be uniquely given by $f(x)$. Why an injective function? To ensure that you visit each house no more than once, $f$ must be injective, i.e. if $f(x) = f(y)$, then $x = y$. Suppose we let $x_0$ be the house that is your starting point. Since you must eventually return to $x_0$, there must exist a house $x_n$ such that $f(x_n) = x_0$, i.e. $x_n$ would be last house you visited before returning to your starting point $x_0$. A set $S$ can then be said to finite if and only if $\forall x_0, f:[x_0 \in S \land f:S\to S\implies [Injective(f) \implies \exists x_n \in S: f(x_n)=x_0]$ This can be shown to be equivalent to Dedekind's definition of finite, with it's negation being the definition of infinite.","['elementary-set-theory', 'soft-question']"

Consider for example (with $m=4$)
$$w=g_{1}g_{2}^{-1}g_{2}g_{1}^{-1}=
(g_{1}(g_{2}^{-1}g_{2})g_{1}^{-1}).$$
Likewise,
for any fixed sequence of $m$ correctly matched parentheses, we can find $(2n)^{m/2}$ distinct words that reduce to $e$ associated to the sequence of parentheses,

$$()(())\to(h_1h_1^{-1})(h_2(h_3h_3^{-1})h_2^{-1}),$$

I am having a hard time understanding part of the Riesz Representation Theorem The Theorem states : Every open set $E$ satisfies $$\mu(E)=sup\,\{\mu(K):K\subset E,\,K\,\,\text{compact}\}\,\,\,\,\,\,(3)$$ (Note: Here $\mu$ is a positive measure, $\Lambda$ is a positive linear functional and $\mathfrak M_F$ is the class of all $E\subset X$ that satisfies $(3)$ and $\mu(E)<\infty$ .) Hence $\mathfrak M_F$ contains every open set $V$ with $\mu(V)<\infty$ The proof goes as : Let $\alpha$ be a real such that $\alpha<\mu(V)$ . There exists $f\prec V$ with $\alpha<\Lambda f$ . If $W$ is any open set which contains the support $K$ of $f$ , then $f\prec W$ , hence $\Lambda f\leq\mu(W)$ . Thus $\Lambda f\leq \mu(K)$ . This exhibits a compact $K\subset V$ with $\alpha<\mu(K)$ , so that $(3)$ holds for $V$ . Here is what I understand along with what I don't : $\alpha<\mu(V)$ is clear since $\mu(V)$ is a positive measure. I am not sure whether there exists an $f\prec V$ with $\alpha<\Lambda f$ . I think that the reasoning comes from the definition that $$\mu(V)=\sup\{\Lambda f:f\prec V\}$$ where $V$ is any open set in $X$ . Here the $f\prec V$ with $\alpha<\Lambda f$ would be the supremum. However, I am not sure if that is true. The fact that if $W$ is any open set which contains the support $K$ of $f\Rightarrow f\prec W\Rightarrow \Lambda f\leq \mu(W)$ is clear. However, I don't understand why this implies that $\Lambda f\leq\mu(K)$ . Nor do I understand how $K\subset V$ . Lastly, I don't think that I understand why the fact that $K\subset V$ and $\alpha<\mu (K)$ implies that $V$ satisfies $(3)$ . Wouldn't $\Lambda f\leq \mu (W)\Rightarrow\Lambda f\leq \mu (K)$ make sense only if $W\subset K$ ? But that is not the case since $K\subset W$ ...
Also, how was the connection between $V$ and $K$ made, i.e. $K\subset V$ ? What is the connection between $W$ and $V$ ? And lastly why does $K\subset V$ and $\alpha<\mu (K)$ implies that $V$ satisfies $(3)$ ? Any advice or hints would be appreciated.

1001941,Questions about tangent and cotangent bundle on schemes,"In differential geometry, for a smooth manifold $M$ we have the definition of the tangent bundle and the cotangent bundle and then $k$-forms  are defined to be (smooth) sections of the $k$-exterior power of the latter. In algebraic geometry, say $X$ is the affine space $\mathbb{A}_k^n=\operatorname{Spec}(k[x_1,\ldots,x_n])$, we can talk about the Zariski tangent space at a point $x$ which is by definition $T_xX=(\mathfrak{m}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^2)^*$ ($\mathfrak{m}_x$ is the maximal ideal $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$). I have read that this definition is not the best one unless the point $x$ is $k$-rational point. For other points there exists the concept of relative tangent space (see for example https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~blnli/buildings/bag.pd , page 151). 1) My first question is:
 Is there exists the notion of tangent bundle on $X$ as a sheaf? Comming back to differential geometry, I have read on the wikipedia a nice definition of the cotangent bundle: let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\mathcal{I}$ be the sheaf of  of germs of smooth functions on M×M which vanish on the diagonal $\Delta(M)\subseteq M\times M$, and define the contangent bundle $T^*M$ as the sheaf $\Delta^*(\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2)$ (where $\Delta:M\rightarrow M\times M$ is the diagonal map). This makes me suspect that a possible definition of the contangent space on a separated scheme $X$ over a field $k$ will be the same. 2) So my second question is: is this definition of cotangent bundle correct in algebraic geometry?. 3) (More urgent) I make these questions because while reading a paper I found this part: ""Let $h:Y\rightarrow X=\operatorname{Spec}(k[x_1,\ldots,x_n])$ be a morphism of integral schemes and consider the divisor of $h^*(dx_1\wedge\ldots\wedge dx_n)$ ... "". I would appreciate a lot if you help me to interpret this part. What is exactly $dx_1\wedge\ldots \wedge dx_n$?, why can we obtain a divisor from $h^*(dx_1\wedge\ldots\wedge dx_n)$?.

If I denote the varieties as $V_1=V(xy)$ and $V_2=V(x^2-x)$, then $V_1$ is the coordinate axes, and $V_2$ is the disjoint of the vertical lines $x=0$ and $x=1$. I suspect these curves are not isomorphic since the axes cross each other at the origin. I know two algebraic varieties $V_1$ and $V_2$ are isomorphic if we have inverse regular maps $\varphi:V_1\to V_2$ and $\psi:V_2\to V_1$.

1002159,Problems on the Cardinality of the Sets,"Problem 1 For any set $A$ , let $B^A$ be the set of all functions mapping $A$ into the set $B=\{0,1\}$ . Show that $\left \lvert B^A \right \rvert=\left \lvert\mathscr {P}(A)\right \rvert$ where $\left\lvert S \right \rvert$ means the cardinality of $S$ , for any set $S$ and $\mathscr {P}(A)$ denotes the Power Set of $A$ . Problem 2 Show that (using the same notation as the above problem) $\mathscr {P}(A)$ has too many elements to be put in an one to one correspondence with $A$ . Explain why this intuitively means that there are an infinite number of infinite cardinal numbers. Is the set of everything a logically acceptable concept? Why or why not? I have only proved the problems for finite $\left \lvert A \right \rvert$ . For a proof of Problem 1 when $\left \lvert A \right \rvert$ is finite, we note that for each element $a \in A$ there are only two choices from the set $B$ . Hence the total number of such functions will be $2^\left \lvert A \right \rvert=\left \lvert \mathscr {P}(A) \right \rvert$ . But if $\left \lvert A \right \rvert$ is not finite then I don't know how to proceed because the argument that has been given for finite $\left \lvert A \right \rvert$ may not apply to the non-finite $\left \lvert A \right \rvert$ . Similar problem is with Problem 2. For the first part if $\left \lvert A \right \rvert$ is finite then we note that for a bijection to exist between $A$ and $\mathscr P(A)$ then $\left \lvert \mathscr {P}(A) \right \rvert$ must be equal to $\left \lvert A \right \rvert$ . But since for finite $\left \lvert A \right \rvert$ , it is an integer and for all $\left \lvert A \right \rvert \geq1$ we have $\left \lvert A \right \rvert<2^{\left \lvert A \right \rvert}$ , we conclude that for finite $\left \lvert A \right \rvert$ there cannot exist a bijection between $A$ and $\mathscr P(A)$ . But here again the problem is when $\left \lvert A \right \rvert$ is non-finite. For third part of Problem 2, is the answer simply is that since everything is not a well-defined concept, the set of everything is not a logically acceptable concept, or is there some more subtle reasoning?
