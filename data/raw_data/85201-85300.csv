1122095,Algebraic values of the sine function,"First question: For which angles $x$ is $\sin(x)$ a real number that can be expressed using only integers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and the extraction of $n$th roots? (With ""$n$th roots"" meaning real-valued $n$th roots of positive numbers). Let $A$ be the set of numbers in $[-1; 1]$ expressible in this way. Unfortunately there is a lot of confusing information about this topic floating around. For example, in this question , the accepted answer claims: But it is known, for example, that there is no expression for $\sin(\pi/9)$ that starts from the integers, and uses only the ordinary operations of arithmetic and roots in which every component is real. This seems to be false. The trigonometric formula $\cos(3x) = 4 \cos^3(x) - 3\cos(x)$ should yield the value of $cos(20^\circ)$ as the solution of a cubic equation. At other places there are claims that the $n$th cyclotomic polynomial has an abelian Galois-group and is therefore solvable. Does this imply that $\sin(2\pi/n)$ is in $A$ for every positive integer $n$? (Sorry if this is a stupid question, I don't understand algebra.) If so, $\sin(\pi x)$ would also be in $A$ for every rational $x$ (and $\sin(\pi x)$ not in $A$ would imply that $x$ must be irrational). If this is true, I have a second question: Does the inverse also hold? Is every number in $A$ of the form $\sin(\pi x)$ for a rational $x$?","['trigonometry', 'algebra-precalculus', 'abstract-algebra']"

If the first occurrence of heads is on the $n$th toss, you are paid $2^{n−1}$. So for instance, if heads appears on the first toss, you are paid 1 dollar; if heads appears for the first time on the second toss, you are paid 2 dollars, and so on. Say the cost of entering the lottery is 10 dollars and I start with 100 dollars. I'll play the lottery again and again until I have more than 10 dollars to play the game. Now my question is, what is the probability that I can go on playing the game? Example: Say during the first game, I get a heads on the first toss then I'll be left with 91(=100-10+1) dollars. I'll play the game again by paying 10 dollars and this time I may get a heads on the 7 toss and now I'll have 145(=91-10+64) dollars and so on.

1122134,Adjoints of operators between different Hilbert spaces.,"When we have an operator $$
  T ~\colon \mathscr{H} \longrightarrow \mathscr{H}
$$ from a Hilbert space to itself, we can use the Riesz representation theorem to prove the existence of the adjoint map $T^*$ with the property $$ 
  \langle Tx, y \rangle 
    = 
  \langle x, T^* y\rangle 
    \quad 
  \forall x, y \in \mathscr{H}
$$ However, if we instead have an operator $$
  S ~\colon \mathscr{H_1} \longrightarrow \mathscr{H}_2
$$ between two different Hilbert spaces $\mathscr{H}_1$ and $ \mathscr{H}_2$, it is often sensible to talk about the map $S^*$ with the property $$
  \langle Sx, y \rangle_{\mathscr{H}_2}
    =
  \langle x, S^* y \rangle_{\mathscr{H}_1}
    \quad
  \forall x \in \mathscr{H}_1, y \in \mathscr{H}_2
$$
In this case, it appears to me that we cannot use the Riesz representation theorem to prove the existence of $S^*$. This leads me to ask a few questions: Questions: What hypotheses do we need for the operator $S^*$ to exist? How would we go about proving this existence? Where can I read about adjoints in this more general scenario?","['operator-theory', 'reference-request', 'real-analysis', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

Does there exist $n$ points, such that the lines determined by the $n$ points cover all the points in $S$? One can formulate this as an algebra problem. We consider variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_n$, so $(x_i,y_i)$ would be the position of the $i$th point. To detect if any line determined by the points covers $(a_k,b_k)\in S$, it requires the following polynomial $$ P_k(x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_n) = \prod_{i\neq j} \left|\begin{pmatrix} 1 & x_i & y_i \\ 1 & x_j & y_j \\ 1 & a_k & b_k \\ \end{pmatrix} \right| = 0$$.

However, there are always degenerate solutions because there can be two points $(x_i,y_i)=(x_j,y_j)$. So we need that $(x_i,y_i)\neq (x_j,y_j)$ for all $j\neq i$. This can be encoded as another polynomial. $Q_{i,j}(x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_n) = (x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2$. $Q = \prod_{i\neq j} Q_{i,j}$. Thus now we want to know if the polynomial $P+Q$ has any $0$s. Then I'm stuck. I think there must be some algebra tool that I don't know of.

1122931,Showing that stereographic projection is a homeomorphism,"For any $n\geq 0$ , the unit $n$ -sphere is the space $S^{n}\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ defined by $$

\left\{ (x_{1}, \dots, x_{n+1})
\;\middle\vert\; 
\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} x_{i}^{2} = 1 \right\}
$$ with the subspace topology. The point $P = (0, \dots, 0, 1)$ in $S^{n}$ called the north pole. Then we have the following conclusion: $\qquad\qquad\qquad$ For any $n\geq 0$ , $S^{n}$ with the north pole removed is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ . $\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad$ From FIGURE 1-1 ,we define a map $$
f: S^{n} \setminus \{P\} \to \mathbb{R}^{n}, 
\quad x \mapsto \frac{1}{1-x_{n+1}} \cdot (x_1, \cdots , x_n).
$$ (This map is called stereographic projection .) It can be described geometrically as follows: Given a point $x = (x_{1}, \dots, x_{n+1}) \in S^{n} \setminus \{P\}$ , stereographic projection sets $f(x) = y$ , where $(y, 0)$ is the point where the line through $P$ and $x$ meets the subspace $\mathbb{R}^{n} \times \{0\}$ at $u = (y,0) = (y_{1}, \dots, y_{n}, y_{n+1})$ .

\left\{\begin{matrix}
u = \lambda x+(1-\lambda )P \\ 
y_{n+1} = 0
\end{matrix}\right. 
\quad(\lambda \in\mathbb{R}) \Longrightarrow 
\lambda = \frac{1}{1-{x}_{n+1}}.
$$ So the analytical expression of the stereographic projection is $$
f(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n+1}) 
= \left( \frac{x_{1}}{1-{x}_{n+1}}, \dots, \frac{x_{n}}{1-{x}_{n+1}} \right) \in \mathbb{R}^{n}.

Further, I need some rigorous proofs that $f: S^{n} \setminus \{P\} \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a homeomorphism. (We must strictly demonstrate that $f$ is injective, surjective, and continuous.) Another question: I know the analytical expression of the inverse $f^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^{n} \to S^{n} \setminus \{P\}$ is $$
f^{-1} (y_1, \dots, y_n) 
= \frac{1}{\|y\|^2 + 1}(2y_1, \dots, 2y_n, \|y\|^2 - 1), 
\quad \text{where } \|y\|^2 = y_1^2 + \dots + y_n^2.

1123149,Why do we require that a complex manifold has the structure of a real manifold?,"I am taking a course in complex manifolds, heavily influenced by Huybrechts' book ""Complex Geometry"", and in it we define a complex manifold $X$ to be a smooth, real manifold $M$ together with an equivalence class of holomorphic charts. As far as I can see, there is no compatibility condition on the two atlases. My question is: Why do we do this? Is this definition useful? Since holomorphic functions are smooth when considered as real functions, any complex atlas should define a real atlas, so assuming that the manifold already has a real atlas seems superfluous. I suppose this means that as a topological space the manifold is Hausdorff and second-countable, but to me it would seem nicer to just define a complex manifold as such a topological space with a holomorphic atlas. This is the approach taken in a Riemann surfaces course I have attended previously, and just after the definition in his book, Huybrechts mentions that we could use this approach to define complex manifolds. It seems then that the definition as given must have been, at least to him, somehow preferable. Moreover, I know that in the real case there are topological spaces that have several different smooth structures ($S^7$ is such an example) so if we don't assume that the complex and real atlases are compatible, I'm not sure how we could use real atlas to do anything useful since there is not in general a single choice of real atlas for each complex manifold.

In the book He also writes that it is the classical problem to provide restrictions to definitions such that it follow these two criteria. (You can find more details in the book .. - Google Books..)

definition in a theory if and only if $C$ is of the form $H \Longrightarrow [O(v_1, v_2, ... , v_n)=w \Longleftrightarrow S]$ .and the following restrictions are satisfied: (i) the variable $w$ is not free
in $H$, (ii) the variables $v_1, v_2,... , v_n, w$ are distinct, (iii) $S$ has no free
variables other than $v_1, v_2, ... , v_n, w$, (iv) $S$ and $H$ are formulas in which
the only non-logical constants are primitive symbols and previously defined
symbols of the theory, and (v) the formula $H \Longrightarrow (\exists!w)S$ is derivable from
the. axioms and preceding definitions of the theory. Here The reason behind last four restrictions are well explained in the book, though not directly.

It is easy to show to that ${\{{a_n}^2}\}$ converges if ${\{a_n}\}$ converges: ${\{a_n}\}$ is convergent sequence and ${\{a_n}\}$ also, since product of two convergent sequences converges (to the product of their limit), so ${\{{a_n}^2}\}={\{a_n\times a_n}\}$ converges; and it doesn't require that ${\{a_n}\}$ to be monotone.

1123421,Parametric equations for hypocycloid and epicycloid,"Suppose that the small circle rolls inside the larger circle and that the point $P$ we follow lies on the circumference of the small circle. If the initial configuration is such that $P$ is at $(a,0)$, find parametric equations for the curve traced by $P$, using angle $t$ from the positive $x$-axis to the center $B$ of the moving circle. The resulting curve is called a hypocycloid . The following is the solution from  the text. The center of the moving circle is at $(a-b)$$(\cos(t),\sin(t))$. Notice that as the moving circle rolls so that its center moves counterclockwise it is turning clockwise relative to its center. When the small circle has traveled completely around the large circle it has rolled over a length of $2\pi(a)$. Its circumference is $2\pi b$ so if it were rolling along a straight line it would have revolved $a/b$ times. So far I understand the story. However, The problem is that it is rolling around in a circle and so it has lost a rotation each time the center has traveled completely around. In other words the smaller wheel is turning at a rate of $((a/b)-1)t$$=$$(a-b)t/b$. I don't understand the preceding sentences. Why does it mean that it loses a rotation each time the center has traveled completely around and why is that so? Also, I don't see how this brings the final equation. Moreover, how is the rate of the smaller wheel turning translated as the angle of $P$? The position of $P$ relative to the center of the moving circle is $$b(\cos(-\frac{(a-b)t}{b}),\sin(-\frac{(a-b)t}{b}))=b(\cos(\frac{(a-b)t}{b}),-\sin(\frac{(a-b)t}{b}))$$. Also, why is the rate multiplied my $-$, the negative sign, in this equation? On the other hand, now suppose that the small circle rolls on the outside of the larger circle. Derive a set of parametric equations for the resulting curve in this case. Such a curve is called an epicycloid . In this case, the moving circle now gains one revolution each time around the fixed circle and so turns at a rate of $((a/b)+1)t=(a+b)t/b$. I think this is pretty much the same story, however, likewise, I don't understand the part where it gains a revolution, and how that rate of turning represents the angle. Would anyone carefully explain the questions to me? I'm really confused and I'd appreciate some help.","['geometry', 'plane-curves']"

The question is: Should the player still change his decision after one of the doors was revealed? I'm having trouble with this problem, since I don't really know how to interpret the probabilities given at the start of the game. Since door 1 is more likely than the others to have the prize, it seems logical that after one of the doors was revealed the probability of door 1 having the prize should increase, but I cannot explain this probabilistically.

$$\frac{q^4}{2 p^4}+\frac{q^2}{2 p^2}-\frac{q\sqrt{4 p^2+q^2}}{2 p^2}+\frac{q^3\sqrt{4 p^2+q^2}}{2 p^4}-2=p$$
If $4p^2+q^2$ is not a perfect square, then $p=\pm q$ or $q=0$. Wolframalpha sledgehammering both cases (it is only necessary to check one case, since the other one corresponds to inverting  the sign of $t$), we see that that  all solutions yield rational $p,q$. Going back to the original problem, we can forget those solutions since we wanted $0<5\alpha<90$ Second update: Substituting $2t=a/b$ with coprime $a,b$, we see that we have to minimize $x+y+z$ subject to $x,y,z$ being integers and $2\cos18<a/b<2$. Therefore, we want to minimize:
$$k\left(\left(\frac ab\right)^5+\left(\frac ab\right)^4-4\left(\frac ab\right)^3-3\left(\frac ab\right)^2+3\left(\frac ab\right)+2\right)$$
It is easy to see that when reducing to the common denominator $b^5$. the numerator will be coprime due to the leading coefficint being $1$. Therefore, $k$ must be $b^5$ in order to have integers(and not another multiple of $b^5$ since we want to minimize the perimeter). So the problem is reduced to: Minimize $$a^5+a^4b-4a^3b^2-3a^2b^3+3ab^4+2b^5$$

1123883,Understanding a proof from Conway: showing existence of idempotents using functional calculus,"I am studying the spectral theory of operators on Banach and Hilbert spaces, making use of Conway's A Course in Functional Analysis. In section VII.4, Conway states Proposition 4.11 as a consequence of the spectral mapping theorem. I am having trouble understanding a crucial step in this argument. I have summarized Conway's proof below. Proposition 4.11 Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a Banach algebra with identity. Suppose that $a \in \mathcal{A}$ with $\sigma(a) = F_1 \cup F_2$, where $F_1,F_2$ are disjoint, non-empty closed subsets of $\mathbb{C}$. Then there exists a nontrivial idempotent $e \in \mathcal{A}$ such that (i) If $b \in \mathcal{A}$ commutes with $a$, then $b$ commutes with $e$. (ii) If $a_1 = ae$ and $a_2 = a(1-e)$, then $a = a_1 + a_2$ and $a_1a_2 = a_2a_1 = 0$. (iii) $\sigma(a_1) = F_1 \cup \{0\}$, $\sigma(a_2) = F_2 \cup \{0\}$. This theorem is achieved by the following argument, with utilizes the Riesz functional calculus. We let $G_1, G_2$ be disjoint open subsets of $\mathbb{C}$ such that $G_1 \supset F_1, G_2 \supset F_2$. Then we choose $\Gamma$, a positively oriented system of closed curves such that $F_2$ lies in the inside of $\Gamma$ and $F_2$ lies on the outside of $\Gamma$. We then let $\chi_1$ be the characteristic function of $G_1$ an observe that $\chi_1$ is a holomorphic function on $G_1 \cup G_2$, hence holomorphic on a neighborhood of $\sigma(a) = F_1 \cup F_2 \subset G_1 \cup G_2$. We then use the Riesz functional calculus to define: $$\rho(\chi_1) = \int_{\Gamma} \chi_1(z) (z - a)^{-1} dz,$$ which is an element of $\mathcal{A}$. The claim is that, since $\rho$ is a homomorphism and $\chi_1^2 = \chi_1$, $\rho(\chi_1)$ is the idempotent we are looking for. The spectral mapping theorem allows us to prove (iii). My concern with the above proof is about the selection of the contour $\Gamma$. According to the definition of the functional calculus for an element $a \in \mathcal{A}$ (see, for instance (4.5) in the same section of Conway), we must choose $\Gamma$ so that the entire spectrum $\sigma(a)$ lies on the inside of $\Gamma$. But here it is specifically stated that $F_2$ (which is part of $\sigma(a)$) lies on the outside of $\Gamma$. How, then, can the contour integral above be considered as an instance of the functional calculus? Any clarification is greatly appreciated.","['banach-algebras', 'spectral-theory', 'functional-analysis']"
