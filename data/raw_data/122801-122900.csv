1848574,Stable resolution of a $2\times2$ linear system,"Cramerâ€™s method for the resolution of linear systems is known to be unstable, even in the $2\times2$ case. For general systems, stability can be improved by partial or full pivoting. When you transpose the full pivoting principle to a $2\times2$ , the procedure essentially amounts to finding the L.H.S. coefficient with the largest magnitude, let it be $a_{11}$ W.L.O.G.; computing $x_2$ by determinants*, computing $x_1$ by elimination of $x_2$ from equation $1$ . Can this improve stability? Is there a more stable solution? *Whatever the choice of the pivot, the formula amounts to a ratio of $2\times2$ determinants. I wonder if first normalizing the pivot coefficient to $1$ makes any difference. $$\frac{b_1-b_2\dfrac{a_{21}}{a_{11}}}{a_{22}-a_{12}\dfrac{a_{21}}{a_{11}}}\text{ vs. }\frac{b_1a_{11}-b_2a_{21}}{a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}}$$","['numerical-methods', 'linear-algebra']"
1848602,local minimum is isolated,"Let $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}$, $f(x,y)=(y-x^2)(y-2x^2)$. Claim: For all $(a,b)\in\mathbb{R}^2\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ the function $\varphi(t)=f(at,bt)=b^2t^2-3a^2bt^3+2a^4t^4$ has an isolated local minimum at $t=0$. I proved that $\varphi$ has an local minimum at $t=0$ (because $\varphi'(0)=0$ and $\varphi''(0)>0$) but I don't know why this is an isolated minimum. Isolated means that there is a $\epsilon >0$ such that for all $t\neq 0$ with  $|t|<\epsilon$ $\Rightarrow$ $\varphi(0)<\varphi(t)$. But how to define $\epsilon$? Can you help me? Edit: If for example $b=0$ (see the hint below), then $\varphi(t)=2a^4t^4$ has a local minimum in $t=0$ too.

1848706,"Stationary distribution of ""probabilistic geometric series"" with two alternative ratios","I have an iterative process starting at $X_0=2$. In each iteration $i=1,2,\ldots$, the value of $X_i$ is determined based on the value of $X_{i-1}$ as follows: With probability 0.5, $X_i=qX_{i-1}+1$, otherwise, $X_i=(1-q)X_{i-1}+1$, with $0<q<1$. I am interested in the stationary distribution of this process, i.e. $\lim_{i\rightarrow\infty}P(X_i=x)$. Specifically, I am interested in an explanation why this distribution seems so ""rough"" and ""repetitive"" (at least when numerically solving it, see below). Alternatively, I would be grateful for any reference to the literature on this distribution, the name of the process, or anything else to find out more. The image shows the numerically obtained distribution by running the above described algorithm n=100000 times for 10000 iterations, each, with $q=\pi/5$. Dash dotted lines are the two limits $\frac{1}{1-q}$ and $\frac{1}{q}$ corresponding to the solution of the deterministic geometric series with coefficient $q$ and $(1-q)$. The numerically obtained distribution seems not to change significantly when increasing the number of iterations. Edit: Preliminary ideas Based on the reference from Did, I managed to get some preliminary ideas. I am not completely sure if the following is correct, thus, if you find an error please tell. My process is an iterated random function:
\begin{align*}
X_{n+1}=f_{\theta_{n+1}}(X_n),\,X_0=2
\end{align*}
with $\theta_k$ iid random variables being either $1$ or $2$ with probability $1/2$, and
\begin{align*}
f_1(x)&=qx+1\\
f_2(x)&=(1-q)x+1.
\end{align*} The first thing I learned from Diaconis & Freedman (1999) is that the forward iteration
\begin{align*}
X_{n+1}=(f_{\theta_{n+1}}\circ\ldots\circ f_{\theta_{1}})(x_0)
\end{align*}
has the same distribution as the backward iteration
\begin{align*}
Y_{n+1}=(f_{\theta_{1}}\circ\ldots\circ f_{\theta_{n+1}})(x_0).
\end{align*} This is useful because the forward process is ergodic, while the backward process converges. Specifically,
\begin{align*}
Y_\infty=1+a_1+a_1a_2+\ldots = \sum_{j=0}^\infty\prod_{i=1}^{j}a_i,
\end{align*}
with $a_k$ either $q$ or $1-q$ with probability $1/2$. Denoting the first $N$ terms of $Y_\infty$ as $Z_N$, and letting $Z^q_N$ be the first $N$ terms with $a_{N-1}=q$, we obtain:
\begin{align*}
Z_N^q&=1+\ldots+\prod_{i=1}^{N-2}a_i+q\prod_{i=1}^{N-2}a_i\\
Z_N^{1-q}&=1+\ldots+\prod_{i=1}^{N-2}a_i+(1-q)\prod_{i=1}^{N-2}a_i.
\end{align*}
Then, we define $R_N^q=Z_\infty^q-Z_N^q$. By doing some calculations, we find out that
\begin{align*}
\frac{q^2}{1-q}\prod_{i=1}^{N-2}a_i\leq R_N^q\leq (1-q)\prod_{i=1}^{N-2}a_i\\
q\prod_{i=1}^{N-2}a_i\leq R_N^{1-q}\leq \frac{(1-q)^2}{q}\prod_{i=1}^{N-2}a_i,
\end{align*}
and, thus, $Z_N^q+R_N^q\leq Z_N^{1-q}+R_N^{1-q}$, meaning that an iteration of the backward iteration ""splits"" the realizations in two groups, such that each group ends up in a given interval, with the overlap between the intervals having measure zero. Furthermore, both groups have the same mass, and it also follows (I don't do all steps here) that the stationary distributions in the interior of both intervals have to be the same (except scaling of axis), and to be the same as the whole distribution (Note: I have to check this again). This again implies, if I didn't make some mistake, that every interval contains the information about the whole distribution. I guess with a few more arguments it follows that the distribution cannot be uniformly continuous, explaining its roughness.","['power-series', 'sequences-and-series', 'probability-distributions']"

1848797,Cohomology of a group of order two with coefficients in a finite abelian group of odd order,"I am looking for an elementary proof that the cohomology groups in the title are trivial in the positive degrees. In more detain, let $G=\{1,s\}$ be a group of order two, and let $A$ be an abelian group with an action of $G$.
I need an elementary proof that if $A$ is finite of odd order, then
$H^1(G,A)=0$ and $H^2(G,A)=0$. A non-elementary proof goes as follows. Since $|G|=2$, both $H^1(G,A)$ and $H^2(G,A)$ are killed by the multiplication by $2$. Clearly they are also killed by the multiplication by $|A|$. Since $2$ and $|A|$ are coprime, these cohomology groups are killed by the multiplication by $1$, hence they both are trivial. I give an elementary formulation of the desired assertion. 
Let $A$ be an abelian group and let $s\colon A\to A$ be an automorphism such that $s^2=1$.
Set
$$ N=s+1, \qquad T=s-1. $$
Then $TS=0$ and $ST=0$,
hence
$$ \mathrm{im\ } N\subseteq \ker T\quad\text{and}\quad \mathrm{im\ } T\subseteq \ker N. $$
I need an elementary proof of the following assertion: Theorem. If $A$ is a finite abelian group of odd order , then $\ker T=\mathrm{im\ } N$ and $\ker N=\mathrm{im\ } T$. Motivation. Let $X$ be a quasiprojective variety with additional structure over ${\mathbb{C}}$.
Write $G=\mathrm{Gal}({\mathbb{C}}/{\mathbb{R}})$, then $G=\{1,s\}$, where $s$ is the complex conjugation.
Let $sX$ denote the variety with additional structure over ${\mathbb{C}}$
obtained from $X$ by the action of the complex conjugation $s$ on the coefficients of the equations defining $X$.
Assume that $sX$ is isomorphic to $X$. 
We would like to know whether $X$ admits a real form. 
Let $A=\mathrm{Aut}(X)$, and assume that $A$ is an abelian group.
Then one can construct an obstruction $\eta(X)\in H^2(G,A)$ to the existence of a real form of $X$,
see my question .
Now assume that $A$ is a finite abelian group of odd order .
Then by our theorem we have $H^2(G,A)=0$, hence $\eta(X)=0$ and therefore, $X$ admits a real form $X_{\mathbb{R}}$.
The set of isomorphism classes of such real forms is a principal homogeneous space of the abelian group $H^1(G,A)$,
see again my question .
By our theorem we have $H^1(G,A)=0$, hence this real form is unique. Motivation for an elementary proof: A potential reader of my paper comes from analysis and would prefer an elementary proof.","['algebraic-geometry', 'finite-groups', 'arithmetic-geometry', 'group-cohomology', 'group-theory']"

1848840,Question about oblique co-ordinate system,"Definitions: Let the following figure show an oblique $2$ dimensional co-ordinate system, where $O$ is the origin and the parallelogram $OQRP$ is called the fundamental parallelogram. Rest of the infinite parallelograms ( those with sides parallel to $OQ$ and $OP$ ) formed are said to be based on parallelogram $OQRP$. Two points $A$ and $B$  are called equivalent if they are inside ( or on the boundary ) of two different parallelograms based on $OQRP$, and when the first parallelogram is made to coincide with the second ( the first parallelogram is moved along lines parallel to $OQ$ and $OP$  ), the two points coincide, for example in the figure the two red points are equivalent. Also the points of intersection in the figure above are called lattice points . Question: Let $R_{O}$ be a parallelogram containing the origin $O$ ( not necessarily a parallelogram based on $OQRP$ ). And let us denote $R_{P}$ to be a parallelogram congruent to $R_O$ and similarly situated about lattice point $P$. What I have to prove is that iff $R_{O}$ does not contain two equivalent points inside it, then none of the parallelograms $R_{P}^*$ coincide ( $R_P^*$ denotes the set of parallelograms around all lattice points ). What I tried: Just using the fact that a parallelogram is a convex figure, I was able to prove that if $R_{O}$ contains two equivalent points inside of it, the parallelograms $R_P^*$ will coincide. But I am unable to prove the reverse direction, that is if $R_P^*$ overlap then each of them has two equivalent points inside of them. PS: The above is one of theorems related to Minkowski's theorems regarding Farey series given in the book by Hardy and Wright ( Introduction to theory of numbers ). The concerning theorem is If $R_O$ is a parallelogram containing the origin such that its area is equal to that of the fundamental parallelogram $OQRP$ and there are no two equivalent points ( that is the parallelograms $R_P^*$ don't overlap  ) inside $R_O$ then the parallelograms $R_P^*$ cover the $2D$ space, where the terms are defined above in Definitions.","['elementary-number-theory', 'geometry']"

Playing around I see that this method is fruitless since: $$\int_{0}^{1}x^{s-1} \arctan^2 x \, {\rm d}x = \left [ \frac{x^s}{s} \arctan^2 x  \right ]_0^1  - \frac{2}{s}\int_{0}^{1} \frac{x^{s-1} \arctan x}{x^2+1} \, {\rm d}x$$ and if someone tries to apply parts again at the second integral beginning with the rational function then he encounters hypergeometrics.

The right-hand side looks like a weighted sum of the two terms on the left-hand side, but not quite. If we plug in $b=1$ and $c=d$, then all three terms are equal, so $k\leq 1$. On the other hand, we have $k\geq 3/5$. Indeed, we will show that $$\frac{5}{5-3c}\geq\frac35\cdot\frac{2+3b}{5-c-2d}.$$
 Note that $d\leq 1$ and $2+3b\leq 5$, so it suffices to show $$\frac{1}{5-3c}\geq\frac35\cdot\frac{1}{3-c},$$
or $$5(3-c)\geq 3(5-3c)$$
or $$15-5c\geq 15-9c$$
which is true. But the bound is not tight here, since we must have $b=d=1$ and $c=0$, and we have $\max(5, 5/2)\geq 5/3$. (The term $\frac{5b}{5-3d}$, which we did not use at all, is large.) Update : By dividing the cases into whether $b\leq 3/5$ (and compare with the first term in the $\max$ if so) or $b\geq 3/5$ (and compare with the second term in the $\max$ if so), we can show that $k\geq 15/19$. Moreover, as Aravind pointed out in the comments, we have $k\leq 15/16$. So the gap is now between $15/19$ and $15/16$. Update 2 : WolframAlpha confirms that $k=15/16$ is the right answer.

1848980,"Showing $L(1,\chi)$ is positive given that it's nonzero","Let me first provide context for this question. There is a series of four exercises in Ireland & Rosen's book (in second edition it's exercises 14-17 in chaprer 16), aim of which is (although this is not relevant to my question) to establish that in the interval $0<x<\frac{p}{2}$ there are more quadratic residues than nonresidues $\mod p$ for $p\equiv 3\pmod 4$. The content of exercise 17, when restated, is essentially the following: Let $\chi$ be the Dirichlet character $\mod 2p$ such that $\chi(n)=\left(\frac{n}{p}\right)$ for odd $n$. Given that $L(1,\chi)\neq 0$, show $L(1,\chi)>0$. Since I am asking this question in the context of mentioned book, let me briefly go through what was established in the chapter (for the same of people who don't own the book and want to give an answer at the adequate level): Definitions of: zeta function, Dirichlet characters and L-functions was given and their basic properties were established Nonvanishing of L-functions has been proven by standard method for complex characters and for real characters using Landau's lemma (concerning Dirichlet series with nonnegative coefficients) I suppose these aren't related to my question, but just in case I mention these: Dirichlet's theorem was proven, it was shown that L-functions can be continued to the whole (punctured) complex plane, and L-functions have been evaluated at negative integers with help of generalized Bernoulli numbers. The exercise so restated seems to be quite difficult, since sign of L-function value was at no point dealt with in the chapter. At this point you can guess what my question: How to solve this exercise without using tools outside the ones provided by Ireland & Rosen in their book? I know from other places that the value of $L(1,\chi)$ for real $\chi$ is always positive. So, extending my question: Is there an easy way to show, for general real Dirichlet character $\chi$, that $L(1,\chi)>0$, given that we know it's not zero? Let me also note that I am aware of a proof of nonvanishing of L-functions which at the same time proves that the value is positive, but this wouldn't be a valid answer to my question - as far as I can recall, the proof was by itself pretty nontrivial, and I'm looking for something that, in theory, could've been figured out by a reader of the book who, say, has not encountered analytic number theory before.

1848984,"If the entries of a positive semidefinite matrix shrink individually, will the operator norm always decrease?","Given a positive semidefinite matrix $P$, if we scale down its entries individually , will its operator norm always decrease? Put it another way: Suppose $P\in M_n(\mathbb R)$ is positive semidefinite and $B\in M_n(\mathbb R)$ is a $[0,1]$-matrix, i.e. $B$ has all entries between $0$ and $1$ (note: $B$ is not necessarily symmetric). Let $\|\cdot\|_2$ denotes the operator norm (i.e. the largest singular value). Is it always true that
   $$\|P\|_2\ge\|P\circ B\|_2?\tag{$\ast$}$$ Background. I ran into this inequality in another question . Having done a numerical experiment, I believed the inequality is true, but I hadn't been able to prove it. If $(\ast)$ turns out to be true, we immediately obtain the analogous inequality $\rho(P)\ge\rho(P\circ B)$ for the spectral radii because $\rho(P)=\|P\|_2\ge\|P\circ B\|_2\ge\rho(P\circ B)$. Remarks. There is much research on inequalities about spectral radii or operator norms of Hadamard products. Often, either all multiplicands in each product are semidefinite or all of them are nonnegative. Inequalities like those two here, which involve mixtures of  semidefinite matrices with nonnegative matrices, are rarely seen. I have tested the inequality for $n=2,3,4,5$ with 100,000 random examples for each $n$. No counterexamples were found. The semidefiniteness condition is essential. If it is removed, counterexamples with symmetric $P$s can be easily obtained. The inequality is known to be true if $P$ is also entrywise nonnegative. So, if you want to carry out a numerical experiment to verify $(\ast)$, make sure that the $P$s you generate have both positive and negative entries. One difficulty I met in constructing a proof is that I couldn't make use of the submultiplicativity of the operator norm. Note that tie occurs if $B$ is the all-one matrix, which has spectral norm $n\,(>1)$. If you somehow manage to extract a factor like $\|B\|_2$ from $\|P\circ B\|_2$, that factor may be too large. For a similar reason, the triangle inequality also looks useless.","['inequality', 'hadamard-product', 'matrices', 'normed-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

First, I state necessary facts from the book used in the exercise: For every abelian group $G, End_{Ab}(G)$ ( the set of group homomorphisms from $G$ to $G$ ) is a ring with operations: $+: (f+g)(a) = f(a) + g(a)$ $.: (fg)(a) = f(g(a))$ and zero $0_{End_{Ab}(G)} = $ trivial map $0: \ \ im0 = 0$ , identity $1_{End_{Ab}(G)} = 1_G \in End_{Ab}(G)$ Proposition. $End_{Ab}(\mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ as rings. Let $R$ be a ring. For $r \in R$ , define left-multiplication by $r$ by $\lambda_r$ . $\lambda_r$ is an endomorphism of the underlying abelian group $(R,+)$ . Proposition. Let $R$ be a ring. Then the function $\lambda: R \to End_{Ab}(R)$ defined by $\lambda(r) = \lambda_r$ is an injective ring homomorphism. Now, here goes the exercise: it's on the page $138$ in book, numbered $2.16$ . Prove that there is (up to isomorphism) only one structure of ring(with identity) on the abelian group $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ . Let $R$ be a ring whose underlying group is $\mathbb{Z}$ . Then there is an injective ring homomorphism $\lambda: R \to End_{Ab}(R)$ , and the latter is isomorphic to the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ . Prove that $\lambda$ is surjective is this case. So, assume $R$ is some ring, whose underlying abelian group is $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ . We may denote it as $(\mathbb{Z}, + , o , 1_R = k)$ where $o$ is multiplication in $R$ , and $k$ is some integer serving and identity in this ring. We need to prove that every group homomorphism $\phi:(\mathbb{Z},+) \to (\mathbb{Z},+)$ may be defined by formula $\phi(n) = d \ o \ n$ for some integer $d$ . But every group endomorphism $\phi$ of $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ is uniquely determined by the image of $1$ . Since $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z} \ \ \phi(n) = \phi(n1) = n\phi(1)$ . And $1_{(\mathbb{Z},+)}$ is determined as $\forall z \in \mathbb{Z} \ \ 1_{(\mathbb{Z},+)}(z) = k(=1_{(\mathbb{Z},+,o)}) \ o \ z = z$ .

If we equip $\mathcal D$ with the restriction $\left\|\;\cdot\;\right\|_{\mathcal D}$ of the norm induced by $\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle_H$, then $f$ is a bounded, linear operator from $(\mathcal D,\left\|\;\cdot\;\right\|_{\mathcal D})$ to $\mathbb R$. Thus, since $\mathcal D$ is a dense subspace of $(H,\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle_H)$, we can apply the bounded linear transform theorem and obtain the existence of a unique bounded, linear operator $F:(H,\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle_H)\to\mathbb R$ (i.e. $F\in H'$) with $$\left.F\right|_{\mathcal D}=f\tag 1$$ and $$\left\|F\right\|_{H'}=\left\|f\right\|_{\mathcal D'}\tag 2$$ where $\left\|\;\cdot\;\right\|_{\mathcal D'}$ denotes the operator norm on $(\mathcal D,\left\|\;\cdot\;\right\|_{\mathcal D})'$.

1849191,Why doesn't this argument show the MÃ¶bius bundle is trivial?,"I wrote the following argument to prove that $S^1$ is parallelizable, that is, to show that the tangent bundle is trivial. It looks fairly reasonable to me. Let $\tau=2\pi$. We define a map $\varphi:S^1\times\Bbb R\to TS^1$ by
  $\varphi((e^{i\tau\theta},
 t))=(e^{i\tau\theta},t\frac{\partial}{\partial
 x^1}\Big|_{e^{i\tau\theta}})$. This map is clearly a bijection:
  injectivity follows trivially and surjectivity follows since the
  tangent space $T_{e^{i\tau\theta}}$ is one-dimensional. It remains to be shown that it is a diffeomorphism. We will, in fact,
  show that it is the identity map on suitably chosen coordinates. For
  any point $(e^{i\tau\theta},t)\in S^1\times\Bbb R$, we can choose the
  coordinate chart such that
  $(e^{i\tau(\theta+\varepsilon)},(t+\delta))$, for sufficiently small
  $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$, is given by $(\varepsilon,\delta)$. Similarly, for any point $(e^{i\tau\theta},t\frac{\partial}{\partial
 x^1}\Big|_{e^{i\tau\theta}})\in TS^1$, we can choose the coordinate
  chart such that
  $(e^{i\tau(\theta+\varepsilon)},(t+\delta)\frac{\partial}{\partial
 x^1}\Big|_{e^{i\tau(\theta+\varepsilon)}})$, for sufficiently small
  $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$, is given by $(\varepsilon,\delta)$.  Then,
  we have that $\widehat\varphi$ (the function with respect to these two
  coordinates) sends $(\varepsilon,\delta)\mapsto (\varepsilon,\delta)$,
  as desired. However, I don't see where this is using the tangent bundle construction in any meaningful way. It seems that this would work just as well for any rank-1 vector bundle over the sphere. That concerns me, because of course the conclusion is not true: for instance the MÃ¶bius strip is (diffeomorphic to) a vector bundle over the sphere. Since it is not orientable, we know that the bundle is nontrivial. So the question is: Where does this break for a general vector bundle? Or if the argument is simply invalid, can it be fixed without much trouble?","['vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"

Intuitively ${{\partial f}\over{\partial x}} = 1$ where $\frac{x}{y} \notin \mathbb{Z}$ However, ${{\partial f}\over{\partial y}}$ seems more tricky. If I try to use intuition and define it piecewise, it seems like it may be: $$
{{\partial f}\over{\partial y}} = \left\{\begin{aligned}
&0 &&: 0 < x < y\\
&\text{undefined} &&: \frac{x}{y} \in \mathbb{Z} \\
&-1 &&: \text{otherwise}

\begin{aligned}
{{\partial f}\over{\partial y}} &= -\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \operatorname{floor}\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)\\[6pt]
&= \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \operatorname{floor} \left(\frac{x}{y}\right)\frac{x}{y^{2}}\\

I'm interested in the average distance between random points in the square. Let $ \mathbf{a} = \left< x_1,y_1 \right>$ and  $ \mathbf{b} = \left< x_2,y_2 \right>$ be random points in the unit square.  By random, I mean that $x_i$ and $y_i$ are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. The normal approach is to use multiple integration to determine the average value of the distance between $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a}$.  I would like to try another approach. $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are random vectors, and each element has known distribution. So, the vector between them also has known distribution.  The difference between two uniformly random variables has triangular distribution. So $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}$.  Then, the average distance is the expectation of $\lVert \mathbf{c} \rVert$.  Perhaps it would be easier to calculate the expectation of $\lVert \mathbf{c} \rVert^2$.

(b) Determine the greatest common divisor (over $\mathbb{Z}$) of all the entries of $\big(\textbf{A}_n(0)\big)^{-1}$.

Now, Part (d) is known (see i707107's solution below), but Part (b) remains open, although it seems like the answer is $n$. Recall that 
$$\binom{t}{r}=\frac{t(t-1)(t-2)\cdots(t-r+1)}{r!}$$

This means that, for all integers $k$ such that $k\notin\{-1,-2,\ldots,-2n+1\}$, the entries of $\big(\textbf{A}_n(k)\big)^{-1}$ are integers. I now have a new conjecture, which is the primary target for the bounty award. Conjecture: The greatest common divisor $\gamma_n(k)$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ of the entries of $\big(\textbf{A}_n(k)\big)^{-1}$, where $k$ is an integer not belonging in the set $\{-1,-2,\ldots,-2n+1\}$, is given by $$\gamma_n(k)=\mathrm{lcm}(n,n+k)\,.$$ It is clear from (*) that $n+k$ must divide $\gamma_n(k)$.  However, it is not yet clear to me why $n$ should divide $\gamma_n(k)$.  I would like to have a proof of this conjecture, or at least a proof that $n \mid \gamma_n(k)$. Let $M_n$ denote the (unitary) cyclic $\mathbb{Z}[x]$-module generated by $\dfrac{1}{\big((n-1)!\big)^2}\,(x+n)$.  Then, the (unitary)  $\mathbb{Z}[x]$-module $N_n$ generated by the entries of $\big(\textbf{A}_n(x)\big)^{-1}$ is a $\mathbb{Z}[x]$-submodule of $M_n$. We also denote by $\tilde{M}_n$ for the (unitary)  $\mathbb{Z}$-module generated by $\dfrac{1}{\big((n-1)!\big)^2}\,(x+n)\,x^l$ for $l=0,1,2,\ldots,2n-2$.  Then, the (unitary) $\mathbb{Z}$-module $\tilde{N}_n$ generated by the entries of $\big(\textbf{A}_n(x)\big)^{-1}$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-submodule of $\tilde{M}_n$. For example, $M_2/N_2$ is isomorphic to the (unitary) $\mathbb{Z}[x]$-module $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ (in which $x$ acts trivially), and $\tilde{M}_2/\tilde{N}_2$ is isomorphic to the (unitary) $\mathbb{Z}$-module $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.  Hence, $\left|M_2/N_2\right|=2=\left|\tilde{M}_2/\tilde{N}_2\right|$.  For $n=3$, Mathematica yields
$$\tilde{M}_3/\tilde{N}_3\cong (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})\oplus(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})^{\oplus 2}\oplus(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z})^{\oplus 3}\,,$$
as abelian groups.  That is, $\left|\tilde{M}_3/\tilde{N}_3\right|=1152$.  On the other hand, 
$$M_3/N_3\cong \mathbb{Z}[x] \big/\left(12,2x^2+6x+4,x^4-x^2\right)$$
as $\mathbb{Z}[x]$-modules, which gives $\left|M_3/N_3\right|=576$. Question: Describe the factor $\mathbb{Z}[x]$-module $M_n/N_n$ and the factor $\mathbb{Z}$-module $\tilde{M}_n/\tilde{N}_n$.  It is easily seen that $\left|M_n/N_n\right|\leq\left|\tilde{M}_n/\tilde{N}_n\right|$.  What are $\left|M_n/N_n\right|$ and $\left|\tilde{M}_n/\tilde{N}_n\right|$?  It can be shown also that the ratio $\dfrac{\left|\tilde{M}_n/\tilde{N}_n\right|}{\left|M_n/N_n\right|}$ is an integer, provided that $\left|\tilde{M}_n/\tilde{N}_n\right|$ is finite.  Compute $\dfrac{\left|\tilde{M}_n/\tilde{N}_n\right|}{\left|M_n/N_n\right|}$ for all integers $n>0$ such that $\left|\tilde{M}_n/\tilde{N}_n\right|<\infty$.  Is it always the case that $\left|\tilde{M}_n/\tilde{N}_n\right|$ is finite? Apart from the conjecture above, this question is also eligible for the bounty award. I have not yet fully tried to deal with any case involving $n>3$.  However, for $n=4$, the module $\tilde{M}_4/\tilde{N}_4$ is huge:

But, I can't figure out such an intuitive and geometrical explanation or example of how the second case with the relation between linear transformations works and thus, I can't explain why the two transformations are called similar.

1849974,"Between $2$ consecutive roots of $f'$, there is at least one root of $f$","Prove that between $2$ consecutive roots of $f'$, there is at least one root of $f$. I understand that a root of $f'$ represents an extreme point. But, for example, $f(x) = \sin(x)+2$ has no roots, but its derivative, $\cos(x)$, has lots of consecutive roots. Ok, while I was writing this, I realized that its no ""at least"" but ""there is at most "" one root of $f$. So, I understand that, between $2$ consecutive maximum points, for example, there can be one root, but if that function tries to come back and make another root between the two max poits, it's gotta create a local maximum point between them. But how do I write this mathematically? Let me try: By Rolle's, between $2$ consecutive roots $f(a) = f(b)$, there must be a point $c\in [a,b]$ where $f'(c) = 0$, which is a maximum point. Or maybe, can I say the following: between two roots of $f'(x)$, let's say, $f'(m) = f'(n)$ by rolles theorem we have: $$\exists c\in [m,n] / f''(c) = 0$$ so there's a maximum point between the roots, but I don't know how to prove that this is the only maximum point, and that this maximum point leads to only one root.","['algebra-precalculus', 'real-analysis', 'calculus', 'functions']"

I also want to make sure each Leader helps with each Patrol at least once, again this is not too hard to achieve (its basically an 8 team round robin tournament at 4 grounds) but the stumbling block I am having is that ideally I do not want any Leader to help with the same Patrol without at least a 2 day gap (e.g. help Monday and not back there until Thursday).

1850049,Intuitive explanation of a stochastic PDE,"Lindgren et al 2011 connects Gaussian Markov Random Fields (which have fast calculation properties due to the Markov attribute) and Gaussian Processes (which can model many types of data). The connection rests upon the fact (from Whittle 1954) that solutions to a certain stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) defined below have a MatÃ©rn covariance (common in Gaussian Processes). They then show that some models with defined Markov properties (like on a lattice, but they extend it to off-lattice data) are solutions to that SPDE and so all the fast calculations (such as the precision matrix) that can be done on Markov models lead to desired covariance properties. So we can do some GP calculations very quickly with this technique. My questions are about the SPDE itself:
$$
(\kappa^2 - \Delta)^{\alpha/2}x(\mathbf{u}) = \mathcal{W}(\mathbf{u})
$$ where $\Delta = \sum \frac{\delta^2}{\delta x_i^2}$ is the Laplacian,  $\mathcal{W}$ is a white-noise process, $\alpha/2$ is an integer, and $\kappa$ is a constant that represents the inverse ""range"" of the covariance (something like a persistence length). What does this very weird equation represent? I hate to pull an ""I don't get it"" so here are some specific questions: On the LHS we have the Laplacian operator, which is the divergence of the gradient. What does a PDE with this operator imply about the solution? E.g. ""$dx/dt = a$ means that x changes with speed $a$."" On the RHS we have a stochastic white noise process $\mathcal{W}$. How is this different from putting something deterministic here? In the paper they call this ""driving the SPDE with white noise"" but I don't know what driving means in this context. They mention in the paper the relationship of this equation to diffusion. It would be helpful to flesh out that connection. They further extend this model to non-stationary fields with a slightly modified SPDE: $$
(\kappa^2(\mathbf{u}) - \Delta)^{\alpha/2}\left\{\tau(\mathbf{u})x(\mathbf{u})\right\} = \mathcal{W}(\mathbf{u})
$$ Where functions $\kappa^2(\mathbf{u})$ and $\tau(\mathbf{u})$ vary throughout space. They show this ALSO has ""local"" MatÃ©rn covariance but globally could be a dense covariance with interesting global correlations.

1850251,When is the contraction of a maximal ideal still maximal?,"Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, $F$ a subfield of $k$, $A$ a reduced, finitely generated $k$-algebra, and $A_0$ a finitely generated $F$-subalgebra of $A$ for which $A = k \otimes_F A_0$. Let $\mathfrak m$ be a maximal ideal of $A$.  Then $\mathfrak m \cap A_0$ is a prime ideal of $A$.  Here is my very general question: When is $\mathfrak m \cap A_0$ a maximal ideal of $A$? Another point of view would be to use the fact that since $k$ is algebraically closed, there is a unique $k$-algebra homomorphism $\phi: A \rightarrow k$ whose kernel is $\mathfrak m$.  Then $\mathfrak m \cap A_0$ is the kernel of the restriction of $\phi$ to $A_0$.  So equivalently the question I'm asking is when is $\phi(A_0)$ a field (necessarily a finite extension of $F$, by Zariski's lemma). Here is a small result: Let $A_0 = F[X], A = k[X]$.  Let $\mathfrak m = (X - x)$ be any maximal ideal of $A$.  Then $\mathfrak m \cap A_0$ is a maximal ideal of $A$ if and only if $x$ is algebraic over $F$.  Otherwise, $\mathfrak m \cap A_0$ is zero. Proof: If $x$ is algebraic over $F$ with minimal polynomial $\mu$, then $\mu A_0$ is a maximal ideal of $A_0$ contained in $\mathfrak m \cap A_0$, so the inclusion $\mu A_0 \subseteq \mathfrak m \cap A_0$ is an equality. Conversely, suppose that $\mathfrak m \cap A_0$ is a maximal ideal of $A_0$.  Since $A_0$ is a PID, and we know that $\mathfrak m \cap A_0$ is prime, this is the same as saying that $\mathfrak m \cap A_0 \neq 0$.  So there exists a polynomial $f(X) \in k[X]$ such that $(X-x)f(X) \in F[X]$.  This is a polynomial in $F[X]$ of which $x$ is a root, so $x$ is algebraic over $F$. $\blacksquare$ The next step would be to consider $A_0 = F[X_1, ... , X_n], A = k[X_1, ... , X_n]$, and $\mathfrak m = (X_1 - x_1, ... , X_n - x_n)$.  A natural thing to expect would be that $\mathfrak m \cap A$ is a maximal ideal of $A_0$ if and only if all the $x_i$ are algebraic over $F$.  I have not been successful in proving this yet, but it may follow from using induction and some facts about flat extensions of rings.  Maybe a more general result to expect would be that the height of $\mathfrak m \cap A_0$ is $$ n - \textrm{tr. deg}(F[x_1, ... , x_n]/F)$$ The final step would be to consider quotients $$A = k[X_1, ... , X_n]/I, A_0 = F[X_1, ... , X_n]/I \cap F[X_1, ... , X_n]$$ where $I$ is an ideal of $A$ which is extended from an ideal of $F[X_1, ... , X_n]$.  Up to noncanonical isomorphism, I believe such extensions $A_0 \rightarrow A$ cover all pairs $(A,A_0)$ as I described in the beginning of the question.","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

1850260,Abstract algebraic definition of dual tangent spaces,"I know that if $(M,\mathcal{A})$ is a smooth manifold, the dual tangent space at $p\in M$ can be defined as $$ T^*_pM=I_p/I_p^2, $$ where $I_p$ is the ideal of the ring $C^\infty(M)$ consisting of smooth functions that vanish at $p$ and $I_p^2$ is the second power of this ideal. I understand that this definition is useful, because, unlike other definitions, this one can be generalized to situations when you don't have the smooth structure $\mathcal{A}$, however this definition is so unintuitive I have a hard time grasping it. According to wikipedia, the product of ideals $A$ and $B$ is defined as $$ AB=\{a_1b_1+...a_nb_n|\ a_i\in A,b_i\in B,n\in\mathbb{N}\}, $$ I assume the point of this definition is that by demanding that the functions vanish, we make sure that the functions' Taylor expansion has no zeroth order terms, and since the elements of the product ideal are second order expressions, I assume the quotient is needed to get rid of second order terms. Seems logical, since by the usual definition we can infer that the contangent space is generated by differentials of functions, which are, of course, the first order part. Am I correct in this? If I am correct on the first point, what about higher than second order terms? Shouldn't we need to quotient those out too? Thinking about it as I write this post, elements of $I_p^2$ are second order algebraic expressions from $C^\infty(M)$, but they are not polynomials, a Taylor expansion, however is polynomial. I think I don't understand it now. This line of thought seems to depend on the functions having Taylor expansions. However I know this definition is generalizable to algebraic varieties as well as locally ringed spaces in general. Without having a structure that allows Taylor expansions, how do we know that this grasps the concept of ""functions having the same first order behaviour at $p$"" for those cases as well? How can we see that this quotient space is finite $n$ dimensional? If the proof is not particularily pleasant, I don't expect anyone to actually post it here, but a reference to a manifold theory textbook that utilizes this definition heavily enough to also contain related proofs would be nice. I would appreciate any response, even if it doesn't address these points directly, if it can help me see intuitively why this particular quotient space has the same meaning as the usual definition of dual tangent space. EDIT: Since there have been misunderstandings, I wish to clarify: In my last bullet point I am not asking how to prove that the tangent/cotangent space is $n$ dimensional for an $n$ dimensional manifold.

Edit I think this is true only if $A^{-1}B$ has distinct eigenvalues. Indeed, let $v_i$ denote an eigenvector of $A^{-1}B$ for $\lambda_i>0$ (because it is PD), then $A^{-1}B v_i=\lambda_i v_i$ or $Bv_i=\lambda A v_i$ so that $v_j^\top B v_i=\lambda_i v_j^\top A v_i$ and similarly $v_i^\top B v_j=\lambda_j v_i^\top A v_j$. Substracting one equality to the other:
$$ (\lambda_j-\lambda_i)v_i^\top A v_j=(\lambda_j-\lambda_i)v_i^\top \dfrac{1}{\lambda_j}  B v_j.$$ Hence, if $\lambda_i\neq\lambda_j$, necessarily $v_i^\top A v_j=v_i^\top  B v_j=0$ or $V^\top A V$ and $V^\top B V$ are diagonal, where $V$ is a matrix of columns the $v_i$. Does it seem correct?","['matrices', 'symmetric-matrices', 'bilinear-form', 'linear-algebra']"

1850372,nef Line bundles over KÃ¤hler manifolds,"I am trying to understand a particular property of the first Chern class of a nef line bundle over a  KÃ¤hler manifold. We know in general, let $X$ be a complete complex projective variety, and $L$ a line bundle over it. Then $L$ is called nef if $$\int_Cc_1(L)\geq0$$ where $C$ is any irreducible complete curve on $X$. Then is it true that $c_1(L)$ can is a limit of KÃ¤hler forms in $H^2(X,\mathbb{Q})$?

1850376,Coloring the pentagonal hexecontahedron,"So, I'd like to color the pentagonal hexecontahedron in a way that is satisfying aesthetically and mathematically. For me this equates to, in order of priority -
1. No same-colored faces can share an edge
2. We must use as few colors as possible
3. We must have as much symmetry as possible Here's a 5-colored pentagonal hexecontahedron - 5 colors is a lot, but it's nice that there are apparently no adjacent faces with the same color. Not clearly very symmetrical though (if it is, it's obscured by the large number of colors). By the four-color theorem, we know it can be done with 4. I know it can't be done with 3, proof below. So, the aesthetics question boils down to ""how symmetrical a 4-coloring can we make?"". By the way, it is possible to color the deltoid hexecontahedron with only three colors, without same colored faces touching, and with chiral octahedral symmetry. Here's a lovely piece of origami designed by Tomoko Fuse that does this . Answer this question and you will be credited in a documentary about virus structure! I'm coloring a Satellite Tobacco Mosaic Virus EDIT so the origami one I show is actually quite symmetrical! But still not hugely useable since you (I) have to stare at it for a while to see it.","['polyhedra', 'combinatorics', 'coloring', 'biology']"
1850381,Differential Geometry for General Relativity,"I'm going to start self-studying General Relativity from Sean Caroll's Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity. I'd like to have a textbook on Differential Geometry/Calculus on Manifolds for me on the side. I do like mathematical rigor, and I'd like a textbook whose focus caters to my need. Having said that, I don't want a exchaustive mathematics textbook (although I'd appreciate one) that'll hinder me from going back to the physics in a timely manner. I looked for example at Lee's textbook but it seemed too advanced. I have done courses on Single and Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Analysis I and II and Topology but I'm not sure what book would be the most useful for me given that I have a knack of seeing all results formally.

1850426,Laplace Transform for Solving Differential Equation,"I solved the following task, but since I am new in this field I need to check if it is correct or if there is anything I am missing or doing wrong. Task : Solve differential equation using Laplace transform.
$$y^{''}-y^{'}-2y=2t+1 \\y^\;(0)=1, \; y^{'}(0)=2$$ First i got the following equation : $$\mathcal{L}(y)=\frac{s^3+s^2+s+2}{s^2(s^2-s-2)}$$ Now this is the part that was kinda tricky. When i fractioned equation i got this : $$\frac{A}{s}+\frac{B}{s^2}+\frac{C}{s+1}+\frac{D}{s-2}$$ The fractions were : $$A=0,\;B=-1,\;C=1,\;D=0$$ Finally the result is : $$y(t)=-t + e^{-t}$$","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'fractions', 'laplace-transform']"
