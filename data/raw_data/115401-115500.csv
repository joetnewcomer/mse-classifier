My idea was to approximate ""movement in any direction by $\Delta r$"" with the same grid approach and a discretized ring as movement kernel Keeping $\Delta r = 7$ (second ring) constant while increasing the path length and distance between the two points is equivalent to making $\Delta r$ smaller without amplifying the discretization artifacts.

It seems intuitive to me that I could find the probability of 0 arrivals in the first 30 minutes with a standard Poisson process with rate 5, and then add this probability to the probability of 0 arrivals in the second 30 minutes with a standard Poisson process with rate 3.

Conversely, show that every number with a repeating ternary expansion is a member of $\mathbb{Q}$. I can see this computationally by finding the ternary expansion for different rational numbers.

A solution of the form is said to be a solution about the ordinary point $x_0$. The distance $R$ in Theorem 6.2.1 is the minimum value or lower bound for the radius of convergence. This passage is taken from my Differential equation book and I just want to focus on the last small but confusing adjective MINIMUM VALUE used in the last quoted sentence , now it is true that if we want to center a given power series solution of a DE at a point $x_0$ we want $x_0$ to be an ordinary points , fine till here .

1691926,Minimal-dimension example of (open) subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with trivial first cohomology but nontrivial fundamental group,"As a follow-up to this question, I was wondering what dimension provides the minimal counterexample to the claims: If $U\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is an open connected set with trivial $H^1(U)$, then $\pi_1(U)$ is trivial; Same as above, but with a more general $U$. Let $m$ be the minimal counterexample's ambient space's dimension. Qiaochu's answer to the above linked question shows $m\leq 4$, since for claim 2, we have $\mathbb{RP}^2$ smoothly imbedded into $\mathbb{R}^4$ providing the example directly, whereas for claim 1 we take a tubular neighborhood of the embedded image of $\mathbb{RP}^2$, which is then open and connected, and deformation retracts (I guess, correct me if I'm wrong) onto $\mathbb{RP}^2$, thus having the same fundamental group and cohomology. Qiaochu also stated in a comment that the fundamental group of an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ is free, which I found proof-sketched here . He also stated that the Universal Coefficient Theorem (which I will sooner or later be studying for an exam) can be used to prove $H^1(U)=1\iff\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_1(U),\mathbb{R})=1$. These two facts put together imply $m_1\in\{1,3,4\}$, where $m_1$ is the $m$ for claim 1. In dimension 1, connected subsets are intervals, hence have trivial $\pi_1$. So $m_1\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $m_2\in\{3,4\}$. The 3-dimensional case seems to have claim 1 as an open problem , so I was wondering if I could get: An answer about 2 dimensions and claim 2; I'm guessing we can once more take a non open connected set in the plane and say a tubular neighborhoods of it would retract onto it, having the same fundamental group, thus concluding by Qiaochu's comment's ""nonobvious fact"" that we have no counterexamples in the plane because all fundamental groups are free; is that right? Something about the 3-dimensional case, if it is possible for claim 2; although the prhasing of that comment about the open problem seems to suggest that ""open"" does make a differnece, which would contrast with the tubular neighborhood retraction argument.

Suppose $l < h < 0$. I am trying to upper bound the probability of $P[l \leq S_n \leq h]$. Of course I can use Chernoff bound as follows :
\begin{align*}
P[l \leq S_n \leq h] \leq P[S_n \leq h] = P[S_n \leq (1 - \delta)n\mu] \leq e^{-\delta^2 n \mu^2/2}

Where $\delta = 1 - \frac{h}{n\mu}$. Substituting this value of $\delta$ gives a bound of $O(e^{-n\mu^2})$ when $n$ is large enough. Let $T_n = \frac{S_n - n\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{n}}$. Then we have 
\begin{align*}
P[l \leq S_n \leq h] = P\left[\frac{l-n\mu}{\sqrt{n}} \leq T_n \leq \frac{h - n\mu}{\sigma \sqrt{n}}\right] = F_{T_n}(\frac{h - n\mu}{\sigma \sqrt{n}}) - F_{T_n}({\frac{l-n\mu}{\sigma \sqrt{n}})}
\end{align*} Since $T_n$ converges in distribution to $N(0,1)$, I can ``use'' the central limit theorem. Let $\rho = E[|X_1 - \mu|^3]$. Then Berry-Esseen theorem states that $\forall x$, $\left|F_{T_n}(x) - \Phi(x)\right| \leq \frac{3\rho}{\sigma^3 \sqrt{n}}$. Using this theorem, we have for any $x < y$, \begin{align*}
&\left|F_{T_n}(y) - F_{T_n}(x) - \int_{x}^{y} \phi(t) dt\right| \leq \frac{6 \rho}{\sigma^3 \sqrt{n}} \\
&\Rightarrow F_{T_n}(y) - F_{T_n}(x) \leq \int_{x}^{y} \phi(t) dt + O(1/\sqrt{n})
\end{align*} Now, substituting $y = (h - n\mu)/\sigma\sqrt{n}$ and $x = (l - n\mu)/\sigma\sqrt{n}$ we get
\begin{align*}
&P[l \leq S_n \leq h] \leq  \int_{(l-n\mu)/\sigma \sqrt{n}}^{(h - n\mu)/\sigma \sqrt{n}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{t^2}{2}} dt + O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)\\
&\leq \frac{h-l}{\sigma \sqrt{n}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(h-n\mu)^2}{2n\sigma^2}} + O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
\end{align*} For large enough $n$, the upper bound on the contribution from the integral is $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}e^{-n\mu^2/2\sigma^2} )$. However, the error term of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ overwhelms it. I am curious to know whether a bound of the form $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}e^{-cn})$ for some constant $c > 0$ can be proven formally, or the bound of $O(e^{-cn})$ derived by Chernoff Inequality is the best achievable.","['probability-limit-theorems', 'large-deviation-theory', 'probability-theory', 'central-limit-theorem']"
1691962,"Integral $\int_0^1 \frac{\ln|1-x^a|}{1+x}\, dx$","Let's consider this integral: $$g(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln|1-x^a|}{1+x}\, dx$$ There is a related integral, which is more widely known. See this question , this question and this paper . $$f(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x^a)}{1+x}\, dx$$ It has a number of interesting properties, namely: $$f(a)-f(-a)=-\frac{\pi^2}{12} a$$ $$f(a)+f \left( \frac{1}{a} \right)=\ln^2 2$$ We can immediately see (by evaluating the integral as well): $$f(0)=\ln^2 2$$ $$f(1)=\frac{\ln^2 2}{2}$$ In the related paper the way is shown to get a closed form for infinitely many values of $a$. Now we consider $g(a)$. Notice the important limit: $$\lim_{a \to \pm 0} g(a)=-\infty$$ In this answer it is shown that: $$g(1)=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1-x)}{1+x}\, dx=\frac{\ln^2 2}{2}-\frac{\pi^2}{12}$$ I have not been able to find references about the general integral yet. However, the most interesting property is this obvious formula: $$g(2a)=g(a)+f(a)$$ Using it, we can find some values without explicitly evaluating the integral. $$g(2)=g(1)+f(1)=\ln^2 2-\frac{\pi^2}{12}$$ This integral also has the same symmetry relation as $f(a)$: $$g(a)-g(-a)=-\frac{\pi^2}{12} a$$ However, I have not been able to find any formula for $g(1/a)$ (the proof used for $f(a)$ fails because of the singularity at $a=0$). Here is a plot of these two integrals and their common asymptote: And here is a list of 'nice' values for $f(a)$ and $g(a)$ for integer $a$: $$

$$ I was able to find most of these values using the highlighted relations, only checking with Mathematica after the fact. Can we find more closed form expressions for $g(a)$ for some $a$, maybe using the values for $f(a)$ (see the linked paper)? What other properties of $g(a)$ can we obtain? And what is the one real solution of $g(a)=0$ (see the plot)? Also for any $a>0$ we can define $g(a)$ in terms of $f$: $$g(a)=g(2a)-f(a)=g(4a)-f(a)-f(2a)=g(8a)-f(a)-f(2a)-f(4a)$$ $$\lim_{a \to + \infty} g(a)=\lim_{a \to + \infty} f(a)=0$$ $$g(a)=- \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} f(2^k~a), ~~~~~ a>0$$ The last relation also directly follows from the well-known identity: $$\prod_{k=0}^{\infty} \left( 1+x^{2^k} \right)=\frac{1}{1-x}, ~~~~~|x|<1$$ We can also use $f(a)$ and $g(a)$ to define a whole family of integrals: $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{ka}=\frac{1-x^{na}}{1-x^a}$$ $$I_n (a)=\int_0^1 \ln \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{ka} \right) \frac{dx}{1+x}=g(na)-g(a)$$ $$J_n (a)=\int_0^1 \ln \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k x^{ka} \right) \frac{dx}{1+x}= \begin{cases}g(na)-f(a) & n=2j \\ f(na)-f(a) & n=2j+1 \end{cases} $$ For example: $$\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x+x^2+x^3)}{1+x}\, dx=g(4)-g(1)=-\dfrac{\pi ^2}{48}+\dfrac{15 \ln ^2 2}{12}$$","['reference-request', 'definite-integrals', 'calculus']"

I think I am supposed to be finding the probability that the random variable $\theta$ takes on the value of $\frac{1}{8}$ given that it is uniformly distributed over the interval [0,$\frac{1}{4}$], but isn't this probability 0 because the probability of choosing any given point in an interval is 0? I know I must be thinking about this incorrectly because I should use Bayes' rule for the second part, and $p(\theta)$ should be interpreted as the prior probability of $\theta$, which definitely should not be 0.

My approach: Call the RHS $\vartheta(\tau)$. I've shown $\vartheta$ converges normally on $\mathbb{H}$. Now, $\Delta$ is a (holomorphic) cusp form of weight $12$ on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Since the vector space of such cusp forms is one-dimensional, if we show $\vartheta$ is a cusp form then we know $\delta = \alpha \vartheta$ for some constant $\alpha$. Then examining the Fourier expansion one can show $\alpha = (2\pi)^{12}$. To show $\vartheta \in S_k$ we must check for any $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \in SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ that $\vartheta(\gamma \tau) = (c\tau+d)^{12}\vartheta(\tau)$, where $\gamma$ is the Mobius transform induced by the matrix. For this its enough to verify on the generators, which give transformations $\tau \to \tau + 1$, $\tau \to -1/\tau$. The first transformation is easy, but I can't figure out how to prove $\vartheta(-1/\tau) = \tau^{12} \vartheta(\tau)$. I did a similar problem following the exact same procedure. It was to show $(2\pi)^{-12}\Delta(\tau) = 2^{-8}(\vartheta_1\vartheta_2\vartheta_3(\tau))^8$ for similar looking functions $\vartheta_j$. I was able to recognize these functions as theta functions and manipulate the theta transformation formula. In this problem, I'm failing to get theta transformation to work. Does anyone have any ideas? It should also be noted that we have been discussing vector valued theta functions recently on quadratic lattices, so maybe this is a necessary tool. Again, I can't find a way to apply these ideas though. Another approach to the problem is using my previous exercise: note $\vartheta_1 = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}q^{n^2/2}$, $\vartheta_2 = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}(-1)^n \cdot q^{n^2/2}$, $\vartheta_3 = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}q^{(n+1/2)^2/2}$.

They comprise cards of each of five types, showing a square, circle, star, cross, or wavy lines: A standard pack contains 25 cards, five of each type. A run consists of a subject trying to guess each card in a pack in turn. If we replace and shuffle after each guess, his expected score is 5. But what if we don't replace, and we allow our subject to keep a record (or he just remembers) how many cards of each type have already come up. What is the expected score then? The answer is greater than 5. The probability of getting the 25th card right must always be 1, and that of getting the 24th card right must be either 0.5 or 1, depending on what has gone before. Similarly the probability of getting the 23rd card right cannot be smaller than 0.33. So the expected contribution to the score from the last three guesses alone is greater than 1.83. So the expected score after a run is greater than $\frac{22}{5}+1.83=6.23$. How large actually is it?

Attempt: Question 1:
It can be calculated by conditioning the first arrival. $E[X]=\int E[X|Y=y]f_Y(y)dy$, where $Y$ is the time of the first traffic. The answer is $(e^{\lambda a}-1)\lambda^{-1}$. Question 2: 
a) I think this is two indepedent poisson process each with parameter $\lambda$. Therefore, the sum of the two poisson process = $2\lambda$. So $E[X]=(e^{2\lambda a}-1)(2\lambda)^{-1}$. b)I think the answer is $2*(e^{\lambda a}-1)\lambda^{-1}$","['poisson-process', 'probability-theory', 'probability', 'random-variables']"

1692503,Gambling system theorem given by Doob,"Let$\{X_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of i.i.d. random variable. Let $\{\alpha_k\}_{k=1}^{\infty} $be a sequence of
strictly increasing finite stopping times. Then $\{X_{\alpha_k+1}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is also a sequence of i.i.d. random variable. I can prove this theorem under the assumption that the family $\{X_n,\alpha_k\}_{n,k\in\mathbb{N}}$ is independent.
Actually, to prove the independence I just prove the case of finite intersection and the independence of infinite intersection follows by taking the limit. Here is my proof: Let $\Lambda_n=\bigcap\limits_{k=1}^{n} \{X_{\alpha_k+1} \in B_k\} $ for $ n\in\mathbb{N}$ Claim: $P(\Lambda_n)=\prod\limits_{k=1}^{n}P(X_{k} \in B_k)$
$$P(\Lambda_1)=\sum\limits_{m=0}^{\infty}P(X_{m+1} \in B_1,\alpha_1=m)  \\
=\sum\limits_{m=0}^{\infty}P(X_{m+1} \in B_1)P(\alpha_1=m)  \\
=\sum\limits_{m=0}^{\infty}P(X_{1} \in B_1)P(\alpha_1=m)\\=P(X_{1} \in B_1)$$
Assume it is true for $n=N-1$. $$P(\Lambda_N)=\sum\limits_{m=N}^{\infty}P(X_{m+1} \in B_N,\alpha_N=m,\Lambda_{N-1})\\
=\sum\limits_{m=N}^{\infty}\sum\limits_{0\leq i_1 < i_2<...<i_{N-1}<m}P(X_{m+1} \in B_N,\alpha_N=m,\alpha_k=i_k,X_{i_k+1}\in B_k , k=1,2,...,N-1)  \\
=\sum\limits_{m=N}^{\infty}\sum\limits_{0\leq i_1 < i_2<...<i_{N-1}<m}P(X_{m+1} \in B_N)P(\alpha_N=m,\alpha_k=i_k,X_{i_k+1}\in B_k , k=1,2,...,N-1)  \\
=P(X_N\in B_N)P(\Lambda_{N-1})$$ As $P(X_{\alpha_k+1}\in B)=P(X_{k} \in B)$ (from the proof for n=1),
the independence is proved. And by the same reason, $P(X_{\alpha_k+1}\in B)=P(X_{k} \in B)=P(X_{1} \in B)=P(X_{\alpha_1+1}\in B)$ for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$, it is identically distributed. I am not sure whether my proof is correct. The main problem is whether assumption ""The family $\{X_n,\alpha_k\}_{n,k\in\mathbb{N}}$ is independent."" can be dropped. Since one  can take $\alpha_k $ to be the first hitting time of ${X_k} $ with some set, it is not suitable to assume this family is independent.

1693067,Differences between Quaternion integration methods,"I've implemented a Quaternion Kalman filter and i have the choice between multiple way to integrate angular velocities.
The goal is to predict futur orientation $q^{n+1}$ from current orientation $q^{n}$ and angular velocity $\vec{r}$. During the time step $\Delta_t$ separating $q^{n+1}$ from $q^{n}$, the angular velocity is said to be constant. The first method transform angular velocity $\vec{r}=[r_x \ r_y \ r_z]$ into a quaternion $q_r$ and multiply the result with the current orientation quaternion $q^n$ : $$
q_r =(a,\vec{v})\\
a = \cos{(\frac{|\vec{r}|\Delta_t}{2})} \\
\vec{v}=\sin{(\frac{|\vec{r}|\Delta_t}{2})}\frac{\vec{r}}{|\vec{r}|}\\
q^{n+1}=q^{n}q_r
$$ The second method is based on the quaternion derivative formula : 
$$
q_r =(0,\vec{r})\\
q^{n+1}=q^n+ \Delta_t(\frac{1}{2}q^nq_r)
$$ What are the fundamental differences between the two approach? What are their properties ? I understand the second one is a simple Euler integration, a crude first order approximation assuming a fixed $q$ and $\vec{r}$ during integration. At the end, we can possibly have $|q^{n+1}|$ different from unity so a normalization can be necessary. This kind of approach, based on the derivative, can easily be generalized to higher orders. On the other hand, i don't know what the first approach really is. It doesn't require any normalization. In which aspect is it an approximation ? If this integration method a numeric approximation, what's its order ?  Could a RK4 approximation be better ? Here is a similar question asked on a programming thread. No clear answer was given.

1693092,Mayer Vietoris for locally finite singular homology,"Usually one defines the traditionnal singular homology (let's say in $\mathbb{Z}$ and on a topological space $X$) by using singular $p$-chains. A singular $p$-chain is a finite formal sum $\sum c_{\sigma} \sigma$ where $\sigma$ are $p$-simplexes in $X$ and $c_{\sigma}$ integers. A well-known theorem, usually proven with barycentric decomposition is the Mayer-Vietoris theorem. Theorem : Let $\{U,V\}$ be an open covering of $X$. Then on has the following long exact sequence $$\cdots \rightarrow H_{n+1}(X) \xrightarrow\, H_{n}(U\cap V) \xrightarrow\, H_{n}(U) \oplus H_{n}(V) \xrightarrow\, H_{n}(X) \xrightarrow\, H_{n-1} (U\cap V) \rightarrow \cdots$$ Now my question is the following one. Instead of defining usual singular homology, one can define locally finite singular homology , noted $H^{lf}_{\cdot}(X)$ by using infinite formal sums $\sum c_{\sigma} \sigma$ but which are locally finite. That means that for all $x$ their is a neighbourhood $V_x$ which meets only a finite number of $supp(\sigma)$. Does Mayer-Vietoris hold in this context ? I.e, do we have a long exact sequence $$\cdots \rightarrow H^{lf}_{n+1}(X) \xrightarrow\, H^{lf}_{n}(U\cap V) \xrightarrow\, H^{lf}_{n}(U) \oplus H^{lf}_{n}(V) \xrightarrow\, H^{lf}_{n}(X) \xrightarrow\, H^{lf}_{n-1} (U\cap V) \rightarrow \cdots$$ for any open covering $\{U,V\}$ of $X$ ? This seems not easy to me because the barycentric decomposition will probably not work as in the finite case. Any help or recommandation for a book that works with locally finite homology will be much appreciated.","['algebraic-topology', 'mayer-vietoris-sequence', 'general-topology', 'homological-algebra']"
