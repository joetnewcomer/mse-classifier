1101393,Why doesn't every integral from 0 to $2\pi$ equal zero?,"Quick question, might end up having a simple answer, but I have here a ""proof"" that any integral from 0 to $2\pi$ is zero, as follows: $$\int^{2\pi}_0f(x)dx$$ Now using u-substitution, let $u = \sin x$, so $dx = \frac{du}{\cos x}$, so: $$\int^{0}_{0}\frac{f(x)du}{\cos x}$$ (The bounds were evaluated to zero due to the u-substituion). However, this is zero, since the integral goes from zero to zero. Any help as to why this is wrong would be appreciated.","['integration', 'fake-proofs']"
1101424,"Is there a name for the curve $t \mapsto (t,t^2,t^3)$?","Is there a name for the curve given by the parametrization $\{(t,t^2,t^3); t\in\mathbb R\}$? Here is a plot from WA . An another plot for $t$ from $0$ to $1$ . This curve is an example of a subset of $\mathbb R^3$ which has cardinality $\mathbb c$ and intersects every plane in at most three points. 
(See Problems and Theorems in Classical Set Theory by Péter Komjáth, Vilmos Totik, p.300 . They mention Wacław Sierpiński's book Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers as a reference.) The above fact is not very difficult to prove. (If a plane $ax+by+cz+d=0$ intersects the curve in four differen points, then the equation $d+at+bt^2+ct^3=0$ is fulfilled for 4 different values of parameter $t$. This give a system of linear equations with unknowns $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$. The matrix of this linear system is Vandermonde matrix and it is invertible . So there is only trivial solution for this linear system.) I was wondering whether this curve might have some other interesting properties. Knowing the name (if it has one) would be useful for finding some more information about it. EDIT: As the answers say, it is called twisted cubic . For other user's convenience, I will add Wikipedia link . Other pictures of this curve and some related objects can be found by Google .","['analytic-geometry', 'geometry', 'terminology', 'algebraic-curves']"
1101432,Imaginary-Order Derivative,"I would like to find the imaginary-order derivative of a function (let's just focus on a simple function for now).

1101469,When is a pseudoinverse of a matrix non-negative?,"Consider a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}, n > m$ with independent columns and non-negative entries. Consider the oblique pseudo-inverse of $A$, i.e. the matrix $A^\dagger_B = (B

There was a typo (now corrected) in the previous version of this post in the definition of $A^\dagger_B$. $A^\dagger_B$ fulfills the following Moore-Penrose conditions for any choice of $B$ such that the inverse $(B^\top A)^{-1}$ exists. (1) $A A^\dagger_B A = A$ (2) $A^\dagger_B A A^\dagger_B = A^\dagger_B$ (4) $A^\dagger_B A = I$ is symmetric The condition (3) $AA^\dagger_B$ is symmetric is only true for $B=A$, when $A^\dagger_B$ becomes the standard Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. I am aware of the following result for the special case of $B = A$, i.e. the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse: given a non-negative $A$, $A^\dagger$ is non-negative if and only if rows of $A$ are (up to a permutation) composed of rank-1 blocks orthogonal to each other (""Nonnegative Matrices in the Mathematical Sciences"", A. Berman, R. J. Plemmons, Theorem 5.2). I am wondering whether the class of matrices having the desired property is richer in the oblique case.","['matrices', 'convex-analysis', 'linear-algebra']"

Prove there's a minimum distance between $A$ and $B$. In class we've seen that there's a minimum distance between a compact set $A$, and a point $x_0\notin A$. I thought about utilizing it as a generalization. First we may assume the points (if exist) must be on the spheres of the sets. For each $x_0$ in the sphere of $B$ there's a point $y_0$ in the sphere of  $A$ such that $\forall y\in A: \|y_0-x_0\| \le \|y-x_0\|$.

1101743,Axioms as recreational mathematics,"Before modern group theory, mathematicians studied concrete permutation groups: algebraically closed subsets of the set of all bijections on a set $X$ in which all inverses was included. This was the kind of groups studied by Galois and others. Then the axioms were abstracted from the concrete example and it was proved that any abstract group was isomorphic to a concrete group. I'm trying to repeat this process with different concrete structures on sets, as 
$\mathcal P(X)$ and $\text{End}(X)$, just for fun . Both of these examples seems more complicated, however. $\text{Aut}(X)$ rather obvious boils down to an associative composition $\circ$, an identity $e$ and an inverse $f^{-1}$ for all functions $f\in\text{Aut}(X)$. But how to deal with $\text{End}(X)$? Again there is an associative composition $\circ$ and an identity $e$, which point towards monoids. But here it seems to exist hidden structures: unlike for bijections (and surjections), there is a non-trivial function $\text{Im}:\text{End}(X)\to \mathcal P(X)$, that makes algebraically closed subsets (including $e$) of $\text{End}(X)$ to somewhat special monoids. And the question is, how to formulate the axioms for this concrete structure? One idea would be to study a monoid action on sets $$\text{End}(X)\times\mathcal P(X)\to\mathcal P(X),\;(f,A)\mapsto f(A)$$ but that ends up in finding axioms for the $\mathcal P(X)$-structure with it's own more or less hidden structures. Is there a way to abstract axioms for $\text{End}(X)$ without dealing with $\mathcal P(X)$? I'm interested in canonically pre-structured sets. The simplest one is $X\times X$ with the structures 
$\displaystyle X\times X\overset {p_1,p_2}{\longrightarrow} X,\;p_i(x_1,x_2)=x_i$. 
Obviously there are no more structures. For the sets of all bijections $Bij(X)$ or surjections $Sur(X)$ on a set $X$ it is rather obvious that there is one canonical structure: $Bij(X)\times Bij(X)\to Bij(X)$ etc. Now suppose the example $N(X)$ has a binary $N(X)\times N(X)\to N(X)$ structure and a topological structure, canonically. If you're only interested in one of those structures you might describe the axioms for that structure and try to show that all the abstract objects are isomorphic with a concrete subset of $N(X)$. But it might also be of interest to find the axioms for both structures and their interaction. An abstract monoid doesn't have an extra structure corresponding to $\text{Im}:\text{End}(X)\to \mathcal P(X)$, but the functions in End$(X)$ do have it.","['boolean-algebra', 'elementary-set-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'axioms', 'recreational-mathematics']"

1101838,How can I improve my explanation that the ratio $\theta=\frac{s}{r}$ that defines the radian measure holds for all circles?,"I'm trying to demonstrate why the ratio $\theta=\frac{s}{r}$ (where $s$ is an arc measuring some $s$ -units in length and $r$ is the radius of the circle) which defines the radian measure holds for all circles.  I'm attempting to show this by using two circles, one of radius $1$ and another radius $r$ . I would like to know if there is anything pertinent that I can add, or that is wrong with this explanation, or perhaps you could put forward a better explanation of your own. I don't think it's rigorous, so go easy. This is what I have so far: Consider the Unit Circle centered at the origin $O$ . Let $P$ be the point on the terminal side of the central angle $\theta$ that lies on the Unit Circle. Let the point $A(1,0)$ be the point on the Unit Circle that lies on the positive $x$ -axis. Consider another circle with radius $r$ (with $r>1$ ) that is also centered at the origin $O$ . Let $Q$ be the point on the terminal side of the central angle $\theta$ that lies on the circle with radius $r$ . Let the point $B(r,0)$ be the point on the circle with radius $r$ that lies on the positive $x$ -axis. Here's a diagram: Given that arcs $QB$ and $PA$ subtend the same central angle $\theta$ they are similar, and as the circle segments are congruent this must mean the radiuses are also similar, so we can write: $\frac{\text{arc PA}}{\text{arc QB}}=\frac{OP}{OQ}$ As $OP=1$ and $OQ=r$ we have: $\frac{\text{arc PA}}{\text{arc QB}}=\frac{1}{r}$ Both arc $PA$ and $QB$ are segments of the circumference, and can be written as, $PA=2\pi r k$ where $0<k<1$ and represents the fraction of the circumference that the arc constitutes. As $r=1$ in the case of arc $PA$ we have $PA=2\pi (1) k=2\pi k $ . Similarly arc $QB=2\pi r k$ , so we now have: $\frac{2\pi k}{2\pi r k}=\frac{1}{r}$ $\frac{2\pi k}{1}=\frac{2\pi r k}{r}$ This equals the ratio which we have defined to be the radian measure: $\theta=\frac{s}{r}=\frac{2\pi r k}{r}$ . Therefore we can conclude. I lost my way towards the end as I don't know how to conclude this; help would be appreciated.

(a) Find a binary operation $\ast$ on $\mathbb{Q}$ such that $f:(\mathbb{Q},+) \to (\mathbb{Q},\ast)$ is an isomorphism. Here's my work. Is it correct? Since $f(x)$ is bijective, we just need to find a binary operation $\ast$ such that $f: (\mathbb{Q},+) \to (\mathbb{Q},\ast)$ is a homomorphism. Define $\ast:\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$ as $(a,b) \mapsto a + b + 1$.

Taking the countour $\gamma_R$ to be the half-circle that lies in the upper-half of the complex plane and whose radius is $R$, we can show that the residue of the integrand at the pole at $ia$ (as you can clearly see above, $e^{-itx}$ is entire) multiplied by $2\pi i$ will give us the value of the improper integral above. I have shown my calculations below. It seems that I am missing an absolute value sign in my answer, but I can't see where it comes into play, even when $x<0$. Could you point out my mistake(s)? Calculations Replace all the $t$'s with $z$'s in the integral above. $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-izx}}{(z-ia)(z+ia)}dz$$ Now we are in the complex domain, and this integral represents integrating the integrand over the real line, going from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. So we consider the semicircle contour $\gamma_R$. If $R \rightarrow \infty$, integrating the part of the contour on the real line will give us our original integral. With that said, we apply the residue theorem. We know that integrating over the entire semicircle can be simplified by the residue theorem, and the only residue that we need to calculate is that at the pole $ia$ (which is inside the contour). $$2 \pi i \textrm{Res} (f; ia) = \left. \frac{e^{-itx}}{t+ia}\right|_{t=ia} = \frac{\pi}{a}e^ax$$ But what I just got only applies to the entire contour $\gamma_R$, not the horizontal line in specific. I now show that it actually does apply to the horizontal line in specific (the real line), as the top part of this semicircle goes to $0$ as $R \rightarrow \infty$. $$
\left| \int_{\textrm{top half}} \frac{e^{-izx}}{z^2+a^2}dz \right| \leq \pi R \left|\frac{1}{a^2-R^2}\right|, \, \rightarrow 0 \,\, \textrm{ as } R \rightarrow \infty
$$ So the top-half doesn't matter when $R$ is sufficiently big. This finally leaves us with $$\mathcal{F}\left[\frac{1}{t^2+a^2}\right](x)=\frac{\pi}{a}e^{ax}$$","['residue-calculus', 'fourier-analysis', 'complex-analysis']"
1101876,Is Archimedes's method for computing volumes equivalent to Cavalieri's?,"Encyclopaedia Britannica is unequivocal: ""It turned out that Archimedes had used a method later known as Cavalieri’s principle, which involves slicing solids (whose volumes are to be compared) with a family of parallel planes."" I suppose it's true that both are based on slicing, but Cavalieri's calculation for sphere and cylinder only needs a simple comparison of cross sections, whereas Archimedes's requires a diagram with a tangle of lines, and a lever with unequal arms to balance the pieces. Also in Cavalieri's case the sphere is inscribed into the cylinder, while in Archimedes's it has only half the cylinder's radius, and Cavalieri's cone is inverted compared to Archimedes's. Can somebody explain the exact relationship between Archimedes's and Cavalieri's use of slicing?

My first thought was to take the expression for the arbitrary circle and the line, and solve the systems that the intersections generate, then taking into account that since they are tangent, there can only be a single solution. Since the equations are quadratic, this would then probably boil down to forcing the discriminant of a quadratic polynomial to be $0$ so that it only yields a single solution.

1101948,The Underlying Manifolds of the Special Unitary Lie Groups SU(n),"I want to find the underlying manifolds of Lie Groups $\mbox{SU}(n)$ for general $n$. $$ \quad $$ My lecturer told us last year that the only n-spheres that admit a Lie group structure are $\mathbb{S}^1$ and $\mathbb{S}^3$. Moreover I see several question describing why this is so, such as here and here , and understand the arguments therein. However each Lie group must have some underlying manifold by definition. However I do not know how to find what the manifold is for any given Lie group. $$ \quad $$ My motivation for this question is to understand the Lie algebra relation
$$ \mathfrak{su}(4) \simeq \mathfrak{so}(6) $$
and as such there is some relation between the Lie groups $\mbox{SU}(4)$ and $\mbox{SO}(6)$, with my neive guess being $$ \mbox{SU}(4) / \mathbb{Z}_2 \simeq \mbox{SO}(6) $$ I don't have any very good reason for this however, but it feels right. I note that $$ \mbox{dim}[\mbox{SU}(4)] = 15 \quad \mbox{ and } \quad \mbox{dim}[\mbox{SO}(6)] = 15$$ so we don't immediately think that no such relation should exist. Moreover, I'm encouraged by the relation $\mbox{SU}(2) / \mathbb{Z}_2 \simeq \mbox{SO}(3) $, which I understand and can calculate. Explicitly, one first notes that both $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{so}(3)$ have the same Lie algebra, namely $$ [T_i, T_j ] = \varepsilon^{ijk} T_k $$ Then one shows that $\mbox{SU}(2)$ has the 3-sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$ as underlying manifold, since any $U \in \mbox{SU}(2)$ can be written like $$ U = a_0 I_2 + i \vec{a} \cdot \vec{\sigma} $$ with $$ a_0^2 + \vec{a} \cdot \vec{a} = 1 $$ and this is the equation for the unit 3-sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$, while it can be shown that $\mbox{SO}(3)$ has underlying manifold $\mathbb{RP}^3$, and it remains to note that $\mathbb{S}^3$ is a double cover of $\mathbb{RP}^3$, which motivates the quotient by $\mathbb{Z}_2$, leading to the result. Now, I have tried thinking about using this approach in my case of $\mbox{SU}(4)$ and $\mbox{SO}(6)$, but I make no progress. $$ \quad $$ Perhaps a related point, we can show that the action of $\mbox{SU}(2)$ on $\mathbb{C}^2 \simeq \mathbb{R}^4$ has as orbits 3-spheres $\mathbb{S}^3$ by considering the fact that that the action of $\mbox{SU}(2)$ on $\mathbb{C}^2$ preserves the Hilbert norm, giving a constraint $$ ||\vec{z}||^2 = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = x_1^2 +y_1^2 + x_2^2 +y_2^2 $$ for $\vec{z} = (z_1,z_2) = (x_1 + i y_1, x_2 + i y_2) \in \mathbb{C}^2$. Now this I have had success (I hope!) in generalising, and I find that the action of $\mbox{SU}(n)$ on $\mathbb{C}^n \simeq \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ should have as orbits (2n-1)-spheres $\mathbb{S}^{2n-1} \subset \mathbb{R}^{2n}$. I am unsure if this actually helps me with my original question however. $$ \quad $$ Finally, I'll note that my motivation for wanting to find a relation between $\mbox{SU}(4)$ and $\mbox{SO}(6)$ comes from studying the AdS/CFT correspondence (I'm a TP). In $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory we get one vector supermultiplet of states, which can be written as one $\mathcal{N}=1$ vector supermultiplet and three $\mathcal{N}=1$ chiral supermultiplet, consisting of a total of four gauge vector fields $A_{\mu}^i(x)$ and six scalar fields $\phi^{[ij]}(x)$ for $i = 1,2,3,4$ which then have an $\mbox{SU}(4)$ R-symmetry (an $\mathcal{N}=N$ supersymmetric field theory has an $\mbox{SU}(N)$ R-symmetry). However, in order to compare this to the type IIB superstring theory on $AdS_5 \times \mathbb{S}^5$ we need to match this $\mbox{SU}(4)$ R-symmetry with the $\mbox{SO}(6)$ rotation symmetry of the 5-sphere \mathbb{S}^5$. In the AdS/ CFT papers that I have read the TPs (who are not known for making accurate group theoretic statements! (See, for example, the top of page 30 and the bottom of page 72 of what is otherwise a brilliantly clear paper 0712.0689 ) ) simply write $\mbox{SU}(4) \simeq\mbox{SO}(6)$, which I know is deffinitely not correct! For starters, $\mbox{SU}(4)$ is simply connected, while $\mbox{SO}(6)$ is not (my thanks to QMechanic for pointing this nice quick check out to me many questions ago!). $$ \quad $$ To conlude, I want to find the relation between $\mbox{SU}(4)$ and $\mbox{SO}(6)$, and I think that not being able to find the underlying manifold of either $\mbox{SU}(4)$ or $\mbox{SO}(6)$ is what is stopping me (of course, perhaps I'm taking the complete incorrect approach...).

1101953,The sum of three colinear rational points is equal to $O$,"I'm working on a problem, Show that in an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ the sum of three colinear rational points of it is equal to $O$ exactly when the neutral element of the group $E(\mathbb{Q})$ , $O$ is an inflection point of the curve. I found the following in my notes. Let $C$ be a cubic curve that is defined over a field $k$ and let $O \in C(k)$ . $O$ is an inflection point if and only if $P+Q+R=O$ , where $P, Q, R$ are three intersection points of $C$ with a line. Proof: If $P, Q, R$ are three intersection points of $C$ with a line, then $R=PQ$ . Now, $-R=P+Q$ if and only if $-R=(OO)R=O(PQ)=P+Q$ . This holds exactly when $(OO)R=OR$ or $O=OO$ , i.e. exactly when $O$ is an inflection point. Could you explain this to me? I understand that if $P, Q, R$ are three intersection points of $C$ with a line, then $R=PQ$ , but I am facing difficulties with the remaining. EDIT : Could we say it as follows? Let $R$ be a point of the curve. We have that $R+(-R)=O$ . To add the points $R,-R$ we find the third intersection point of the line $(R,-R)$ and the curve, which is $R(-R)$ . Then we take the line $(R(-R),O)$ . The third intersection point is $R+(-R)=O$ . That means that the line $(R(-R),O)$ is the tangent at $O$ . Since $R(-R)$ is the third intersection point of the tangent at $O$ , it should be $R(-R)=OO$ . If we take the line $(OO,R)$ the third intersection point is $(OO)R$ . So $(OO)R=-R$ . So we have that the following relation holds: $P+Q=(PQ)O$ , where $P,Q$ are points of the elliptic curve and $-R=(OO)R$ . $P,Q,R$ are collinear, so let $R=PQ$ . Then \begin{align}P+Q+R=O \iff &P+Q=-R \\ \iff &(PQ)O=(OO)R \\ \implies &RO=(OO)R\end{align} so $(OO,R)=(R,O),$ Since the lines are the same it has to hold $OO=O$ . Does this mean that $O$ is an inflection point? Have we shown in this way both directions?","['algebraic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves', 'abstract-algebra']"

1102117,Question about Definition of Boundary in Stokes' Theorem,"I was wondering if what my teacher said was correct and complete in that in Stokes' Theorem the ""boundary curve"" of a surface can be defined as the mapping along the boundary of the two-dimensional region from which the surface is parameterized. For example, if a surface $\mathbf r(u,v)$ is a mapping from the u-v plane to x-y-z space, then the boundary of $\mathbf r(u,v)$ is the curve that you get from mapping from the u-v plane to x-y-z along the boundary of the domain region in the u-v plane.
Thanks in advance! Edit: I was discussing with my teacher and we think the above is the case (although I would really like someone to please confirm) but interestingly depending on how you parameterize a surface you may get similar but not exactly the same results for the boundary curve by following the above method, although you do get equivalent results if you account for direction, and the same answer via two parametrization makes me think I'm on the right track. To demonstrate what I mean let me use an example. Call the surface S the part of the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=4$ above the plane $z=1$. The boundary curve is obviously the intersection of the plane and the sphere, that is the circle $x^2+y^2=3$ (and $z=1$). It seems from the fact that we can get this result using the method that traces the out the boundary curve by mapping to the surface along the domain using two different parametrizations that this definition of a boundary curve is correct (though note that the spherical one requires that two parts cancel each other out). Example: Cartesian Coordinates We can write the surface S as $\mathbf r(x,y)= \big<x,y,\sqrt{4-x^2-y^2}\big>$ (where we take the positive root since $z\geq1 \rightarrow z\geq0$). Now, the surfaces is a mapping of  all $(x,y)$ from the ""filled-in circle"" $x^2+y^2\leq3$ to it via $z=\sqrt{4-x^2-y^2}$, so tracing along the boundary of the planar domain region $x^2+y^2\leq3$, that is, $x^2+y^2=3$, and mapping to the surface gives the boundary curve $x^2+y^2=3$ with $z=1$ (the first part of which is given by the fact that the domain of the curve we are tracing along the surface is $x^2+y^2=3$ and the $z=1$ part we got from plugging in). Now in spherical coordinates we get a similar result for the boundary curve. Spherical Coordinates We can write S as $\mathbf r(\phi,\theta) = \big<2\sin\phi\cos\theta,2\sin\phi\sin\theta,2\cos\phi\big> $ where $0\leq\theta\leq2\pi$ and $0\leq\phi\leq\frac{\pi}{3}$. This gives us a rectangular domain in the ""$\phi$-$\theta$"" plane (where $\phi$ is where the x-axis would be and $\theta$ where the y-axis would be and the surface is a mapping from the rectangle into x-y-z space) bounded by the coordinate axis and the lines $\theta = 2\pi$ and $\phi=\frac{\pi}{3}$. Update: Here's an image: Going along the bottom ($\theta =0, \phi$ varying to $\frac{\pi}{3}$) gives us a downward arch along the sphere from the top to the bounding circle. Similarly, going along the right gives us the bounding circle, going along the top gives the arch but in the opposite direction (so they cancel -- I presume) and at $\phi=0$ moving down the last side of the rectangle (where $\theta$ is varying from $2\pi$ back to $0$) all we get is a point which doesn't contribute to the curve leaving us with the same boundary curve to S. To recap, as we map to the surface alone the boundary of the domain, we go from the ""north pole"", down a longitude to the 60-degree latitude, around the latitude 360 degrees and back up the same longitude to the north pole, gibing us the boundary circle. In both cases you get the ""boundary ring"" by mapping to the surface along the boundary of the planar domain region. I was wondering if this method can be a general definition of the boundary of a surface. If someone could confirm or correct that would be great.","['multivariable-calculus', 'differential-geometry', 'definition', 'vector-analysis', 'surfaces']"

1102156,Why does notation for functions seem to be abused and ambiguous?,"I really need to clear up a few things about function notation; I
can't seem to grasp how to interpret it. As of right now, I know that
a function is roughly a mapping between a set $X$ and a set $Y$, where no
element of $X$ is paired with more than one element of $Y$. This seems
simple enough. I know that this function is commonly denoted by a
single letter, such as $f$, $g$, or $h$. I also that when it comes to
""rules"" for function, $f$ denotes the set of mathematical instructions
that tell how to find an output in set $Y$ given an input in set $X$. $x$ is
the input, $f$ is the function, and $f(x)$ is the result of applying f to
an input $x$, i.e., the output. My main question is, why do many authors
say call $f(x)$ the function? This really confuses me, since $f(x)$ is a
variable for a real number, and not a mapping between two different
sets. Following from this, why do some say that an expression such as
$2x + 5$ is a function? As stated before, this seems to just be a
variable quantity that varies with $x$, but is not a function itself.
Finally, if it's true that $x$ is the input, $f$ is the function, and $f(x)$
is the output, then why do we manipulate functions, like $f$, through
the output $f(x)$? For example, we have the image of $x$ under $f$, $f(x) =
2x^2 + 5x$. The only way to find $f'$ (the derivative of $f$) is to
manipulate $f(x)$. If we're manipulating functions, then why must we
reference an input variable $x$ in the process? Why do we have to have
$f(x)$ in order to find the derivative of $f$? One of the most confusing aspects about function notation is the
differentiation operator. $dy/dx$ represents the ""infinitesimal"" change
in $y$ with respect to the ""infinitesimal"" change in $x$, and since $y =
f(x)$, we can write $df(x)/dx$. The confusing aspect of this is, we say
""take the derivative of the function $f(x)$""; however, $f(x)$ can't be a
function because it is equal to $y$, which is a variable quantity, not a
function. To add to the confusion, we say that the differentiation
operator $d/dx$ maps a function, $f$, to its derivative, $f'$. However, as
with $df(x)/dx$, we need $f(x)$ in order to transform the function $f$ into
$f'$. This seems very confusing, because then it seems that the
derivative operator, $d/dx$, actually maps $f(x)$ to $f'(x)$, since we need $f(x)$ to calculate the derivative. The differentiation operator is just an example of a more broad
frustration with function notation. To recap, I know that $x$ is the input, $f$ is the
function, and $f(x)$ is the image of $x$ under $f$, which can often be given
by an algebraic expression. I know that $f$ is a mapping, so $f: x \mapsto
f(x)$. This means that $f$ is the function that maps $x$ to an output $f(x)$.
I've determined this for myself, but I always stumble when I see
authors or other people refer to $f(x) = $ ""some expression"" as the
function. It is clear that $x$ is a variable of a
real number, and $f(x)$ is a variable of a real number that is dependent
on $x$. Then, $f$ is the function, the mapping that links $x$ to $f(x)$; yet ,
people insist on saying that something like $2x + 1$ is a function.
Additionally, I know that differentiation is an operator $d/dx: f \mapsto
f'$. However, in order to calculate derivatives, we are not given a
function $f$, we are given the image of $x$ under $f$, $f(x)$. This means that it seems that the
differentiation operator should be $d/dx: f(x) \mapsto f'(x)$. However, I do not think this is right, and it is one of the main points of my confusion. EDIT: Looking at some of the comments, I have one additional question. When we define a function, we usually do so by writing $f: X \rightarrow Y$, such that $f(x) = 5x^2$, for example. My additional question is, why is it necessary to, in order to define the rule for a function, use a variable x as the input in the function? Why don't we define functions like $f(~)$, with no reference to any variables, since we are specifying the action of the function, not the image of $x$ under $f$...","['notation', 'functions']"

By [CRT] this provides $4\cdot182=728$ solutions over $\mathbb Z_{26}$ for the subcase $\det(K)=-1$. The case $\det(K)=1$ provided $8$ matrices in my analysis.

In particular, there is a non-nuclear non-Banach space of this type that is defined as an intersection of weighted sequence spaces. Let $\ell_2(w)$ denote  a weighted sequence space; $a\in \ell_2(w)$ if \begin{equation}
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(a(n)w(n)\right)^2 < \infty.
\end{equation} Considering the weights $w_{\epsilon}(n) = n^{\epsilon}$, the set \begin{equation}
\bigcap_{\epsilon>0} \ell_2(w_{\epsilon}),
\end{equation}
with the initial topology is neither Banach nor nuclear.","['topological-vector-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

The aim of the game is to have each hex contain the numbers 1-6 on its edges.

The other two edges can be any number as long as the first rule isn't broken. Below, I have completed a small section by hand as an example: Can this pattern propagate to a hex grid of infinite size and does it repeat?

b) none of the 6 girls will get more than 50 coins. for a, i know that what you do in these situation is you say that the answer is equal to the answer of x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 = 100, but x1 has to be lower than 10 so you change it to y - 10  x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 +x6 = 100, move the 10 to the other side and you get 90... than you split it between 6. i'm not sure about it because the minus before the y bugs me. as for b, If this is the right way to do it i'll get 205 chooses 200 (if i change the x to 50 - y), still not sure.

1102818,constant-curvature Riemannian metric for Bring's surface,"There is a well-known and very symmetric space that is called either ""Bring's curve"" or ""Bring's surface"", depending upon the context.  (Bring was a Swedish mathematician in the 18th century.)   Let's here call it simply $B$ .  In brief, I am looking for an explicit formula for a constant-curvature Riemannian metric on $B$ . If we treat quintuples of complex numbers $[z_0,...,z_4]$ as the homogeneous coordinates of points in complex projective 4-space, then $B$ consists of all solutions of the three simultaneous equations $\sum_i z_i=0$ , $\sum_i z_i^2=0$ , and $\sum_i z_i^3=0$ .  The first of those equations is linear, cutting out a projective 3-space.  The second equation gives a quadric surface in that 3-space, while the third gives a cubic surface.  Bring's curve $B$ is the complete intersection of those two surfaces, which is a nonsingular sextic curve in complex projective 3-space.  So $B$ is a complex $1$ -manifold.  Since we can permute the five coordinates freely, $B$ has at least an $S_5$ of automorphisms -- in fact, it has exactly those 120 automorphisms.  We can also take the complex conjugates of all five coordinates; so there are also 120 antiautomorphisms. If we work over the real numbers, rather than over the complexes, we view $B$ as a smooth, orientable manifold of real dimension 2 and of genus 4.  It has 240 automorphisms, 120 of which preserve orientation and 120 of which reverse it. ​As a complex 1-manifold, Bring's curve $B$ comes to us with a conformal structure.  Unless I am confused, it follows from the Uniformization Theorem that $B$ can be equipped with a Riemannian metric, compatible with that conformal structure, under which its Gaussian curvature is the constant $-1$ . Question 1: Is that metric unique?  To remain compatible with the conformal structure, our only freedom is a positive-real magnification factor at each point.  And it might be the case that the smooth function giving this magnification factor is uniquely determined by the requirement that the resulting Gaussian curvature turn out to be everywhere $-1$ .  But maybe not. Question 2: Whatever the answer to Question 1, I am trying to find an explicit description of some constant-curvature metric.  If there are multiple such metrics, then choose some simple one. If we equip $B$ with such a metric, we can then lay $B$ out in the hyperbolic plane, getting a repeating pattern.  Given the structure of the automorphism group, we can tile a fundamental domain of that pattern with 240 hyperbolic triangles, each of which has vertex angles of $\pi/5$ , $\pi/4$ , and $\pi/2$ --- that is, 36, 45, and 90 degrees.  Let's call those triangles ""basic triangles"".  The page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbifold_notation#mediaviewer/File:H2checkers_245.png shows the hyperbolic plane tiled by basic triangles; but note that there are various subsets of 240 of them that constitute a fundamental domain.  The area of each basic triangle is $\pi/20$ , leading to a total area for the fundamental domain of $12\pi$ , as the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem requires for a surface of genus 4.  And any one of the basic triangles can be taken to any other, either by an automorphism, if the two triangles are the same color in the picture above, or by an antiautomorphism, if they are opposite colors. I know explicit formulas, in terms of the coordinates $[z_i]$ , for the vertices and edges of all of the basic triangles, as I will describe in a moment.  But that's all that I have managed to do so far. Given the coordinates $[z_0,...,z_4]$ of some point along one of the edges of a basic triangle, I would like to be able to compute the distances from that point to the two vertices at the endpoints of the edge.  Finally, I would like to compute distances also for points in the interiors of the triangles. Here are further details, in case anyone is still reading. The 36-degree vertex of any basic triangle is, in fact, the 36-degree vertex of ten basic triangles.  So there are 240/10 = 24 such vertices, and we'll call them Type A.  The 45-degree vertex of any triangle is the 45-degree vertex of eight triangles.  So there are 240/8 = 30 such, which we'll call Type B.  And the 90-degree vertex of any triangle is the 90-degree vertex of four triangles.  So there are 240/4 = 60 such, which we'll call Type C. The paper ""Bring's curve"", by W. L. Edge, published in volume 2-18 of the Journal of the London Math. Society in 1978, pages 539-545, gives explicit formulas for the coordinates of these various vertices.  For vertices of Type A, let $\epsilon:=e^{2 \pi i/5}$ be a primitive fifth root of unity, and then freely permute these coordinates: $$[1, \epsilon, \epsilon^2, \epsilon^3, \epsilon^4].$$ There are 120 ways to permute those five coordinates, of course, but the homogeneity of the coordinates means that we can multiply by any nonzero complex number, and multiplying by powers of $\epsilon$ puts those 120 permutations into groups of size 5, of which there must be 24. The vertices of Type B result from freely permuting the coordinates: $$[0, 1, i, -1, -i].$$ Again, there are 120 ways to permute those coordinates, but multiplying by any power of $i$ puts them into groups of size 4, of which there must be 30. The vertices of Type C are a bit more complicated.  Let $\alpha$ , $\beta$ , and $\gamma$ denote the three roots of the cubic polynomial $z^3+2z^2+3z+4$ .  Then, the Type C vertices result from permuting the coordinates: $$[1, 1, \alpha, \beta, \gamma].$$ The 120 permutations come in pairs that differ only in swapping the two copies of 1; so we get precisely the 60 vertices of Type C. Now, these vertices lie along various hyperbolic lines.  Let's refer to the edges of a basic triangle as being of Type a, Type b, or Type c, where the edge of Type a is opposite the vertex of Type A, and so forth.  So the edges of Type c are the hypotenuses of their triangles, those of Type b are the longer legs, and those of Type a are the shorter legs. In the resulting tiling, there are lines of two types, say Type 1 and Type 2.  A line of Type 1 passes through vertices in the pattern $(A B A C)^4$ .  So it passes through eight vertices of Type A, four of Type B, and four of Type C.  In the process, it travels along eight edges of Type c and eight of Type b, in the repeating pattern $(c c b b)^4$ .  So there must be 15 lines of Type 1, which travel along a total of 120 edges of Type c and 120 of Type b --- each such edge acting as an edge for two of the 240 basic triangles. A line of Type 2 passes through vertices in the pattern $(B C)^6$ .  In the process, it travels along twelve edges, all of Type a.  So there must be 10 lines of Type 2, which travel along the 120 edges of Type a. The formulas for these lines must involve something beyond complex arithmetic, and that extra something is complex conjugation.  Let consider lines of Type 2 first.  One such line consists of all points for which $[z_0,...,z_4]$ coincides, homogeneously, with $[\bar z_1,\bar z_0,\bar z_2,\bar z_3,\bar z_4]$ .  That is, we swap the first two coordinates and we conjugate all five coordinates.  If that combined process leaves us where we started, homogeneously, then the point where we started lies on our current example of a line of Type 2, which we might call ""the (0,1) line of Type 2"".  The ten lines of Type 2 are determined by the ten ways of choosing which two coordinates to swap. Lines of Type 1 are similar, but we swap two pairs of coordinates, rather than just one.  There are fifteen ways to choose two separate pairs of coordinates to swap, and those choices give rise to the fifteen lines of Type 1. As we move along any line of either type, consider the ratio $r:=z_i/z_j$ , for some fixed indices $i$ and $j$ .  The ratio $r$ moves along one of five algebraic curves in the complex plane, which one depending upon how the indices $i$ and $j$ relate to the pairs of coordinates that get swapped -- a single pair for a line of Type 2 or two pairs for a line of Type 1.  The five resulting curves turn out to be of degrees 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12, and it might be helpful to study how they cut up the Riemann sphere. But those curves, along with all of the other structure discussed so far, are forced by how the automorphisms behave on $B$ .  Is the entire constant-curvature metric also forced?  And, if so, how?","['hyperbolic-geometry', 'riemann-surfaces', 'differential-geometry']"

Suppose for the sake of contradiction $\exists x_0\in[a,b] \text{ such that } f(x_0)= D> 0$ Since the function is continuous at $x_0$, we have

$$-D/2 \leq f(x)-f(x_0)\leq D/2$$
$$-D/2 \leq f(x) - D$$
