102470,Convexity of Entropy function,"Prove $(x+y)^{x+y}\ge x^x y^y$, subject to constraints $x>1$ and $y>1$. More generally, what other functions besides $x^x$ and $x\ln(x)$ satisfy this inequality? (I vaguely remember a paper where a well known distribution measure, which name unfortunately escapes me, was considered together with standard entropy). Edit: For $x\ln(x)$ we are looking into $(x+y)\ln(x+y)\ge x\ln(x) + y\ln(y)$. In fact, here is original formulation of the problem: ""Prove that the standard partition lattice order is consistent with total order of partition entropy values"". The second part of my question is if there is alternative function on set partitions which agrees with lattice of partitions. Edit2: I was looking into Gini Index : $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=0}^n p_i(1-p_i)$.",['algebra-precalculus']
102476,"$f\geq 0$, continuous and $\int_a^b f=0$ implies $f=0$ everywhere on $[a,b]$","This is problem 6.2 from the 3rd edition of Principles of Mathematical Analysis. Problem 6.2 : Suppose $f\geq 0$, f is continuous on $[a, b]$, and $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = 0$. Prove that $f(x)=0$ for all $x \in [a, b]$. I'm looking for a critique of my proof. It's a pretty easy problem, but I am always wary of making too bold of assumptions, especially on these low level/fundamental proofs. I'll be using Rudin's notation and refer to theorems from the text (If I should include the text of each theorem, feel free to leave a comment... I'm lazy but could probably use the TeX practice :p) Proof : Assume, for contradiction, that $f>0$. Then, for any partition $P$ we have the Lower Riemann Sum: $L(P, f)=\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \, \Delta x_i$. At least one $\Delta x_i$ must be positive, since $a < b$, and each $m_i$ must be positive since we have $f>0$ by assumption, so certainly $\sup f > 0$. That means $L(P, f)>0$. Thus, we have:
$$0 = 0(b-a) < L(P,f)\leq \sup L(P, f) = \inf U(P,f) =L$$
where the last string of equalities holds because our function is continuous on a compact interval, so is integrable by theorems 6.8 and 6.6. So our integral has value $L>0$. This is in contradiction to our given assumption that $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = 0$, so we must have that $f=0$ on $[a, b]$. $\Box$ So, I am wondering if my proof is correct (and is presented well). Also if someone could enlighten me as to what Rudin means when he say ""Compare this with exercise 1,"" I'd be appreciative. Is it a hint or is there something else he expects you to notice? there are a lot of things I could compare :)... Exercise 6.1: Suppose $\alpha$ increases on $[a, b]$, $a \leq x_0 \leq b$, $\alpha$ is continuous at $x_0$, $f(x_0)=1$, and $f(x)=0$ if $x\neq x_0$.

102480,Showing a distribution is not complete for a parameter $\theta$,"I am trying to show that a normal distribution with parameters $\mu = 0$ and variance $\theta$ is not complete. I am looking for a function $u(x)$ that is not equal to 0 such that $\mathbb E(u(x)) = 0$. I have done some research on this problem and I have found that $\bar{X}$ and $S$ (sample standard deviation) are independent and can help yield me a function that will give me $\mathbb E(u(x)) = 0$. I know that $\bar{X}$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $\theta/n$. I know that $S^2$ has a chi-squared distribution. I was trying to take an expectation $\mathbb E(\bar{X} S^2)$ to yield a value of 0, but I am not sure how exactly to do that. Also, would this approach be correct in showing that it is not complete for $\theta$? EDIT:

102482,How badly can Dini's theorem fail if the p.w. limit isn't continuous?,"Dini's theorem is commonly seen in real analysis courses (possibly with the requirement that $X$ be a compact metric space if topological spaces are still off in the future), but suppose one wanted to give an example of how much it can fail without the requirement that the pointwise limit of the sequence of functions is continuous. The problem therefore is: Exhibit a sequence of continuous functions $f_n: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ pointwise monotonically decreasing to a function $f: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ such that the set of points where $f$ is discontinuous has measure $1$ . This could for example be used to demonstrate how poorly behaved the Riemann integral is with respect to pointwise limits since the sequence $(f_n)$ is pretty much as nice as you can possibly get without being uniformly convergent and $f$ is obviously Lebesgue integrable, but it ""maximally fails"" to satisfy Lebesgue's criterion for Riemann integrability. Additionally, it would demonstrate the existence of comeagre Lebesgue null sets because the set of points where $f$ is continuous is comeagre by the Baire-Osgood theorem (does anyone have a good free online reference for this?

102496,Average percent increase not equal to total percent increase?,"I tried searching around for this but it was difficult to boil down the search terms. Plus nothing seemed to be showing up anyway. What's an easy way to show that the average percentage increase of n numbers will not equal the total percentage increase of the before/after summed n numbers? Yes, one could work out an example but it still doesn't make it apparently clear. I worked out a small example to illustrate my intuition. Initial    %       Final

Total % 
Increase    = (Final Sum - Inital Sum) / (Initial Sum) * 100

            = 1.87879 These percentages are close but not the same. My intuition tells me this is correct but I would like to develope a proof to show this is actually true. Any help/guidance would be greatly appreciated. -- Edit 1 -- My question contains an incorrect premise. I shouldn't be using the average of the percentages. Rather, I should be using the weighted average. Using Excel and this example I was able to generate the total percent increase using the all the percentages. A proof would still be helpful in understanding the problem. -- Edit 2 -- Given initial values $a_k$ and percentages $p_k$, the weighted average for the percentages would be:
$$ 
\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k *p_k}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}p_k}

102512,internal direct product of lie groups,"If $G$ is a (edit: simply connected)Lie group, when does a direct sum decomposition of its Lie algebra (into a direct sum of subalgebras) correspond to a (semi)direct product decomposition of $G$? Does it suffice for one of the summands of the Lie algebra to be the center of the algebra?  I (think I) have verified that if $H$ and $N$ are the subgroups corresponding to the summands and $N$ is normal  then $H$ and $N$ generate $G$ (by multiplying the images of the two summands under the exponential map, then applying the inverse function theorem and the fact that $G$ is generated by any neighborhood of the identity).  But I have trouble verifying that $H \cap N = \{e\}$.  Clearly more conditions are required since the two torus furnishes easy examples of such $H$ and $N$ with nontrivial intersection.  As I mentioned I am particularly interested in the case when one of the subalgebras is the center of the Lie algebra of $G$.","['lie-algebras', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"

Let $I$ be a prime ideal of $R$, so $R/I$ is a domain. Must $R/I$ in fact be a Euclidean domain? I know that this is true if we replace ""Euclidean domain"" with ""PID"", and false if we replace it with ""UFD"", so there is no clear intuition to be gained from similar concepts. My first attempts at a proof was to borrow a construction from analysis and define a norm on $R/I$ by $N(a + I) = \inf\{N(a+i) : i\in I\}$ but this didn't really get me anywhere. So, this fact true?

Rather than proceeding topic by topic (e.g. analysis, algebra, topology, etc) I wanted to choose a motif to keep as a frame of reference -- that way, for example,  when I return to diff. geom. I can ask questions about what that topic has to say about my particular motif and hopefully not get completely lost in all the abstraction. I've chosen a particular motif, and was hoping people could comment on whether this motif seems general and interesting enough that the major branches and theorems of math might have something to conclude about this topic, and furthermore, I would be extremely grateful if people could suggest various little puzzles around this motif that would eventually tie in to the various deep theorems. The motif I am interested in exploring is the relationship between $\displaystyle\max_{y} \min_{x} f(x,y)$  and $\displaystyle \min_{x} \max_{y} f(x,y)$ I like this motif because 1) it feels like a lot of interesting real word problems involve mins of maxes or vice versa, and 2) it just seems really easy to pose interesting questions about this topic. For example: under what conditions of f does $\displaystyle\max_{y} \min_{x} f(x,y) = \min_{x} \max_{y} f(x,y)$ Assuming $f \in C^{\infty}$ or $f$ is convex, etc, what kinds of bounds can we place on $\displaystyle\max_{y} \min_{x} f(x,y) - \min_{x} \max_{y} f(x,y)$ in some compact, convex, etc region $A$? Thinking a f(x,y) as a discrete, lookup table (i.e. matrix) with random iid entries, what can we say about the probability distribution of $\displaystyle\max_{y} \min_{x} f(x,y) - \min_{x} \max_{y} f(x,y)$ The above questions are not meant to be deep issues for professionals, but more at the level of textbook exercises.  Currently they feel mostly linked to analysis with maybe a small touch of topology, but my intuition feels like I could keep going and find things that would feel like algebra, certainly geometry, and so forth.

I know the Riemann integrability condition that there must exist some partition $ P $ for which $ U(P,f) - L(P,f)\leq\epsilon, \forall \epsilon>0 $. For my attempt at a proof, I said: Let $ P=\{x_0,x_1,\cdots,x_n:x_0=a<x_1<\cdots<x_n=b\} $ be a partition of $ [a,b] $. Let $ x_0\in[x_{k-1},x_k]. $ Then normally for an everywhere continuous function, since $ [a,b] $ is a compact set, the function is uniformly continuous and therefore $ \exists\delta(\epsilon):|x-y|<\delta\implies|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon,\forall\epsilon>0 $.  Using this, we can make any of the subintervals in the partition arbitrarily small, and eventually make the difference between the upper and lower sums arbitrarily small by using the property that a continuous function will attain its maximum and minimum.  But how do I do something similar for $ g $?  Furthermore, how can I extend that to the case in which $ g $ is discontinuous at $ x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_n $? EDIT: Using ncmathsadist's advice, Let $\epsilon > 0$.  Let $M = \sup_{x\in[a,b]} f$. Let $ D=\{x_0,x_1,\cdots,x_{2n}:x_0<x_1<\cdots<x_{2n}\} $ be a subpartition containing all the points $ x_0,x_1,\cdots,x_n $ where $ g $ is discontinuous, such that $ \sum_{i=1}^{2n}(x_i-x_{i-1}) < \frac{\epsilon}{2M}$ Let $ C $ be a subpartition containing all the other points.  By visiting the proof that a continuous function is Riemann integrable, I can construct a $ C $ so that: $ U(C\bigcup D,f)-L(C\bigcup D,f)< \frac{\epsilon}{2M}\times M+\frac{\epsilon}{2}=\epsilon $ This is because $ g $ is bounded, and any contribution by $ g $ to the sum from the discontinuous point must be less than the maximum, $ M $.","['definite-integrals', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"
102845,What is some good intuition for being parallel or Lie derivative is zero?,"I would like to know, if my unterstanding of the difference between  parallelness and zero Lie derivative so far are accurate: \
1.
Consider a Riemannian manifold $M$.
My understanding of $L_vT=0$ for some tensor field $T$ and $L_v$ being the Lie derivative goes as follows: The condition $L_vT=0$ means that $T$ does not change by moving infinitesimally along the geodesic defined by $v$, that is its components in any coordinate system stay the same. This especially implies that the tensor is constant along geodesics $\gamma$, if we have $L_{\dot\gamma}T=0$ along $\gamma$. \
\
2. Now consider the notion of being parallel: My understanding of $\nabla  T=0$ for $\nabla$ being the Levi-Civita connection is, that then you get the same value if you plug into $T$ the parallel transports of some vectors along a curve as if you plug into it the initial vectors. \

102846,Might such a sequence of mathematical expectations be able to predict uncertain events?,"This question might sound a little bit mystical, but it seemed like an interesting idea, so I am posting it here. Despite the title, I know it probably does not work miracles, but here goes anyway. I have been thinking about predicting outcomes of random events, and had the following idea. Let $X$ be a random variable. Then the average value we can expect $X$ to have is $\mu := E(X)$, its mathematical expectation. This seems like a good start, but as we know from probability, random variables also have a cerain degree of dispersion. But here instead of the standard deviation, I'll use $\delta_1 := E(|X-E(X)|)$ instead, because what I'm really interested in is: ""How far away from the expected value can I expect to find the value of my variable?"" This also generalizes more faithfully, I think. So, this would lead me to think that I'd most likely find the value of my variable to be $\mu\pm\delta_1$. But here comes the next question: ""How far from $\delta_1$ will the actual error $|X-E(X)|$ lie on average?"" So we define $\delta_2:=E(\big||X-E(X)|-\delta_1\big|)$. So we have another correction: we predict that the value should be $\mu\pm\delta_1\pm\delta_2$, where the choices of $+$ and $-$ in the $\pm$ are independent (not necessarily in any statistical sense of the word). We can of course continue this indefinitely and recursively define: $$X_0:=X$$ $$\delta_0:=\mu = E(X)$$ $$X_{n+1}:=|X_n-\delta_n|$$ $$\delta_{n+1}:=E(X_{n+1})$$ And now we take the final prediction for where the value of $X$ is going to be found to be: $$\mu +\sum_{n=1}^\infty(\pm\delta_n)$$
where the choices of $+$ and $-$ in $\pm$ are again completely arbitrary and mutually independent. My questions are: What exactly does this sum describe? To me, since I do not know much physics and ascribe mystical properties to it, this looks like some sort of quantum states for the variable. On a more serious note: I'd expect (maybe after adding some appropriate conditions) the set of such sums to be dense in the interval $(\mu -\sum_{n=1}^\infty\delta_n,\mu +\sum_{n=1}^\infty\delta_n)$. [Edit: actually, after thinking about this some more, it doesn't seem so likely anymore. My intuition about it has completely abandoned me, to be honest.] Has this been explored before? (And does it have a name?) Also, if you prefer to work with standard deviations (or their squares), you can modify the above recursive definition to read $X_{n+1}=(X_n-\delta_n)^2$. Such a sequence may seem more standard, but I'm not sure it is so intuitively obvious what it describes anymore. So thoughts about this variant are also welcome.","['statistics', 'probability']"

Let $L$ be the set of all lower bounds of $B$. Then $\alpha = \sup L$ exists in $S$, and $\alpha = \inf B$. This is what I understand so far: $B$ is bounded below means that $L$ is not empty and $L = \{ y \ | \ y \leq x \ \forall x \in B \}$.

I want to show that $f(z)$ is analytic if and only if $\overline{f(\bar{z})}$ is analytic, and by analytic I mean differentiable at each point. Here $f$ is a complex valued function. What I do is write $f(z)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$, where $u$ and $v$ are real functions of two variables. Then $\overline{f(\bar{z})}=u(x,-y)-iv(x,-y)$. These two forms look very similar, in the sense the one function being differentiable should immediately imply the other is differentiable, since the only thing really changing might be a $-$ sign popping out due to the chain rule.

102924,Cosine similarity / distance and triangle equation,"There is a similarity function particular popular for processing sparse vectors such as textual data (word frequency counts etc.) commonly referred to as cosine similarity. There are two variants to invert it to a dissimilarity, often referred to as cosine and arccos distance (distance in the weak sense, not the strict mathematical definition though!) In essence, the similarity function is:
$$\text{cosine-similarity}(A,B) = \frac{\left<A,B\right>}{||A||\cdot||B||}$$
Which is then used as a distance function as either
$$\text{cosine-dist}(A,B) := 1 - \text{cosine-similarity}(A,B)$$
$$\text{arccos-dist}(A,B) := \arccos(\text{cosine-similarity}(A,B))$$ Obviously, these distances cannot be a distance function on $\mathbb{R}^n$, as they are not well defined for the point $\{0\}^n$, as this leads to $0/0$. What is the proper result then? $1$? $\infty$? I tried finding a formal proof on Google that these distances do or do not satisfy the triangle inequality. Wikipedia seems to claim only the second is a proper metric, but does not give a reference . Update : reworked my question from here on, with updated thoughts on this issue. As confirmed by joriki, the $0$ is a problem for this distance function, as one cannot compute the angle to this vector. There is another issue with this distance, that however in many circumstances is intentional: two vectors that are a positive linear multiple of each other will have the angle of 0, while not being the same. See his reply on why cosine-dist does not satisfy the triangle equality for small angles (I wonder if this issue is comparable to that of $L_p$ with $p<1$). I have the following ideas in my mind, and again appreciate any pointers to literature, references , errors in these thoughts, extensions: A) Instead of $\mathbb{R}^n$, lets look at the unit sphere instead, i.e. vectors of length $1=||A||=||B||$. $\arccos(\left<A,B\right>)$ then is the geodesic distance on the unit sphere, which is metric, right? So in this restricted domain, arccos-dist is a proper distance? B) Assuming I have an injective (not necessarily surjective) map from another domain to the unit sphere, then use this distance function, this becomes also a metric space? After all, any of the distance function properties should still hold, right? C) Is arccos-dist a pseudo-metric on $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0\}$?

By standard manifold I mean Hausdorff, second-countable differential manifold. So my question is, we have an injective immersion, ie with a non singular derivative, $\iota\colon M\to N$. Where $M$ is a connected general manifold and $N$ is a standard manifold. Is it true that $M$ is second-countable. Note that if we take away the connection hypothesis then it is false. If we consider $M$ to be $(0,1)\times (0,1)$ with the horizontal topology, ie open basis of the form ${a}\times U$ with U open set of $(0,1)$; $N$ to be $(0,1)\times (0,1)$ with the standard topology, and $\iota$ to be the identity then it is false. If we take away the injective hypothesis I think it is also false. I'm not really sure if it can be done, but if it is possible to wind up the long line around $\mathbb S^1$ similar to how we do with $\mathbb R$ it would be a counterexample. I've been told it can be done with Riemann manifolds. Something like: $N$ has a riemann metric because it is second-countable, $\iota(M)$ has a riemann metric induced by $N$, taking it back to $M$ by $\iota$, you get a metric in $M$ so it has to be second-countable.
However I don't know anything about Riemann Geometry so I'd prefer a pure topological/differential proof. I'm interested because it allows you in the proof of the Frobenius theorem not to check about second-countable in the manifold you obtain.","['differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
