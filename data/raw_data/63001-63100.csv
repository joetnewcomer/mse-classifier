720001,Why is Dantzig's solution to the knapsack problem only approximate,"For a bunch of items with values $v_i$ and weights $w_i$, and with a total weight $W$ that our bag can carry, how do we achieve maximum total value without breaking the bag? Dantzig proposed that we consider the ratio $v_i/w_j$, and add items for which this ratio is largest until the bag fills up. But this is regarded as an approximate solution. I have also been thinking about this problem. I came up with the same solution as Dantzig and even proved it for the $0-1$ problem. Of course, I was suspicious of my proof even before I knew the method had been proposed before (since it would imply that $P= NP$). I am even more suspicious now. So put me out of my misery.

720128,Decrease of entropy when iterating a random discrete function,"Let $m$ be a positive integer. Let $S$ be the set of non-negative integers $x$ less than $m$, with $|S|=m$. Let $X_0$ be the discrete uniform distribution over $S$, with $P(x)=\begin{cases}
1/m & \text{if } x\in S \\
0   & \text{if } x\not\in S
\end{cases}$ Let $F$ be any of the $m^m$ discrete functions from $S$ to $S$. For that particular $F$, let $X_{i+1}=F(X_i)$ be the discrete distribution of the output of $F$ for input distribution $X_i$ (or equivalently the discrete distribution of $F^i$ for input distribution $X_0$); and let $H_i=H(X_i)$ be the entropy of $X_i$. Question: How is the distribution of $H_i$ when $F$ is a uniformly random discrete function from $S$ to $S$? In particular, can we find a little-$\mathcal o$ expression of its mean (perhaps variance or standard deviation, skewness..) when $m\to\infty$? An heuristic approximation is proposed here , with $n=\log_2(m)$, in a cryptographic context. It holds that $H_0=\log_2(m)$; and $\forall i\in\mathbb N, H_{m-1}\le H_{i+1}\le H_i\le\log_2(m)$. $H_i$ for an individual $F$ depends only on $i$ and the structure of the Functional Graph of $F$, irrespective of its labeling. Here a graph showing a random $F$ (a truncated hash with $m=2^{10}$). Another example yielding a maximally high $i$ before $H_i$ no longer decreases is with
$$F(x)=\begin{cases}
x-1 & \text{if } 1\le x<m \\
0   & \text{if } 0\le x\le1\text{ and }x<m

x-i & \text{if } i\le x<m \\

$$ And actually I have my answer and just need someone to verify this for me since I haven't done something like this for a long time. First, to deal with the pesky $1/x$ , I take the natural log inside the limit: \begin{align}
\lim_{x\to0+}\ln\left(\frac{3^x+5^x}{2}\right)^{\displaystyle\frac{1}{x}}
&= \lim_{x\to0+}\frac{1}{x}\ln\left(\frac{3^x+5^x}{2}\right)\\

&=\frac{\ln3+\ln5}{2}\\
&=\frac{1}{2}\ln3+\frac{1}{2}\ln5

720216,$K$-schemes as varieties: the importance of the structural morphism,"Consider a variety $p:X\longrightarrow\operatorname{Spec K}$ where $X$ is an integral scheme and $p$ is a separated morphism of finite type. Now chose an element $\sigma\in\operatorname{Aut}(K)\setminus\{\operatorname{id}\}$, then we can construct another variety over $K$ namely $\operatorname{Spec}(\sigma)\circ p: X^\sigma\longrightarrow\operatorname{Spec}(K)$, where, despite the two names,  we have that $X^\sigma=X$ as schemes. These two varieties are different (in general not even isomorphic) because the structural morphisms are distinct, but they are defined by the same underlying scheme. I have proved that, in the framework of algebraic subsets (so working with the classical/old concept of variety), this switch from $X$ to $X^\sigma$  is equivalent to changing through $\sigma$ the coefficients of the polynomials that define our varieties.
Formally this is clear, but it is hard to understand how the concept of variety depends so heavily on the structural morphism to  $\operatorname{Spec}{K}$. Simply modifying the morphism, but mantaining the same scheme $X$, we obtain two different objects, and this is so strange!!
Can you point out some other examples of the importance of the structural morphism in the modern definition of algebraic varieties? I'd like also some practical enlightenments
that help me to figure out the above situation.","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"
720236,Proving the reflection principle of Brownian motion,"The reflection principle of Brownian motion states that Brownian motion reflected at some stopping time $\tau$ is still a Brownian motion. The proof found in MÃ¶rters & Peres (as well as in several other books), rests on the fact that the concatenation mapping, which takes a continuous path $\{g(t) : t \geq 0\}$ and glues it to the end point of a finite continuous path$\{f(t) : 0 \leq t \leq \tau\}$ to form a new continuous path, is measurable. I don't see how to prove that the concatenation mapping is measurable. Formally, the reflection principle states (I follow Schilling & Partzsch): Let $(B(t), \mathcal{F}_t)_{t \geq 0}$ be a standard, $d$-dimensional Brownian motion and let $\tau$ be an a.s. finite stopping time. Consider the process
  $$
W(t,\omega) := \begin{cases} B(t,\omega), & 0 \leq t < \tau(\omega) \leq +\infty \\ 2B(\tau(\omega), \omega) - B(t,\omega), & \tau(\omega) \leq t < \infty
\end{cases}
$$
  Then $(W(t))_{t \geq 0}$ is again a standard Brownian motion. To prove this theorem we may assume, without loss of generality, that $\tau(\omega) < \infty$ for all $\omega \in \Omega$, and we define the mapping $\Phi : \mathbf{C}_{(0)}\times[0,\infty)\times\mathbf{C}_{(0)} \rightarrow \mathbf{C}_{(0)}$, where $\mathbf{C}_{(0)} := \{f \in \mathbf{C}[0,\infty) : f(0) = 0\}$, thus
$$
\Phi(f,t,g) := \begin{cases}
f(s), & 0 \leq s < t \\
f(t) + g(s - t), & t \leq s < \infty
\end{cases}
$$ It is claimed that $\Phi$ is $\mathcal{B}(\mathbf{C}_{(0)})\otimes\mathcal{B}[0,\infty)\otimes\mathcal{B}(\mathbf{C}_{(0)})/\mathcal{B}(\mathbf{C}_{(0)})$ measurable. Schilling and Partzsch offer the following hint for proving this fact: equip $\mathbf{C}_{(0)}\times[0,\infty)\times\mathbf{C}_{(0)}$ with the topology of locally uniform convergence (in $\mathbf{C}_{(0)}$) and pointwise convergence (in $[0,\infty)$). I'd appreciate help in proving why $\Phi$ is measurable, either by following Schilling & Partzsch's cue, or by another method. Additionally, if it makes life easier, it can be assumed that $d = 1$.

720280,Proof that a given projection map restricted to a subset is closed.,"$\pi_{1}:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}, (x,y)\mapsto x$ is a projection map from $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the standard eulcidean topology, $\mathscr{T}_E$ to $\mathbb{R}$ with it's usual euclidean topology $\mathscr{T}_\mathbb{R}$. Let $X:=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2\;|\; xy=0\}$ (the axes effectively), endowed with the subspace topology $\mathscr{T}_X$ and let $p:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be the restriction of $\pi_1$ to $X$. Show that $p$ is closed, i.e. for each V closed in $(X,\mathscr{T}_X)$, $p(V)$ is closed in $(\mathbb{R},\mathscr{T}_\mathbb{R})$. Attempt: So the way I would attempt it for open maps at least is to choose a basis for the topology.
Here, $\mathcal{B}=\mathcal{B}_1 \cup \mathcal{B}_2$ is a basis for $\mathscr{T}_X$, where: $\mathcal{B}_1:=\{(\alpha,\beta)\times\ \{0\}\;|\; \alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{R}, \alpha<\beta\}$ $\mathcal{B}_2:=\{\{0\}\times(\alpha,\beta) \;|\; \alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{R}, \alpha<\beta\}$ So I considered taking the complement of the elements in the basis with respect to X, to form a basis $\mathcal{A}$ say, for the closed sets of the topology, $\mathcal{A}:=\{X\backslash U\;|\;U \in \mathcal{B}\}$. Then consider $p(V)$ for $V$ in $\mathcal{A}$. For $V=X\backslash U$ where $U \in \mathcal{B}_2$, $p(V)=\mathbb{R}$, and for  $V=X\backslash U$ where $U \in \mathcal{B}_1$, $p(V)=(\mathbb{R}\backslash (\alpha,\beta)) \cup \{0\}$. In both cases the sets are closed. But, for sets $U_\lambda, \lambda \in \Lambda$ an indexing set, and $f$ a map, $f(\bigcup\limits_{\lambda \in \Lambda} U_\lambda)=\bigcup\limits_{\lambda \in \Lambda}f(U_\lambda)$. So when proving certain things about open sets reduces to proving it for a basis, and I am assuming because of the corresponding image rule: 
$f(\bigcap\limits_{\lambda \in \Lambda} U_\lambda)\subseteq\bigcap\limits_{\lambda \in \Lambda}f(U_\lambda)$, that I can't conclude the map is closed using the basis for closed sets? Cheers for any help. I'd rather hints on approaches as opposed to full solutions, but a comment on the use of basis would be appreciated.","['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory']"
720282,Why do we care for uniform convergence on compact sets?,"I was trying to come up with reasons, why we naturally consider the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets as the appropriate framework for spaces of holomorphic functions such as e.g. $H(\mathbb{C}^n)$ (which is the space of entire functions on $\mathbb{C}^n$). I understand that e.g. by Weierstrass' theorem the above space is closed, when $f_n$ converges compact to f. Moreover, that we can make such spaces into FrÃ©chet spaces in case the domain behaves nicely enough (e.g. is the union of countable many compact sets, which clearly is the case for $\mathbb{C}^n$), which provides some nice topological properties. But I would like to hear some more motivation or reasons, why to consider this topology naturally, which stem (purely) from complex analysis. Thanks in advance.

720296,Rank of a jet bundle of a vector bundle.,"I am trying to understand the jet bundles but currently I am stuck on the following questions: Let $\pi: E\rightarrow X$ be a smooth (holomorphic) vector bundle of rank $k$ over a smooth (complex) manifold $X$. I know that the bundle $J_k(E)$ of k-jets of $E$ has the structure of a vector bundle over $X$. I would like to know however what the rank of this vector bundle is. Is $J_k(E)$ holomorphic in the case when $(E, \pi, X)$ is holomorphic? Moreover, when $\pi: E\rightarrow X$ is a fiber bundle with structure group $G$, can we view $J_1(E)$ as the associated principal bundle $P$ associated to $E$ or am I wrong? I have seen an interpretation of $J_1(E)$ as some sort of an ""extended frame bundle"" of E in the sense that its fiber consists of the set of all pairs comprising a basis of $T_pX$   $(T^{1, 0}_pX)$ and a basis of $E_p$, $p\in X$ P.S.: I am new here and I really hope that I don't annoy the experienced audience in this forum with trivialities.

some background for the question.. a student writes

then writes
$$dA=xdy+ydx$$
then the student tries to recover the A by integrating
$$\int dA=\int ydx+\int xdy$$
which 'yields'
$$A=yx+c(y)+yx+c2(x)=2xy+c(y)+c2(x)$$
which is NOT the correct value of A, the teacher says $\int ydx\ne yx$ the students replies ""sometimes it is"" we routinely compute  $\int ydx=yx$  when doing the inside of a double integral...so in $\int ydx$ sometimes $y$ is held constant and sometimes not.. yet the notation is indistinguishable...","['notation', 'calculus', 'integration', 'partial-derivative']"

They correspond to so-called prime ideals , which are the ring-theoretic generalizations of ultrafilters.

Define an equivalence relation on $S^1\times[0,1]$ by: $(x,t)$~$(y,s) \iff xt=st$. Show that $(S^1\times [0,1])/$~ is homeomorphic to the unit disc $D^2$. My attempt: Let $g: S^1\times[0,1]\to D^2$ by $g(x,t)=xt$. Now $g(x,t)=g(y,s)\iff xt=ys\iff (x,t)$~$(y,s)$. This shows two things: that $g$ is injective (forward direction) and $g$ is constant on each equivalence class of $S^1\times [0,1]$ (reverse direction). The latter means that $g$ induces a map $f:(S^1\times [0,1])/$~$\to D^2$. Now $S^1$ and $[0,1]$ are compact, so $S^1\times [0,1]$ is compact, and so $(S^1\times[0,1])$/~ is compact by the projection map $\pi$. We know $g$ is a surjection as well because for $y\in D^2$, we have $g(y/\|y\|,y)=y$. Since $g=f\circ\pi$, we have that $f$ is bijective, and we have that $f$ is continuous by the universal mapping property of quotients. Hence, $f$ is a continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space, so it is also a homeomorphism. Does anyone see any problems with my argument?",['general-topology']

Consider a ring of radius $\mathrm{d}r$ at a distance $r$ from the centre. This ring has area $2\pi r \mathrm{d}r$. Integrating, $$\int_0^R2\pi r \mathrm\,{d}r=\pi R^2$$ But calculus is a relatively new tool, while the area of a circle has been known for what I presume since Archimedes at least. So what is the historic derivation for this? I think it is something related to the method of exhaustion which is in essence a primitive form of integration, the Wikipedia article states Archimedes used the method of exhaustion as a way to compute the area inside a circle by filling the circle with a polygon of a greater area and greater number of sides. The quotient formed by the area of this polygon divided by the square of the circle radius can be made arbitrarily close to $Ï$ as the number of polygon sides becomes large, proving that the area inside the circle of radius $r$ is $Ïr^2$, $Ï$ being defined as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter $\frac{C}{d}$ or of the area of the circle to the square of its radius $A/r^2$. I am unclear as to how Archimedes would have proved that these two definitions of $\pi$ are in fact equivalent and refer to the same constant. Maybe in his proof of $\pi r^2$ the equality emerges but I have been unable to find any reference to or a description of how Archimedes proved this.

We also repeat it for $y$. i.e. we verify that  $x+y = x+y'$. Question: Instead of checking that $x+y = x+y'$ and $x'+y = x+y$ seperately, would it suffice to check that $x+y = x' + y'$ in a single operation in order to show that addition is well defined for real numbers.

If it's essential for somebody, I can explain the application where this matrix appears. In article by Lele, Kulkarni, Willsky - ""Convex-polygon estimation from support-line measurements"" this matrix represents the conditions of consistent support function measurements. Each $i$-th row of matrix represent conditions that $i$-th descrete radius of curvature is positive. These are the criteria of consistency. Here is the detailed description of geometrical interpretation of this matrix. Defintion 1. The support function of convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is defined as follows: $$
h_{K}(u) = \sup \limits_{x \in K} (x, u)
$$ Each value of support function corresponds to 1 support hyperplane of convex body. Suppose that $n = 2$ (we work in plane). Maybe this picture will help you to understand what we are speaking about: We consider $M$ measurements $h_{1}, \ldots, h_{M}$ of support function at directions $u_{1}, u_{2}, \ldots, u_{M}$ (all $||u_{j}|| = 1$, and $u_{j} = (\cos \theta_{j}, \sin \theta_{j}$)), and want to reconstruct the body $K$ from these measurements. In ideal, we can just intersect half-spaces corresponding to support hyperspaces: $$
K = \bigcap \limits_{i = 1}^{M} \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{n} : \; (x, u_{i}) < (h_{i}, u_{i})\}
$$ But measurements are noisy, so there could be no convex body that has such support function values at these directions. So we need to correct them. To do this we need some conditions representing the consistency of support function measurements. Here are these conditions: Theorem 1. A vector $h \in \mathbb{R}^{M}$ is the vector of support function measurements of some convex body if an only if $$
C h \geq 0
$$ The value $h_{i - 1} \sin(\theta_{i + 1} - \theta_{i}) - h_{i} \sin(\theta_{i + 1} - \theta_{i - 1}) + h_{i + 1} \sin(\theta_{i} - \theta_{i - 1})$ is the value of $i$-th descrete radius of curvature. If all these values are positive, then the measurements are consistent. The vectors $$
v_{1} = (1, \cos(\theta_{1}), \ldots, \cos(\theta_{M - 1}))^{T}
$$ $$
v_{2} = (0, \sin(\theta_{1}), \ldots, \sin(\theta_{M - 1}))^{T}
$$ are just vectors of support function values of convex bodies consisting only from one point: $(1, 0)$ for $v_{1}$ and $(0, 1)$ for $v_{2}$. Adding these vectors and their combinations to other support function measurements does not change descrete radio of curvature and correspond to translation of the convex body in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.","['geometry', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'differential-geometry', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

721150,"Why does the ""T=0"" method to calculate tangent work?","Given a random equation of a curve: $ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$. Suppose we need to find the tangent to this curve at any point $A(x_1, y_1)$. A method given to me by my professor was the 'T' method: The 'T' form of an equation can be obtained by replacing: $$x^2 \rightarrow xx_1$$
  $$y^2 \rightarrow yy_1$$
  $$x \rightarrow \frac{x + x_1}{2}$$
  $$y \rightarrow \frac{y + y_1}{2}$$
  $$xy \rightarrow \frac{xy_1 + x_1y}{2}$$ The tangent to the curve is then the equation $T=0$. For instance, if we need to find the tangent at $(2, 2)$ to the parabola $y^2 - 2x=0$: $T =0$: $\implies yy_1 - 2\frac{x+x_1}{2} = 0$ Substituting $x_1 = 2$ and $y_1 = 2$: $$2y - (x+2) = 0$$ $$\implies 2y - x = 2$$ which is the required tangent.

721178,How do we make this integration rigorous?,"This is from Jaynes, Probability Theory: The Logic of Science , pp 27-28. We have a function $F$ which is $\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and we set $v = F(y,z)$. We discover that $$ F_1(y,z) = { \partial F \over \partial y }  = { H(v) \over H(y) } \\
   F_2(y,z) = { \partial F \over \partial z }  = r{ H(v) \over H(z) } $$ where $H$ is arbitrary, but can't change sign in the region of interest. (Specifically, $H$ is such that $F_2(y,z) / F_1(y,z)$ takes the form $r H(y) / H(z) $.) We later discover $r = 1$, so I'm going to ignore that for clarity. Then, since $\mathrm d v = F_1 \mathrm d y + F_2 \mathrm d z $, we get $$ { \mathrm d v \over H(v) } = { \mathrm d y \over H(y) } + { \mathrm d z \over H(z) } $$ So far, so good. Now we define $$ w(x) = \exp\left( \int^x { \mathrm d x \over H(x) } \right) $$ and it follows that $w(v) = w(y) w(z)$. I can kinda sorta see how this happens, but not really. Apparently, $$ \int { \mathrm d v \over H(v) } = \int \left( { \mathrm d y \over H(y) } + { \mathrm d z \over H(z) } \right)  = \int { \mathrm d y \over H(y) } + \int{ \mathrm d z \over H(z) } $$ And then we just apply $e^{a+b} = e^a e^b$. This makes some sense notationally, but I'm not familiar with the rigor behind it. (I've removed the ${}^x$ from the integrals because I don't really know what I'd do with it. Jaynes credits this proof to Cox (1961), which I looked up - it didn't include any intermediate steps to help me, but it also omitted the ${}^x$, so I feel somewhat comfortable doing so myself.) I think there are a few specific things confusing me, where the notation just doesn't mean what I expect it to: I expect expressions like $\int^x f(s) \mathrm d s$ to be a function of $x$, where $s$ is a bound variable, and we can rewrite $s$ as $p$ or $\alpha$ or anything, and rewriting $s$ as $x$ is just about the most confusing choice we can possibly make. In this case, it seems that the symbol used inside the integration is relevant? $w$ looks like a function $\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R $, but $w(v)$ depends upon $\mathrm d v$ as well as $v$? Can anyone clear this up for me?",['multivariable-calculus']

is the Chebyshev function .
and where:
$$\Lambda(n) = \begin{cases} \log p & \text{if }n=p^k \text{ for some prime } p \text{ and integer } k \ge 1, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}$$
is the von Mangoldt function . The von Mangoldt function can be calculated as . Edit 27.1.2018 , I rewrote the whole question from here on, trying to use more conventional notation. $n$ stands for row index, and $k$ stands for column index. Mathematica knows that: $$\log(n)=\lim\limits_{s \rightarrow 1}\zeta(s)\left(1-\frac{1}{n^{s-1}}\right) \; \; \; \; \; \; (1)$$
and it has been proven that for $n>1$ the von Mangoldt function is:
$$\Lambda(n)=\lim\limits_{s \rightarrow 1}\zeta(s)\sum\limits_{d|n} \frac{\mu(d)}{d^{s-1}} \; \; \; \; \; \; (2)$$
The Dirichlet series associated with the von Mangoldt function defined in such away  as above, is the infinite symmetric square matrix $T_1$: $$T_1=a(GCD(n,k)) \; \; \; \; \; \; (3)$$ which starts: $$T_1 = \left(   \begin{array}{ccccccc}   +1&+1&+1&+1&+1&+1&+1&\cdots \\ +1&-1&+1&-1&+1&-1&+1 \\ +1&+1&-2&+1&+1&-2&+1 \\ +1&-1&+1&-1&+1&-1&+1 \\ +1&+1&+1&+1&-4&+1&+1 \\ +1&-1&-2&-1&+1&+2&+1 \\ +1&+1&+1&+1&+1&+1&-6 \\ \vdots&&&&&&&\ddots \end{array}   \right)$$ where: $$a(n) = \sum\limits_{d|n} d \cdot \mu(d) \; \; \; \; \; \; (4)$$ (better known as the Dirichlet inverse of the Euler totient.) Now by periodicity of the entries in the columns for $m=0,1,2,3,4,5,...$ or $m \in \mathcal â_0$, the column sums satisfy: $$\sum\limits_{n=1+m}^{n=k+m} T_1(n,k)=\begin{cases}1 & \mbox{ if } k=1\\ 0&\mbox{ if } k>1.\end{cases}  \; \; \; \; \; \; (5)$$ and by periodicity of the entries in the rows, the row sums satisfy: $$\sum\limits_{k=1+m}^{k=n+m} T_1(n,k)=\begin{cases}1 & \mbox{ if } n=1\\ 0&\mbox{ if } n>1.\end{cases} \; \; \; \; \; \; (6)$$
by symmetry. Since from $(2)$ for $n>1$: $$\Lambda(n)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{k=\infty}\frac{T_1(n,k)}{k} \; \; \; \; \; \; (7)$$ and: $$\sum\limits_{n=1+m}^{n=k+m} \frac{T_1(n,k)}{k} =\begin{cases}1 & \mbox{ if } k=1\\ 0&\mbox{ if } k>1.\end{cases}  \; \; \; \; \; \; (8)$$ and since the denominator is $k$ in $(8)$ and the length of the period in the $k$-the column is also $k$, we can say that the average contribution to $\Lambda(n)$ from an entry $T_1(n,k)$ for $k>1$ in matrix $T_1$ must be: $$\sum\limits_{n=1+m}^{n=k+m} \frac{T_1(n,k)}{k} =\begin{cases}1 & \mbox{ if } k=1\\ 0&\mbox{ if } k>1.\end{cases}  \; \; \; \; \; \; (9)$$ Writing:
$$\sum_{n \leq x} \Lambda(n)=\sum_{n \leq x} \sum\limits_{k=1}^{k=\infty}\frac{T_1(n,k)}{k} \; \; \; \; \; \; (10)$$ Combining $(9)$ with the right hand side of $(10)$ and multiplying the denominators $k \cdot k = k^2$ we get: $$\sum_{n \leq x} \Lambda(n)=\sum_{n \leq x} \sum\limits_{k=1}^{k=\infty}\sum\limits_{n=1+m}^{n=k+m} \frac{T_1(n,k)}{k^2} =\begin{cases} (1+o(1))x & \mbox{ if } k=1\\ (0+o(1))x &\mbox{ if } k>1.\end{cases}  \; \; \; \; \; \; (11)$$ and thereby at least heuristically: $$\sum_{n \leq x} \Lambda(n) = (1+o(1)) x  \; \; \; \; \; \; (12)$$ $\square$ Associated Mathematica 8 code: nn = 7

where:
$$g=1,2,3,4,5,...$$
and:
$$n=1,2,3,4,5,...$$ Matrix $T_2$ in turn has the property: $$\psi(x)=\sum\limits_{k \leq x} \Lambda(k) = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{n=\infty}\frac{T_2(n,k)}{n}$$ We then form matrix $T_3$: $$T_3(n,k)=\frac{T_2(n,k)}{n \cdot k}$$ Since for $n>1$: $$\lim\limits_{k \rightarrow \infty} T_3(n,k) = 0$$ and since: $$\lim\limits_{k \rightarrow \infty} T_3(1,k) = 1$$ the prime number theorem is true/follows. $\square$ In case I did not get it entirely right I attach this second program in Mathematica as a verification: (*start*)

721448,Unique representation of a degenerate simplex,"I recently learned about simplicial sets, and now I'm studying some basic properties. I've learned that every degenerate simplex is a degeneracy of a unique non-degenerate ( nice ) simplex. However, I suspect that the entire representation must also be unique. (This question started as a request for help when I was stuck, but while I was writing the post I figured it out myself, so I end up asking if you could check my proof.) This means, given a nice simplex $x$  and $$\large
z = s_{j_n}\cdots s_{j_1}x = s_{i_n}\cdots s_{i_1}x,
\qquad 0\le j_1 <\cdots <j_n, \;\; 0\le i_1 <\cdots< i_n
$$
does this imply that $j_k=i_k$ for all $k$? If $s_j x = s_i x,\ i<j$, for a simplex $x$, then 
$$\large
x = d_i s_i x = d_i s_j x = s_{j-1} d_i x
$$
So if $x$ is nice, then $s_j x \ne s_k x$. This can be seen as the induction start. Assume that the claim is true for $n$. 
Let's first consider the case $j_{n+1} > i_{n+1}+1$. If we apply $d_{j_{n+1}}$ to both sides, we get
$$\large
d_{j_{n+1}} z = s_{j_n} \cdots s_{j_1} x = 
s_{i_{n+1}} \cdots s_{i_n}d_{j_{n+1}-n-1} x 
$$
which means that $d_{j_{n+1}} z$ is degeneracy of $x$ and of $d_{j_{n+1}} x$, but then $d_{j_{n+1}}x$ has to be a degeneracy of $x$. We can conclude that  $j_{n+1}\in\{i_{n+1},i_{n+1}+1\}$. Clearly, $j_{n+1} = i_{n+1}$ implies by induction that $j_k = i_k$ for all $k$. But what if $j_{n+1}=i_{n+1}+1$? We can write $$\large\begin{align}
s_{i_n}\cdots s_{i_1} x
& = d_{i_{n+1}} s_{i_{n+1}} \cdots s_{i_1} x \\
& = d_{i_{n+1}} s_{i_{n+1}+1} \cdots s_{j_1} x \\
& = s_{i_{n+1}} d_{i_{n+1}} s_{j_n} \cdots s_{j_1} x
\end{align}$$
If $i_{n+1} > j_n +1$, the last line would transform into an $(n+1)$-fold degeneracy of $d_{i_{n+1}-n} x$. So $d_{i_{n+1}}s_{j_n}$ must vanish, and we can use the induction hypothesis to conclude  that $i_n = i_{n+1}$, which is a contradiction. Is this proof correct? And can it be simplified? Thanks.","['simplicial-stuff', 'category-theory', 'proof-verification', 'combinatorics']"

721474,Proof about lognormal distribution,"I'm trying to prove a result about the lognormal distribution that seems to me to be fairly intuitive, but I can't get the proof to work. Basically, I'd like to prove that as the mean increases, the expected value below a certain threshold (say $x^*$) increases more by raising the variance than by lowering the mean. Formally, let $V = \int_0^{x^*} x f(x) dx$, where $f(x)$ is the lognormal pdf with mean $y-a$ and variance $\sigma^2$. I'd like to show $\frac{\partial^2V}{\partial y \partial a} < \frac{\partial^2V}{\partial y \partial \sigma}$ I'd really appreciate any help.","['statistics', 'calculus']"
721504,Row swap changing sign of determinant,"I was wondering if someone could help me clarify something regarding the effect of swapping two rows on the sign of the determinant. I know that if $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix and $B$ is an $n\times n$ matrix obtained from $A$ by swapping two rows, then $$\det(B)=-\det(A)$$ but I don't know how to prove this. I have been looking for proofs at internet, and read in both in textbooks and lectures notes that are available that this result is very hard to prove and most approaches rely on induction and so was wondering if there is something wrong with using that $\det(AB)=\det(A)\det(B)$ and then writing $B=EA$ where $E$ is an elementary matrix swapping two rows and using this result to get $\det(B)=\det(E)\det(A)=-\det(A)$ (since showing that $\det(E)=-1$ in this case is not that hard).","['permutation-matrices', 'permutations', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"
721511,"Isomorphism between MÃ¶bius transformations and $SL(2,\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{Z}_2$","This is a problem from A Course in Modern Mathematical Physics by Peter Szekeres. Here's the quote to the problem I'm solving: Show that the map $\mu$ from $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ to the MÃ¶bius group is a homomorphism, and that the kernel of this homomorphism is $\{I;-I\}$; i.e the MÃ¶bius group is isomorphic to  $SL(2,\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{Z}_2$. What I did was to define $$\mu:\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
a & b \\
c & d \end{array} \right)\rightarrow m(z)=\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$$ where $ad-bc=1$. By taking the image of two unimodular matrix product gives us the composition of two MÃ¶bius transformations which is exactly the result we expect, it is easy to see why $\{I;-I\}$ (identity matrix and the ""negative"" identity matrix) is the kernel of this homomorphism, by the theorem that goes: If $\varphi: G\rightarrow G'$ is a homomorphism then the factor group $G/\ker(\varphi)$ is isomorphic with the image subgroup $im(\varphi)\subseteq G' $ I can prove that the group of the MÃ¶bius transformations is isomorphic to $SL(2,\mathbb{C})/\{I;-I\}$, can't find a way to prove that it is isomorphic to $SL(2,\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{Z}_2$ because i thought that you could only factor a group by a normal subgroup of that group, I don't know if it is possible to factor it by a group wich is isomorphic the normal subgroup of that group. If that were the case, I could prove that $\{I;-I\}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and then prove that $SL(2,\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{Z}_2 \cong SL(2,\mathbb{C})/\{I;-I\}$ which by transitivity should be isomorphic to the group os MÃ¶bius transformations. If this is not posible, i don't see how $\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a normal subgroup of $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-groups']"
