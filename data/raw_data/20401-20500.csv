171910,limit of an integral with a Lorentzian function,"We want to calculate the $\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{f(x)}{x^2 + \epsilon^2} dx $ for a function $f(x)$  such that $f(0)=0$. We are physicist, so the function $f(x)$ is smooth enough!.
After severals trials, we have not been able to calculate it except numerically. 
It looks like the normal Lorentzian which tends to the dirac function, but a 
$\epsilon$ is missing. We wonder if this integral can be written in a simple form as function of $f(0)$ or its derivatives $f^{(n)}(0)$ in 0. Thank you very much.","['distribution-theory', 'integration']"

171949,Does an uncountable intersection of sets with probability one also have probability one? ; in connection with the ergodic theorem,"Let $(\Omega, {\cal F},P)$ be a complete probability space and $T$  a mesure-preserving transformation on $\Omega$ that is ergodic. The point-wise ergodic theorem states that for any $f\in L^1(P)$, $$\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}f(T^j \omega) \to \int_{\Omega}f(\omega)P(d\omega) \quad P\text{-a.e.}$$ 
This is equivalent to saying that the set $$A_{f}:=\left\{\omega\in\Omega; \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}f(T^j \omega) \to \int_{\Omega}f(\omega)P(d\omega) \;\; \text{holds}\right\}$$ has probability $1$. Notice here that  the set of probability $1$ may be different for a different $f\in L^1(P)$. My desired goal is to make a set with probability $1$ for which the above convergence of the Cesaro means holds regardless of the choice of $f\in L^1(P)$. I think that one way to take for this objective is to take an intersection of $A_{f}$ over $f\in L^1(P)$. Then the dependence on $f$ disappears, i.e., for  $\omega\in \cap A_{f}$ we have the above convergence for every $f\in L^1(P)$. My question is; the intersection   $\cap A_{f}$ is m'ble and has probability 1? (I think that if the intersection is taken over a countable index set, then the question is trivial and the answer is affirmative.) 
Is there any   need for appropriate additional assumptions in order to ensure that the set
$\cap A_{f}$ is measurable and has probability one? Or are there other ways to take than taking the intersection of $A_{f}$?","['probability-theory', 'ergodic-theory', 'probability']"

171966,Whats the probability a subset of an $\mathbb F_2$ vector space is a spanning set?,"Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional $\mathbb F_2$ vector space. Note that $V$ has $2^n$ elements and $\mathcal P(V)$ has $2^{2^n}$. I'm interested in the probability (under a uniform distribution) that an element of $\mathcal P(V)$ is a spanning set for $V$. Equivalently a closed form formula (or at least one who's asymptotics as $n\rightarrow \infty$ are easy to work out) for the number of spanning sets or non-spanning sets. It's not hard to show that the probability is greater than or equal to $1/2$. Since any subset of size greater than $2^{n-1}$ must span the space. I calculated  the proportion of spanning sets of size $n$ for $n$ up to $200$ which seem to be going to a number starting with $.2887$. This leads me to believe that the probability exceeds $1/2$. I couldn't nail down a formula for arbitrary sized subsets though to continue experimental calculations.

172070,Combinatorial Interpretation of Fractional Binomial Coefficients,"My question is a bit imprecise - but I hope you like it. I even strongly think it has a proper answer. The binomial coefficient $\binom{\frac{1}{2}}{n}$ is strongly related to Catalan numbers - the expression $(1-4x)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ appears when calculating the generating function of the Catalan numbers and solving a quadratic equation. I am trying to find some combinatorial interpretation of $\binom{\frac{1}{k}}{n}$ for non-zero integer $k$. I feel it must exist - I don't know if it is because of intuition or because I've seen something similar and forgot. I want an elementary interpretation, maybe related to trees (since Catalan numbers count binary trees). So, can anyone find a combinatorial interpretation of those coefficients (possibly multiplied by some power such as $k^n$)? My motivation: I can show p-adically that $\binom{\frac{1}{k}}{n}$ is $p$-integral for any prime $p$ not dividing $k$. I am looking for a combinatorial proof of this property, and a combinatorial interpretation of $k^m \binom{\frac{1}{k}}{n}$ (for some integer $m$) will suffice for this.","['catalan-numbers', 'generating-functions', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"

OK, so Stokes's Theorem tells me that: $$\oint_{C}\vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} = \iint_{S}\operatorname{curl} \vec{F} \cdot \vec{N} ~dS$$ I have calculated: $$\operatorname{curl} \vec{F} = -\vec{i} - \vec{j} - \vec{k}.$$ I then figured that on the surface $S$ we must have: $$\vec{N}dS = \vec{i} + \vec{j} + \vec{k}dxdy$$ since this follows from the equation of the given plane. However this will then give me: $$\operatorname{curl} \vec{F} \cdot \vec{N} = -1 -1 -1 = -3$$ And thus I would get, if project this onto the $xy$-plane: $$\iint_{S} \operatorname{curl} \vec{F} \cdot \vec{N} ~dS = -3 \iint_{A} dA = -3 \pi a^2$$ which is obviously not correct.

172093,A Gröbner Basis Computation Gone Bad,"Here is the problem statement: Consider the polynomial ideal $I =  \langle b-r_1-r_2, c-r_1r_2 \rangle  \subset \mathbb{Q}[r_1,r_2,b,c].$ Show that $I \cap \mathbb{Q}[b,c] = \langle 0 \rangle$. First, if you can solve this without the use of the theory of Gröbner bases, I would love to see a solution, but I am explicitly trying to solve this using some Gröbner basis. Now, let me give my calculations, which do not yield the desired result. I will use the notation in Dummit and Foote. Put the lexicographic order $r_1 > r_2 > b > c$ on the polynomial ring and let $f_1 = -r_1-r_2 + b$ and $f_2 = -r_1r_2  + c$. Then,
\begin{align*}
S(f_1,f_2) &= \frac{r_1r_2}{-r_1}(-r_1-r_2 + b) - \frac{r_1r_2}{-r_1r_2} (-r_1r_2 + c)\\
&= -r_2(-r_1-r_2 + b) + (-r_1r_2 + c)\\
&=r_2^2-r_2b + c =: f_3.

Next,
\begin{align*}

&=-r_2^2(-r_1-r_2 + b) - r_1(r_2^2-r_2b + c)\\
&=r_1r_2b-r_1c+r_2^3-r_2^2b =: f_4
&\\
& \\
S(f_2,f_3) &= \frac{r_1r_2^2}{-r_1r_2}(-r_1r_2 + c) - \frac{r_1r_2^2}{r_2^2}(r_2^2 - r_2b + c) \\
&=-r_2(-r_1r_2 + c)-r_1(r_2^2 - r_2b + c)\\
&=r_1r_2b - r_2c - r_1c =:f_5.
\end{align*}
Feeling like there was still hope this would work, I stopped with:

S(f_3,f_4) &= \frac{r_1r_2^2b}{r_2^2}(r_2^2 - r_2b+c) - \frac{r_1r_2^2b}{r_1r_2b}(r_1r_2 - r_1c + r_2^3 - r_2^2b)\\
&=r_1b(r_2^2-r_2b+c)-r_2(r_1r_2b-r_1c + r_2^3-r_2^2b)\\
&=-r_1r_2b -r_1r_2c + r_1bc -r_2^4 + r_2^3b =:f_6.

But, being the question ""Describe all the compacts"", can you suggest me a way to find them all? Is there a procedure someone can follow in this or in similar cases?

172190,Can this function be rewritten to improve numerical stability?,"I'm writing a program that needs to evaluate the function $$f(x) = \frac{1 - e^{-ux}}{u}$$ often with small values of $u$ (i.e. $u \ll x$).  In the limit $u \to 0$ we have $f(x) = x$ using L'Hôpital's rule, so the function is well-behaved and non-singular in this limit, but evaluating this in the straightforward way using floating-point arithmetic causes problems when $u$ is small: then the exponential is quite close to 1, and when we subtract it from 1, the difference doesn't have great precision.  Is there a way to rewrite this function so it can be computed more accurately both in the small-$u$ limit and for larger values of $u$ (i.e. $u \approx x$)? Of course, I could add a test to my program that switches to computing just $f(x) = x$, or perhaps $f(x) = x - ux^2/2$ (second-order approximation) when $u$ is smaller than some threshold.

172193,Normalizers of automorphism groups,"In abstract groups $\Gamma$ the normalizer $N_\Gamma(S)$ of a subset $S\subseteq\Gamma$ is the subgroup of all $x \in \Gamma$ that commute with $S$, i.e. $xS = Sx$, i.e. $x\ y\ x^{-1} \in S $ for all $y \in S$. Among the permutations $S_n$ of the vertices of a graph $G$ of order $n$ (or any other kind of structure) there is one distinguished subgroup: the automorphisms $\text{Aut}(G)$, that reflect the symmetries of $G$: $$\alpha \in \text{Aut}(G)\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \alpha G = G$$ To give $\alpha G = G$ a proper meaning, identify $G$ with an adjacency matrix, for example. The normalizer of $\text{Aut}(G)$ is another distinguished subgroup: it consists of those permutations $\pi$ of the vertices, such that $\text{Aut}(\pi G) = \text{Aut}(G)$, i.e. that respect the symmetries of $G$, as can be shown like this: $\quad \pi \in N_{S_n}(\text{Aut}(G))\\

This the Exercise 3, Chapter 11 of the Gerald B. Folland book Real Analysis : Let $G$ be a locally compact group that is homeomorphic to an open subset $U$ of $\Bbb R^d$ in such a way that, if we identify $G$ with $U$, left translation is an affine map -- that is, $xy=A_x(y)+b_x$ where $A_x$ is a linear transformation of $\Bbb R^d$ and $b_x\in\Bbb R^d$. Then $|\det A_x|^{-1}\d x$ is a left Haar measure on $G$, where $\d x$ denotes Lebesgue measure on $\Bbb R^d$. Let me know if I understand this. What the problem gives us is $G$ a locally compact group, an open set $U\subseteq\Bbb R^d$, and a bijection $\varphi:G\to U$ such that $\varphi$ and $\varphi^{-1}$ are both continuous and satisfy that given $u\in G$ there is a linear operator $A_{\varphi(u)}:\Bbb R^d\to \Bbb R^d$ and $b_{\varphi(u)}\in\Bbb R^d$ so that $$\varphi(uv)=A_{\varphi(u)}(\varphi(v))+b_{\varphi(u)}.$$ Is this right If it is, define $f:\Bbb R^d\to\Bbb [0,\infty[$ given by $$f(x)=|\det A_x|^{-1}\quad\text{i.e.}\quad f(x)=|\det A_{\varphi(\varphi^{-1}(x))}|^{-1}.$$ Is the problem asking if the measure $\mu$ in $G$ given by $$\mu(E)=\int_{\varphi(E)}f(x)\d x$$ is a left Haar measure? This reminds me the formula $$\int_E f(y)\d y=|\det T|\int_{T^{-1} E} f(Tx)\d x,$$

172313,Why is every irreducible matrix with period 1 primitive?,"In a certain text on Perron-Frobenius theory, it is postulated that every irreducible nonnegative matrix with period $1$ is primitive and this proposition is said to be obvious. However, when I tried to prove the theorem by myself, I found that I was unable to come up with a formal proof. Intuitively, of course, I am sure that the theorem holds (and the converse statement is in fact easy to prove), but I am unable to prove it. According to the text, the theorem should be obvious from the graph-theoretic interpretation of these notions. For a given nonnegative matrix, it is possible to construct a digraph as follows: There is an edge from the $i$-th vertex to the $j$-th vertex if and only if the entry $(i,j)$ of the matrix is positive. Thus, the matrix is irreducible if and only if its digraph is strongly connected. The period is defined to be the greatest common divisor of lengths of cycles (more precisely, the closed paths) of the graph. And finally, the matrix is said to be primitive if there is a positive integer $n$ such that for each pair of vertices of the graph there is a path of length $n$ interconnecting these vertices. The theorem to be proved can thus be restated as follows: For every strongly connected digraph with the greatest common divisor of the lengths of closed paths equal to $1$, there is a positive integer $n$ such that for every pair of vertices of the digraph there is a path of length $n$ interconnecting these vertices. It seems to me that the theorem might be proved by means of number theory, but I have not been able to find a proof up to now. To be more specific, I am looking for a proof without the use of the Perron-Frobenius theorem (the proposition is used in the text to prove the Perron-Frobenius theorem). Any ideas?

  numbers. A second person tries to guess the number
  by successively selecting subsets of the $n$ numbers and
  asking the first person whether $x$ is in each set. The
  first person answers either “yes” or “no.” When the first
  person answers each query truthfully, we can find $x$

  used in each query in half. Ulam’s problem, proposed by
  Stanislaw Ulam in 1976, asks for the number of queries
  required to find $x$, supposing that the first person is allowed
  to lie exactly once. a) Show that by asking each question twice, given a number
  $x$ and a set with $n$ elements, and asking one more
  question when we find the lie, Ulam’s problem can be
  solved using $2 \log n + 1$ queries. b) Show that by dividing the initial set of $n$ elements into
  four parts, each with $n/4$ elements, $1/4$ of the elements
  can be eliminated using two queries. [ Hint : Use two
  queries, where each of the queries asks whether the
  element is in the union of two of the subsets with $n/4$
  elements and where one of the subsets of $n/4$ elements
  is used in both queries.] c) Show from part (b) that if $f (n)$ equals the number
  of queries used to solve Ulam’s problem using the
  method from part (b) and $n$ is divisible by 4, then
  $f (n) = f(3n/4) + 2$. d) Solve the recurrence relation in part (c) for $f (n)$. e) Is the naive way to solve Ulam’s problem by asking

My students differ in background and motivation. Most of them are prospective high school math teachers. Typically they have seen some proofs, but not a lot; for example, they may have proved that the sum of two odd numbers is even. Most of the students won't yet have taken analysis, or algebra, or any other course obliging them to work really hard.

The entries on the superdiagonal play a crucial role, in that the $n-1$ matrices with a single $1$ on the superdiagonal ($1$s on the diagonal and $0$s elsewhere) generate all of $\Gamma$. Trying to write down a presentation, I would start by choosing $n-1$ generators, $a_{12},\dotsc,a_{n-1,n}$ (named after the matrix entries). It is also clear that we need commutation relations, like
$$
[\cdots[[[a_{12},a_{23}],[a_{23},a_{34}]],\ldots]\cdots]=\cdots=e.

(If $n=3$, this would just be $[[a_{12},a_{23}],a_{12}]=[[a_{12},a_{23}],a_{23}]=e$.)

$$
[a_{12},a_{34}]=e,

I was wondering, however, if there were any other steps I could take to progress the problem further a little bit further. For instance (assuming I did not make any mistakes), if $A$ is normal then $A = U \Lambda U^H$, where $\Lambda=\text{diag}(\lambda1,\lambda2,\ldots,\lambda_n)$ contains the eigenvalues and $U$ is unitary. Then \begin{equation}
\int_0^t e^{A(t-t')} e^{A^T (t-t')} dt' = U \left[\int_0^t e^{2\Lambda(t-t')} dt'\right]U^H = U \left[(2\Lambda)^{-1} (e^{2\Lambda t} - I)\right]U^H

172498,Two algebraic geometry questions: Lines through generic points and degree of varieties,"I'm currently reading Beauville: complex algebraic surfaces as a start for my master thesis in algebraic geometry. Before, i did two courses on AG, basicaly chapters 1 and 2 of Hartshorne and some cohomology theory. Now Beauville uses the term ""generic"" every now and then, and i'm having a hard time finding out if he means a property of a generic point of a variety, or a property that one expects to hold for a random point.
So a first question could be: how is this term used normally in algebraic geometry? However i have more specific questions: By a generic point i will mean a non closed point on n dimensional projective space (so a non maximal prime ideal).
Pick a point p in $\mathbb{P}^n$, and consider projection away from p.
Question: What happens if p is not a closed point?
My guess is that a line L trough p must contain $\overline{p}$, which we for the moment suppose to be a line, hence $L = \overline{p}$? So there is just one line through p?? But then projection from p does not make sense.
And if the dimension of $\overline{p}$ is bigger then one, then a line through p has dimension bigger then one? That does not make sense at all.
However, Beauville page 42, prop IV.5, talks about ""generic projection"". Question: So does he mean projection away from the generic point, or does he mean generic in the sense of ""almost all points"" here? If my reasoning above is correct, it will of course be the last, but it very well might be flawed. So far for generic. My second and last question concerns degree of varieties. On the same page, p.42, Beauville talks about a surface S in $\mathbb{P}^n$. He lets H be a hyperplane section of S, and then says H.H = deg(S) (intersection product of curves)
Question 1: I assumed that by a ""hyperplane section of S"", he means the intersection of S with a hyperplane (assumed to be nonempty). Is this correct?
Question 2: Is it true in general that the intersection product of such a hyperplane section with itself gives the degree of a surface? The questions seem really specific, but answers to them will help me in a lot of other places in the book as well! So lots of thanks in advance!!

Let $s_n$ denotes partial sum $\sum_{j=1}^n a_j$ . We know that the proof of $\Rightarrow$ direction makes use of the fact that convergent series implies the sequence of partial sum converges and thus is Cauchy in $\mathbb{R}$ . So here is part of the proof, since sequence of partial sum is Cauchy, therefore given $\epsilon>0$ , there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \ge m \ge N$ , $|s_n - s_{m-1}|< \epsilon$ . I do not get the $s_{m-1}$ part, i.e. I do not get why you can pick $m-1$ , since there is possibility for $m=N$ , and thus having $m-1<N$ , which in this case you cannot guarantee the sequence of partial sum Cauchy. When I was thinking about this, I was rather confused, and my original thought was following: Starting from the sequence of partial sum being Cauchy, $|s_n-s_m|< \epsilon$ , for all $n,m\ge N$ (the definition of Cauchy sequence), and without loss of generality we can pick $n>m$ such that $|s_n- s_m|=|\sum_{j=m+1}^{n} a_j|< \epsilon$ , but this differs from the statement of the theorem somehow.

Let $(\mathfrak{N}_i,\alpha_{ij}')$ denote the direct system of nilradicals $\mathfrak{N}_i \subseteq A_i$ with $\alpha_{ij}'$ the restriction of $\alpha_{ij}$ to $\mathfrak{N}_i$. Say $\mathfrak{N}_\infty$ is the direct limit of the nilradicals and $\nu_i: \mathfrak{N}_i\to \mathfrak{N}_\infty$ the associated homomorphisms.

The collection of equivalence classes in $\mathfrak{N}_\infty$ is not actually contained in $A_\infty$. But perhaps there is some sort of identification that I may be missing that permits me to view $\nu_i$ as a restriction?

The configuration space of $n$ points on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ is:
$$C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})=\{(z_{1},...,z_{n}) \in \mathbb{C} \times \cdot \cdot \cdot \times \mathbb{C} \text{ | } z_{i} \neq z_{j} \text{ if } i \neq j\}$$ A point on $C_{o,\hat{n}}$ is denoted by a vector $\vec{z} = (z_{1},...,z_{n})$. The group action $S_{n} \times C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C}) \rightarrow C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})$ has the property that $\forall \vec{z} \in C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})$, $\sigma\vec{z}=\vec{z}$ implies $\sigma = e$, where $\sigma \in S_{n}$ and $e$ is the identity permutation. Thus,  the symmetric group acts freely on $C_{o,\hat{n}}$, permuting the coordinates in each $\vec{z} \in C_{o,\hat{n}}$. According to the notes I am reading, the orbit space $S_{n}(\vec{z})=\{\sigma\vec{z} \text{ | } \sigma \in S_{n}\}$ with $\vec{z} \in C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})$ is equivalent to the configuration space modulo the permutation group. That is, $$C_{o,n} = S_{n}(\vec{z}) = C_{o,\hat{n}}(\mathbb{C})\Big/\Sigma_{n}$$ is the orbit space of the group action and we let $\tau: C_{o,\hat{n}} \rightarrow C_{o,n}$ be the orbit space projection. Then, letting $\vec{p}=(p_{1},...,p_{n})$ be a fixed base point, we define the pure braid group $\textbf{P}_{n}$ on $n$ strands and the braid group $\textbf{B}_{n}$ on $n$ strands to be the following fundamental groups, respectively. $$\textbf{P}_{n} = \pi_{1}(C_{o,\hat{n}},\vec{p})$$
$$\textbf{B}_{n} = \pi_{1}(C_{o,n},\tau(\vec{p}))$$ EDIT: I have been able to answer some of my own questions recently by further thinking and research but I have one remaining question.

I can visualize how if we place our base point as a configuration of collinear points that we obtain a braid on $n$ strands, but I am not sure why there is a non-trivial loop. My understanding of homotopy is that if there is no ""hole"" in the space, then we can continuously retract our loop in $C_{o,\hat{n}}$ back to our base point $\vec{p}$.

Let's say I create ""virtual groups"" which are inverses with respect to $\times$ (like getting $\mathbb{Z}$ from $\mathbb{N}$).  Then I have a group $G$ whose elements are all groups. This isn't allowed, though, is it?  Since a set can't be a member of itself.","['elementary-set-theory', 'group-theory']"
172753,Is there a monotonic function discontinuous over some dense set?,"Can we construct a monotonic function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that there is a dense set in some interval $(a,b)$ for which $f$ is discontinuous at all points in the dense set?  What about a strictly monotonic function? My intuition tells me that such a function is impossible. Here is a rough sketch of an attempt at proving that such a function does not exist: we could suppose a function satisfies these conditions.  Take an $\epsilon > 0$ and two points $x,y$ in this dense set such that $x<y$.  Then, $f(x)<f(y)$ because if they are equal, then the function is constant at all points in between, and there is another element of $X$ between $x$ and $y$, which would be a contradiction.  Take $f(y)-f(x)$.  By the Archimedean property of the reals, $f(y)-f(x)<n\epsilon$ for some $n$. However, after this point, I am stuck.  Could we somehow partition $(x,y)$ into $n$ subintervals and conclude that there must be some point on the dense set that is continuous?","['continuity', 'real-analysis']"
172754,When is this quotient by an action on the product of a variety with itself non-singular,"Let $X$ be a smooth projective geometrically connected variety over a field $k$. Let the cyclic group $G=\{e,a\}$ with two elements act on $X \times X$ via $a\cdot (x_1,x_2) = (x_2,x_1)$. When is the quotient $X\times X/ G$ nonsingular? I wrote down the case of $X=\mathbf{A}^1$. The answer is that $X\times X/G$ is given by nonsingular scheme $\mathrm{Spec} (k[xy,x+y]) \cong \mathbf{A}^2$, where $\mathbf{A}^1_x\times \mathbf{A}^1_y = X\times X = \mathrm{Spec} (k[x]\otimes k[y])$. (The subscript $x$ and $y$ indicate the coordinate used.) I'm very interested in the case $\dim X = 1$.","['arithmetic-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"
