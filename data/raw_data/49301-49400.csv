501838,Probability of second ball being black,"I was taking Caltech - ML Course and solving problem 1.3 in this link We have 2 opaque bags, each containing 2 balls. One bag has 2 black balls and
the other has a black ball and a white ball. You pick a bag at random and then pick one of the balls in that bag at random. When you look at the ball, it is black. You now pick the second ball from that same bag. What is the probability that this ball is also black? I tried to do this way: Since we are trying to find the probability of 2nd being ball being black when we already know that first ball is black. This reduces our problem to probability by which we picked the bag with two black balls. So the answer should be 1/2. PS: This is not a homework/assignment. This course has been already finished. I am just taking it offline for learning purpose.",['probability']
501874,Proof verification,"I have a problem and a proposed solution. I want to know if I have done it correctly. Problem Statement: Let $V=F^n$ be the space of column vectors. Prove that every subspace $W$ of $V$ is the space of solutions of some system of homogeneous linear equations $AX=0$. My solution: The null space of an $m$ x $n$ matrix $A$, written as $Nul A$, is the set of all solutions to the homogeneous equation $Ax = 0$. The null space of an $m$ x $n$ matrix $A$ is a subspace of $R^n$. Equivalently, the set of all solutions to a system $Ax = 0$ of $m$ homogeneous linear equations in $n$ unknowns is a subspace of $R^n$. Then I proceeded to prove that the properties of a subspace hold for the null space, and hence the null space is a subspace of $R^n$.

501888,Why is $\det(A - \lambda I)$ zero?,"I was reading over some notes of mine from the Linear Algebra class I took a while ago in order to prepare myself for Computer Graphics course I'll be taking this Fall and I ran across a sentence that I can't quite grasp. It states that Since we have a non-zero vector $x$ in the nullspace of $A - \lambda I$, then $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$. From reading Wikipedia page on determinants I got that ... the system has a unique solution exactly when the determinant is nonzero; when the determinant is zero there are either no solutions or many solutions. So if we have vector $x$ in the nullspace of $A-\lambda I$, then we have either 0 solutions or many solutions. But I still don't understand why $\det(A - \lambda I)$ has to be equal zero?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'characteristic-polynomial']"

502036,Is the ring and semi-ring definition of algebra and set linked?,"""Ring"" and ""semiring"" are concepts defined both in algebra and set theory. In Algebra A ring in algebra is a set R equipped with two binary operations + and · called addition and multiplication, that Addition (+) is abelian, Multiplication (⋅) is associative, Multiplication distributes over addition, and Multiplicative identity (1) exists. A semiring in abstract algebra ,  is an algebraic structure similar to a ring, but without the requirement that each element must have an additive inverse. In Set theory A ring of sets in measure theory is a family of sets closed under unions and set-theoretic differences.  That is, it obeys the two properties
$$A \setminus B \in \mathcal{R} $$
$$A \cup B \in \mathcal{R}$$
This implies that it is also closed under intersections,
$$A \cap B \in \mathcal{R}$$ A semiring of sets is a non-empty collection S of sets such that $\emptyset \in S$ If $E \in S$ and $F \in S$ then $E \cap F \in S$. If $E \in S$ and $F \in S$ then there exists a finite number of
mutually disjoint sets $C_i \in S$ for $i=1,\ldots,n$ such that $E
   \setminus F = \bigcup_{i=1}^n C_i$. I wonder, are such definitions somehow linked or equivalent? or they are just coincidence that both fields of mathematics used the same terms?",['abstract-algebra']

502045,Continuity+differentiability imply weak sequential continuity?,"Let $E$ and $F$ be two Banach spaces. We know that, if $f:E\rightarrow F$ is a nonlinear continuous operator, then $f$ may fail to send weakly convergent sequences to weakly convergent sequences, i.e., $u_n \rightharpoonup u$ weakly in $E$  does not necessarily imply $f(u_n)\rightharpoonup f(u)$ weakly in $F$. Even through $f$ has very mild non-linearity,  this weak sequential continuity may fail. For example, let $u_n(x)=\sin(nx), x\in (0,2\pi)$. Then Riemann-Lebesgue lemma shows that $u_n\rightharpoonup u= 0$ in $L^p(0,2\pi)$ for any $p\geq 1$. 
Now, for $f(u)=\max(0,u)=u^+$, one has 
$$f(u_n)\rightharpoonup \frac{1}{\pi}\neq f(u)=0  \text{ in } L^1(0,2\pi). 
$$
Also,
$$
\int_0^{2\pi}f(u_n(x))dx=\int_0^{2\pi}\sin^+(nx)dx=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\int_{2k\pi}^{(2k+1)\pi}\sin (y)dy=2, 
$$
which implies $f(u_n)$ can not converge weakly to  $0=f(u)$ in $L^2(0,2\pi)$. If $g(u)=|u|$, then 
$$g(u_n)\rightharpoonup \frac{2}{\pi}\neq g(u)=0  \text{ in } L^1(0,2\pi). 
$$
From these two examples, we see there is no general hope that a continuous map  preserves weak sequential continuity. We are wondering what kind of conditions imposed on $f$ so that it preserves weak sequential continuity.  For the two examples above, we note that both $f$ and $g$ are sub-linear ($|f(u)|\leq c|u|$ for some  constant $c>0$),  continuous but not differentiable. Now, a natural question arises: whether a sub-linear ($|f(u)|\leq a|u|+b$ for some positive constant $a$ and non-negative constant $b$), continuous and differentiable map $f:E\rightarrow F$ preserves weak sequential continuity? Here, we emphasize the non-linearity of $f$, since, for linear map $f$, it is known from functional analysis this question holds. For this question, one can choose $E$ and $F$ to be Hilbert spaces, for convenience. As concrete examples, one may test: 1. $u_n\rightharpoonup u$ with $u_n\geq 0$ in $L^2(\Omega)$ and $f(u)=\frac{u}{1+u}$, do we have $f(u_n)\rightharpoonup f(u)$ in $L^2(\Omega)$? 2. $u_n\rightharpoonup u$ in $L^2(\Omega)$ and $g(u)=\frac{u}{1+u^2}$, do we have $g(u_n)\rightharpoonup g(u)$ in $L^2(\Omega)$?

  if the length of $I$ is not less than $2\sqrt{\dfrac{M_{0}}{M_{2}}}$ (b):the numbers $2$ and $\sqrt{2}$ (in part a) cannot be replaced by smaller numbers. My try:for part $(a)$ I can prove if the length of $I$ is not less than $4\sqrt{\dfrac{M_{0}}{M_{2}}}$ my proof: $$f(c)-f(x)=f'(x)(c-x)+\dfrac{f''(x+\theta_{1}(c-x))}{2}(c-x)^2$$
  let $c-x=h$
  then we have
  $$f'(x)=\dfrac{f(c)-f(x)}{h}-\dfrac{f''(x+\theta_{1}h)}{2}h$$
  Thus
  $$f'(x)\le\dfrac{2M_{0}}{h}+\dfrac{1}{2}M_{2}h$$
  Now taking $h=2\sqrt{\dfrac{M_{0}}{M_{2}}}$, which in turn implies that
  $$M_{1}\le2\sqrt{M_{0}M_{2}}$$
  and $$c=x+h=2\sqrt{\dfrac{M_{0}}{M_{2}}}+x>2\sqrt{\dfrac{M_{0}}{M_{2}}}$$

502449,The rotation of dice on a grid,"Imagine you have a plane, flat surface with a square grid drawn on it. You have a standard cubic die  which is placed flat on the surface. Its length is the same as the length of side of each grid square. The only way to move the die to an adjacent square is by tipping the die into the square. So obviously the die cannot move diagonally. Since this grid is infinitely large, there are infinite round trips that can be made with the die. Some of these round-trips can cause a rotation of the die. The set of all round trips can be categorized into equivalence sets, where each class represents a particular rotation following a round-trip. These rotations naturally constitute a group. Can anyone list out all possible rotations in this configuration? Also, when moving the die around, I noticed that it was impossible for a round-trip to produce a 90 degree rotation about the the axis perpendicular to the surface. Can anyone give me a simple proof of this? It seems to be an easy proof, but I am unable to show it. Also, if we generalize this to a n-sided die, what are the impossible rotations?

Let $\hat{\theta}=\bar{X}$ be an estimate of $\theta$. Question: (i) is $\hat{\theta}$ unbiased? (ii) is $\hat{\theta}$ consistent? (iii) is $\hat{\theta}$ sufficient? (iv) why doesn't the Cramer-Rao lower bound apply? Answer: 
(i) To determine if $\hat{\theta}$ is unbiased we check that $E(\hat{\theta}) = \theta$ for all $\theta$:
$$E(\hat{\theta})   =   \int\limits_{0}^{3\theta} x \frac{2}{3\theta}\left(  1- \frac{x}{3\theta} \right)dx  =    \int\limits_{0}^{3\theta}  \left(\frac{2x}{3\theta} - \frac{2x^2}{9\theta ^2} \right)dx  =  \left[   \frac{x ^2}{3\theta} - \frac{2x^3}{27 \theta^2}  \right]_{x=0}^{x=3\theta}    =  \left(     \frac{9\theta^2}{3\theta} - \frac{54\theta^3}{27\theta^2}   \right)=\theta  $$
Thus $\hat{\theta}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\theta$. (iv) The support (domain for which $f_{\theta}>0$ is dependent on $\theta$ thus the regularity conditions are not met and the Cramer-Rao lower bound on does not necessarily apply.

The framework is semigroups, but obviously it has a lot of application within matrix theory. In the article mention is made of the ""trace product"" - it is defined as: if $a,b \in S$, then $ab$ is a trace product if $ab \in \mathcal{R}_a \cap \mathcal{L}_b$. Here $\mathcal{R}_a$ and $\mathcal{L_b}$ are the relevant classes from Green's relations. So I traced (no pun intended) this product back to two articles, one by Rees and one by Miller and Clifford (Regular D-classes in semigroups). So here the explanation is given of a semigroup $D^0$, constructed from a $D$ class and called the trace of $D$. The definition of the binary operation of this semigroup then includes this trace product. So this semigroup is used to prove that $D$ is partially isomorphic to a regular matrix semigroup. I am not so familiar with the abstract algebra of semigroups - does anyone know if this trace product mentioned here bears any relation to the trace of a matrix? or perhaps trace of a matrix product? as it is usually referred to in the context of matrix theory. Perhaps in a semigroup of matrices (say square matrices of the same size) you get some classes as per Green's definitions that can be characterized in terms of the trace of a matrix, and it is related to this trace product (it's a long shot I know...)?

  patch $(U, x)$ [where $U \subset M^n$ and $x=(x^1,\dots,x^n)$ are the
  coordinates) holding $p_0$ an $n$-tuple of real numbers $$(X^i_U) = (X^1_U,\dots,X^n_U)$$ such that if $p_0 \in U \cap V$, then $$X^i_V = \sum_j \left(\frac{\partial x^i_V}{\partial x^j_U}
 \right)_{p_0}X^j_U $$ So far it's fine, this is a reasonable definition of a vector. Now if $f:M^n \to \mathbb{R}$, we define the derivative of $f$ with respect to $\mathbf{X}$: $$\mathbf{X}_p(f) = D_{\mathbf{X}}(f) = \sum_j \left( \frac{\partial
 f}{\partial x^j} \right)_p X^j$$ Again, this makes sense. The author points out that there is a one-to-one correspondence between vector and differential operators of the form $\sum_j X^j\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\right)_p$, which is not hard to picture. But then the book says that we shall make no distinction between a vector and its associated
  differential operator. What's the point of this? I understand that there's an association between vectors and operators, and that this might be useful. But why would we make no distinction?

Unfortunately, the exponential terms remained even after substituting \begin{equation}
(k+1)^{n-m}=\sum_{i=1}^{n-m}\binom{n-m}{i}k^{i}

I know that in the trigonometric cirle, we can just look for the simetric angle in the other side and then the sine value will be the same, since the radius of the circle is $1$ (then the sine is just the height of the point, or the $y$ value). But I cannot understand how they became with this definition. For me, there's no sense to admit that the sine of an angle greater than $90^\circ$ will be symmetric to a triangle on the other side. I know that the Taylor expansion for sine can converge for any angle (in radians) but this expansion is derived from the derivative of the sine function, which should be only defined for $0^\circ<x<90^\circ$.","['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'sequences-and-series']"

I also have seen in Amemiya's Advanced Econometrics (1985) that Constrained Linear Least Squares can be used to impose a constraint on regression coefficients for an independent regression, such that the constrained estimated coefficients are: Bc = B - (X'.X)-1.Q.(Q'.(X'.X)-1.Q)-1.(Q'.B - C) Where Bc is the constrained estimated coefficients, B are the standard OLS coefficients, Q is a matrix of known constants governing the linear constraints on the coefficients, and C are the right-hand-side terms for the constraints (such that Q'.Bc = C).
