141392,"Random graph connectivity, and the existence of isolated vertices","Here $G_{n,p}$ represents the Erdős-Rényi random graph model, where the graph has order $n$ and each edge is added independently with probability $p$ . I am faced with proving the following claim: Show that there is a constant $c>0$ such that, for every $p$ we have: $\mathbb{P}(G_{n,p}$ is disconnected) $\leq c \mathbb{P}(G_{n,p}$ has an isolated vertex). $\,\,\,(*)$ From the appearance of the question I think it is meant to be interpreted as asking ''in the limit $n \to \infty$ ''. It is clear that $\mathbb{P}($ a fixed vertex of $G_{n,p}$ is isolated $)=(1-p)^{n-1}$ . It is easy to calculate the expected number of isolated vertices using this, but I'm not convinced that helps. As a last thought, a followup to the question asks ""What value of $c$ would be acceptable""? It is therefore probably not the case that a valid choice of $c$ will actually be obtained in the proof, although it may be reasonably clear how to calculate one; perhaps that clarifies the nature of the solution a little. Many thanks for your help. Edit: Update - I have thought a little more about it, and I have the following theorem we can hopefully make use of (if anyone is willing to help me!): suppose $p = \frac{\log{n}+\gamma(n)}{n}$ and $\gamma(n)$ grows at most slowly (say $o(\log \log n)$ ); then if $\gamma(n) \to +\infty$ , $\mathbb{P}(G_{n,p}$ disconnected) $\to 0$ , if $\gamma(n) \to -\infty$ , $\mathbb{P}(G_{n,p}$ disconnected) $\to 1$ , if $\gamma(n) \to k$ , $\mathbb{P}(G_{n,p}$ disconnected) $\to 1-e^{-e^{-k}}$ . Now in the first case, being connected implies no isolated vertex, so $(*)$ holds with any constant $c$ since both probabilities are 0. Likewise, in the second case, the graph is almost surely disconnected: while this doesn't immediately imply that an isolated vertex exists, we can hopefully say for $X:=\#$ of isolated vertices, $\mathbb{E}(X)=n(1-p)^{n-1} = n(1-\frac{\log{n}+\gamma(n)}{n})^{n-1} \sim ne^{-(\log{n}+\gamma(n))} = e^{-\gamma(n)} \to \infty$ . I think this last step holds but it may depend on $\gamma$ : in general I'm not sure for which functions $(1+\frac{f(n)}{n})^n \to e^{f(n)}$ , I know this is true for the log term but maybe not if $\gamma$ grows very fast (though obviously it can't grow any faster than $1-\frac{\log{n}}{n}$ otherwise we would have $p>1$ ). We can also calculate the second moment and get $\mathbb{E}(X^2)-\mathbb{E}(X)^2 \sim e^{-\gamma(n)}$ and deduce that with high probability there is an isolated vertex. Thus again, both probabilities are equal and we can take (e.g.) $c=1$ . The hard case is where $\gamma(n) \to k$ : in this case we can reapply the same method to get $\mathbb{E}(X) \sim e^{-k}$ , a constant. We can calculate again $\mathbb{E}(X^2) -\mathbb{E}(X)^2 \sim e^{-k}$ , and use Chebyshev's inequality to calculate $\mathbb{P}(X=0) \leq e^{-k}/e^{-2k} = e^k$ . If $k<0$ , then this gives us an actual bound on the probability; otherwise we just get $\mathbb{P}(X=0) \leq 1$ . Supposing $k<0$ then; we can rewrite as $s:=\mathbb{P}(X>0)=\mathbb{P}$ (isolated vertex) $\geq 1-e^k$ , $d:=\mathbb{P}($ disconnected) and using the fact $d =1- e^{-e^{-k}}$ and a little rearranging I think we get out the inequality $d \leq 1-\exp\left(\frac{1}{s-1}\right)$ . We can then find a $c$ which works by applying the lower bound to $s$ in terms of $k$ then looking at the values of $c$ such that $cx \geq 1-\exp\left(\frac{1}{s-1}\right),\,x \in [1-e^k,1]$ . However, this is only for fixed $k$ ! If we try and do this for every $k<0$ (i.e. every probability of this type) simultaneously, then we find that $c$ must be arbitrarily large. What's worse, this method doesn't work at all for $k \geq 0$ where we don't have a lower bound for $s$ : in this case $s$ can be arbitrarily small and we can't pick a $c$ big enough to always work. So close and yet so far. I am aware this question's length has spiralled out of control, so apologies for that - I know there's a good chance Math.SE is not going to provide me with an answer to this one. Nevertheless, it says add your working and this is what I managed to do! A proof which works for all slowly decreasing $\gamma$ or $\gamma \to k \in (-\infty,-\epsilon],$ any $\epsilon > 0$ .

I'm thinking that, if it's continuous on $(a,b)$, then $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to b^-} f(x)$ exist, and then one can just define $f(a)$ to be $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)$, and similarly for $f(b)$.

141441,Please suggest a functional analysis book to refresh my knowledge,"I would like to ask you to recommend me a good modern textbook on functional analysis to refresh what I already know. I am a computer science student and for the last two semesters we've been having a functional analysis course, but, big surprise, some months after I passed the exam I discovered my knowledge of the topic has considerably waned. My requirements for the book would be: Easy to read (the lecturer never dared to explain any of the topics to us, and we've been forced to do everything by ourselves. One thing I discovered about the lectures was that the material was presented in a very diverse way, topics sometimes were not connected to the neighbouring topics. Some theorems were brief definitions, some had EXTREMELY long proofs, while the idea of the proof was rather simple - i.e., the theorem about the completion of normed vector spaces. And he never gave us any intuitive examples of what these constructs could be like. So the material was unbalanced. I would especially like that the book has  intuitive explanations). Rather new (it is always bothersome to read books so old they are unaware of the existence of personal home computers. Most of the books we have here were published in the 1970s-80s, if not earlier, and they sometimes mention that some of the described problems could be solved on ЭВМ - an archaic Russian term for a computer. I think that the area of functional analysis is not one to be filled with computational examples, but nevertheless, maybe in the book they could illustrate some points with Mathematica or similar things). It may be for a complete beginner, or a bit higher level, but not a level such that the ordinary student would feel completely defeated on the second page :) The topics we learned are (by topics I mostly mean main definitions, some properties, some lemmas/theorems. We never went deeply into them): Measure and Lebesgue integral Introduction to set theory Measure, countable measure Outer measure, Lebesgue measure, measurable sets Measurable functions Stieltjes-Lebesgue measure (very very brief) Lebesgue integral Egorov theorem, Lebesgue theorem, Beppo Levi's lemma Normed spaces Vector spaces, definitions Norm Topology of normed spaces Banach spaces The application of contraction mappings to the solution of the Fredholm and Volterra integral equations Pre-Hilbert spaces Hilbert spaces Compact sets and Arzela-Ascoli theorem Linear operators Linear operators, definitions Bounded and continuous operators Invertible operators Closed operators Hahn-Banach theorem Compact operators The application of the theory of compact operators to the solution of second-order equations (Riesz-Schauder theory) Spectral analysis of linear operators Introduction to the spectral theory of linear operators.

141445,How do I apply smooth $p$-forms to vector fields?,"Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. My definition of a smooth $p$-form is a map section $\omega: M \rightarrow \Lambda^p TM^*$, i.e. if $q \in M$ is contained in a chart $U$ with co-ordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, then $$ \omega (q) = \sum_{i_1 < \ldots < i_p}a_{i_1\ldots i_p}(q) \operatorname{d}x_{i_1}|_q \wedge \ldots \wedge \operatorname{d} x_{i_p}|_q$$

141460,Use rectangular contour to integrate $\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(ax)}{e^{2\pi x}-1}dx$,"I have been self-studying CA and find it very interesting. So, working through problems in a book I have, I ran across $$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(ax)}{e^{2\pi x}-1}dx=\frac{1}{4}\coth(a/2)-\frac{1}{2a}$$ and $$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(ax)}{e^{x}+1}dx=\frac{1}{2a}-\frac{\pi}{2\sinh(\pi a)}$$ For the former, I wrote it as $\frac{e^{aiz}}{e^{2\pi z}-1}$ and used a rectangular contour with vertices $0, \;\ R. \;\ R+i, \;\ i$ $e^{2\pi z}-1$ has poles at $ni$. Of these, I think $i$ only lies within the contour. Unless I am in error, I then calculated the residue at $i$ to be $\frac{e^{-a}}{2\pi}$ So, $2\pi i(\frac{e^{-a}}{2\pi})=ie^{-a}$ Now, where I get hung up is setting up the integrals around the contour. Two of which should tend to 0 as $R\to \infty$. Here is what I done. $$\int_{0}^{R}\frac{e^{iax}}{e^{2\pi x}-1}dx+\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{e^{ai(R+iy)}}{e^{2\pi (R+iy)}-1}idy+\int_{R}^{0}\frac{e^{ai(x+i)}}{e^{2\pi (x+i)}-1}dx+\int_{\infty}^{0}\frac{e^{ai(iy)}}{e^{2\pi iy}-1}dy=-\sinh(a)$$ I am unsure of the limits on the second and fourth integrals. I am not so sure this is correct. The second and fourth ones, which represent the vertical sides,  should tend to 0 as $R\to\infty$. I hope :). This than gave me $(1-e^{-a})\int\frac{e^{iax}}{e^{2\pi x}-1}dx=-\sinh(a)$. Which does not look correct. I did manage to solve this using series and $\pi csc(\pi z)$, but the contour I am unsure of. Can someone lend a hand here?. Any advice on either would be appreciated. For the other one, I only posted it because it looks similar, but I believe is actually more involved and 'tougher' if you will. If I can get one, perhaps I can manage to evaluate the other. With that one, I think the same rectangle with the same vertices can be used, but $\pi i$ would have to be avoided. Perhaps a Principal Value in there somewhere. But, I was told to use vertices $0, \;\ R, \;\ R+2\pi i, \;\ 2\pi i$ Since I am relatively new to CA, setting up those integrals is the confusing part.

141666,Axiom of choice and calculus,"I thought many results in calculus need axiom choice.
For example, I thought one needs AC to prove that a bounded sequence in the real line has a convergent subsequence.
Recently I was taught that one only needs mathematical induction to prove it.
So here are my questions. Can most results in calculus be proved without AC?
If yes, what are the exceptions, to name a few? Obviously a theorem which uses Zorn's lemma most likely does need AC.
So please exclude obvious ones. Edit By ""without AC"", I mean without any form of AC, i.e. countable or not, dependent or not. In other words, within ZF. Edit One of the motivations of my question is as follows.
People often unconciously use AC to prove theorems.
And it often turns out that their uses of AC are unnecessary.
For example, an infinite subset of a compact metric space has a limit point.
In his book ""Principles of mathematical analysis"", Rudin proves this by choosing a suitable neighborhood of every point of the space.
He uses AC here, though he doesn't say so.
However, since a compact metric space is separable, you can avoid AC to prove this theorem. Edit I'll make the above statement clearer. You can even avoid countable AC to prove the above theorem.
In other words, you can prove it within ZF. Edit I'll make my questions clearer and more specific.
By calculus, I mean classical analysis in Euclidean spaces.
Take, for example, Rudin's ""Principles of mathematical analysis"".
Can all the results in this book be proved within ZF?
If not, what are the exceptions?","['set-theory', 'calculus', 'axiom-of-choice']"

There are then three questions: (I) Find $c$ and $\gamma$ such that
$(\phi_a \circ \rho_\alpha)\circ(\phi_b \circ \rho_\beta) = \phi_c \circ \rho_\gamma$. (II) Compute $(\phi_a \circ \rho_\alpha - \rho_\alpha \circ \phi_a)(z) $. (III) Using knowledge of the automorphisms of the unit disc, describe the automorphisms of the upper half plane $\mathbf{H}$ as fractional linear transformations. I mistakenly thought that part (I) would come down to just some simple algebraic manipulation, but I've gone through about a dozen pages of attempts and I just can't seem to get it in the form required to extract a suitable $c$ and $\gamma$. I'm really hoping that there's some neat trick that will make the answer just fall out. For part (II), I've gone through it and obtained a fairly horrendous answer, but I was wondering whether there is actually a tidy answer, namely one tidier than:
$$(\phi_a \circ \rho_\alpha - \rho_\alpha \circ \phi_a)(z)=\frac{\overline{a} e^{i\alpha} z \left( e^{i 2 \alpha} z - z - a e^{i 2 \alpha}\right) + a \overline{a} z + a e^{i \alpha} - a}{1 - \overline{a}z - \overline{a}e^{i \alpha}z + (\overline{a})^2 e^{i \alpha} z^2}.$$ Finally, for (III), I looked it up and the automorphisms of the upper half plane are $$z \mapsto \frac{az+b}{cz+d}, \quad ad-bc=1.$$ 
However, my interpretation of the question is to map the upper half plane to the unit disc, apply an automorphism and then map it back, i.e. for any $f \in \text{Aut}(\mathbf{H})$, $f = (\xi^{-1} \circ g \circ \xi) (z)$. So what I did was define $\xi(z) = \frac{z-i}{z+1}$, $g(z) = e^{i \alpha} \frac{z-a}{1-\overline{a}z}$, and then of course $\xi^{-1}(z) = \frac{z+1}{i z - i}$.

141774,Choice of $q$ in Baby Rudin's Example 1.1,"First, my apologies if this has already been asked/answered.  I wasn't able to find this question via search. My question comes from Rudin's ""Principles of Mathematical Analysis,"" or ""Baby Rudin,"" Ch 1, Example 1.1 on p. 2.  In the second version of the proof, showing that sets A and B do not have greatest or lowest elements respectively, he presents a seemingly arbitrary assignment of a number $q$ that satisfies equations (3) and (4), plus other conditions needed to show that $q$ is the right number for the proof.  As an exercise, I tried to derive his choice of $q$ so that I may learn more about the problem. If we write equations (3) as $q = p - (p^2 - 2)x$ , we can write (4) as $$
q^2 - 2 = (p^2 - 2)[1 - 2px + (p^2 - 2)x^2].
$$ Here, we need a rational $x > 0$ , chosen such that the expression in $[...]$ is positive.  Using the quadratic formula and the sign of $(p^2 - 2)$ , it can be shown that we need $$
x \in \left(0, \frac{1}{p + \sqrt{2}}\right) \mbox{ for } p \in A,
$$ or, for $p \in B$ , $x < 1/\left(p + \sqrt{2}\right)$ or $x > 1/\left(p - \sqrt{2}\right)$ . Notice that there are MANY solutions to these equations! The easiest to see, perhaps, is letting $x = 1/(p + n)$ for $n \geq 2$ .  Notice that Rudin chooses $n = 2$ for his answer, but it checks out easily for other $n$ . The Question: Why does Rudin choose $x = 1/(p + 2)$ specifically?  Is it just to make the expressions work out clearly algebraically?

141888,How to show that the commutator subgroup is a normal subgroup,"It is suggested as an exercise in Serge Lang's book ""Algebra"" to show that the commutator subgroup $G^c$ of a group $G$ is a normal subgroup. I'd like to do that but I am afraid I need help, I think the first thing I need to figure out is how a general element in the commutator subgroup looks like, so that I can check that the defining condition for normality is satisfied. That is, supposing for a moment that a general element in $G^c$ is denoted by $g$, I need to show that $aga^{-1} \in G^c,$ for all $a \in G$. But here I get stuck, first because I am unsure how to write a general element in $G^c$ - a simple product in $G^c$ is of the form $xyx^{-1}y^{-1}aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ where $a,b \in G$. I cannot see a way to simplify this - I am sure there is one, but somehow I am blind today. The second thing then is, even if one tries out the conjugation of a simple element like $xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$ in $G^c$, again not simplification offers itself easily I think .. what am I missing ? An alternative would be to find a homomorphism of $G$ whose kernel is precisely $G^c$ - here I tried to think of this as a map $G \times G \to G$ but whatever I cook up is not a homomorphism.

141892,Azumaya algebras,"I have seen a few different definitions of an Azumaya algebra in the literature- for example, Wikipedia prefers the following one: An Azumaya algebra over a commutative local ring $R$ is an $R$-algebra $A$ that is free and of finite rank $r$ as an $R$-module, such that the tensor product $A\otimes_R A^{op}$  (where $A^{op}$ is the opposite algebra) is isomorphic to the matrix algebra $\mathrm{End}_R(A) \sim M_r(R)$ via the map sending $a\otimes b$ to the endomorphism $x \mapsto axb$ of A. On the other hand, for purposes of checking this definition, I have seen the following characterization used: $A$ is a finitely generated projective $R$-module and for all maximal ideals $\mathfrak{m}\subset R$, $A/\mathfrak{m}A$ is a central simple $R/\mathfrak{m}$ algebra. Is there an obvious way to show that these are equivalent? EDIT : It has been noticed in the comments that the first definition specified ""local ring""- this is too specific for the two definitions to be equivalent. I'm interested in what can be said when one removes local (and as Mariano points out, replaces free by projective) from the first definition and allows $R$ to be just a commutative ring.",['abstract-algebra']
141913,"How to prove $(0,1)$ form is not $\overline\partial$-exact","On a complex manifold, if we are dealing with the $d$ operator, there's a pretty easy way of showing some form is not $d$-exact, simply by integrating in a closed loop.  If you can find a loop that is closed, but gives a nonzero integral for your form, then you know the form is not $d$-exact. However, I can't seem to find an equivalent test for $\overline\partial$-exact forms.  My intuitive understanding of the complex vector space is a bit shaky, but it I think if we integrate $\overline\partial f$ in a closed loop, we will get $-\int\partial f$ in that loop, which we don't really know anything about.  We can't come up with a loop on which $\int\partial f$ is necessarily zero, or necessarily anything specific. Is there some way to salvage this method, or is there another way we can prove $\overline\partial$-exactness?  Any overview about how you'd approach this sort of problem is also welcome.","['differential-forms', 'complex-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-operators']"

If we have such function , we can write any real number easily as shown below: $x=\sum \limits_{n=-\infty}^\infty f_n(x) 10^n$ I tried to find  power series expression of the function.

My Q is about relating mathematics and statistics to what in biomedicine and healthcare is termed ""evidence"" based on real world data. In 46 SuperBowls, NFC teams have won the last 15 coin tosses and overall lead AFC teams ~2:1. A graphic of the realized process (up to SuperBowl XLV) superimposed on pseudorandom tosses generated with Mathematica is shown on my infotainment site understars (shameless promo). There's no reason to presume the coins and tosses are biased (unless NFC teams have developed telekinesis lately) - the streak and bias is obviously a coincidence, however the probability of 15 wins in a row is 1/32,000 I think. I would be glad to offer a bounty for statisticians to explain and compute all the standard study-design related parameters associated with this process, like power and p-values associated with the null hypothesis of unbiased, independent tosses.

My doubts are that do I need to say something about the product metric? As far as I know there isn't a unique definition for it. Also this ""proof"" seems to be too simple -- I think it might be lacking in something. $(\Leftarrow) $ Suppose $a_k\to a$,  Then since $G$ is compact, given a sequence $(a_k, f(a_k))$, we can find a subsequence $(a_{k_n}, f(a_{k_n}))$ that converges (I am not sure what this law is, I hope I haven't confused the context and that it is really applicable here.) Since the limit is in $G$, therefore $f(a_{k_n})\to f(a)$ for $a_{k_n}\to a$. Therefore $f$ is continuous. Again, I think there might be holes in my argument, or perhaps even wrong assumptions.

141958,Why does the Hilbert curve fill the whole square?,"I have never seen a formal definition of the Hilbert curve, much less a careful analysis of why it fills the whole square. The Wikipedia and Mathworld articles are typically handwavy. I suppose the idea is something like this: one defines a sequence of functions $f_i(t) : [0,1]\to {\Bbb R}^2$, and then considers the pointwise limit $f(t) = \lim_{i\to\infty} f_i(t)$. But looking at the diagram, it is not clear that the sequence converges. I can imagine that we might think of following a single point in the range of $f_i$ as $i$ increases, and that point might move around, but only by $2^{-i}$ at each stage as we pass from $f_i$ to $f_{i+1}$, and so eventually approaches a limiting position. But I don't know how we'd get from there to showing that $f_i(t)$ converges for a particular value of the argument, especially for an argument other than a dyadic rational. And even if it does converge, every point in the range of each $f_i$ has at least one rational coordinate, so it is not at all clear why a point like $({1\over\sqrt2}, {1\over\sqrt2})$ should be in the range of $f$.

141974,Are these definitions of submanifold equivalent?,"Let $M$ be a manifold – by which I mean a second countable Hausdorff smooth manifold.

But what if we relax these conditions slightly? Definition B. A subspace $S$ of $M$ is a submanifold if there is some smooth structure on $S$ making the inclusion $S \hookrightarrow M$ into a smooth immersion. This definition makes it clear that the image of any smooth embedding is automatically a submanifold, but it is not clear how the smooth structure of $S$ is induced from $M$, nor whether such a smooth structure is unique. A little thought shows that definitions A and B are equivalent. Definition C. A subspace $S$ of $M$ is a submanifold if it has the following property: for all points $p$ in $S$, there exist an open neighbourhood $U$ of $p$ in $M$ and a chart $\phi : U \to U'$ such that $S \cap U$ is the inverse image of a linear subspace of $U'$. This definition leaves no room for doubt about the existence and uniqueness of a smooth structure of $S$ and gives a clear, concrete picture of how it is induced from the smooth structure of $M$. But on the other hand, one worries that this definition is too restrictive: it seems to imply that every submanifold can be locally thickened without self-intersection, which sounds like a non-trivial condition to me.
