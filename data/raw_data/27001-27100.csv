$$
   \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} e^{-px} \mu(dx) = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} e^{-px} \nu(dx).

Passing to the limit $p \to +0$ and using Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem we receive
$$
   \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \mu(dx) = \lim\limits_{p \to +0} \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} e^{-px} \nu(dx) < \infty.
$$
Is it true that measure $\nu$ is finite in general? If I'm not mistaken we can use monotone convergence theorem to pass to the limit under the integral sign. More precisely, $e^{-p_n x}$ is a monotone nondecreasing sequence of functions if $p_n$ is a decreasing sequence with zero limit. Furthermore, $e^{-p_n x} \to 1$. Then $1$ is $\nu$-integrable and
$$
   \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \mu(dx) = \lim\limits_{p \to +0} \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} e^{-px} \nu(dx) = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \lim\limits_{p \to +0} e^{-px} \nu(dx) = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \nu(dx)

I have the matrices $A$, $B$, $C$, $X$ and $Y$. All matrices are square (say n-by-n).

248639,Products of CW-complexes,"I am currently reading through May's ""Algebraic Topology"" and in the chapter on CW-complexes he shows that a product of CW-complexes is again a CW-complex, because one can define product cells using the canonical homeomorphism $(D^{n}, S^{n-1}) \simeq (D^{p} \times D^{q}, D^{p} \times S^{q-1} \cup S^{p-1} \times D^{q})$. However, I remember hearing that a product of CW-complexes need not be again a CW-complex, ie. the topology on it is not the correct one. Here, May is working in the category of compactly generated spaces and the topology on this product can in general be finer than the usual product topology.

248674,Prove that a continuous function $f:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R$ is injective if and only if it has no extrema,"I have a homework problem where I need to prove that a continuous function $f:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R$ is injective if and only if it has no extrema (local or global). So far what I have is: We'll assume that $f$ is injective and assume that it has an extrema, $(x_{0}, f(x_{0}))$. Since $x_0$ is an extrema, there is a neighborhood of $x_0$ such that for each $x$ in the neighborhood, $f(x)\leq f(x_0)$ or $f(x)\geq f(x_0)$. This is where I got stuck. Intuitively I understand that that on each side of $x_0$, there have to be two points whose values are the same, which contradicts the assumption that $f$ is injective - I'm having extreme difficulty proving it, though. If we assume that $f$ has no extrema, then I've tried to show that it is also a strictly monotonic function, but I'm having difficulty proving this as well. I'd appreciate any help.",['calculus']
248691,Example for a simple game of chance where the average value converges fast to the expected value,"I want to introduce the concept of expected value (for a discrete random variable, finite case) in a high school class. My first idea was to start with a simple game of chance and let the students play it. Suppose there are 25 students. If everybody plays the game once I have 25 outcomes which I could take to calculate the mean value of profits for this game. Then I want to discuss it and go over to calculate the probabilities of the game and then introduce the concept of expected value. My first idea for a game was this one: Throw a fair dice twice (= two random integers $i$ and $j$ between 1 and 6). If $i = 4$ and $j = 4$ you win 4\$, if exactly one of them is 4 you win 2\$ if $i \neq 4$ and $j \neq 4$ you lose 1\$. The expected value for this game turns out to be -0,03\$. However if you simulate this by playing the game 25 times you never end up with a mean value close to this, even if I let each student play it two times, such that I get 50 values it is most times far away from the mean value. I simulated it with a little python script and noticed that you have to play it at least 1000 times to come close to some extent to the expected value, so this example converges too slow for my purpose. So is there another game (of similar complexity) which converges very much faster and which is such that I can play it with the students as described above before discussing it?","['education', 'convergence-divergence', 'probability']"

248722,Equivalent conditions defining stable curves,"I'm learning the basics about stable curves. Suppose we have a connected complex projective curve $C$, at worst nodal and of genus $g\geq 2$. Then I want to prove that the following are equivalent: $|\textrm{Aut}\,C|<\infty$. For every smooth rational component $E\subset C$, $|E\cap\overline{C-E}|\geq 3$. The dualizing sheaf $\omega_C$ is ample. My attempts : for $1\Rightarrow 2$, I notice the following facts (but I might be wrong!): first, an automorphism must send a component onto itself. Second, it has to permute the nodes. Third, we have $$E\cap\overline{C-E}=\{\textrm{Nodes of } C\, \textrm{inside }E\}.$$
Hence if we have strictly less than $3$ nodes on a component $E\cong\mathbb P^1$, then because Aut $\mathbb P^1$ is 3-dimensional, we have infinitely many choices of automorphisms of $E$, which I can then extend to automorphisms of $C$. Contradiction. For $2\Rightarrow 1$, let $\phi\in\textrm{Aut}\,C$. By the condition $|E\cap\overline{C-E}|\geq 3$ I can choose $3$ points on every smooth rational component, and their images (permutations) determine a unique automorphism of $E$. Then, I would like to conclude using the fact that there are finitely many components and finitely many permutations. But I wonder if I can really conclude, because my argument does not involve singular components. So how to fix the reasoning ? Furthermore, I have no idea how to deal with the condition on $\omega_C$. 
Indeed I was able to show just one thing: namely, if $\omega_C^m$ gives me an embedding of $C$ in $\mathbb P^r$, then necessarily $m\geq 3$, and $r=(2m-1)(g-1)-1$. So, a ""$3$"" magically appeared, but I don't know how to use it! Last (aside) question . I'll be honest: I don't know why $\omega_C$ is invertible for such a curve $C$. Is there an easy way to prove it? Thanks for any help.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"
248737,Sunflower combinatorics,"$\newcommand{\ms}{\mathscr}$Please give me only a small hint, or give me an easier problem to solve that would help me do this. A sunflower is a family of sets (petals) for which ever pairwise intersection is the same. I want to prove Sunflower Lemma: Let $\ms{A}$ be a family of sets such that $|A|\le\ell$ for each $A\in\ms{A}$. If $|\ms{A}|>(p-1)^\ell\ell!$, then $\ms{A}$ contains a sunflower with $p$ petals. (Thanks to Brian M Scott for the correct statement of the lemma) I though about this a lot but I didn't get much. First I realized that a family of sets like {1,2,3,4,5}, {1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3}, {1,2}, {1} is never a sunflower. I also found that if there is no sunflower with empty core (I named the pairwise intersection the core) then our sets are made out of at most $lp$ symbols. It's also impossible for our sunflower to have full core (equal to the whole set) because there would only be one set in our family of sets. I tried to think a bit about the probability of two sets having an intersection, but it didn't seem fruitful because it's so complex to try to generalize this to more sets. I was thinking for a while about the largest possible set containing no sunflower. If it didn't have any empty set in it's pairwise intersection then out of every $p$ sets at least one pair must have a nonempty intersection. I tried to use pigeonhole principle to get 3 petals but this gave a too weak bound. I am thinking about some way of doing the induction step for $\ell$ like for sets of size $\ell$ then $|\ms{A}|>N=(p-1)^\ell\ell!$ has n $p$-sunflower $\implies |\ms{A}|>N \cdot (p-1)(\ell+1)$ for sets of size $\ell+1$ has a $p$-sunflower. The is that if you allow the sets to be bigger, they're much more capable of avoiding being sunflowers. The reason for that might be related to my first observation. If I have $N \cdot (p-1)(\ell+1)$ then I was first thinking each of the $(p-1)(\ell+1)$ blocks of size $N$ have a sunflower in them but I don't actually have that so I need a new idea. From Andres Caicedo hints I have the following: The proof should work by induction on $\ell$, so suppose than any family of sets of size $\ell$ will contain a $p$-petalled sunflower if $|\ms{A}| > N$, we would like to find a bound on the cardinality of a family of sets of size $\ell+1$ needed for it to contain a $p$-petalled sunflower. Suppose there are not $p$ pairwise disjoint sets, since if there were we would be done. Let $\ms{F}$ be a maximal disjoint subfamily of $\ms{A}$, then every set from $\ms{A}$ has nonempty intersection with exactly one set of $\ms{F}$ (otherwise it should have been included in $\ms{F}$ since it's disjoint to everything in there). This allows us to partition $\ms{A}$ into families $\ms{A}_F$ for each $F \in \ms{F}$ and any sunflower must be completely contained in one of the families. Since there are at most $p-1$ of the $\ms{A}_F$, we we would be able to get a bound for $\ms{A}$ and be done by pigeonholing if we could just figure out how large an $\ms{A}_F$ needs to be for there to be a $p$-petalled sunflower in it. This plan seems promising but I don't quite see how we could go from the idea of induction on $\ell$ to the idea of taking a maximal disjoint subfamily. If any element was in more than $N$ of sets then we would have a sunflower by the induction hypothesis (just remove the element and we have a family of $N$ $\ell$ sets). So I asked: How many sets would we need to meet $F$ in order for an element to be contained in $N$ of them? The answer is $N|F|$ which is at most $N (\ell+1)$. The pigeonholing argument gives us that we need $N \cdot (p-1)(\ell+1)$ sets in $\ms A$.",['combinatorics']

248759,"Normal Extension Equivalent to Same Degree Irreducible Factors (Hungerford, Exercise V.3.24)","I am doing exercises from Hungerford's Algebra for preparation of my exam. I would appreciate some help in a part of the proof of the following question: Exercise V.3.24. An algebraic extension $F$ of $K$ is normal over $K$ if and only if for every irreducible $f\in K[x],f$ factors in $F[x]$ as a product of irreducible factors all of which have the same degree. The part I have problem with is showing $F$ is normal when all factorization is of the same degree. Here is my progress so far: Let $u\in F$ be a root of $f\in K[x]$. We need to show that $f$ splits in $F$, so that $F$ is normal. Let $g=f_K^u\in K[x]$ be the minimal polynomial of $u$. Since $f(u)=0=g(u)$, we may conclude that $g\;|\;f$. Since $f,g\in K[x]$ and $g\;|\;f$ this shows that $g=f$, since $f$ is irreducible. Therefore for all irreducible $f\in K[x]$, if it has a root in $F$, then $f$ is necessarily the minimal polynomial of some $u\in F$. Let deg $f=d$, such that $\lbrace u_1,\dots,u_r\rbrace$ are the roots in the Algebraic closure $\overline K$ of $K$. (Such that $r\leq d$, assuming some roots may have multiplicity $>1$) $u_1\in F$ by assumption, but why can we assume that $u_2,\dots,u_r\subset F$? My guess is for some $\sigma\in Aut_K\overline K$, I can have $\sigma(u_1)=u_j$ that extends to an isomorphism $K(u_1)\cong K(u_j)$, since $\sigma(f)=f$ and $\sigma(u_1)=u_j$ are both roots. Then using some restriction on $\sigma$, I should be able to show that $\sigma(u_1)\in F$. But I am not sure how to do it.

I understand that much - $e$ and $\ln$ are inverse functions, so they cancel each other out and the end result is the same equation.But when he was showing us how to do implicit differentiation, he says that $y=\ln(f(x))$ can be re-written as $e^y=e^{\ln(f(x))}$, or ultimately $e^y=f(x)$. Same goes for converting a function $y=f(x)^{g(x)}$ to $\ln(y)=g(x)\cdot \ln(f(x))$. My first impression was to say WTF? I would have thought that raising both sides of the equation to a power of $e$ would destroy the equation... but apparently not. So my question is, what operations can you safely do like this to both sides of an equation - or if it's more concise, what list of things can you NOT do?

249041,Star-Shaped polygons,"We call a polygon star-shaped if there exists at least one point for which the entire polygon is ""visible"" from that point. The set of such points we call the kernel of the polygon. The art-gallery theorem states that $\left\lfloor\frac{n}{3}\right\rfloor$ points are sufficient (and sometimes necessary) to cover an $n$-gon and in particular this shows that polygons for which $n\le 5$ are necessarily star-shaped. However, the point which the art-gallery theorem selects is always a vertex of the polygon. I am interested in points for the interior of the polygon. The main question I have is: Given an $n$-gon for $n\le5$, we know that the closed $n$-gon is star-shaped. Is the open $n$-gon also necessarily star-shaped? In other words, is the intersection of the kernel with the interior non-empty? Intuitively, this should be possible by simply taking a point ""sufficiently close"" to vertex which oversees the polygon, but I am having difficult time finding a rigorous proof. Also note that this is not true for $n\ge 5$. For example, the following hexagon is star-shaped from the red vertex, but the open hexagon is not star-shaped. As an off-shoot of the above, I would also like to know whether this can generalize the art-gallery theorem: Is $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{3}\right\rfloor$ points in the interior of the polygon sufficient to cover it?","['geometry', 'graph-theory', 'computational-geometry']"

More precisely: we all know (or maybe most of us do) the roulette progression systems which were popular a while ago - they told you that you should wait for a streak of some three-or-more consecutive reds or blacks and then bet on the contrary, always staying with this colour and eventually it has to be drawn as with every other spin, the chances become higher for the streak to be broken. Of course the system is dumb and was shortly afterwards popularly neglected as a fallacy (though surprisingly many people still believe it works) as every spin is independent and even though you had a million reds in a row, in the next spin the odds for red, black and green are still the same as they had been these million spins ago. And here I see an analogy to Monty Hall - sure, if we were proposed ""Do you choose doors k and l (both at the same time!) or m?"", it would be a straightforward 2/3 to 1/3. But why don't we cast aside the fact of some door having a goat and treat the two remaining doors as a simple 50/50 just like we do in roulette?

We know that $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $g:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are continuous and differentiable on $(a,b)$. My attempt: Define $t(x):=c$ Let $t:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be continuous and differentiable on $(a,b)$. $t'(x)=0$ for all $x \in (a,b)$ $\Rightarrow t(x)=c$ , $c \in \mathbb{R}$ for all $x \in [a,b]$. Proof (with contraposition): assume that $t(x)$ isn't $const$ on $[a,b]$ $\Rightarrow \exists x_0 \in [a,b]$ that $t'(x_0) \neq 0$ Under the assumption there exists a $x,y \in [a,b] : f(x) \neq f(y)$ $w.l.o.g.$ assume that $x<y \Rightarrow (x,y) \leq (a,b)$ $\Rightarrow t(x)$ is differentiable on $(x,y)$ and continuous on $(x,y) \leq (a,b)$ With the mean value theorem $\Rightarrow \exists 
\eta_0 \in (x,y): t(y)-t(x) = t'(\eta_0) \cdot (y-x)$ Under the assumption we know that $(y-x) > 0$ and $t(y)-t(x) \neq 0$. $\Leftrightarrow \frac {t(y)-t(x)}{y-x} = t'(\eta_0) \Rightarrow f'(\eta_0) \neq 0 \Rightarrow Assumption.$ Now since we know that the differentiation of a constant function is zero we can define our $c:= f-g \Rightarrow f'(x)-g'(x)= 0 \Rightarrow f'(x) = g'(x)$.

249638,Unnormalized density function for a random variable,"Usually in probability theory, for a random variable whose value is in $\mathbb{R}$, we talk about its cumulative distribution function $F(x)$ and then its density $f(x)$, in good enough cases $F'(x)=f(x)$. That's the setup I'm familiar with, so I got annoyed when physicists talk about unnormalized ""densities"". E.g. if the probabilistic density of the position of a particle on $\mathbb{R}$ is equal to 1 everywhere, that means it is equally likely to appear anywhere. More generally you can imagine them talking about a non-negative function $f(x)$ being the density of something with the density $f(x)$ is not integrable on $\mathbb{R}$ but locally integrable, i.e. $\int_{[a,b]}f(x)dx$ make sense for $a\leq b, a, b\in\mathbb{R}$. As $\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(x)dx$ is undefined ($=\infty$), one cannot divide by it to normalize. Is there a mathematical way to make sense of such statements? There is one I have in mind, namely, one can talk about the density of some random variable $X$ up to a scalar multiple, such that for any intervals $[a,b]\subset [c,d]$ we can express the conditional probability as a quotient of integrals: $$P(X\in[a,b] \big| X\in[c,d])=\dfrac{\int_{[a,b]}f(x)dx}{\int_{[c,d]}f(x)dx}.$$ I only know very basic probability theory so I don't know if this makes sense.

249725,Hypothesis testing for Variance - choosing a null hypothesis.,"A gun-like apparatus has recently been designed to replace needles in administering vaccines. The apparatus can be set to inject different amounts of the serum, but 
  because of random fluctuations the actual amount injected is normally distributed with a mean 
  equal to the setting and with an unknown variance $\sigma^2$. It has been decided that the apparatus 
  would be too dangerous to use if $σ$ exceeds $0.10$. If a random sample of $50$ injections resulted in a sample standard deviation of $0.08$, should use of the new apparatus be discontinued? Comment on the appropriate choice of a significance level 
  for this problem, as well as the appropriate choice of the null hypothesis I approached this question as follows: null hypothsis $H_0: \sigma \le 0.10 $ and alternate hypothesis $H_1: \sigma > 0.10 $. Then I used Chi square:  $\chi_0^2 = \frac{(n-1)(s^2)}{\sigma^2} = \frac{(49)(.0064)}{.01} = 31.36$. I calculated the probability that a Chi Square variable with $49$ degrees of freedom would have a $97.6513\%$ chance of being above $31.36$: $P\{\chi_{49}^2 > 31.36\} = .976513$. What exactly does this mean? Does it mean that if $\sigma$ was to equal $.10$, there would be a $97.6513\%$ of finding a sample of 50 that would give you a sample standard deviation of $.08$?
