697,Are there variations on least-squares approximations?,"In least-squares approximations the normal equations act to project a vector existing in N-dimensional space onto a lower dimensional space, where our problem actually lies, thus providing the ""best"" solution we can hope for (the orthogonal projection of the N-vector onto our solution space).  The ""best"" solution is the one that minimizes the Euclidean distance (two-norm) between the N-dimensional vector and our lower dimensional space. There exist other norms and other spaces besides $\mathbb{R}^d$, what are the analogues of least-squares under a different norm, or in a different space?","['regression', 'approximation', 'linear-algebra', 'big-list']"
698,Looking for a probability distribution,"Recently I discussed an experiment with a friend. Assume we start a random experiment. At first there is an array with size $100,000$, all set to $0$. We calculate at each round a random number modulo $2$ and select one random position in that array. If the number in the array is $1$, nothing is changed and otherwise the pre-computed value is set. The question is: how many distinct hash values would we have added in $1$%, $5$%, $50$%, $95$%, $99$% of all cases? Example: $4$ rounds with array of size $10$: Array                     Position   random number
[0,...,0]                    5              0

701,How many circles of a given radius can be packed into a given rectangular box?,"I've just came back from my Mathematics of Packing and Shipping lecture, and I've run into a problem I've been trying to figure out. Let's say I have a rectangle of length $l$ and width $w$. Is there a simple equation that can be used to show me how many circles of radius $r$ can be packed into the rectangle, in the optimal way ?  So that no circles overlap. ($r$ is less than both $l$ and $w$) I'm rather in the dark as to what the optimum method of packing circles together in the least amount of space is, for a given shape. An equation with a non-integer output is useful to me as long as the truncated (rounded down) value is the true answer. (I'm not that interested in how the circles would be packed, as I am going to go into business and only want to know how much I can demand from the packers I hire to pack my product)","['geometry', 'packing-problem']"

707,The limiting case of a discrete probability problem,"Say there are three jars, $j_1, j_2, j_3$ filled with different binary sequences of length two. The distribution of the binary sequences in each of the jars is given by the $p_i^k(1-p_i)^{n-k}$, where 
$p_i = \frac{i}{m + 1}$ where $m$ is the number of jars, $i$ is the jar index, $k $is number of 1$$'s and $n$ is the length of the string. So for three jars we have $p_1 = 0.25, p_2 = 0.5$, and $p_3 = 0.75$ for $j_1, j_2, j_3$ respectively. Here are the sequences and their probabilities for $j_1$ with $p_1 = 0.25$: \begin{align*}
P(00) = 9 / 16 \\
P(10) = 3 / 16 \\  
P(01) = 3 / 16 \\  
P(11) = 1 / 16.
\end{align*} If I tell you that I have selected a binary sequence and the first element is $1$ what is the E($p_i$)? Well, this can be calculated by looking at each of the jars and adding up the probability of candidate sequences times the value of $p_i$. Edit: I wasn't normalizing this conditionally space properly. I'm skipping a step which I'll explain, someone wants. \begin{equation*}
E(p_i) = (4/24 * 1/4) + (8/24 * 1/2) + (12/24 * 3/4) = 14 / 24 = 0.58.
\end{equation*} So the question is ... what is $E(p_i)$ when the numbers of jars goes to infinity (or alternatively, when $p$ can take on values between $0$ and $1$)? Also what happens when the size of the binary strings goes to infinity? Does it have an effect on the outcome? If it does, does the order we take the limits change the answer? And most importantly what is the general case for when I have $s$ 1's and $r$ $0$'s?, with a continuous $p$ from $0$ to $1$ and infinite sequences?","['probability-theory', 'probability']"
709,Derivation of the formula for the vertex of a parabola,"I'm taking a course on Basic Conic Sections, and one of the ones we are discussing is of a parabola of the form $$y = a x^2 + b x + c$$ My teacher gave me the formula: $$x = -\frac{b}{2a}$$ as the $x$ coordinate of the vertex. I asked her why, and she told me not to tell her how to do her job. My smart friend mumbled something about it involving calculus, but I've always found him a rather odd fellow and I doubt I'd be able to understand a solution involving calculus, because I have no background in it.  If you use something you know from calculus, explain it to someone who has no background in it.  Because I sure don't.

Why doesn't the same thing happen for squares? If we start with the area formula for squares, $l^2$, this differentiates to $2l$ which is sort of right but only half the perimeter.

Matrix multiplication is associative, and I can compute $A^9$ with $4$ multiplications: $$A^2 = A \cdot A$$ $$A^3 = A^2 \cdot A$$ $$ A^6 = A^3  \cdot A^3 $$
$$ A^9 = A^6 \cdot A^3 $$ One method which works is to compute $A^{2^i}$ and use the binary representation of $n$, but this is not always optimal, e.g. with $n=23$, we can do it in $6$ multiplications: $$ A^2 = A \cdot A $$ $$ A^3 = A^2 \cdot A $$ $$ A^5 = A^3 \cdot A^2 $$ $$ A^{10} = A^5 \cdot A^5 $$ $$ A^{20} = A^{10} \cdot A^{10} $$ $$ A^{23} = A^{20} \cdot A^3 $$ rather than $7$: $$ A^2 = A\cdot A $$

735,"What does it mean to be going 40 mph (or 64 kph, etc.) at a given moment?","I was coming back from my Driver's Education class, and something mathsy really stuck out to me. One of the essential properties of a car is its current speed.  Or speed at a current time.  For example, at a given point in time in my drive, I could be traveling 40 mph.  But what does that mean ? From my basic algebra classes, I've learned that speed = distance/time.  So if I travel ten miles in half an hour, my average speed would be $20$ mph ($\frac{10 mi}{25 h}$). But instantaneous velocity...you aren't measuring average speed for a given amount of time.  You're measuring instantaneous speed over an...instantaneous amount of time. That would be something like (miles) / (time), where time = $0$?  Isn't that infinite? And perhaps, in a difference of time = $0$, then I'd be travelling $0$ miles.  So would I be said to be going $0$ mph at an instantaneous moment in time?  I'd like to be able to tell that to any cops pull me over for ""speeding""! But then if miles = $0$ and time = $0$, then you have $\frac00$? This is all rather confusing.  What does it mean to be going $40$ mph at a given moment in time, exactly? I've heard this explained using this strange art called ""calculus"" before, and it's all gone over my head.

756,Twenty questions against a liar,"Here's one that popped into my mind when I was thinking about binary search. I'm thinking of an integer between 1 and n . You have to guess my number. You win as soon as you guess the correct number. If your guess is not correct, I'll give you a hint by saying ""too high"" or ""too low"". What's your best strategy? This is an easy problem if I always tell the truth: by guessing the (rounded) mean of the lower bound and the upper bound, you can find my number in roughly log 2 n guesses at most. But what if I'm allowed to cheat once? What is your best strategy then? To clarify: if you guess my number, you always win instantly. But I'm allowed, at most once, to tell you ""too high"" when your guess is actually too low, or the opposite. I can also decide not to lie. Here's a rough upper bound: you can ask each number twice to make sure I'm not cheating, and if I ever give two different answers, just ask a third time and from then on, play the regular game. In this way, you can win with about 2 log 2 n guesses at most. I'm pretty sure that bound can be improved. Any ideas?","['searching', 'computer-science', 'algorithms', 'discrete-mathematics']"

The Euclidean distance is easy to calculate, but what if I were to restrict myself to traveling on the surface of the sphere? Two approaches come to mind: use arc-length in some way, or simply use trigonometry: calculate the angle between the two points and get a distance from that. Will both/either of these methods work?

764,How is the Riemann integral a special case of the Stieltjes integral?,"From Rudin's Principles of mathematical analysis , 6.2 Definition Let $\alpha$ be a monotonically increasing function on $[a,b]$ . ... Corresponding to each partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ , we write $$\Delta \alpha_i = \alpha(x_i) - \alpha(x_{i-1}).$$ He then goes on to define the Riemann Stieltjes integral of $f$ with respect to $\alpha$ , over the interval $[a,b]$ . The Riemann integral is then pointed out to be a special case of this when $\alpha(x)=x$ . With $\alpha(x)=x$ , I understand $\Delta x = x_i - x_{i-1}$ to represent the directed magnitude of the ""base of the approximating rectangle"" that we then multiply by the value of $f$ taken somewhere within this interval, thus obtaining the area of an approximating rectangle.

886,Deal or no deal: does one switch (to avoid a goat)?/ Should deal or no deal be 10 minutes shorter?,"Okay so this question reminded me of one my brother asked me a while back about the hit day-time novelty-worn-off-now snoozathon Deal or no deal . For the uninitiated: In playing deal or no deal, the player is presented with one of 22 boxes (randomly selected) each containing different sums of money, he then asks in turn for each of the 21 remaining boxes to be opened, occasionally receiving an offer (from a wholly unconvincing 'banker' figure) for the mystery amount in his box. If he rejects all of the offers along the way, the player is allowed to work his way through several (for some unfathomable reason, emotionally charged) box openings until there remain only two unopened boxes: one of which is his own, the other not. He is then given a choice to stick or switch (take the contents of his own box or the other), something he then agonises pointlessly over for the next 10 minutes. Monty hall [If you have not seen the monty hall 'paradox' check out this wikipedia link and prepare to be baffled, then enlightened, then disappointed that the whole thing is so trivial. After which feel free to read on.] There is a certain similarity, you will agree, between the situation a deal or no deal player finds himself in having rejected all offers and the dilemma of Monty's contestant in the classic problem: several 'bad choices' have been eliminated and he is left with a choice between a better and worse choice with no way of knowing between them. So??? Question: The solution to the monty hall problem is that it is, in fact, better to switch- does the same apply here? Does this depend upon the money in the boxes? Should every player opt for 'switch', cutting the 10 minutes of agonising away???","['game-theory', 'probability']"

918,How do I count the subsets of a set whose number of elements is divisible by 3? 4?,"Let $S$ be a set of size $n$.  There is an easy way to count the number of subsets with an even number of elements.  Algebraically, it comes from the fact that $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} = (1 + 1)^n$ while $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k {n \choose k} = (1 - 1)^n$. It follows that $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n/2} {n \choose 2k} = 2^{n-1}$. A direct combinatorial proof is as follows: fix an element $s \in S$.  If a given subset has $s$ in it, add it in; otherwise, take it out.  This defines a bijection between the number of subsets with an even number of elements and the number of subsets with an odd number of elements. The analogous formulas for the subsets with a number of elements divisible by $3$ or $4$ are more complicated, and divide into cases depending on the residue of $n \bmod 6$ and $n \bmod 8$, respectively.  The algebraic derivations of these formulas are as follows (with $\omega$ a primitive third root of unity):  observe that $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} \omega^k {n \choose k} = (1 + \omega)^n = (-\omega^2)^n$ while $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} \omega^{2k} {n \choose k} = (1 + \omega^2)^n = (-\omega)^n$ and that $1 + \omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 0$ if $k$ is not divisible by $3$ and equals $3$ otherwise.  (This is a special case of the discrete Fourier transform.)  It follows that $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n/3} {n \choose 3k} = \frac{2^n + (-\omega)^n + (-\omega)^{2n}}{3}.$ $-\omega$ and $-\omega^2$ are sixth roots of unity, so this formula splits into six cases (or maybe three).  Similar observations about fourth roots of unity show that $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n/4} {n \choose 4k} = \frac{2^n + (1+i)^n + (1-i)^n}{4}$ where $1+i = \sqrt{2} e^{ \frac{\pi i}{4} }$ is a scalar multiple of an eighth root of unity, so this formula splits into eight cases (or maybe four).

Notice that every deduction above follows from a natural question.  We never need to guess anything to proceed. Is there any natural way like the above to derive the complex exponential?  The only way I've seen it derived is as follows: Derive the real exponential by some method (inverse function to the natural log, which is the integral of $1/t$ on the interval $[1,x)$, Bourbaki's method, or some other derivation), then show that it is analytic with infinite radius of convergence (where it converges uniformly and absolutely), which means that it is equal to its Taylor series at 0, which means that we can, by a general result of complex analysis, extend it to an entire function on the complex plane. This derivation doesn't seem natural to me in the same sense as Bourbaki's derivation of the real exponential, since it requires that we notice some analytic properties of the function, instead of relying on its unique algebraic and topological properties.

Consider the system of equations (in complex numbers) $$z^b w^c = 1,\quad z^d w^e = 1.$$ I am interested in the solution set when we restrict both $z$ and $w$ to be $a^{\textrm{th}}$ roots of unity, for some positive integer $a$. Of course, one immediately sees that $(z, w) = (1, 1)$ is a solution. What are some nice necessary and sufficient conditions on $a, b, c, d,$ and $e$ which guarantee that $(z, w) = (1, 1)$ is the ONLY solution? To give an idea of the flavor of answer I'd be most happy with, one must have $\textrm{gcd}(a, b, d) = \textrm{gcd}(c, e) = 1$, because if $z$ is any $\textrm{gcd}(a, b, d)^{\textrm{th}}$ root of $1$ (which is neccesarily an $a^{\textrm{th}}$ root of $1$), then $(z, 1)$ is a solution to both equations. It also turns out that $z$ and $w$ must both be $\textrm{gcd}(a, be - cd)^{\textrm{th}}$ roots of $1$. I'd love to have an answer like ""$\textrm{gcd}(a, be - cd) = \textrm{gcd}(a, b, d) = \textrm{gcd}(c, e) = 1$ is necessary and sufficient"", with, perhaps, a few more estimates on gcd terms.

Suppose you are given $3$ equations $$z^a w^b = 1,\quad z^c w^d = 1,\quad z^e w^f = 1,$$ with $z$ and $w$ complex numbers of modulus $1$. What are necessary and sufficient conditions on $a, b, c, d, e$ and $f$ which guarantee that the only simultaneous solution is $(z, w) = (1, 1)$? The previous problem is a special case of this (which comes from setting $b = 0$.  Clearly then, $z$ must be an ath root of unity.  It turns that if $b$ is $0$, using the fact that $\textrm{gcd}(d, f) = 1$ one can show $w$ must also be an $a^{\textrm{th}}$ root of unity). And please feel free to retag as appropriate!

1283,Closed form of a partial sum of the power series of $\exp(x)$,"I am looking for a closed form (ideally expressed as elementary functions) of the function $\exp_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n x^k / k!$ .  I am already aware of expressing it in terms of the gamma function. Background / Motivation When counting combinations of objects with generating functions, it is useful to be able to express the partial sum $1 + x + \cdots + x^n$ as $\frac{1-x^{n+1}}{1-x}$ . For example, to count the number of ways to pick 5 marbles from a bag of blue, red, and green marbles where we pick at most 3 blue marbles and at most 2 red marbles, we can consider the generating function $f(x) = (1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x+x^2)(1+x+x^2+\cdots)$ . By using the partial sum identity, we can express it as $f(x) = \left(\frac{1-x^4}{1-x}\right)\left(\frac{1-x^3}{1-x}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right)$ .  Simplify, express as simpler product of series, and find the coefficient of the $x^5$ term. I want to be able to do the same for a generating function in the form $g(x) = \exp_{n_1}(x)^{p_1} \exp_{n_2}(x)^{p_2} \cdots \exp_{n_j}(x)^{p_j}$ The easiest way to extract the coefficient of a given term $x^p / p!$ would be to use a similar closed form expression for $\exp_n(x)$ and a similar technique to $f$ . Attempted Solutions Differential equation Recall that the way to prove the identity $1+x+x^2+\cdots+x^n = \frac{1-x^{n+1}}{1-x}$ is to define $S = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^n$ and notice that: $S - Sx = 1 - x^{n+1}$ . Likewise, notice that $y(x) = \exp_n(x)$ satisfies $y - y' = x^n/n!$ .  Via SAGE, the solution is $y(x) = \frac{c+\Gamma(n+1,x)}{n!}e^x$ .  Our initial condition $y(0) = 0$ so $c=0$ .  By (2) , $\Gamma(n+1,x) = n! e^{-x} \exp_n(x)$ so we have $y(x) = \exp_n(x)$ . Recurrence Relation Notice that $\exp_n(x) = \exp_{n-1}(x) + x^n/n!$ . Using the unilateral Z-Transform and related properties, we find that $\mathcal{Z}[\exp_n(x)] = (z e^{x/z})/(z-1)$ . Therefore, $\exp_n(x) = \mathcal{Z}^{-1}\left[(z e^{x/z})/(z-1)\right] = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_C z^n e^{x/z}/(z-1)\;dz$ . $(z^n e^{x/z})/(z-1)$ has two singularities: $z = 1$ and $z = 0$ .  The point $z = 1$ is a pole of order one with residue $e^x$ .  To find the residue at $z = 0$ consider the product $z^n e^{x/z} (-1/(1-z)) = -z^n \left( \sum_{m=0}^\infty x^m z^{-m} / m! \right) \left( \sum_{j=0}^\infty x^j \right)$ .  The coefficient of the $z^{-1}$ term is given when $n - m + j = -1$ . The residue of the point $z=0$ is then $-\sum_{m,j} x^m / m! = -\sum_{m=n+1}^\infty x^m / m!$ . Let $C$ by the positively oriented unit circle centered at the origin.  By Cauchy's Residue Theorem, $\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_C z^n e^{x/z}/(z-1)\;dz = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} 2 \pi i \left(e^x - \sum_{m=n+1}^\infty x^m / m!\right) = \exp_n(x)$ . Finite Calculus I've tried to evaluate the sum using finite calculus, but can't seem to make much progress.","['sequences-and-series', 'combinatorics']"

1302,How to test if a point is inside the convex hull of two circles?,"Following my previous question , I'm wondering how I can determine if a point is within the convex hull of two circles (a boolean value). There's no problem testing if the point is in either of the two circles, but it can also be ""between"" them and I don't know how to test for that. Seeing Wolfram MathWorld's article on Circle-Circle Tangeants , it seems that an inequation that tests if the point is on the internal side the two external circle tangeants would do the trick, but I'm afraid my solving skills are too far away to be able to turn the tangeant equations into a fitting inequality.

1311,Are there more rational numbers than integers?,"I've been told that there are precisely the same number of rationals as there are of integers. The set of rationals is countably infinite, therefore every rational can be associated with a positive integer, therefore there are the same number of rationals as integers. I've ignored sign-related issues, but these are easily handled. To count the rationals, consider sets of rationals where the denominator and numerator are positive and sum to some constant. If the constant is 2 there's 1/1. If the constant is 3, there's 1/2 and 2/1. If the constant is 4 there's 1/3, 2/2 and 3/1. So far we have counted out 6 rationals, and if we continue long enough, we will eventually count to any specific rational you care to mention. The trouble is, I find this very hard to accept. I have two reasons. First, this logic seems to assume that infinity is a finite number. You can count to and number any rational, but you cannot number all rationals. You can't even count all positive integers. Infinity is code for ""no matter how far you count, you have never counted enough"". If it were possible to count to infinity, it would be possible to count one step less and stop at count infinity-1 which must be different to infinity. The second reason is that it's very easy to construct alternative mappings. Between zero and one there are infinitely many rational numbers, between one and two there are infinitely many rational numbers, and so on. To me, this seems a much more reasonable approach, implying that there are infinite rational numbers for every integer. But even then, this is just one of many alternative ways to map between ranges of rationals and ranges of integers. Since you can count the rationals, you can equally count stepping by any amount for each rational. You can use 1..10 for the first rational and 11..20 for the second etc. Or 1..100 and 101..200 etc, or 1..1000 and 1001..2000 etc. You can map finite range of integers of any size to each rational this way and, since there is no finite upper bound to the stepping amount, you could argue there are potentially infinite integers for every single rational. So... can anyone convince me that there is a single unambiguous correct answer to this question? Are there more rational numbers than integers, or not? EDIT Although I've already accepted an answer, I'll just add some extra context. My reason for questioning this relates to the Hilbert space-filling curve. I find this interesting because of applications to multi-dimensional indexing data structures in software. However, I found Hilberts claim that the Hilbert curve literally filled a multi-dimensional space hard to accept. As mentioned in a comment below, a one meter line segment and a two meter line segment can both be seen as sets of points and, but (by the logic in answers below), those two sets are both the same size (cardinality). Yet we would not claim the two line segments are both the same size. The lengths are finite and different. Going beyond this, we most certainly wouldn't claim that the size of any finite straight line segment is equal to the size of a one-meter-by-one-meter square. The Hilbert curve reasoning makes sense now - the set of points in the curve is equal to the set of points in the space it fills. Previously, I was thinking too much about basic geometry, and couldn't accept the size of a curve as being equal to the size of a space. However, this isn't based on a fallacious counting-to-infinity argument - it's a necessary consequence of an alternative line of reasoning. The two constructs are equal because they both represent the same set of points. The area/volume/etc of the curve follows from that.","['infinity', 'elementary-set-theory']"
