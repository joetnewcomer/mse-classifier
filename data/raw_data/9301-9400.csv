70731,Exponential scaling?,"I have a series of numbers, say 2, 3, 7 that sum 12. I want to increase these numbers so that they sum 62. I could multiply each number by 62/12 to achieve that. However, all numbers would be scaled equally linearly. I want instead that 7 be scaled more than 2- i.e. bigger numbers to be scaled more. One way to achieve that would be to square each number. $2^2+3^2+7^2=4+9+49=62$ In general, given $a_i$ and an $n$ I want to find a $k$ so that: $$\sum a_i^k=n$$ I haven't been able to isolate the $k$. Can it be done or should I resort to finding it numerically (which sounds easy). I've tried using exponentiation... $$e^{\sum a_i^k}=e^n$$ $$\prod e^{a_i^k} = e^n$$ But I can't seem to find any useful manipulation with $a^{b^c}$. Thoughts?",['algebra-precalculus']

70760,Is there a clever solution to this elementary probability/combinatorics problem?,"My friend was asked the following problem in an interview a while back, and it has a nice answer, leading me to believe that there is an equally nice solution. Suppose that there are 42 bags, labeled $0$ though $41$.  Bag $i$ contains $i$ red balls and $42-(i+1)$ blue balls.  Suppose that you pick a bag, then pull out three balls without replacement.  What is the probability that all 3 balls are the same color? The problem can be solved easily by using some basic identities with binomial coefficients, and the answer is $1/2$.  Moreover, if $42$ is replaced by $n$, the answer does not change, assuming $n>3$.  However, this computational approach obscures any hidden structure there might be.  Ideally, I would like a simple and direct proof that the probability of getting RRR is the same as the probability of getting RBB. So, is there a nice solution to the problem, one that could be explained fully to someone without the use of paper?  Or is there no good way to explain this beyond computational coincidence?","['probability', 'combinatorics']"

Now, a proof starts with ""choose a nonzero vector in $L$ of smallest length..."". Why such a vector exists? In theory the lengths of vectors in $L$ can converge to 0. Another formulation for the same question with different approach: I am trying to understand the crystallographic restriction theorem (given, e.g., in Armstrong, ""Groups and Symmetry"", chapter 25 ). The relevant definition of a crystallographic group is a group of plane isometries whose translation subgroup is generated by two vectors. Hence when this subgroup acts on the origin the resulting orbit is a lattice. Armstrong finds $a,b$ for this lattice by choosing $a$ to be the nonzero vector of smallest length; but again, why do such vector has to exist in the orbit?","['geometry', 'integer-lattices', 'group-theory']"
70798,How to approach number guessing game(with a twist) algorithm?,"I posted this on stackoverflow, but was advised to also post here. It's kind of a math/algo question so I think it's kind of stuck between both worlds of math and computer science.  I believe this to be ontopic but if not, please let me know and I'll delete it. Here's the link to the stackoverflow post. I am learning programming (python and algo’s) and was trying to work on a project that I find interesting.   I have created a few basic python scripts but I’m not sure how to approach a solution to a game I am trying to build. Here’s how the game will work: Users will be given items with a value. For example Apple = 1
Pears = 2
Oranges  = 3 They will then get a chance to choose any combo of them they like (e.g. 100 apples, 20 pears, and 1 orange).  The only input the computer gets is the total value (in this example, it's currently $143).  The computer will try to guess what they have. Which obviously it won’t be able to get correctly the first turn. Value  quantity(day1)  value(day1)
Apple    1      100             100
Pears    2      20              40
Orange   3      1               3
Total           121             143 The next turn the user can modify their numbers but no more than 5% of the total quantity (or some other percent we may chose. I’ll use 5% for example.).  Using the above example, on day 2 of the game, the user returns a value of \$152 and \$164 on day 3. Here's an example. quantity(day2)  %change(day2)   value(day2) quantity(day3)  %change(day3)   value(day3)
104                             104         106                             106
21                              42          23                              46
2                               6           4                               12
127             4.96%           152         133             4.72%           164 (I hope the tables show up right, I had to manually space them so hopefully it's not just doing it on my screen; if it doesn't work let me know and I'll try to upload a screenshot). I am trying to see if I can figure out what the quantities are over time (assuming the user will have the patience to keep entering numbers). I know right now my only restriction is that the total value cannot be more than 5%, so I cannot be within 5% accuracy right now, so the user will be entering it forever. What I have done so far Here’s my solution so far (not much).  Basically I take all the values and figure out all the possible combos of them (I am done this part).  Then I take all the possible combos and put them in a database as a dictionary (so for example for \$143, there could be a dictionary entry {apple:143, Pears:0, Oranges :0}… all the way to {apple:0, Pears:1, Oranges :47}.  I do this each time I get a new number so I have a list of all possibilities. Here’s where I’m stuck.  Using the rules above, how can I figure out the best possible solution? I think I’ll need a fitness function that automatically compares the two days' data and removes any possibilities that have more than 5% variance of the previous days data. Questions: So my question with user changing the total and me having a list of all the probabilities, how should I approach this? What do I need to learn? Is there any algorithms out there  or theories that I can use that are applicable? Or, to help me understand my mistake, can you suggest what rules I can add to make this goal feasible (if it's not in its current state. I was thinking adding more fruits and saying they must pick at least 3, etc.)?  Also, I only have a vague understanding of genetic algorithms but I thought I could use them here; is there something I can use? I'm very very eager to learn so any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated (just please don't tell me this game is impossible). Thanks in advance. UPDATE: Getting feedback that this is hard to solve. So I thought I'd add another condition to the game that won't interfere with what the player is doing(game stays the same for them) but everyday the value of the fruits change price(randomly). Would that make it easier to solve? Because within a 5% movement and certain fruit value changes, only a few combo's are probable over time. Day 1, anything is possible and getting a close enough range is almost impossible, but as the prices of fruits change and the user can only choose a 5% change, then shouldn't(over time) the range be narrow and narrow. In the above example, if prices are volatile enough I think I could brute force a solution that gave me a range to guess in, but I'm trying to figure out if there's a more elegant solution or other solutions to keep narrowing this range over time.","['number-theory', 'logic', 'algorithms', 'real-analysis', 'probability']"
70801,How many k-dimensional subspaces there are in n-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb F_p$?,"I am asked to find how many there are $k$-dimensional subspaces in vector space $V$ over $\mathbb F_p$, $\dim V = n$. My attempt:
1) Let's find a total number of elements in $V$: assume that $\{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n\}$ is a basis in $V$. Then, for every $v \in V$ we can write down
$$ v = a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + \cdots + a_n v_n $$
and since the coordinates ($a_1, \cdots, a_n$) are from $\mathbb F_p$ there are $p^n$ vectors in $V$;  $p-1$ without the zero vector. 2) Let's look at a situation where $k=1$. Let's call this 1-dimensional space $V'$.
$$\forall v' \in V'. v' = a_1 v_1$$ where $v_1$ is a basis in $V'$. We know that if there are two non-zero vectors $u \in V'_1$ and $v \in V'_2$,  they are not linear dependant. So, every 1-dimensional subspace has $(p-1)$ basises. Therefore, there are $\frac{p^n - 1}{p-1}$ possible 1-dimensional subspaces in $V$ 3) k-dimensional subspace is defined by the set of it's basises. Since basis can not contain zero vectors we can write down the formula for selecting $k$ linear independent vectors: $C^k_m (p-1)^k$, where $m = \frac{p^n - 1}{p-1}$. Here we first choose $k$ 1-dimentioanl subspaces and then we choose one of $(p-1)$ non-zero vectors from each of the subspaces. 4) .. unfortunately, this is where I am stuck. My intuition says that the answer may be 
$\frac{p^n - 1}{(p-1)^k}$, but this might be completely wrong and I don't know how to go about finishing the problem. Thanks in advance.",['linear-algebra']

70841,Prove Fitting's theorem for finite groups,"Fitting's Lemma is: Let $M$ and $N$ be normal nilpotent subgroups of a group $G$. If $c$ and $d$ are the nilpotent classes of $M$ and $N$, the $L = MN$ is nilpotent of class at most $c+d$. There is an exercise on Derek J.S. Robinson's A Course in the Theory of Grouops : If $M,N$ are nontrivial normal nilpotent subgroups of a group, prove that $\zeta(MN) \neq 1$. Hence give an alternative proof of Fitting's Theorem for finite groups. The proof of the first part is easy. As $M$ is nontrivial and nilpotent, the center of $M$ is nontrivial. Suppose that $a \in \zeta(M)$, $a \neq 1$, if $a$ commutes with every element of $N$, then $a \in \zeta(MN)$ and $\zeta(MN) \neq 1$. If there is some $b \in N$, such that $aba^{-1}b^{-1} \neq 1$, then $aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in \zeta(MN)$, and $\zeta(MN) \neq 1$. On the book, the proof for the general case of Fittng's theorem shows by induction on $i$ that $\gamma_i L$ is the product of all $[X_i, \cdots, X_i]$ with $X_j = M$ or $N$.

70938,Natural and coordinate free definition for the Riemannian volume form?,"In linear algebra and differential geometry, there are various structures which we calculate with in a basis or local coordinates, but which we would like to have a meaning which is basis independent or coordinate independent, or at least, changes in some covariant way under changes of basis or coordinates. One way to ensure that our structures adhere to this principle is to give their definitions without reference to a basis. Often we employ universal properties, functors, and natural transformations to encode these natural, coordinate/basis free structures. But the Riemannian volume form does not appear to admit such a description, nor does its pointwise analogue in linear algebra. Let me list several examples. In linear algebra, an inner product on $V$ is an element of $\operatorname{Sym}^2{V^*}$. The symmetric power is a space which may be defined by a universal property, and constructed via a quotient of a tensor product. No choice of basis necessary. Alternatively an inner product can be given by an $n\times n$ symmetric matrix. The correspondence between the two alternatives is given by $g_{ij}=g(e_i,e_j)$. Calculations are easy with this formulation, but one should check (or require) that the matrix transforms appropriately under changes of basis. In linear algebra, a volume form is an element of $\Lambda^n(V^*)$. Alternatively one may define a volume form operator as the determinant of the matrix of the components of $n$ vectors, relative to some basis. In linear algebra, an orientation is an element of $\Lambda^n(V^*)/\mathbb{R}^>$. In linear algebra, a symplectic form is an element of $\Lambda^2(V^*)$. Alternatively may be given as some $\omega_{ij}\,dx^i\wedge dx^j$. In linear algebra, given a symplectic form, a canonical volume form may be chosen as $\operatorname{vol}=\omega^n$. This operation can be described as a natural transformation $\Lambda^2\to\Lambda^n$. That is, to each vector space $V$, we have a map $\Lambda^2(V)\to\Lambda^n(V)$ taking $\omega\mapsto \omega^n$ and this map commutes with linear maps between spaces. In differential geometry, all the above linear algebra concepts may be specified pointwise. Any smooth functor of vector spaces may be applied to the tangent bundle to give a smooth vector bundle. Thus a Riemannian metric is a section of the bundle $\operatorname{Sym}^2{T^*M}$, etc. A symplectic form is a section of the bundle $\Lambda^2(M)$, and the wedge product extends to an operation on sections, and gives a symplectic manifold a volume form. This is a global operation; this definition of a Riemannian metric gives a smoothly varying inner product on every tangent space of the manifold, even if the manifold is not covered by a single coordinate patch In differential geometry, sometimes vectors are defined as $n$-tuples which transform as $v^i\to \tilde{v}^j\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial \tilde{x}^j}$ under a change of coordinates $x \to \tilde{x}$. But a more invariant definition is to say a vector is a derivation of the algebra of smooth functions. Cotangent vectors can be defined with a slightly different transformation rule, or else invariantly as the dual space to the tangent vectors. Similar remarks hold for higher rank tensors. In differential geometry, one defines a connection on a bundle. The local coordinates definition makes it appear to be a tensor, but it does not behave the transformation rules set forth above. It's only clear why when one sees the invariant definition. In differential geometry, there is a derivation on the exterior algebra called the exterior derivative. It may be defined as $d\sigma = \partial_j\sigma_I\,dx^j\wedge dx^I$ in local coordinates, or better via an invariant formula $d\sigma(v_1,\dotsc,v_n) = \sum_i(-1)^iv_i(\sigma(v_1,\dotsc,\hat{v_i},\dotsc,v_n)) + \sum_{i+j}(-1)^{i+j}\sigma([v_i,v_j],v_1,\dotsc,\hat{v_i},\dotsc,\hat{v_j},\dotsc,v_n)$ Finally, the volume form on an oriented inner product space (or volume density on an inner product space) in linear algebra, and its counterpart the Riemannian volume form on an oriented Riemannian manifold (or volume density form on a Riemannian manifold) in differential geometry. Unlike the above examples which all admit global basis-free/coordinate-free definitions, we can define it only in a single coordinate patch or basis at a time, and glue together to obtain a globally defined structure. There are two definitions seen in the literature: choose an (oriented) coordinate neighborhood of a point, so we have a basis for each tangent space. Write the metric tensor in terms of that basis. Pretend that the bilinear form is actually a linear transformation (this can always be done because once a basis is chosen, we have an isomorphism to $\mathbb{R}^n$ which is isomorphic to its dual (via a different isomorphism than that provided by the inner product)). Then take the determinant of resulting mutated matrix, take the square root, multiply by the wedge of the basis one-forms (the positive root may be chosen in the oriented case; in the unoriented case, take the absolute value to obtain a density). Choose an oriented orthonormal coframe in a neighborhood. Wedge it together. (Finally take the absolute value in the unoriented case). Does anyone else think that one of these definitions sticks out like a sore thumb? Does it bother anyone else that in linear algebra, the volume form on an oriented inner product space doesn't exist as natural transformation $\operatorname{Sym}^2 \to \Lambda^n$? Do the instructions to ""take the determinant of a bilinear form"" scream out to anyone else that we're doing it wrong? Does it bother anyone else that in Riemannian geometry, in stark contrast to the superficially similar symplectic case, the volume form cannot be defined using invariant terminology for the whole manifold, but rather requires one to break the manifold into patches, and choose a basis for each? Is there any other structure in linear algebra or differential geometry which suffers from this defect? Answer: I've accepted Willie Wong's answer below, but let me also sum it up, since it's spread across several different places. There is a canonical construction of the Riemannian volume form on an oriented vector space, or pseudoform on a vector space. At the level of level of vector spaces, we may define an inner product on the dual space $V^*$ by $\tilde{g}(\sigma,\tau)=g(u,v)$ where $u,v$ are the dual vectors to $\sigma,\tau$ under the isomorphism between $V,V^*$ induced by $g$ (which is nondegenerate). Then extend $\tilde{g}$ to $\bigotimes^k V^*$ by defining $\hat{g}(a\otimes b\otimes c,\dotsb,x\otimes y\otimes z\dotsb)=\tilde{g}(a,x)\tilde{g}(b,y)\tilde{g}(c,z)\dotsb$. Then the space of alternating forms may be viewed as a subspace of $\bigotimes^k V^*$, and so inherits an inner product as well (note, however that while the alternating map may be defined canonically, there are varying normalization conventions which do not affect the kernel. I.e. $v\wedge w = k! Alt(v\otimes w)$ or $v\wedge w = Alt(v\otimes w)$). Then $\hat{g}(a\wedge b\dotsb,x\wedge y\dotsb)=\det[\tilde{g}(a,x)\dotsc]$ (with perhaps a normalization factor required here, depending on how Alt was defined). Thus $g$ extends to an inner product on $\Lambda^n(V^*)$, which is a 1 dimensional space, so there are only two unit vectors, and if $V$ is oriented, there is a canonical choice of volume form. And in any event, there is a canonical pseudoform.","['category-theory', 'linear-algebra', 'differential-geometry']"

In 2005 it was published again by Robert C. Alperin: http://www.math.sjsu.edu/~alperin/pt.pdf He seems to say in a footnote on the first page that he didn't know that someone had discovered this before him until a referee pointed it out.  That surprised me.  Maybe because of Roberts' book, I had thought this was known to all who care about such things. If we identify a Pythagorean triple with a rational point (or should I say a set of eight points?) on the circle of unit radius centered at $0$ in the complex plane, then we can say the set of all nodes in that tree is permuted by any linear fractional transformation that leaves the circle invariant.  The function $f(z) = (az+b)/(bz+a)$, where $a$ and $b$ are real, leaves the circle invariant and fixes $1$ and $-1$.  There are also LFTs that leave the circle invariant and don't fix those two points. Are there any interesting relationships between the geometry of the LFT's action on the circle and that of the permutation of the nodes in the tree?

Given a matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{9\times 9}$, find the optimal orthogonal matrix $X$ minimizing the following objective function.
$$J=\left(\mathrm{vec}X\right)^T A \mathrm{vec}X$$
I think Kronecker product may be useful for solving this problem. Does a closed-form solution exist? If not, is it possible to solve it iteratively? Thanks. EDIT ： a) Here $A$ doesn't have any special property. But it is also acceptable if solutions can be obtained by adding some properties on $A$. b) In the original problem, $X$ is constrained as a rotation matrix. But I think that would be even harder, so I put $X$ as an orthogonal matrix herein. Of course, optimal rotation matrices are better.","['optimization', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'numerical-methods']"
71144,Sloppy notation $ y'=f(t)y$ for differential equation $ y'(t)=f(t)y(t)$,"Why does one often use the following notation for differential equation: $$ y'=f(t)y$$
(this is just a particular example) ? What bothers me with this notation, which I have encountered in countless textbooks is, that one mixes in this notation the symbols which denote functions ($y',y$) with those that denote function values ($f(t)$).
Shouldn't the above be written either as $$y'=f \cdot y$$ (where the multiplication is pointwise understood) or as $$\forall t\in I:\ y'(t)=f(t)\cdot y(t)$$where $I$ is for example an interval - meaning either just on the level of linking functions with functions or just on the level of linking functions values with functions values ? How come, that in the subject of differential equations sloppy (even bad/confusing) notation is more the norm than the exception ? Side question: In a course I read a while ago, someone defined a function $t(y(x))=y(x)+y'(x)$. My question is: Is this even correct? Because one can't just define a function like that; either one defines directly a function $u$ as $u(x)=y(x)+y'(x)$ or either one defines $t$ and the composes $t$ with $y$. But in the last case (which was as one that was meant in the course) how should $t$ look ? One can't define a function $t:I\subseteq \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, as far as I know, such that $t(y(x))=y(x)+y'(x)$ for all suitable differentiable functions $y$.","['notation', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
71145,Construction of an non-measurable set,"I have a homework problem I am having trouble on. Could someone please help me? The statement of my problem is as follows: An equivalence relation on $\mathbb{R}^N$ is defined by $ x \sim y$ if $ x-y \in \mathbb{Q}^N$, so that the equivalence classes are defined by $[x] = x + \mathbb{Q}^N$. By the Axiom of Choice we can construct the following set C: Let B denote the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^N.$ For each equivalence class $[x]$  with $ [x] \cap B \neq \emptyset$, choose exactly one $y \in [x] \cap B $ to be in C. Let $I = 2B \cap \mathbb{Q}^N.$ i) Show the family of sets $ (q+C)_{q \in I}$ is pairwise disjoint. ii) Show $ B \subseteq \displaystyle\bigcup_{q\in I} (q+C) \subseteq 3B$ iii) Show that $m^*(C) > 0$ and deduce that $ C$ is not measurable. (Here $m^*$ is the $N$-dimensional Lebesgue outer measure). I am unsure how to approach i) at all. For ii) I have no idea how to show $ B\subseteq \displaystyle\bigcup_{q\in I} (q+C).$ For the second part of ii) since $I \subseteq 2B$ and $ C \subseteq B$ I can see why it should hold, but don't know to justify it rigorously. Here is my attempt for iii): Suppose $m^*(C) = 0.$ By ii) $ B\subseteq \displaystyle\bigcup_{q\in I} (q+C)$ so $ m^*(B) \leq m^*\left(\displaystyle\bigcup_{q\in I} (q+C)\right)$. Since $I \subseteq \mathbb{Q}^N$ is countable, by countable sub-additivity of outer measures $\displaystyle m^*\left(\bigcup_{q\in I} (q+C)\right) = \sum_{q\in I} m^*(q+C)$. By translation invariance of the Lebesgue outer measure $m^*(q+C) = m^*(C)=0$ so $\displaystyle m^*\left(\bigcup_{q\in I} (q+C)\right) = 0$ implying $m^*(B) =0 $, which is clearly false. Thus $m^*(C) > 0.$ Now suppose C is measurable, so $m^*(C)= m(C)$. By translation invariance, $q+C$ is measurable with $m(q+C) = m(C)$. From ii), we deduce $m^*\left(\displaystyle\bigcup_{q\in I} (q+C)\right) \leq m^*(3B) $. By part i), and Countable additivity of disjoint sets, $\displaystyle m^*\left(\bigcup_{q\in I} (q+C)\right)= \sum_{q\in I} m(C) = \infty $ since $m(C) > 0.$ But it is easy to show $ m^*(3B) < \infty $, which is again a contradiction. I am relatively sure by working for iii) is correct. If someone could check it, and also give me help on how to proceed for parts i) and ii), it would be very helpful.

71148,Continuity of a Composition map in a finite measure space,"I have a homework problem I am unable to finish. Could someone please help me proceed? Problem: Suppose $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ is a finite measure space (that is, $\mu(x) < \infty$ ) and $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is bounded and continuous. Define a composition mapping $ F (u) = f \circ u$. Show that if $1\leq p < \infty$ , the map $ F: L^p(X) \to L^p(X)$ is continuous. My working: Let $(u_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of functions such that $ \| u_n - u \|_p \to 0.$ We need to show that $ \| F(u_n) - F(u) \|_p \to 0.$ 
Since $f$ is bounded, there exists $M\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $|f(x)| < M $ for all $x\in \mathbb{R}$. Thus a dominating function of $h_n(x) = | f( u_n(x) ) - f(u(x))|^p $ is $g(x) = (2M)^p $ and since $ \int_X (2M)^p dx = (2M)^p \int_X d\mu = (2M)^p \mu(X) < \infty $, by the Dominated Convergence Theorem we have that $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_X  | f( u_n(x) ) - f(u(x))|^p dx = \int_X \lim_{n\to\infty}  | f( u_n(x) ) - f(u(x))|^p  dx. $$ By the continuity of $f$, the absolute value function and exponentiation by $p$, we can then get  $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_X  | f( u_n(x) ) - f(u(x))|^p dx = \int_X  | f( \lim_{n\to\infty}  u_n(x) ) - f(u(x))|^p  dx. $$ Now, from here I am unsure how to proceed. One thing I know is that if  $(u_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of functions such that $ \| u_n - u \|_p \to 0$, then there exists a subsequence $(u_{n_k}) $ such that $u_{n_k}$ converges pointwise to $u$ almost everywhere. If we let $N$ denote the set where the pointwise convergence does not hold, then we have $$ \int_X| f( \lim_{n\to\infty}  u_{n_k}(x) ) - f(u(x))|^p  dx = \int_{X/N} 0 dx + \int_N | f( \lim_{n\to\infty}  u_{n_k} (x) ) - f(u(x))|^p  dx =0$$ where the first integral is $0$ because the integrand is $0$, and the second integral is zero because $\mu(N) = 0$. So that shows the limit I want for at least a subsequence, but I don't know how to connect the others back to it. Any help would be greatly appreciated, but I would especially prefer if your answer finishes off my proof leaving most of it intact, rather than perhaps an entirely different start.

71175,"Why, conceptually, do limaçons $r=a+b\cos\theta$ have dimples when $|\frac{a}{b}|<2$?","Using calculus, I can justify that limaçons—the polar graphs of $r=a+b\cos\theta$ for various nonzero real values of $a$ and $b$—are dimpled when $|\frac{a}{b}|<2$, but that doesn't seem to yield any conceptual reason why that should be the case.  The boundary value 2 seems too nice to not have a conceptual explanation, so is there one? The calculus:  For this sort of limaçon, with cosine, there are always vertical tangents to the graph at $\theta=k\pi$, and the dimple is characterized by a pair of vertical tangents near one of those two locations, but equally spaced before and after it, whereas a non-dimpled limaçon only has those two vertical tangents.  Vertical tangents occur when $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is undefined; for polars, that means when $\frac{dy}{d\theta}$ is undefined (for our limaçon, never) or when $\frac{dx}{d\theta}=0$.  For our limaçon, $\frac{dx}{d\theta}=-\sin\theta(a+2b\cos\theta)$, so $\frac{dx}{d\theta}=0$ implies $\sin\theta=0$ ($\theta=k\pi$) or $a+2b\cos\theta=0$.  This latter case, which can be rewritten as $\cos\theta=-\frac{a}{2b}$, has no solutions when $|\frac{a}{2b}|>1$, a single solution that is already in the solutions from $\sin\theta=0$ when $|\frac{a}{2b}|=1$ (so, no additional vertical tangents and hence no dimple when $|\frac{a}{b}|\ge 2$), and two solutions when $|\frac{a}{2b}|<1$ (so two additional vertical tangents and hence a dimple when $|\frac{a}{b}|<2$).","['geometry', 'analytic-geometry', 'plane-curves', 'polar-coordinates', 'intuition']"

In addition, suppose that $R$ is a ring in which every non-zero element is either a zero divisor or a unit [For example: take any finite ring or any field.] My question: Is every non-zero element of $R^{n \times n}$ a zero divisor or a unit as well? We know that if $A \in R^{n \times n}$ , then $AC=CA=\mathrm{det}(A)I_n$ where $C$ is the classical adjoint of $A$ and $I_n$ is the identity matrix. This means that if $\mathrm{det}(A)$ is a unit of $R$ , then $A$ is a unit of $R^{n \times n}$ (since $A^{-1}=(\mathrm{det}(A))^{-1}C$ ). Also, the converse holds, if $A$ is a unit of $R^{n \times n}$ , then $\mathrm{det}(A)$ is a unit. I would like to know if one can show $0 \not= A \in R^{n \times n}$ is a zero divisor if $\mathrm{det}(A)$ is zero or a zero divisor. Things to consider: 1) This is true when $R=\mathbb{F}$ a field. Since over a field (no zero divisors) and if $\mathrm{det}(A)=0$ then $Ax=0$ has a non-trivial solution and so $B=[x|0|\cdots|0]$ gives us a right zero divisor $AB=0$ . 2) You can't use the classical adjoint to construct a zero divisor since it can be zero even when $A$ is not zero. For example: $$A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0  & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \qquad \mathrm{implies} \qquad \mathrm{classical\;adjoint} = 0 $$ (All $2 \times 2$ sub-determinants are zero.) 3) This is true when $R$ is finite (since $R^{n \times n}$ would be finite as well). 4) Of course the assumption that every non-zero element of $R$ is either a zero divisor or unit is necessary since otherwise take a non-zero, non-zero divisor, non-unit element $r$ and construct the diagonal matrix $D = \mathrm{diag}(r,1,\dots,1)$ (this is non-zero, not a zero divisor, and is not a unit). Edit: Not totally unrelated... https://mathoverflow.net/questions/42647/rings-in-which-every-non-unit-is-a-zero-divisor Edit: One more thing to consider... 5) This is definitely true when $n=1$ and $n=2$ . It is true for $n=1$ by assumption on $R$ . To see that $n=2$ is true notice that the classical adjoint contains the same same elements as that of $A$ (or negations): $$ A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix} \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad \mathrm{classical\;adjoint} = C = \begin{bmatrix} a_{22} & -a_{12} \\ -a_{21} & a_{11} \end{bmatrix} $$ Thus if $\mathrm{det}(A)b=0$ for some $b \not=0$ , then either $bC=0$ so that all of the entries of both $A$ and $C$ are annihilated by $b$ so that $A(bI_2)=0$ or $bC \not=0$ and so $A(Cb)=\mathrm{det}(A)bI_2 =0I_2=0$ .

71335,"Questions about cosets: ""If $aH\neq Hb$, then $aH\cap Hb=\emptyset$""?","Let $H$ be a subgroup of group $G$, and let $a$ and $b$ belong to $G$. Then, it is known that $$
aH=bH\qquad\text{or}\qquad aH\cap bH=\emptyset 
$$ In other words, $aH\neq bH$ implies $aH\cap bH=\emptyset$. What can we say about the statement ""If $aH\neq Hb$, then $aH\cap Hb=\emptyset$"" ? [EDITED:]
What I think is that when $G$ is Abelian, this can be true since $aH=Ha$ for any $a\in G$. But what if $G$ is non-Abelian? How should I go on?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
71344,Why are Riemann surfaces algebraic curves?,"I've never fully understood the connection between Riemann surfaces and algebraic varieties. I'm particularly interested in the case of the modular curve of level N--I know how the Riemann surface is constructed by taking a quotient of the upper half-plane by the action of a congruence subgroup of the modular group, but not how the resulting manifold translates into a curve. From what I've read, it appears that the associated curve is defined by equations satisfied by functions defined on the manifold, but I don't understand which functions are involved in these equations. What exactly is the relation between the two types of objects?","['algebraic-geometry', 'manifolds']"
71362,why is this sequence convergent,"Suppose to have two sequence $(a_n)_{n\geq1}$ and $(b_n)_{n\geq1}$ such that $a_n=\frac{1}{2}(a_{n-1}+b_{n-1})$. I want to prove that if $b_n\rightarrow0$ then $a_n\rightarrow0$. The only thing I was able to prove is that $a_n$ is bounded, in fact: $b_n$ is convergent and so bounded $|b_n|\leq M$. And so $|a_n|\leq |\frac{a_2}{2^{n-1}}+\frac{b_2}{2^{n-2}}+\cdots+\frac{b_{n-1}}{2}|\leq|\frac{a_2}{2^{n-2}}|+M\sum^\infty_{k=1}\frac{1}{2^k}$ and for great $n$ we have $|\frac{a_2}{2^{n-2}}|\leq\varepsilon$ Could you help me to continue (if I'm on the right track), please? I see that if we prove that $a_n$ has a limit $L$ then necessarily $L=0$ because $L$ must satisfy $L=\frac{1}{2}L$, but I don't know how to prove that it has a limit.","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

71407,Elementary question in partial differentiation,"Let's say we have a function of the form $f(x+vt)$ where $v$ is a constant and $x,t$ are independent variables. How is $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{v}\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$ equal to   $f$? If I let $u=x+vt$ then $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f/\partial t}{\partial u/\partial t}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\frac{1}{v}\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$
 but I cannot infer that $ \frac{1}{v}\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} =  f$ unless I assume the form of D'Alembert's Solution to be the harmonic (exponential). For the general solution I do not know how this was arrived at. Edit:
I still don't get it, as the context does not help. But I assume since it is a physics text, $f$ can be written as a Fourier series/integral of exponentials. Assuming that, the above holds.",['multivariable-calculus']

Possible solution: Suppose $n+2$ and $n^2 + n + 1$ are perfect cubes, their product $(n+2)(n^2 + n + 1)$ must also be a perfect cube. However, note that $(n+2)(n^2 + n + 1)=n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 2 = (n + 1)^3 + 1^3$ By Fermat's Last Theorem, $a^n + b^n \neq c^n $ if $a,b,c,n$ are positive integers and $n>2$ , therefore $a^3 + b^3 \neq c^3$ and $(n + 1)^3 + 1^3$ cannot be a perfect cube (can't be expressed in the form $c^3$ where $c$ is a positive integer) I'm looking for alternative methods of solution, and some verification that the above proof is correct.",['number-theory']
