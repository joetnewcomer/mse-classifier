116089,Evaluating the sum after reordering an infinite series $1-\frac {1} {2}+\frac {1} {3}-\frac {1} {4}+\ldots $,"If in the series  $1-\dfrac {1} {2}+\dfrac {1} {3}-\dfrac {1} {4}+\ldots $ the order of the terms be altered, so that the ratio of the number of positive terms to the number of negative terms in the first $n$ terms is ultimately $a^{2}$, show that the sum of the series will become $\log \left( 2a\right) $. Solution attempt.
Let $p$ be the number of positive terms in the first $n$ terms of the reordered series so based on the question we are allowed $a^{2}=\dfrac {p} {n-p}$. Now solving for p we get $p=\dfrac {a^{2}n} {\left( 1+a^{2}\right) }$ and $n-p=\dfrac {n } {\left( 1+a^{2}\right) }$. We also observe that in the original series only the odd terms are positive and only the even terms are negative. Let's define $S_{odd}=1+\dfrac {1} {3}+\dfrac {1} {5}+.\ldots +\dfrac {1} {2n-1}$ and $S_{even}=\dfrac {-1} {2}\dfrac {-1} {4}\ldots -\dfrac {1} {2n}$ $S_{Reordered}=S_{odd_{p}}+S_{even_{n-p}}$ $S_{Reordered}=\sum _{t=1}^{t=P}\dfrac {1} {2t-1}+\sum _{t=1}^{t=(n-P)}\dfrac {-1} {2t}$ $S_{Reordered}=\sum _{t=1}^{t=\dfrac {a^{2}n} {\left( 1+a^{2}\right) }}\dfrac {1} {2t-1}+\sum _{t=1}^{t=\dfrac {n } {\left( 1+a^{2}\right) }}\dfrac {-1} {2t}$ In order to extend $S_{Reordered}$ from n terms to an infinite length. I guess i should take the limit of the $S_{Reordered}$ as $n\rightarrow \infty $ which would make the upper values of $t$ (Not sure of technical term here) to be $\infty$ giving me $S_{Reordered}=\sum _{t=1}^{t=\infty}\dfrac {1} {2t-1}+\sum _{t=1}^{t=\infty}\dfrac {-1} {2t}$ and i have lost the $a$ from the expression. I guess i am stuck i need to perform some step to capture a before taking the limit. Any help would be much appreciated.","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"
116091,Roots with equal fractional parts,"Question. ¿Does there exist an integer $n>1$ such that there exist positive integers $a,b$ such that $\{\sqrt[n]{a}\}=\{\sqrt[n]{b}\},a\neq b$ and $a$ and $b$ aren't perfect n-th powers? ( $\{x\}$ is the fractional part of $x$) Here is what i've done so far. First we start with a tricky lemma: Lemma. If $z$ is a root of the polynomial $ax^2+bx+c=0$ with $b\neq0$($a$ can be $0$) and for some positive integer $n$, $z^n\in \mathbb{Z}$ then $z\in\mathbb{Z}$. Proof. If $a=0\implies bz=-c\implies b^nz^n=(-c)^n\implies z^n$ is a n-th power from which $z^n=r^n$ for some $r\in\mathbb{Z}$, therefore $z=r\in\mathbb{Z}$. If $a\neq 0$ then we set $z=\frac{p\pm\sqrt{q}}{r}$ for some integers $p,q,r$ with $p,q\neq 0$. Then $zr=p\pm \sqrt{q}\implies z^nr^n=(p\pm\sqrt{q})^n=i+j\sqrt{q}$ for some integers $i,j$. If $q$ is a perfect square then $z$ is rational and since $z^n$ is integer, $z$ is also integer. If $q$ is not a perfect square then $j=0$ from which $(p\pm\sqrt{q})^n=i=(p\mp\sqrt{q})^n\implies |p\pm\sqrt{q}|=|p\mp\sqrt{q}|$ then $p=0$, which is impossible since $p=-b\neq0$, or $q=0$ but $q$ isn't a perfect square. In any case the lemma is proven. Back to the problem. Suposse that for some integer $n>1$, there exist positive integers $a,b,,m$ such that $a$ and $b$ aren't n-th powers and
$$\sqrt[n]{a}-\sqrt[n]{b}=m\quad{(*)}$$
Then
$$\begin{align*}
\sqrt[n]{a}^2-\sqrt[n]{ab}&=m\sqrt[n]{a}\\
\sqrt[n]{a}^2-m\sqrt[n]{a}-\sqrt[n]{ab}&=0
\end{align*}$$
So if we prove that $\sqrt[n]{ab}$ is integer, then applying the lemma we conclude that the answer to the initial question is negative. I'll prove that the answer is negative for $n=5$. Suppose that $(*)$ is true, then setting
$x:=\sqrt[5]{a}$ and $y:=\sqrt[5]{a}$:
$$\begin{align*}
x-y&=m\\
x^5-5x^4y+10x^3y^2-10x^2y^3+5xy^4-y^5&=m^5\\
-5xy(x^3-2x^2y+2xy^2-y^3)&=m^5-x^5+y^5\\
-5xy((x-y)^3+x^2y-xy^2)&=m^5-x^5+y^5\\
-5xy(m^3+mxy)&=m^5-x^5+y^5\\
5mx^2y^2+5m^3xy+m^5-x^5+y^5&=0
\end{align*}$$
Now we apply the lemma to $xy$ and we get that $xy$ is integer, so we are done. Applying a similar argument to $n=2,3,4$ we get what we want. But when $n>5$, we cannot use this trick anymore since we get a polynomial in $xy$ that has a degree greater than $2$.

116180,Axiomatic approach to differential calculus?,"Normally we develop differential calculus by defining a derivative constructively as something related to a quotient (maybe an $\epsilon$-$\delta$-style limit of a quotient, or maybe the standard part of a $dy/dx$ quotient in NSA). I've been toying with the idea of developing the subject axiomatically instead. It seems like the following axioms allow me to do a reasonable amount of calculus: Z. $\exists f : f'\ne 0$ U. $1'=0$ A. $(f+g)'=f'+g'$ C. $(g \circ f)'=(g'\circ f)f'$ P. $(fg)'=f'g+g'f$ (I'm leaving out the obvious $\forall f \forall g$ on most of these.) For example, I can prove that $(cf)'=cf'$ for any rational number $c$, and that $(x^c)'=cx^{c-1}$ if $c$ is rational, at points where $x^{c-1}$ is defined. I think I can also prove the right result for, e.g., $x^\sqrt{2}$, since $(x^\sqrt{2})^\sqrt{2}=x^2$. Some things I haven't figured out: (1) It's not obvious to me how one could start from this system and make contact with the usual constructive approaches and with transcendental functions. (2) Does it follow from these axioms that the derivative is local? Maybe issues 1 and 2 above tell us that we need another axiom relating to continuity or something...? Although I can't figure out how to prove P from the other axioms, I also can't figure out how to construct a model in which P fails, so it's not clear to me whether P is independent of the others. Can anyone construct such a model? The system fails, as it should, to prove that a derivative exists at a point where the standard treatment of calculus says the function is nondifferentiable. On the other hand, none of the axioms allow us to prove affirmatively that any function is ever nondifferentiable.","['calculus', 'derivatives']"

Suppose $\chi(n,I)=m$ for all large enough $n$. From this, why is it that the zeroes of $I$ in $\mathbb{P}^r$ consist of $m$ distinct points?

we say that f has the spherical mean value property (MVP); if instead

we say f has the ball MVP. It is easy to see that spherical MVP implies ball MVP. It is well known, and not hard to prove (though it is much harder in higher dimensions), that ball MVP implies that $f$ is harmonic, i.e. $f$ is of the form $ax+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. Notice that in the definitions above, we require the radius $r$ to run over all the positive numbers. Out of curiosity, I tried to find non harmonic functions which satisfy the MVPs only for $r=1$. It turns out any $1$-periodic function will satisfy the spherical MVP with $r=1$, which is obvious. But it seems much harder to find one for ball MVP.

It is called a periodic point of period $n>1$ of $f$ if $f^i(z_0)\neq z_0$ for $1\leq i \leq n-1$ but $f^n(z_0)=z_0$. A complex number $z_0$ is called a preperiodic point if $z_0,f(z_0),\ldots ,f^{k-1}(z_0)$ are not periodic points but $f^k(z_0)$ is a periodic point for some $k\geq 1$. Let $$Fix(f^n)=\{z\in \Bbb C\mid f^n(z)=z\}$$ be the set of all fixed points of $f^n$. Let $Per_n(f)$ be the set of all periodic points of period $n$. Then it is clear $Per_n(f)\subseteq Fix(f^n)$. QUESTION: Consider $f(z)=z^2$. (a) Describe $Fix(f^n)$ and all preperiodic points. (b) Calculate $\#(Per_n(f))$. ATTEMPT: I answered part (a) by finding all solutions of $z^{2^n}=z$. I found that $$Fix(f^n)=\{0\}\cup\{e^{2\pi ik/(2^n-1)}\mid k\in\Bbb Z , 1\leq k \leq 2^n-1\}.$$ i.e. zero union all $2^n-1^{th}$ roots of unity.

I found part (b) to be much harder, and this is the question I pose to the forum. I calculated these sets by hand for $1\leq n\leq 8$, working with modular arithmetic, and thought I was on to something but hit a wall.

There's a central living room with one light bulb; the bulb is initially off. No prisoner can see the light bulb from his or her own cell. Each day, the warden picks a prisoner equally at random, and that prisoner visits the central living room; at the end of the day the prisoner is returned to his cell. While in the living room, the prisoner can toggle the bulb if he or she wishes. Also, the prisoner has the option of asserting the claim that all 100 prisoners have been to the living room. If this assertion is false (that is, some prisoners still haven't been to the living room), all 100 prisoners will be shot for their stupidity. However, if it is indeed true, all prisoners are set free and inducted into MENSA, since the world can always use more smart people. Thus, the assertion should only be made if the prisoner is 100% certain of its validity. Before this whole procedure begins, the prisoners are allowed to get together in the courtyard to discuss a plan. What is the optimal plan they can agree on, so that eventually, someone will make a correct assertion? http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~wwu/riddles/hard.shtml I was wondering does anyone know the solution for the 4,000 days solution. Also, anyone got any ideas on how to solve this? Just wanted to know if anyone got any ideas how to solve this. http://www.siam.org/ is offering prize money for a proof of a optimal solution for it. I suppose to make it clear the people want a plan that would mean on average it would take least amount of time to free the prisoner. The point is the average run time is as low as possible.","['puzzle', 'expected-value', 'probability']"

116369,Can a rational Bézier curve take exactly the same shape as a part of the sine function?,"I'm wondering whether a rational Bézier curve could take exactly the same shape as a part of the sine function. The best way to check this seems like this: Find a part of the sine function such that there is no symmetry anymore in this part, e.g. from $\sin(0)$ to $\sin({\pi \over 2})$. In that case, the control points for a quadratic Bézier curve follow from the sine function. Because a Bézier curve is tangent to the control polygon at the first and last points, this results in the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$ and $({\pi \over 2}, 1)$. The second point $(1,1)$ is the intersection of the two tangent lines. When plotting the above: Which is pretty close, but I'm looking for an exact representation (if possible). Therefore, the next step is to look to a rational Bézier curve: In this case I used the weights [1, 1.4, 1]. It is now a very close approximation for this part of the sine function, but it is not exact. What would be a systematic way to do this? And if it fails for a quadratic rational Bézier curve, could it work for a cubic, quartic, quintic, ... curve? I don't think it would be meaningful to look into Uniform Rational B-Splines (or Non-Uniform ones, NURBS) since they are just piecewise rational Bézier curves, right?","['trigonometry', 'bezier-curve']"

116537,Lebesgue Line Integrals - Parametric Change of Variables,"Consider the following Lebesgue integral in $\mathbb{R}^n$ $$ \int_C f(x) dx $$ Where $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is measurable and $C$ is a measurable subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that can be defined by the simple, differentiable, parametric curve $y(t)$ over the closed interval $[a,b]$. Does the following result (from Riemann integrals) hold? $$ \int_C f(x) dx = \int_b^a f(y(t)) |y'(t)| dt $$ Where $|v|$ denotes the 2-norm of the vector $v$. If so, I'm also wondering if one could also integrate over a set of disjoint curves to compute an integral over a larger set. To show what I mean, we first adopt an expanded notation for our parametric curve: $y(t,x)$. This simply denotes the particular curve, parameterized by $t$ who's image includes $x$.  Since we assume these curves are disjoint, $y(t,x) = y(t,z) \ $ if and only if there exists a $t$ such that $\ y(t,x) = z \ $ (and conversely swapping x and z). Since it is difficult to define a measure over these curves, I propose the a simple method: We define: $$g(x) = \frac{\int_b^a y(t,x) |y'(t,x)| dt}{\int_b^a |y'(t,x)| dt}$$ From what I learned in Riemann integration, the numerator here is the line integral over $y(t,x)$ and the denominator is the arc length.  Intuitively, the denominator is there to compensate for the fact that lines will be ""duplicated"" an amount equal to their measure in the following integral: $$ \int_X f(x) dx = \int_X g(x) dx $$ Where $X \ $ is a measurable subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and all the intervals $[a,b]$ are constructed in such a way as to never take the curve out of $X$. It seems that the above equality holds because the set of parametric curves form a partition of $X\ $ (detailed below). My primary concern is that, while the curves are disjoint, when considered together they can compress the measure and this compression is not fully compensated from by the norm of the gradient.  Certainly the $n$-dimensional change of variables theorem could be used, but I cannot see a way to write the set of parametric curves as a single injective transformation. We can show in general that if $B \ $ and $C \ $ form a partition of $A \ $ and: $$
  g(x) = \begin{cases}
           \frac{\int_B f(u) du}{\int_B du} & \text{if } \ x \in B \\
           \frac{\int_C f(u) du}{\int_C du} & \text{if } \ x \in C

$$ = \int_B \frac{\int_B f(u) du}{\int_B du} dx + \int_C \frac{\int_C f(u) du}{\int_C du} dx$$ 
We note the inner integrals are constant w.r.t. $x$, yielding:
$$ = \int_B f(u) du \frac{\int_B dx}{\int_B du} + \int_C f(u) du \frac{\int_B dx}{\int_B du}$$

116620,Understanding the relationship between differentiation and integration,"I am trying to understand the relationship between differentiation and integration.  Differentiation has been introduced to me by this diagram: Which displays that the derivative of a point $x$ on a continuous function $f(x)$ is the gradient of a line which is a tangent to that particular point, as shown in the diagram. This can be written as $$\lim_{h \to 0} \left(\frac{f\left(x+h\right)-f\left(x\right)}{h}\right)=f'\left(x\right)$$ and this gives the gradient of the point $(x, f(x))$. Next examine this diagram: The area under the continuous function from $f(x)$ from $a$ to $x$ is $A(x)$, shaded pink.  The area of $A(a)$ is $0$ and the area from $a$ to $b$ is $A(b)$.  Following this convention the area of $x$ to $x+h$ is $$A\left(x+h\right)-A\left(x\right)$$ This section has with $h$ and the area is close to that of a rectangle so it can be said that $$A\left(x+h\right)-A\left(x\right)\approx hf(x)$$ If you divide this through by $h$ you get an equation which shows that the derivative of $f(x)$ is $A'(x)$. $$\lim_{h \to 0} \left(\frac{A\left(x+h\right)-A\left(x\right)}{h}\right)=f\left(x\right)$$ and hence $$A'(x)=f(x)$$ This is where I have a problem, earlier it was stated that the derivative is the gradient of a line which is a tangent to a point on a continuous function.  Here however, we have an area, which encloses many points, which are not a line which is a tangent to a continuous function.  So I do not see how you can find the derivative of an area because it is not a point that you can find the gradient of a line which is a tangent to it.?

There are definitions on page 217 of Humphreys' Linear Algebraic Groups : A subvariety $X$ of $\mathbb A^n$ is $k$-closed if $X$ is the set of zeros of some collection of polynomials having coefficients in $k$. and $X$ is defined over $k$ if $\mathscr I(X)$ (the ideal in $K[X]$ vanishing on $X$) is generated by $k$-polynomials.

But if I let $K = \mathbb C$, the field of complex numbers, and $k =\mathbb R$, the field of real numbers, and set $X = \{i, -i \}$, then $X$ is the zero set of $f(x) = x^2 +1$ whose coefficients are in $k$. So, $X$ is $k$-closed. But $\mathscr I(X)$ generated by $x-i$ and $x+i$. Apparently, this ideal could not be generated by polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb R$.

Here, the path is traced out by the polar origin of the wheel.  You can put the trace point anywhere on or off of the wheel by translating the wheel relative to the polar origin.  To generate a cycloid, $r(t)$ would be a circle which passes through the origin. Equations of any roulette generated by a wheel given by $r(t)$ rolling on a straight line: $$x(t) = \int \sqrt{r(t)^2 + r'(t)^2} dt - \frac{r(t) r'(t)}{\sqrt{r(t)^2 + r'(t)^2}}$$
$$y(t) = \frac{r(t)^2}{\sqrt{r(t)^2 + r'(t)^2}}$$ Given such a roulette in $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, how can I determine the original wheel?  This is all motivated by a specific example, but I would like to understand the general case. I worked out the above equations by geometric inspection, more or less.  At time $t$, the wheel is touching the road at a point on the road ($y = 0$) and the distance is the arc length around the wheel from the initial angle to $t$ ($x = \int \sqrt{r(t)^2 + r'(t)^2} dt$).  Add to that the offset from the tangent point on the wheel to the origin of the wheel.  The origin is a distance $r(t)$ from the tangent point at an angle given by the fact that the wheel is also tangent to the road at all times, so doing a bit of trigonometric substitution gives the rest. Nothing similar is coming to me to work out the reverse equations. I also tried to work it out by treating the wheel as the limit of a class of polygons with an increasing number of sides where the vertices lie on the wheel.  I got as far as: $\Delta x = (L - x)(1 + \cos(a)) + y \sin(a)$ $\Delta y = -y(1 + \cos(a)) + (L - x) \sin(a)$ Where $L$ is the current arc length traveled so far, $x$ and $y$ are the current trace position and $a$ is the next angle that the polygon approximation of the wheel will pivot on.  I'm unable to come up with the angle given simply $t$ and a change in t, since I need three sample points from the wheel to determine the next angle, unless I assume that $\Delta t$ will be constant so the previous $t$ was $t - \Delta t$.  I am afraid that might cause problems when I try to reverse it, given who knows what parameterization.  It won't be linear with respect to $t$. So, where should I go from here? EDIT: New idea.  $\dfrac{dy}{dx}(t) = \dfrac{r'(t)}{r(t)}$. Therefore:
$y(t) = \dfrac{r(t)^2}{\sqrt{r(t)^2 + r'(t)^2}} = \dfrac{r(t)}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{r'(t)^2}{r(t)^2}}} = \dfrac{r(t)}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{dy}{dx}(t)\right)^2}}$ $r(t) = y(t) \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{dy}{dx}(t)\right)^2}$ So given $y(\theta)$ and $x(\theta)$, $r(t) = y(\theta) \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2}$ Is there any way to find $t$ in terms of $\theta$, the relation between the rate at which the wheel turns and the parameterization of the given $x$ and $y$? Also, $x(t) + \frac{dy}{dx} y(t) = \int \sqrt{r(t)^2 + r'(t)^2}$ and $\sqrt{r(t)^2 + r'(t)^2}$ = $y(t) \left(1 + \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2\right)$.","['plane-curves', 'differential-geometry']"

Remark : I am ultimately interested in the degree of $c_2(\tilde Y)c_1^{n-2}(\tilde Y)$. My thoughts so far: As you can see from my first question, the chern classes of $Y$ (and $X$) have well-known representation, and there is a formula for computing the chern classes of blown-up varieties in Fulton's book Intersection Theory , namely Theorem 15.4 . For brevity, I will quote his Example 15.4.3 , which gives a formula for $c_2$: $$c_2(\tilde Y) = f^\ast(c_2(Y)) - j_\ast\left( (d-1) g^\ast(c_1(X)) + \tfrac{d(d-3)}{2} \zeta + (d-2) g^\ast(c_1(\mathcal{N})) \right)$$ Here, $\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{N}_{X/Y}$ is the normal bundle of $X$ in $Y$ and $\zeta$ denotes $c_1(\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{X}}(1))$. Of course, $c_1(\mathcal{N})=c_1(i^\ast\mathcal{T}_Y)/c_1(\mathcal{T}_X)$ by the well-known exact sequence 
$$0\to\mathcal{T}_X\to i^\ast\mathcal{T}_Y\to\mathcal{N}_{X/Y}\to 0,$$
but I am not 100% sure what effect the pullbacks and push-forwards have. In the end, I would like to express $c_2(\tilde Y)$ as the sum of intersections of well-known divisors in $\tilde Y$, like the strict transform of a hyperplane and the exceptional divisor.","['intersection-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

116727,Is there a well-defined notion of class-dimensional vector spaces?,"I was thinking a bit about isometric embeddings into Hilbert spaces and got the following idea. First, as we recall, many vector spaces over the reals are isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{\alpha}$ for some cardinal number $\alpha$. [EDIT: As Carl Mummert remarked below, not every vector space is of this form, as I had erroneously supposed; see comments.] So if we want to embed every single set-dimensional vector space in some kind of vector space, it would be nice to have something like $\mathbb{R}^\mathbf{ON} = \lbrace f:\mathbf{ON}\to\mathbb{R}|\textrm{ }\mathtt{True}\rbrace$ with operations defined as usual. Here $\mathbf{ON}$ is the class of all ordinal numbers. So my question is: Does the notion of class-dimensional vector space make sense in some appropriate variant of set theory? Next, we could possibly modify this definition a bit, definining a class-dimensional Hilbert space: $\ell^2(\mathbf{ON})= \lbrace f:\mathbf{ON}\to\mathbb{R}|\textrm{ }\sum_{\alpha\in\mathbf{ON}}f(\alpha)^2<\infty\rbrace$, where the sum is as usual taken to be the supremum of the finite sums and the other operations are defined as usual. So if such a definition made sense, we would perhaps be able to isometrically embed every set-dimensional Hilbert space in such a space. Therefore I ask also for this case: Is it possible to consistently define such spaces? If such a definition is consistent, is there some literature in which a theory of such spaces is developed? Thank you in advance. [ADDED: As Asaf Karagila remarks below, every $\mathbb{R}$-linear space is of the form $\bigoplus_{\kappa}\mathbb{R}$ for some cardinal $\kappa$.

116813,Existence of a differentiable curve,"Let $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ where a and b are real numbers. Prove that the curve $f$ is differentiable if and only if there is an open interval $I$ that contains the closed interval $[a, b]$, and a differentiable curve $g: I \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that its restriction to the interval $[a, b]$ is the curve $f$. Showing from 'down' to 'up' should be trivial, because if we have a differentiable $g$ on an interval $I$, then it should specifically be differentiable on the interval $[a, b]$, and if we let $f$ be the restriction of the function $g$ on that interval then $f$ must be differentiable. Going from 'up' to 'down' is what is bothering me. So now I construct a $g$ on $(a-1,b+1)$ as $g(x)=f(x)$ for $x \in [a,b]$ $g(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$ for $x \in (a-1,a)$ $g(x)=f(b)+f'(b)(x-b)$ for $x \in (b,b+1)$ We see that $g$ is differentiable on $(a-1, b+1)$ except for maybe on $a, b$. So I examine the left and right sided limits: the left sided limit $$\lim _ {t \to a-} \frac{g(a) - g(t)}{t} = \lim_{t \to a-} \frac{f(a) + f'(a)(t-a) - f(a) - f'(a)(a-a)}{t} = \lim_{t \to a-} \frac{f'(a)t - f'(a)a}{t}$$ And the right sided limit $$\lim_{t \to a+} \frac{f(t) - f(a)}{t}$$ I've been trying to bridge these two limits for over an hour now. Am I approaching this problem incorrectly or am I missing something in the two one sided limits?","['general-topology', 'calculus', 'analysis']"
116819,Computing partial derivatives.,"I am having trouble solving this problem: If $f$ is $C^{2}$ and $f(x,y)=g(r,\theta)$ where $(r,\theta)$ are polar coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, then
$$
\left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y^{2}}\right)f(x,y)=\left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial r^{2}}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}+\frac{1}{r^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta^{2}}\right)g(r,\theta)
$$
for all $(x,y)\ne(0,0)$.
I computed
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial\theta}\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial x}=\cos\theta\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}-\frac{\sin\theta}{r}\frac{\partial f}{\partial\theta}
$$
and
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}\frac{\partial r}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial\theta}\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial y}=\sin\theta\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}+\frac{\cos\theta}{r}\frac{\partial f}{\partial\theta}
$$
but I do not know how to compute the second derivatives.
Any help is appreciated.",['multivariable-calculus']
116820,Uniform integrability and tightness.,"Definition: Let $(X,M,\mu)$ be a measure space and $\{f_n\}$ a sequence of measurable functions on $x$ that are integrable. Then $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable if for every $\epsilon >0$, there is a $\delta >0$ such that if $E$ is a measurable subset of $X$ such that $\mu(E) < \delta$, then $$ \int_E |f_n|~d\mu < \epsilon\qquad\text{for every} ~n.$$ $\{f_n\}$ is said to be tight if for each $\epsilon >0$, there is a subset $X_0$ of $X$ such that $\mu(X_0)< \infty$ and $$\int_{X\setminus X_0} |f_n|~d\mu < \epsilon\qquad\text{for every} ~n.$$ Theorem:(Vitali Convergence) Let $(X,M,\mu)$ be a measure space. Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of uniformly integrable functions that also forms a tight sequence. Suppose $f_n(x) \to f(x)$ a.e. on $X$. Then, $f$ is integrable and, $$ \lim_{n\to \infty} \int_X f_n~d\mu = \int_X f~ d\mu.$$ I wish to prove the following: Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of non-negative integrable functions on $X$. Suppose that $\{f_n(x)\} \to 0$ for almost all $x\in X.$. Then $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \int f_n~d\mu =0 \Leftrightarrow \{f_n\}~\text{is uniformly integrable and tight.}$$ This is my Attempt: $(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose $f_n \to 0$. If $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable and tight, then by Vitali's Convergence theorem, $\lim_{n\to \infty} \int f_n~d\mu = 0$. $(\Rightarrow)$ Let $\lim_{n\to \infty} \int f_n~d\mu = 0$. Let $\epsilon >0$. Then $\exists$ an $N$ such that $\int_X f_n ~d\mu< \epsilon$ whenever $n\geq N.$
Also, since $f_n \geq 0$, if $E$ is a measurable subset of $X$ and $n\geq N$, then $\int _E f_n~d\mu < \epsilon.$ I know that if I have a finite sequence $\{f_k\}_{n=1}^N$ of non-negative integrable functions over $X$, then $\{f_k\}_{n=1}^N$ is uniformly integrable, since if $E\subset X$ and $\mu(E)<\delta_k>0$ then $\int_E
 f_k~d\mu < \epsilon$. I can take $\delta=\min (\delta_1,\ldots, \delta_k)$ so that $\mu(E)< \delta$ and $$\int_E f_k~d\mu < \epsilon.$$ I'm afraid this is where I'm stuck and I don't know how to proceed. Any form of help will be very much appreciated. Thanks.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
116822,Evaluating $\int_{-1}^2\frac{1}{x}dx$,"I understand that when evaluating $$ \int_{-1}^{2} \frac{1}{x} \mathrm dx = \ln 2$$ It's simple integration, I understand. I'm more focused on the theory behind if it even exists.  I had a question from Larson, Edward's Calculus 9th edition that was a true or false relating to this earlier today. In one sense, I thought it had to be $\ln 2$. But, when looking at it again, technically the area from $-1$ to $0$, and $0$ to $1$ are negative infinity and infinity, respectively.  They should cancel out and our original integral from $-1$ to $2$ is the same as the integral from $1$ to $2$.  However, technically the integral does not converge from those two endpoints.  The areas from $-1$ to $0$ and $0$ to $1$ are only infinitesimally close as they both approach zero from one side. I was looking for your guys' input here.  I was debating myself most of today over this seamlessly simple true/false question. Note: this is a Calc 1 class, but I suppose I'm just getting ideas from Calc 2 onward (I've self-studied a bit) intertwined with our knowledge we've learned so far.","['definite-integrals', 'integration']"
116831,Hilbert function of ideal generated by linear forms.,"This is a slight extension of a remark a read a few days ago. Let $K$ be a field, and let $A=K[X_0,\dots,X_N]$ be a polynomial ring, which is graded in the standard way (the elements of degree $n$ are the homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$ ). Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be a homogeneous prime ideal of $A$ , and $d$ the dimension of the corresponding projective variety. Moreover, let $\chi(n,\alpha)=\dim_K A_n/\mathfrak{a}_n$ (also known as the Hilbert function). Here $A_n$ is the $K$ -space of homogeneous elements of $n$ in $A$ , and likewise for $\mathfrak{a}_n$ . I understand that there is some $c_d\in\mathbb{N}$ so that $$
\chi(n,\mathfrak{a})=c_d\frac{n^d}{d!}+c_{d-1}n^{d-1}+\cdots+c_0.
$$ Taking $d$ generic linear forms, say $f_1,\dots,f_d$ , why does $$
\chi(n,\mathfrak{a}+(f_1,\dots,f_d))=c_d?
$$ One theorem I have read is that if $F$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $j$ where $F$ is not a zero divisor modulo $\mathfrak a$ , i.e., if $G\in A$ and $FG\in\mathfrak{a}$ , then $G\in\mathfrak{a}$ , then $\chi(n,\mathfrak{a}+(F))=\chi(n,\mathfrak{a})-\chi(n-j,\mathfrak{a})$ . I'm wondering how it can be extended to an ideal generated by more than one linear form, to get the above equality. Thank you.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'dimension-theory-algebra', 'graded-rings']"
116845,A pyramid of numbers,"Moderator Note: At the time that this question was posted, it was from an ongoing contest. The relevant deadline has now passed. Suppose we have a triangle of numbers. Atop the triangle is 1: each number below it is determined by summing half of each of the numbers that it is supporting, and adding 1 to the sum. The first few layers in the triangle look like this: 1
                            3/2     3/2
                       7/4     10/4     7/4
                  15/8    25/8      25/8    15/8 
            31/16     56/16    66/16    56/16   31/16 The numbers on the edges are such that the number on either end of layer n is $\frac{2^n -1}{2^{n-1}}$. Can we write a generalization for the middle numbers in the triangle in terms of $x$, where each middle number is the $(x+1)th$ number in the $(2x+1)th$ row? (Please explain the architecture of your solution, and how you came about it. I think that an answer that simply fits is FAR less valuable than an instance where we know WHY the answer fits. ) Perhaps this can be done with modifications to Pascal's triangle? I have noticed something rather interesting- if we discard the denominators of the numbers in this pyramid, which are simply $2^{n-1}$ where $n$ is the row number, and leave all the numerators behind in the pyramid, then we can produce the nth line of the pyramid by taking the following pyramid(the following is a example, that produces the fourth line of the pyramid) j
  h   i
e   f   g a   b   c  d If e= $\frac{a+b}{2}$, f= $\frac{b+c}{2}$, and so on and so forth such all characters in rows above the bottom one are the ""average"" of the two characters they are nested in, then if we add a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j, we get 15a+ 25b+25c+15d/8. As you can see, the coefficients produce the fourth line in our pyramid. Similarly if we add the characters in a pyramid with base [abcde] and tip k we will get 31a+56b+66c+56d+31e/16 . The coefficients of a,b,c,d, and e are the terms in the fifth line of our pyramid. Can anyone think of WHY(what in the architecture of both pyramids) this correlation exists between these two seemingly disconnected pyramids, through connecting their production methods?",['sequences-and-series']
