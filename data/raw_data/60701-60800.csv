679478,renorm a Banach space to make an operator have spectral radius equal to norm,"Let $X$ be an infinite-dimensional complex Banach space equipped with the norm $\lVert\cdot\rVert$, and let $T\in\mathcal{L}(X)$ a bounded linear operator on $X$.  Let $r(T)$ denote the spectral radius of $T$, and suppose $r(T)<\lVert T\rVert$.  I would like to renorm $X$ with an equivalent norm $|\cdot|$ so that $r(T)=|T|$, i.e. so that the spectral radius attains the operator norm. It is already known that we can equivalently renorm $X$ so that the spectral radius almost attains the norm.  Let $\epsilon>0$ be arbitrary and let $m$ be the smallest integer so that $\lVert T^m\rVert^{1/m}<r(T)+\epsilon$.  Then we can define the equivalent norm $|\cdot|_{T,\epsilon}$ on $X$ by $\displaystyle |x|_{T,\epsilon}:=\left[\lVert x\rVert^2+\left(\frac{\lVert Tx\rVert}{r(T)+\epsilon}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\lVert T^2x\rVert}{[r(T)+\epsilon]^2}\right)^2+\cdots+\left(\frac{\lVert T^mx\rVert}{[r(T)+\epsilon]^m}\right)^2\right]^{1/2}$ In this case, $|T|_{T,\epsilon}<r(T)+\epsilon$.  However, this is not good enough for my purposes.  We need equality, not almost-equality. In general, what I want need not be possible, for instance if $T$ is a nonzero quasinilpotent operator.  However, this problem arises in a context where I can make some powerful assumptions.  In particular, I have a situation where $0<r(T)$ with $\sigma(T)$ uncountable, $0\in\partial\sigma(T)$, and $\partial\sigma(T)\subseteq\sigma_p(T)$, where $\sigma(T)$ denotes the spectrum and $\sigma_p(T)$ the point spectrum, and $\partial$ denotes the topological boundary.  I can also assume that $\sigma_p(T^*)=\emptyset$, where $T^*\in\mathcal{L}(X^*)$ is the continuous dual of $T$. At least sometimes, what I want really is possible.  For instance let $(\delta_n)$ be a strictly decreasing sequence of positive reals with $\prod_{n=1}^\infty(1+\delta_n)<\infty$, and let $T\in\mathcal{L}(c_0)$ be the weighted left-shift operator defined by $Te_1=0$ and $Te_{n+1}=(1+\delta_n)e_n$, where $(e_n)$ is the unit vector basis for $c_0$, and $c_0$ (as usual) is the space of scalar sequences tending to zero equipped with the sup norm.  Then it's easy to see that $1=r(T)<1+\delta_1=\lVert T\rVert$.  Now, let $U\in\mathcal{L}(c_0)$ be the isomorphism $Ue_n=(1+\delta_n)e_n$, and define $|\cdot|$ by $|x|:=\lVert U^{-1}x\rVert$.  Then $|\cdot|$ is an equivalent norm with $r(T)=|T|=1$. Has this problem been studied at all? Please note, I am also free to ""adjust"" $X$ by modding out finite-dimensional subspaces.  More precisely, if $F$ is a finite-dimensional subspace of $X$ then I can replace $X$ with $W\cong X/F$, where $X=W\oplus F$ and $T$ with the corresponding induced operator $P_WT|_W$ (where $P_W$ is the continuous linear projection onto $W$ along $F$).","['banach-spaces', 'operator-theory', 'normed-spaces', 'spectral-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

679504,A variation of how many integer solutions are there for $a+b+...=n$,"There was a combinatorics question last night that I thought I could answer, turns out I couldn't (so I discarded my draft) but I thought I could, I now want to find out if I got close. The question was about splitting 50 things into any number of groups of 1,2,3,4 or 5 items. If I were asked how many integer solutions there were to $A+B+C+D+E=10$ say I'd be quite happy to conclude that you ""encode"" any such solution using... say X and -s, so ""XXX-XXX--XXX-X"" denotes 3As, 3Bs, 0Cs 3Ds and 1 E, any arrangement of 10Xs and 4 dashes is a solution. So it is simply $\frac{14!}{10!4!}$ using the axiom of choice and such, I am happy with this work. You can also modify it to work out how many integer solutions there are when any number is greater than a certain value (by substituting something like $A=a+1$ then A>=0 means a>=1).

And uniform random number generator $RND$, which can generate numbers in $[0, 1]$ segment.

For each $x_i$ evaluate $g_i = \sum_{k=1}^i p_k$. Generate random number $p'$ using $RND$. Find $g_i$, such that $p' \in (g_{i-1}; g_i]$ and yield $x_i$.

My intuition says to me that $\hat X$ is something like a neighborhood of $x$, but of course it should be considered only as a formal neighborhood. So probably, if there is some smoothness assumption on $X$ around $x$, then we may drop formally , i.e. each formal neighborhood gives us a ""real"" one?

Let $V_1, V_2$ be smooth, projective, 3-folds over complex numbers. I know $V_1, V_2$ both have fiberations over $\mathbb{P}^1$, and for any closed point $t \in \mathbb{P}^1$, the fibres ${(V_1)}_t, (V_2)_t$ are isomorphism. However, I also know $V_1, V_2$ are NOT birational. The other information I know is: The generic fibre are both abelian surfaces. I really could not imagine such varieties, the only thing might be an analogy is the Möbius strip. I was wondering if there is an argumement to show there must be something wrong in the construction as follows: because the fibres are isomorphism, it is also isomorphism nearby the fibres, and hence they two should be birational. Edit: Here is how I construct $V_1, V_2$. First, I have a smooth 3-fold $X$ fibreing over $\mathbb{P}^1$, and I have two finite groups $G_1 ,G_2 \subseteq {\rm Aut}(X)$ (one is abelian, the other is not abelian) acting on $X$ without fixed point. Then $V_1 := X/G_1, V_2 :=X/G_2$. Because I also know the fundamental group of $X$ is trivial, the fundamental groups of $V_1, V_2$ are $G_1, G_2$ respectively. If $V_1, V_2$ are birational, I guess they should have the same fundamental groups. Hence, they are not birational. As for they have the isomorphic fibres, I did this in a simply-mined, non-rigours way, and that is the part I worry most: As I know how does the group $G_i$ acting on coordinates of the generic points of $X$, and I know how does the generic points maps to $\mathbb{P}^1$. I just pick a general point $x$, and see what is the images under $G_i$. For $G_i\cdot x$ (i.e. the orbits) are in the fibre of the exactly same four points of $\mathbb{P}^1$ for both $G_1, G_2$. Then ""module out"" this action on different fibres (i.e. looking at the subgroup of $H_i \subseteq G_i$ such that the orbits are in the same fibre), I get the same group for both $G_1, G_2$. Hence, if I further quotient out $H_i$ for the fibres, I have the same varieties on the fibre. That is how I get the isomrophism on generic fibres.

679984,Nice convergent subsequence of $\cos(n)$.,"This question is related to a few questions which have been posted on the website : Is there a limit of $\cos(n!)$ Converging subsequence on a circle The limit of $\sin(n!)$ Because of the irrationality of $\pi$, the sequence $(\cos(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is dense in $[-1;1]$. For any value $a\in[-1;1]$, we can extract a subsequence $(\cos(n_k))_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ convergent to $a$. My question is the following:
Does someone know an example of a convergent subsequence of $\cos(n)$ with an explicit expression ? Some more comments: We could define a subsequence in the following way:
$$n_0=1;\quad n_{k+1}>n_k \text{ such that } |\cos(n_k)-a|<1/k.$$
This subsequence is well defined (and unique if we add the condition that $n_{k+1}$ should be minimum) and converges. But I would say, that this not explicit.
I don't have a definition of what should be an explicit expression, and any answer are welcome. Reading the nice answer of David Speyer in Is there a limit of $\cos(n!)$ , it seems that we still don't understand enough about $\pi$ to proof or disprove that $\cos(n!)$ diverges.

680122,"Cramér's Model - ""The Prime Numbers and Their Distribution"" - Part 1","I was reading ""The Prime Numbers and Their Distribution"" by Gérald Tenenbaum and Michel Mendès France, the section about Cramér's Model, and I couldn't prove a couple of results. I would like to start with an introduction of the topic. Introduction: Cramér's Model consists in considering a sequence of independent random variables $\{X_n\}_{n=2}^\infty$ which take values 0 and 1, such that $\Bbb P (X_n=1)=1/\log n$ for $n \ge 3$. The definition of $\Bbb P (X_2=1)$ is considered irrelevant for the purposes of the model. The idea of this is to give a probabilistic model for the behaviour of prime numbers: according to the prime numbers theorem, the number of primes less or equal than $n$, with $n$ sufficiently large, is approximately $n/\log n$, so the ""probability that $n$ is prime"" would be $1/\log n$. Now we define $S:=\{n\ge2:X_n=1\}$. The usual way of working with this model seems to be, proving that some property holds almost surely for $S$, and then conjecturing that property holds for $\mathcal P$, the sequence of prime numbers. Question: By analogy to the usual notation, we define $\pi_S(x):=\sum_{n\le x} X_n$ (note that $\pi_\mathcal P(x)=\pi(x)$). We also define:
$$\upsilon_S(x):=\frac{\pi_S(x)-\mathrm {li}(x)}{\sqrt{2x\frac{\log\log x}{\log x}}}$$
The book states that it's easy to show that $\upsilon_S(x)$ oscillates asymptotically between -1 and 1, but a paper by Cramér only states that it's shown in another paper (which I couldn't find) that $\limsup_{x\to \infty}|\upsilon_S(x)|=1$ holds almost surely. I understand that the statement of the book is that both, $\limsup_{x\to \infty}\upsilon_S(x)=1$ and $\liminf_{x\to \infty}\upsilon_S(x)=-1$, hold almost surely, but I could be wrong since I haven't found the definition of ""asymptotic oscillation"".","['prime-numbers', 'probability', 'number-theory']"

By looking online it seems that it should be the dual of the symmetric algebra. The first step it's computing a free resolution of $k$ over $\bigwedge V$. Always by looking online it seems that this resolution should look like $$K_.:\cdots\rightarrow S^{k+1}V\otimes_k\bigwedge V\xrightarrow{d^{k+1}}S^kV\otimes_k\bigwedge V\rightarrow\cdots,$$ where by $SV$ I'm denoting the symmetric algebra.

What I tried is: we know that a generic point for $C_1$ is $(x, x^2 + 1)$, while a generic point for $C_2$ is $(y^2 + 1, y)$. It is pretty clear that the two curves don't intersect, so the distance between a generic pair is: $$||(x, x^2+1) - (y^2 + 1, y)||$$ Which for extreme finding is the same as $$f(x, y) = ||(x - y^2 - 1, x^2+1 - y)||^2$$ Trying to find the critical points means we have to find out what the gradient is: $$\nabla f(x, y) = (4x^3 - 2y^2 - 4yx +6x - 2, 4y^3 - 2x^2 -4yx +6y -2)$$ Hence, I'm looking for the roots of: $$2x^3 - 2y^3 -y^2 +x^2 +3x-3y = 0$$ It is pretty clear that $(x, x) : x \in R$ is always a solution.

0 & \text{else}  \\
\end{cases}$$ Then $\mathbb{T}=\{T_1, T_2, \ldots \} \subset \mathbb{P}$ is the set of all extreme points. We can prove it by showing that if $T=\lambda P_1+(1-\lambda)P_2$ with $0<\lambda<1$ then $T=P_1=P_2$ which follows from the fact what each $E\in\mathcal{F}$ is a disjunct union of atoms.

Let $n,k \in \mathbb{N}$. Let $f(n)=\left\lfloor{\frac{n}{k}}\right\rfloor$. Is it possible to rewrite this using the addition, multiplication, and exponentiation operators? I know it's possible for the case where $k=1$. Quite simply, note that $f(n)=\left\lfloor{\frac{n}{1}}\right\rfloor=\lfloor{n}\rfloor=n$. I know it's possible when $k=2$. Let $f(n)=\left(\frac{n}{2}-\frac{1}{4}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(-1)^n$. The trick there was to start halfway between $\frac{n}{2}-\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{n}{2}$ and using the $(-1)^n$ term to figure out the rest. I'm wondering if it's possible if $k=3$? I think it's possible with the use of infinite sums and trigonometric functions (though I haven't thought about that yet). However, I'd like to avoid those if necessary. I feel they may not be necessary -- though I may be wrong. Even a slight discussion about the topic would be great. EDIT: So, I like the @user44197's solution. It gives rise to the solution I was looking for -- which was simpler than I thought. Let $f(n)=\left\lfloor{\frac{n}{k}}\right\rfloor$, where $n$ is a variable and $k$ is a constant (for simplicity, let $k$ be some constant in the naturals). Why not treat it like a recursion? Let $R(n) = R(n-k) + 1$. To solve this, we need to solve the characteristic polynomial $\lambda^k-1=0$. Therefore, $R_{Homogeneous}(n)=\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}n^{i}c_{i}(1)^n=\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}n^{i}c_{i}$ where $c_i$ is the coefficient that will solve the recursion.

But I'm not sure how to proceed in case $|x| < 1$. Attempt in case $|x| \ge 1$: Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfy $|x| \ge 1$. Then consider that $$
\left| \frac{x}{n(1+nx^2)} \right| = \left| \frac{x}{n+n^2x^2} \right| \le \frac{|x|}{n^2x^2} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{|x| n^2} \le \frac{1}{n^2}}_{\text{ making use of $|x| \ge 1$}}

The point $x$ is a limit point of $A$ iff every neighborhood of $x$ contains a point $a$ of $A$ not equal to $x$. I am thinking about the following question: If $x$ is a limit point of $A$ does it hold that there exists a sequence $x_n $ in $A$ converging to $x$? Please can you tell me if my thoughts are correct: If $x$ has infinitely many  neighborhoods then there are infinitely many different points $x_n \in A$ and for larger $n$ they are nearer $x$ therefore $x_n \to x$ and it is true. If $x$ only has finitely many neighborhoods then it is also true: take the smallest neighborhood and the point $x_n = a \in A$ in that neighborhood and then the constant sequence $a$ converges to $x$ (even though $x\neq a$).,['general-topology']

680678,What is the density of the SRB measure conditioned to unstable manifolds?,"I have a question regarding the SRB measure. As Lai-Sang Young puts it, the SRB-measure is the invariant ergodic invariant measure most compatible with volume. (see [ http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~lsy/papers/SRBsurvey.pdf ]). More precisely, let $\Phi\colon \Gamma\to\Gamma$ be a $C^1$ Anosov diffeomorphism of a compact Riemannian manifold $\Gamma$ to itself. In that case, at any $x \in \Gamma$ the tangent space $\mathrm{T}x$ can be split into $\mathrm D \Phi$-invariant stable and unstable subspaces $E_u$ and $E_s$, such that $\mathrm{D}\Phi\vert_{E_u}$ and $\mathrm{D}\Phi\vert_{E_s}$ are uniformly expanding and contracting, respectively. Now the unstable manifold $W^\epsilon_u(x)$ of a point $x$ is the set of all points $y$ such that for any $n \in \mathbb N$ we have $d(\Phi^{-n}x,\Phi^{-n}y)<\epsilon$, where $d$ is the Riemannian metric.
In other words, it consists of points with a similar ""past"" than $x$. Let $w$ be a local unstable manifold, $\lambda_w$ the volume induced on $w$ by the Riemannian volume on $\Gamma$.
The SRB measure $\mu$ is defined as the unique invariant measure such that $\mu_\omega$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\lambda_w$, where $\mu_\omega$ is its disintegration or conditioning on the unstable manifolds. My question now is: Are there any results to what the density $\frac{\mathrm d \mu_w}{\mathrm d \lambda_w}$ should be? In my opinion it should be something like $\vert\det\mathrm D\Phi\vert_w\vert$, which is the determinant of the flow conditioned on the unstable directions. So basically the product of the positive eigenvalues of $\mathrm D \Phi$, which should be well-defined and the same for all $x \in w$. I also know examples where this holds, but I don't know if something is known in general. (I found a counter-example to that. Actually, the examples where this holds were some affine-linear maps of Baker type were eigenvalues were constant.) I would be grateful for any help,

The person who answered the question claimed that the preimage of an open set under a right-continuous function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a Borel measurable set because it is the countable union of half-open intervals.  I was trying to think through the ""countable union"" part.  If we have an open set $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and let $A = f^{-1}(U)$, then certainly by definition if we take $A \cap \mathbb{Q}$, then for every $a \in A \cap \mathbb{Q}$, there is some $\delta > 0$ such that $[a,a+\delta) \subseteq A$, and thus $\bigcup_{a \in A \cap \mathbb{Q}} [a,a+\delta) \subseteq A$.  But then, why does the reverse containment hold (or does it hold at all)?  I tried to prove that $A \subseteq \bigcup_{a \in A \cap \mathbb{Q}} [a,a+\delta)$ using contradiction, but didn't get anywhere.  The best I could come up with was that if $b \in A$ and $b \notin \bigcup_{a \in A \cap \mathbb{Q}} [a,a+\delta)$, then because of the density of the rationals in the reals, we could write $\{ b \} \cup \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} [a_n,a_n+\delta_n) \subseteq A$, but this clearly didn't get me anywhere...","['measure-theory', 'continuity', 'real-analysis']"

It's a simple part of the proof but I'm not quite getting what they want to say. The proof is the one in Gallot, Hulin and Lafontaine's Riemannian Geometry book. So it starts something like this: We take a geodesic $c(t)=\text{exp}_m(tu)$ with inicial point $m \in M$. Also take an o.n.b., $\, \{u,e_2,\cdots , e_n\}$, of  $\,T_mM$ (the tangent space of M at m), and parallel vector fields , $(E_i)_{2\leq i\leq n}$, along $c(t)$ such that $E_i(0)=e_i$. Now, given the correct restrictions so $T_{ru}\,\text{exp}_m$ (the differential of $\text{exp}_m$ at $ru\in T_mM$) is a isomorphism we can find Jacobi fields staisfying: $$Y_i^r(0)=0,\; Y_i^r(r)=E_i(r)$$
The specific form of these Jacobi fields is: 
$$Y_i^r(t)=T_{tu}\text{exp}_m(tv) $$ Here we are making the identification $T_{ru}T_mM \approx T_mM$, and
 $v \in T_mM$ is the unique vector such that $T_{ru}\text{exp}_m(rv)=E_i(r)$. So nothing worng with the setting until now, but then the proof reads: $``$Now, $$J(u,t)=C_r t^{1-n}\text{det}(Y_2^r(t),\dots,Y_n^r(t)) $$
$$\text{where } C_r^{-1}=\text{det}((Y_2'^{r}(0),\dots,Y_n'^{r}(0)) )""$$
Here $J(u,t)= t^{1-n}\text{ det}(g(\tilde Y_i(t),\tilde Y_j(t)))^{1/2}$ with $\tilde Y_i(t)$ being the Jacobi Field that satisfies $\tilde Y_i(0)=0$ and $\tilde Y_i'(0)=e_i$ for $2\leq i \leq n$. I totally don't get this statement, why are these equalities valid?

681086,Relationship between complex and real Lp spaces.,"The theory of integration of real functions is (as far as I know) usually extended to the complex case as follows: Let $X$ be a set.
Given a function $f:X\to\mathbb C$,
define $\Re(f),\Im(f):X\to\mathbb R$ as $\Re(f)(x)=\Re(f(x))$ and $\Im(f)(x)=\Im(f(x))$ for every $x\in X$,
where $\Re$ and $\Im$ denote the real part and the imaginary part respectively.
Then,
it clearly is the case that $f=\Re(f)+i\Im(f)$. Now,
if $(X,\mathscr A,\mu)$ is a measure space,
we say that $f:X\to\mathbb C$ is integrable if and only if $\Re(f)$ and $\Im(f)$ are integrable,
and we define
\begin{align*}
\int f~d\mu=\int\Re(f)~d\mu+i\int\Im(f)~d\mu.
\end{align*}
This implies in particular that
\begin{align*}
L^1(X,\mathscr A,\mu,\mathbb C)=L^1(X,\mathscr A,\mu,\mathbb R)+i\cdot L^1(X,\mathscr A,\mu,\mathbb R),\tag{1}
\end{align*}
where $L^p(X,\mathscr A,\mu,\cdot)$ denotes the usual $L^p$ space. Question. Equation (1) raises for me an interesting question: is it true that, for any $1\leq p<\infty$,
\begin{align*}
L^p(X,\mathscr A,\mu,\mathbb C)=L^p(X,\mathscr A,\mu,\mathbb R)+i\cdot L^p(X,\mathscr A,\mu,\mathbb R)
\end{align*}
holds? If not, for which $p$ does it hold and for which $p$ does it fail? Attempted solution: By definition, $f\in L^p(X,\mathscr A,\mu,\mathbb C)$ means that $f^p$ is integrable. Now, working with $\Big(\Re(f)+i\Im(f)\Big)^p$ seems very cumbersome to me, so instead we could define functions $r:X\to[0,\infty)$ and $\theta:X\to[0,2\pi)$ such that $f(x)=r(x)\exp(i\theta(x))$.
In this case,
we have that
\begin{align*}
f=r\cos(\theta)+ir\sin(\theta).
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
f^p=r^p\cos(p\theta)+ir^p\sin(p\theta).
\end{align*}
However, I can't seem to get any further with this.","['measure-theory', 'lp-spaces']"
681098,Directional Derivatives using Polar Coordinates,"I am having a hard time with this problem on my homework assignment.  Here is the problem, and i will show my work below: If $f( x, y) = -2 x^{2} + 3 y^{2}$, find the value of the directional derivative at the point $( -1, 1)$ in the direction given by the angle $\theta = \frac{2 \pi}{2}$. More specifically, find the directional derivative of f at the point $\left(-1,1\right)$ in the direction of the unit vector determined by the angle $\theta$ in polar coordinates. To find the directional derivative, i know you need to find the partial derivative with respect to x, and then to y as shown below:
$$fx(x,y)=-4x$$ $$fy(x,y)=6y$$
Then because we want the directional derivative at point P, we evaluate at point P:
$$\nabla f=4i+6j$$
Now the next step is to multiply the gradient by the directional vector, and that will give the final directional derivative.  I just don't know what the hint is implying when is says use the polar coordinates to find the direction of the unit vector.  What i do know about polar coordinates is:
$$x=rcos \theta$$ $$y=rsin\theta$$
But after that i don't know how to use it.  Any help? Thanks!","['calculus', 'vector-analysis', 'partial-derivative']"
681100,Sample space of possible outcomes for a knockout tournament,"I would like to confirm if my answer is correct for the following question: A conventional knock-out tournament begins with $2^n$ competitors and has $n$ rounds. There  are no play-offs for the positions $2,3,..,2^{n-1}$, and the initial table of draws is  specified. Give a concise description of the sample space of all possible outcomes. My answer is: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{2^{i}/2}.$$ My reasoning is as follows: For each round, the number of players is $2^n$. The number of matches for each round is $2^n / 2$. Since there can be only a win or loss, the total number of combinations per round is $2^{2^{n}/2}$. Therefore the total number of combinations of outcomes (the total sample space), is the sum of combinations in each round from $1 \ldots n$.","['discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

It's a problem of a book I'm using to study Dual Spaces. It seems easy to solve, but I'm out of ideas... I tried write $v$ as a linear combination of the basis of $V$ and $f$ as a combination of the dual basis, but then I realized dimension of $V$ can be infinity.","['vector-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

681123,"The ""$\mathbb{Z}_n$-theta function"" - what is it? Is it being studied somewhere?","The Jacobi theta function is well known:
$$\theta(z, \tau) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{e}^{\pi i n^2 \tau + 2\pi i nz}$$
In Shahn Majid's ""Foundations of Quantum Group Theory"", you'll find a sort of finite theta function in example 2.1.11 on page 45, which he calls ""$\mathbb{Z}_n$-theta function"":
$$\theta_d(a) = \frac{1}{d}\sum_{n=0}^d \mathrm{e}^{\frac{2\pi i}{d} (n^2 + an)} \qquad d \in \mathbb{N}$$
I had never heard of such a function before. Google doesn't give anything promising. It sort of looks like a theta function with $\tau = \frac{2}{d}$ and $z = \frac{a}{d}$, but the sum is finite (like a kind of regularisation?). Is this studied anywhere? Can it be derived from the usual theta function? Are there known identities involving this?","['theta-functions', 'quantum-groups', 'complex-analysis']"
