1732719,How many types of martingale related stochastic processes are there?,"Previously I had thought that the only concepts in this direction were martingales, submartingales, and supermartingales. However, at least when discussing quadratic variation and stochastic integration in continuous time, we also have semimartingales and quasimartingales, neither of which appear to be consistently defined between different authors. Local martingales at least appear to be consistently defined, although I don't understand why they are not discussed in discrete time. 1. How many stochastic processes are there that are similar to martingales? 2. What unifies them all? 3. Do they all have decompositions similar to the Doob decomposition? 4. Do they all have discrete time analogs?","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'martingales', 'stochastic-analysis', 'stochastic-calculus']"

1732798,"What is $\int_0^1 \ln (1-x) \ln \left(\ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right) \, dx$?","There are well-known closed-form evaluations for integrals of the form $\int_0^1  a(x) \ln \left(\ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right) \, dx  $ for certain algebraic functions $a(x)$. For example, an evaluation of this form is given in the following link: Evaluating $\int_0^1 \log \log \left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \frac{dx}{1+x^2}$ . Closed-form evaluations for integrals of the form $\int_0^1  a(x) \ln \left(\ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right) \, dx$ may be used to evaluate Glaisher-type infinite products. For example, the evaluation of $ \int_{0}^{1}   \frac{\ln \left(\ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right)}{x^{2}+1} \, dx  $ may be used to prove that: \begin{equation*}
\prod _{i=0}^{\infty }     \frac{  (4 i+3)^{\frac{1}{4 i+3}} }{ (4 i+1)^{\frac{1}{4 i+1}}} = 
    \frac{   2^{   \frac{ \pi}{2} } e^{\frac{\gamma  \pi }{4}} \pi ^{   \frac{3 \pi}{4}}}{  \Gamma^{\pi } \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}.
 \end{equation*} Mathematica does not seem to be able to evaluate integrals of the form $\int_0^1  T(x) \ln \left(\ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right) \, dx  $ for certain elementary transcendental functions $T\left(x\right)$. For example, Mathematica is unable to evaluate the following integrals, and the Inverse Symbolic Calculator is not currently able to identify the following numbers: \begin{align*}
 \int_0^1 \ln (1-x) \ln \left(\ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right) \, dx   &   =  1.834962542065861...   \\

\end{align*} I am interested in evaluating $\int_0^1 \ln (1-x) \ln \left(\ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right) \, dx$, but it does not seem to be feasible to use integration by parts to evaluate this integral, and it is not obvious to me how to evaluate this integral using substitution. I have also considered expanding the integrand of this integral using power series to try to evaluate this integral. A new closed-form evaluation of this integral would be interesting, partly because such an evaluation may be used to construct new Glaisher-type infinite products. A similar problem is given in the following link: Integral ${\large\int}_0^1\frac{\ln^2\ln\left(\frac1x\right)}{1+x+x^2}dx$ . I've tried to mimic the strategy used in the answer given in this link, but using the substitution $t=\ln\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$ in this case yields the following integral, which Mathematica is unable to evaluate: \begin{equation*}
\int_0^{\infty } e^{-t} \ln \left(1-e^{-t}\right) \ln (t) \, dt.
\end{equation*} It is also natural to ask: What are some non-trivial examples of elementary transcendental functions $T\left(x\right)$ such that there is a closed-form evaluation of $\int_0^1  T\left(x\right) \ln \left(\ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right) \, dx$? What is $\int_0^1  \sin^{-1} x \ln \left(\ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right) \, dx$?

I run SPSS over the given data and I obtained the following information, which I belive from this can be answer the all the following questions: (a) Find the p-value for the test H0 : β0 = 0 in your output. Explain (as you would to the judge in this case) what this number tells us. Interpret the results of the test in the context of the problem. SOLVED My ans: P-value=0.984 
From the p-value obtained we have not enough evidence to reject the Ho in favor of the alternative, therefore Bo is not significative difference than 0. In the context of the problem this means that if there is no difference in Machine votes (DifferenceMachine=0) then we cannot say that the DiferenceAbstentees is different from 0. (b) Dr. Ashenfelter found that “the difference between the Democratic and Republican tallies in the machine-based vote has been a good indicator of the difference between the two parties’ absentee vote.” Explain how he could draw this conclusion based on your regression output. SOLVED My ans: I believe that the regression output is the table wich title is Model summary. But from my point of view Dr. Ashenfelter use that the value of p is sgnificant and therefore is a good indicator like he said. Is my answer correct? (b) The NY Times article states: “Assuming this relationship in the 21 previous elections had held in the most recent, Professor Ashenfelter estimates that the Republican’s 564-vote edge on the machines should have led to a 133-vote advantage in absentee ballots.” Explain (as Dr. Ashenfelter would explain to the judge), how one can come to this conclusion. SOLVED My answer: I used the model  y=b0+b1*x where b0 and b1 are the given from the model with 21 data point and not 22 and the anser is 133 as the statement said. (c) In the contested election the voting machine margin was -564. The absentee ballot margin, however, was 1025. Use your regression model to make a statistical argument for why this observation is unusual. Assume for now that the contested election was fair. Derive a probability for observing an absentee ballot margin as large or larger than the one observed if the election was fair. My answer: I am thinking I need to compute p(z>[(1025-133)/sqrt(MSE)]>2.74)  but the p value is not even close to 0.06. Why?? (d) Dr. Ashenfelter made a similar argument you just made and came up with a p-value of 0.06 for the test that decides H0 : the election was fair vs. Ha : there was fraud by the democrats The NY Times reporter interpreted this result as follows: “Putting it another way, if past elections are a reliable guide to current voting behavior, there is a 94 percent chance that irregularities in the absentee ballots, not chance alone, swung the elec- tion to the Democrat, Professor Ashenfelter concludes.”
  Critique the reporter’s interpretation of the p-value. If the interpretation is correct, explain why. If the interpretation is incorrect, provide a correct interpretation instead. QUESTION: This is the last question that left answer, if someone know a good explanation. I belive the journalist is correct but I don't know how to verify this. Conclusion: Please, let me know if I need to improve something or change something. I will keep my work update, and like I said before I will be given points in the future. (I feel bad you reed such a long problem). THANKS AGAIN.","['statistics', 'probability', 'statistical-inference']"
1732960,Fractal fundamentals,"I am a programmer by trade, and am very interested in fractals. To be very basic about the concept, one might say a 'circle of circles' is a fractal. Where each circle is made up of circles, and those circles are made of smaller circles and so on. This idea is similar to a Sierpinski triangle, which I interpret basically a triangle of triangles. To test my understanding, I decided to draw out this notion of a 'circle of circles'. Realize, I did this by hand with MS paint, copy and paste. I really should have just written out a simple program using some derivative of pi to get a perfect, mathematical display. In any case, this image is just to illustrate the concept. It's obviously not perfect, my question is: Is the notion of a 'circle of circles', 'triangle of triangles', or 'function of functions' truly the definition of a fractal? And, consequently, is the application of this notion, in this image, a fractal? (I realize it isn't because the alignment is incorrect.) Note: The coloring was just so I could see the pattern easier, lets assume there is no color. Though if the color had been also repeating, would this still prove true?

1733013,why can't quintics be solved by radicals and the relevance of permutations of roots of polynomials,"I am seeking to learn about the motivation in the development of group theory. It has been a few years since algebra, and we got as far as rings and fields. I am aware that there were several motivations for the development of the theory of groups; the studies of different geometries, the groups that arose out of the study of modular arithmetic, but i am particularly interested in the motivation from the quest to disprove the solvability of the quintic equation, generally, by radicals. I understand after the solutions for the lower order polynomial functions were discovered it was believed that there would be no like solution for that of quintic equations. I have read of the work Lagrange did that led Abel to develop his proof.  Particularly the link on the history of the development of group theory provides some of the history. My specific question relates to the discussion of the role the permutations of the roots the 5th order polynomials played. as follows from the above link Lagrange assumes the roots of a given cubic equation are x', x'' and x'''. Then, taking 1, w, w2 as the cube roots of unity, he examines the expression $$R = x' + wx'' + w2x'''$$ and notes that it takes just two different values under the six permutations of the roots x', x'', x''' If R is a polynomial, and the roots are as denoted above, what are these cube roots of unity? What is the interpretation of the permutation of the roots, and their relevance to a solution by radicals? I have read the article on the Abel-ruffini theorem , which provides a proof which is based on Galois theory. What i would like is more of an explanation in terms of the mathematics the problem was understood in during the time it was posed. i.e. Not the modern algebraic formulation it is introduced in today. I have not studied Galois theory, and considering my own limitations, perhaps the context it was understood in at the time would be more accessible to my understanding. Also, i did try to reason through Intuition behind looking at permutations of the roots in Galois theory , and the part that was difficult was the discussion of elementary symmetric functions. UPDATE A paper entitled Galois theory for beginers was submitted in an answer below. I would like to include an excerpt from that paper that is more direct at part of my difficulty. the set of elements obtainable from $a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1}$ by +, -, $\times$ , $\div$ is the field $\mathbb{Q}(a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1})$ . If we denote the roots of $(\ast)$ by $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ , so that $$(x-x_1)\cdots(x-x_n)=x^n=a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1x+a_0$$ then $a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1}$ are polynomial functions of $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ called the elementary symmetric functions: $$a_0=(-1)^nx_1x_2\ldots x_n,\ldots,a_{n-1}=-(x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n).$$ the link to the paper is provided in a comment below the answer. what i understand that the field $\mathbb{Q}$ is formed from the coefficients of the nth order monic polynomial, $a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1}$ , closed under the operations of addition and multiplication. But in what sense are these coefficients a polynomial of the roots of the polynomial? Also, what is the meaning of the equation $a_0=(-1)^nx_1x_2\ldots x_n,\ldots,a_{n-1}=-(x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n)$ ? Is this equation some how related to the identities relating the sum and multiplies of roots of an nth order polynomial to the quotients of the coefficients, $\alpha+\beta=\frac{-b}{a}$ and $\alpha \beta= \frac{c}{a}$ for the second order polynomial with roots $\alpha,\beta$ and coefficients a,b,c?","['abstract-algebra', 'galois-theory', 'math-history', 'group-theory']"

1733204,A curious problem with striking similarity to L'Hospital's Rule,"I got this problem in a book ""A Problem Seminar"" by Donald J. Newman which caught my attention. I am trying to find a solution and hence if possible please provide a hint only kind of solution. Let $f, g$ be differentiable on $(0, 1]$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x \in (0, 1]$ and further let $f'(x)/g'(x)$ tend to a limit (in the extended sense) as $x \to 0^{+}$. Prove that $f(x)/g(x)$ also tends to a limit (in the extended sense) as $x \to 0^{+}$. By existence of limit in extended sense I mean that the limit is either a real number or is infinite but in any case the function does not oscillate. Update : It appears that the requirement $g'(x) > 0$ is redundant. This is because $f'(x)/g'(x)$ is defined as $x \to 0^{+}$ and hence $g'(x)$ is non-zero and by intermediate value properly of derivatives $g'(x)$ maintains a constant sign as $x \to 0^{+}$. Further update : The condition $g'(x) > 0$ is more for the non-vanishing of derivative $g'$ and this also ensures that $g$ is non-vanishing and hence both $g', g$ are of constant sign (via intermediate value property). We then have $(f/g)' = (g'/g)(f'/g' - f/g)$ and therefore if $f'/g' < f/g$ as $x \to 0^{+}$ or $f'/g' > f/g$ as $x \to 0^{+}$ then $f/g$ is monotone and hence it has a limit (in the extended sense). The difficult case is when there are infinitely many values of $x$ as $x \to 0^{+}$ for which $f'/g' < f/g$ and there are infinitely many values of $x$ for which $f'/g' > f/g$. In this case I guess (but not sure) the $f/g$ remains near $f'/g'$ and the both tend to same limit. I wonder if this line of reasoning is correct. It appears that this reasoning is correct after all. See my answer. Another reasoning goes like this. Since $g$ is monotone and of constant sign it follows that $g$ tends to a limit in the extended sense. If this limit is infinite then we know by a version of L'Hospital's Rule that $f/g$ tends to same limit as that of $f'/g'$. If $g$ tends to a finite limit (including $0$) then we need to show that in this case $f$ also tends to a limit in the extended and hence $f/g$ tends to a limit in extended sense.","['real-analysis', 'calculus', 'limits']"

1733614,Invertible matrices over ring of formal Laurent series,"Let $A$ be a commutative ring, let $A[[t]]$ be the ring of formal power series and consider the ring of formal Laurent series $A((t)) = A[[t]][t^{-1}]$. I would like to know: What is $Gl_n(A((t)))$, the group of invertible matrices with entries in the formal Laurent series over A? Let me give some background to clarify what kind of answer I am looking for: One can verify that for any $n\geq 1$, the ring of matrices $M_n$ with entries in $A[[t]]$ is isomorphic to the formal power series with coefficients in $M_n(A)$, via
\begin{align}
M_n(A[[t]]) \cong & \; M_n(A)[[t]] \\
\left (\sum_k a^{(k)}_{i,j}t^k \right)_{i,j} \mapsto &
\sum_k (a_{i,j}^{(k)})_{i,j} \,t^k.\end{align}
Using the well known result that a power series over any ring is invertible if and only if the first coefficient is invertible, we see from this that the invertible matrices $Gl_n(A[[t]])$ are precisely those for which the first coefficient of the corresponding series is invertible:
$$Gl_n(A[[t]]) = Gl_n(A) + t\cdot M_n(A)[[t]]$$
One could see this as a generalization of the mentioned one-dimensional case $A[[t]]^\times=A^\times + tA[[t]]$. I am interested in finding a similar description for the situation where $A[[t]]$ is replaced by the ring of formal Laurent series $A((t)) = A[[t]][t^{-1}]$. In particular, I would like to get a feeling for: How ""large"" is $Gl_n(A((t)))$ compared to $Gl_n(A[[t]])$? Here are some thoughts: While I think we still get an isomorphism
$$M_n(A((t))) \cong M_n(A)((t)),$$
it seems much harder to determine what the units of the right hand side are, because $M_n(A)$ has many zero divisors. As an example, consider the matrix 
$$\pmatrix{1&0\\ 0&t} \mapsto  \pmatrix{1&0\\ 0&0} + \pmatrix{0&0\\ 0&1} t.$$ 
This element of $M_n(A)((t))$ clearly has an inverse, although all coefficients are zero-divisors. As for the second question, in case that $A$ is an integral domain, for $n=1$ we know that $A((t))^\times/A[[t]]^\times=\mathbb{Z}$. In general, $Gl_n(A[[t]])$ is not a normal subgroup anymore, but I was hoping that one could still say something about coset representatives of $Gl_n(A((t)))/Gl_n(A[[t]])$. I came to this question when I was trying to find out which finite locally free $A((t))$-modules come from locally free $A[[t]]$-modules.","['laurent-series', 'abstract-algebra', 'formal-power-series']"

\int_0^t sW_sdW_s = \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}t_jW_{t_i}(W_{t_{i+1}}-W_{t_i})
$$ Then, $$
E\left(\int_0^t sW_sdW_s\right) = \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}E\left(t_jW_{t_i}(W_{t_{i+1}}-W_{t_i})\right)
$$ I believe that I can separate the terms in the expectation into: $$
E\left(t_jW_{t_i}(W_{t_{i+1}}-W_{t_i})\right) = E\left(t_jW_{t_i}\right)E\left(W_{t_{i+1}}-W_{t_i}\right)
$$ I am not sure how to find $E\left(t_jW_{t_i}\right)$, although I know it is finite so it doesn't matter because $E\left(W_{t_{i+1}}-W_{t_i}\right) = 0$","['stochastic-processes', 'probability', 'stochastic-calculus', 'stochastic-integrals']"
1733839,Trouble with definition of signature of a compact manifold,"The signature of a manifold, as I understand it, is defined as follows: Given a connected, compact, and oriented manifold $M$ of dimension $4n$, we may define a quadratic form on the cohomology group $H^{2n}(M; \mathbb{Z})$ as follows. If we take two cochains $\alpha, \beta \in H^{2n}(M; \mathbb{Z})$, then the cup product $\alpha \smile \beta$ lies in $H^{4n}(M; \mathbb{Z})$. By Poincaré duality, we have an isomorphism $H^{4n}(M; \mathbb{Z}) \simeq H_0(M; \mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}$ (since $M$ is connected). Using this identification, we may define a ""bilinear"" (I put this in quotation marks because the cohomology groups are no vector fields) map $\sigma: H^{2n}(M; \mathbb{Z}) \times H^{2n}(M; \mathbb{Z}) \to \mathbb{Z}$. Moreover, since $\alpha \smile \beta = (-1)^{4n^2}\beta \smile \alpha$, $\sigma$ is also symmetric. Thus, we have a symmetric, ""bilinear"" form. The signature of $M$, denoted by $\sigma(M)$, is then defined as the signature of this form. I'm confused because the signature of a quadratic or symmetric bilinear form is supposed to be an ordered triple, whereas $\sigma(M)$ is supposed to be an integer. On top of this, I'm not sure how we can consider this a quadratic form since we are not working over a vector space. How am I supposed to define this thing?","['homology-cohomology', 'intersection-theory', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"

1733937,Eigenvalues of shape operator and of curvature on second exterior power,"Terminology note In the following, a scalar product will be a symmetric bilinear form, and a euclidean scalar product will be a positive definite scalar product. This is the terminology used by my Differential Geometry teacher. Background Let me sum up the operators coming in play in the question. To start right from the start, we have, in as general a context as possible, a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. The metric induces a single Levi-Civita connection , which I will denote $\nabla_XY$, where $X,Y$ are fields and $\nabla_XY$ is the covariant derivative of $Y$ along $X$, as it is also called. The curvature tensor is then defined as: $$R(X,Y)Z=\nabla_X\nabla_YZ-\nabla_Y\nabla_XZ-\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z=[\nabla_X,\nabla_Y]Z-\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z.$$ This is the type $(1,3)$ curvature tensor, whereas the type $(0,4)$ tensor is: $$R(X,Y,Z,W)=g(R(X,Y)Z,W).$$ This can be proven to be antisimmetric in the first two and second two entries, and symmetric w.r.t. swapping the two couples (i.e. $R(X,Y,Z,W)=R(Z,W,X,Y)$). This means it induces a scalar product on the second exterior power, which we define as: $$\mathcal{R}(X\wedge Y,Z\wedge W)=R(X,Y,W,Z).$$ $g$ also induces a scalar product on the second exterior power: $$g'(v\wedge w,u\wedge t)=g(v,u)g(w,t)-g(v,t)g(w,u).$$ This can be shown to be positive definite -- in fact, if $\{v_j\}$ is orthonormal w.r.t $g$< $\{v_i\wedge v_j\}_{i<j}$ is orthonormal w.r.t. $g'$. Fixing this scalar product as a ""reference"", since $\mathcal{R}$ is also a scalar product, we get a self-adjoint operator, which we still denote $\mathcal{R}$, by setting: $$g'(\mathcal{R}(v\wedge w),u\wedge t)=\mathcal{R}(v\wedge w,u\wedge t).$$ Oh I'm writing all of this with decomposable vectors but this is extended by additivity to non-decomposable ones of course. The last operator we need is the shape operator. So we consider a hypersurface $N\subseteq M$. Locally, we can always find a normal unitary vector field $\mathcal{N}$ for $N$. Modulo a sign, this induces an operator, called shape operator , which is defined by: $$S(v)=\nabla_X\mathcal{N},$$ where $X$ is any field which evalues to $v$ at the tangency point $p$ of $v$ to $M$. It can be shown that this is a $g$-self-adjoint endomorphism of $T_pN$, and that $S(\mathcal{N}(p))=0$. Question So here comes, at last, the question. I have been given the following exercise. Let $M$ be a hypersurface of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Suppose $M$ is compact, connected, orientable (i.e. has a global unitary normal field). Assume $\{v_j\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_pM$ consisting of eigenvalues of the shape operator $S$. Prove that $\{v_i\wedge v_j\}$ is an o.n.b. of $\Lambda^2T_pM$ composed of eigenvalues of $\mathcal{R}$, and more precisely $\mathcal{R}(v_i\wedge v_j)=\lambda_i\lambda_jv_i\wedge v_j$, where $S(v_i)=\lambda_iv_i$. Now the fact that those wedges provide an orthonormal basis is easy, since we know (by earlier proof in the course) that it is a basis, and orthonormality follows from a simple computation: $$g'(v_i\wedge v_j,v_k\wedge v_\ell)=g(v_i,v_k)g(v_j,v_\ell)-g(v_i,v_\ell)g(v_j,v_k)=\delta_{ik}\delta_{j\ell}-\delta_{i\ell}\delta_{jk},$$ we need $i<j$ and $k<\ell$ by definition of the basis, if the two are equal the first term is $1\cdot1$ and the second one $0\cdot0$, so it is a normal basis, and if they are distinct then the first term is 0, and if $i\neq k$ it could be that $i=\ell$ but the $j\neq k$ since $j>i=\ell>k$, so the second term is also zero, whereas if $j\neq\ell$ it could be $j=k$, but $i\neq\ell$ by a similar argument, giving again that both terms are zero. As for the fact those vectors are eigenvalues of $\mathcal{R}$, I am pretty much at a loss: what is the link between $\mathcal{R}$ and $S$? I must be missing something fundamental, but I just don't see a way to link them. PS I also know that the hypotheses given imply $S$ is everywhere positive definite or everywhere negative definite, and that $M$ is diffeomorphic to $S^d$. That is (or should be) called Hadamard's theorem. ""or should be"" because the statement was given after the proof of the theorem and along the lines of «This set of considerations are called Hadamard's theorem». At this point in the course we have not yet covered geodesics , and we never saw anything involving both geodesics and $S$. I remark this because I have seen this question . Also, principal curvature is an unknown term for me. Seeing this question makes me remember the Theorema Egregium, which we proved, and seems to be potentially useful here. However, T.E. works in $\mathbb{R}^3$, not $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, so it would need a generalization. Obviously, $d=2$ is solved by T.E., because if the sectional curvature (which equates to $\mathcal{R}(v_i\wedge v_j,v_i\wedge v_j)$ since the denominator is 1) is the determinant of the shape operator, then it is the product of the eigenvalues, which are precisely the $\lambda_i$.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'curvature']"

$$\psi'(t) = F(\psi(t)) $$ Show that if $\psi(t_0)=\varphi(t_0)$, then $\psi(t) \leq \varphi(t), \forall t \geq t_0$. I should use Grönwall's inequality: Let $u: [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R_+}$  be a continuous function.

1734235,Is an étale morphism of algebraic stacks locally quasi-finite?,"An étale morphism of schemes is unramified, and an unramified morphism is locally quasi-finite. Does the same hold for étale morphisms of algebraic stacks? Let us recall the definitions, following the Stacks Project[1]. Suppose $P$ is a property of morphisms of schemes. For some common Grothendieck topologies $\tau$ on the category of schemes, there are notions of $P$ being $\tau$-local on the source, and $\tau$-local on the target/base. Let's call a property $P$ of morphisms $\tau$-local , if it is $\tau$-local on the source, $\tau$-local on the base, and stable under post-composition by open immersions. The Stacks Project calls this ""$\tau$-local on the source and target"", which seems to conflict with ordinary language. The property of being locally quasi-finite is étale-local in the above sense, so it can be defined for an arbitrary morphism of algebraic spaces. It is fpqc-local on the base and stable under base change, so it can also be defined for morphisms of algebraic stacks that are representable by algebraic spaces. But it's not smooth-local, which means the definition doesn't bootstrap automatically to arbitrary morphisms of algebraic stacks: it has to be given a separate definition. Here's how it's defined in the Stacks Project. Definition : A morphism $f: \cal{X} \rightarrow \cal{Y}$ of algebraic stacks is locally quasi-finite if it is
  locally of finite type, quasi-DM, and for every morphism
  $\rm{Spec}(k) \rightarrow \cal{Y}$, where $k$ is a field, the space
  $|\cal{X}_k|$ is discrete. Here quasi-DM means the diagonal $\Delta_f$ is locally quasi-finite (as a morphism representable by algebraic spaces), and $|\cal{X}_k|$ is the ""underlying topological space"" of the fibre $\cal{X}_k$, consisting of equivalence classes of morphisms from the spectra of fields. Question : With the above definition, is an étale morphism of algebraic stacks
  locally quasi-finite? An acceptable answer would either give a clear proof why the statement is true, provide an enlightening counter-example why it's not, or point to a citable source where the problem is resolved. I have looked in LMB [2], but there locally quasi-finite is only mentioned in the appendix for algebraic spaces, not for stacks. In fact for my purpose, $\cal{X}$ and $\cal{Y}$ are Deligne-Mumford stacks, and in that case the question may be easier. Since locally quasi-finite is an étale-local property, there should be another way to define it for morphisms of Deligne-Mumford stacks by passing to étale presentations. Then there's probably some general rule transferring implication relations between étale-local properties of morphisms from schemes to Deligne-Mumford stacks, which would give (étale $\Rightarrow$ locally quasi-finite). I assume this is not done in the Stacks Project because there the emphasis is on general algebraic stacks.

1734269,Category theoretic definition of topological spaces.,"We know that for algebraic structures like groups and rings, the axioms in their definition can be written in terms of objects and morphisms in the category of sets and hence can be generalised to give group objects and ring objects given here and here respectively. I was wondering if we could do a similar thing for topological spaces. In defining topology on a set $X$, we first identify a collection of subsets of $X$ as the open sets. Correspondingly, we have the notion of subobjects of a given object in any category given by monomorphisms $A\hookrightarrow X$ upto isomorphisms of such diagrams. Then we just have to translate the statements that $X$ and the empty set $\phi$ belong to the collection. This can be given by asking the identity on X and the unique map from the initial object $*$ to $X$, in a monomorphism and is in our collection. The collection is closed under finite intersection. We can translate this as for any two morphisms $A\hookrightarrow X$ and $B\hookrightarrow X$ in the collections, the pullback of the diagram $A\hookrightarrow X \hookleftarrow B$ exisits and is part of the collection. The collection is closed under arbitrary unions. This is the part I find hardest to translate into a statement in category theory. What I was thinking is, given a collection of maps $A_i\hookrightarrow X$, we have the induced map from the coproduct, $\coprod_iA_i\to X$. The problem is, this map is not a monomorphism in general, so to get a monomorphism I think we need some kind of canonical epi-mono factorisation. My question is can these arguments be completed to get a category theoretic definition of topological spaces ? Is this construction useful in anyway or does it have serious drawbacks?","['category-theory', 'general-topology']"

For some time i was wondering $f(z)=\left|z\right|$ is not analytic... $f^2(z)=z^2$  is analytic so $f(z)=|z|$ has to be analytic but it is not...

I hope to get the homogeneous equation from there, and then substituting one of the above three given solutions, I can find $r(x)$, and then using ' Variation of Parameters ', can find the general solution of the non-homogeneous equation.

There is a spectral resolution for $A$, that is, orthogonal projection-valued measure $E$ defined for all Borel measurable subsets of $R$, with the following properties: $E(\emptyset)=0, E(\mathbb{R})=1$ $E(S\cap T)=E(S)E(T)$ $E^*=E$ $E$ commutes with $A$ $D=\left\{u\in H \mid \int t^2dE(t)u<\infty \right\}$ I'm fairly well following the proof given in this book, but I found out several points I cannot make clear about.
