8,How are we able to calculate specific numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence?,"I was reading up on the Fibonacci Sequence, $1,1,2,3,5,8,13,\ldots $ when I noticed some were able to calculate specific numbers. So far I've only figured out creating an array and counting to the value, which is incredibly simple, but I reckon I can't find any formula for calculating a Fibonacci number based on it's position.

57,How do the Properties of Relations work?,"This is simply not clicking for me. I'm currently learning math during the summer vacation and I'm on the chapter for relations and functions. There are five properties for a relation: Reflexive - $R \rightarrow  R$ Symmetrical - $R \rightarrow S$ ; $S \rightarrow  R$ Antisymmetrical - $R \rightarrow S$ && ( $R \rightarrow  R$ || $S \rightarrow  S$ ) Asymmetrical - $R \rightarrow S$ && !( $R \rightarrow  R$ || $S \rightarrow  S$ ) Transitive - if $R \rightarrow S$ && $S \rightarrow T$ , then $R \rightarrow T$ If that's not what you call the properties in English, then please let me know- I have to study it in German, unfortunately, and these are my rough translations. Continuing on, I just don't know what to do with this information practically. The examples of the book are horrible: ""Is the same age as"" is apparently reflexive, symmetrical and transitive. ""Is related to"" is also apparently reflexive, symmetrical and transitive. ""Is older than"" is asymmetric, antisymmetric and transitive. There are more useless examples like this. I have no idea how it comes to these conclusions because we're talking about a literal statement. I was hoping perhaps for some real mathematical examples, but the book falls short on those. I would greatly appreciate it if somebody could explain the above example and perhaps give me a better use for Relations other than... that. Also, how can a relation be asymmetrical and antisymmetrical at the same time? Don't they cancel each other out?","['relations', 'elementary-set-theory']"

128,How do you prove that $p(n \xi)$ for $\xi$ irrational and $p$ a polynomial is uniformly distributed modulo 1?,"The Weyl equidistribution theorem states that the sequence of fractional parts ${n \xi}$, $n = 0, 1, 2, \dots$ is uniformly distributed for $\xi$ irrational. This can be proved using a bit of ergodic theory, specifically the fact that an irrational rotation is uniquely ergodic with respect to Lebesgue measure. It can also be proved by simply playing with trigonometric polynomials (i.e., polynomials in $e^{2\pi i k x}$ for $k$ an integer) and using the fact they are dense in the space of all continuous functions with period 1.  In particular, one shows that if $f(x)$ is a continuous function with period 1, then for any $t$,  $\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \lim \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f(t+i \xi)$. One shows this by checking this (directly) for trigonometric polynomials via the geometric series.  This is a very elementary and nice proof. The general form of Weyl's theorem states that if $p$ is a monic integer-valued polynomial, then the sequence ${p(n \xi)}$ for $\xi$ irrational is uniformly distributed modulo 1.  I believe this can be proved using extensions of these ergodic theory techniques -- it's an exercise in Katok and Hasselblatt.  I'd like to see an elementary proof. Can the general form of Weyl's theorem be proved using the same elementary techniques as in the basic version?",['number-theory']
139,How do I cut a square in half?,"I have a square that's $10\mathrm{m} \times 10\mathrm{m}$. I want to cut it in half so that I have a square with half the area. But if I cut it from top to bottom or left to right, I don't get a square, I get a rectangle! I know the area of the small square is supposed to be $50\mathrm{m}^{2}$, so I can use my calculator to find out how long a side should be: it's $7.07106781\mathrm{m}$. But my teacher said I should be able to do this without a calculator. How am I supposed to get that number by hand?",['geometry']
150,Are there any functions that are (always) continuous yet not differentiable? Or vice-versa?,"It seems like functions that are continuous always seem to be differentiable, to me.  I can't imagine one that is not.  Are there any examples of functions that are continuous, yet not differentiable? The other way around seems a bit simpler -- a differentiable function is obviously always going to be continuous.  But are there any that do not satisfy this?","['continuity', 'real-analysis']"
155,How can you prove that a function has no closed form integral?,"In the past, I've come across statements  along the lines of ""function $f(x)$ has no closed form integral"", which I assume means that there is no combination of the operations: addition/subtraction multiplication/division raising to powers and roots trigonometric functions exponential functions logarithmic functions which when differentiated gives the function $f(x)$ . I've heard this said about the function $f(x) = x^x$ , for example. What sort of techniques are used to prove statements like this? What is this branch of mathematics called? Merged with "" How to prove that some functions don't have a primitive "" by Ismael : Sometimes we are told that some functions like $\dfrac{\sin(x)}{x}$ don't have an indefinite integral, or that it can't be expressed in term of other simple functions.

164,Why is the volume of a sphere $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$?,"I learned that the volume of a sphere is $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ , but why? The $\pi$ kind of makes sense because its round like a circle, and the $r^3$ because it's 3-D, but $\frac{4}{3}$ is so random!

177,Will this procedure generate random points uniformly distributed within a given circle? Proof?,"Consider the task of generating random points uniformly distributed within a circle of a given radius $r$ that is centered at the origin. Assume that we are given a random number generator $R$ that generates a floating point number uniformly distributed in the range $[0, 1)$. Consider the following procedure: Generate a random point $p = (x, y)$ within a square of side $2r$ centered at the origin. This can be easily achieved by: a. Using the random number generator $R$ to generate two random numbers $x$ and $y$, where $x, y \in [0, 1)$, and then transforming $x$ and $y$ to the range $[0, r)$ (by multiplying each by $r$). b. Flipping a fair coin to decide whether to reflect $p$ around the $x$-axis. c. Flipping another fair coin to decide whether to reflect $p$ around the $y$-axis. Now, if $p$ happens to fall outside the given circle, discard $p$ and generate another point. Repeat the procedure until $p$ falls within the circle. Is the previous procedure correct? That is, are the random points generated by it uniformly distributed within the given circle? How can one formally [dis]prove it? Background Info The task was actually given in Ruby Quiz - Random Points within a Circle (#234) . If you're interested, you can check my solution in which I've implemented the procedure described above. I would like to know whether the procedure is mathematically correct or not, but I couldn't figure out how to formally [dis]prove it. Note that the actual task was to generate random points uniformly distributed within a circle of a given radius and position , but I intentionally left that out in the question because the generated points can be easily translated to their correct positions relative to the given center.","['probability-theory', 'algorithms']"
194,Distribution of primes?,"Do primes become more or less frequent as you go further out on the number line?

201,Is there possibly a largest prime number?,"Prime numbers are numbers with no factors other than one and itself. Factors of a number are always lower or equal to than a given number; so, the larger the number is, the larger the pool of ""possible factors"" that number might have. So the larger the number, it seems like the less likely the number is to be a prime. Surely there must be a number where, simply, every number above it has some other factors.  A ""critical point"" where every number larger than it simply will always have some factors other than one and itself. Has there been any research as to finding this critical point, or has it been proven not to exist?  That for any $n$ there is always guaranteed to be a number higher than $n$ that has no factors other than one and itself?","['prime-numbers', 'number-theory']"
206,"What exactly does it mean for a function to be ""well-behaved""?","Often in my studies (economics) the assumption of a ""well-behaved"" function will be invoked. I don't exactly know what that entails (I think twice continuously differentiability is one of the requirements), nor do I know why this is necessary (though I imagine the why will depend on each case). Can someone explain it to me, and if there is an explanation of the why as well, I would be grateful. Thanks! EDIT : To give one example where the term appears, see this Wikipedia entry for utility functions, which says at one point: In order to simplify calculations,
various assumptions have been made of
utility functions. CES (constant elasticity of substitution, or
isoelastic) utility Exponential utility Quasilinear utility Homothetic preferences Most utility functions
used in modeling or theory are well-behaved . They are usually
monotonic, quasi-concave, continuous
and globally non-satiated. I might be wrong, but I don't think ""well-behaved"" means monotonic, quasi-concave, continuous and globally non-satiated. What about twice differentiable?","['economics', 'terminology', 'analysis']"
234,Card doubling paradox,"Suppose there are two face down cards each with a positive real number and with one twice the other. Each card has value equal to its number. You are given one of the cards (with value $x$) and after you have seen it, the dealer offers you an opportunity to swap without anyone having looked at the other card. If you choose to swap, your expected value should be the same, as you still have a $50\%$ chance of getting the higher card and $50\%$ of getting the lower card. However, the other card has a $50\%$ chance of being $0.5x$ and a $50\%$ chance of being $2x$. If we keep the card, our expected value is $x$, while if we swap it, then our expected value is:
$$0.5(0.5x)+0.5(2x)=1.25x$$
so it seems like it is better to swap. Can anyone explain this apparent contradiction?","['probability-theory', 'paradoxes']"

Given the extra computing effort required to multiply $4\times 4$ matrices instead of $3\times 3$ matrices, there must be a substantial benefit to including that extra fourth term, even though $3\times 3$ matrices should (?) be sufficient to describe points and transformations in 3D space.

365,Tiling a $3 \times 2n$ rectangle with dominoes,"I'm looking to find out if there's any easy way to calculate the number of ways to tile a $3 \times 2n$ rectangle with dominoes. I was able to do it with the two codependent recurrences f(0) = g(0) = 1
f(n) = f(n-1) + 2g(n-1)
g(n) = f(n) + g(n-1) where $f(n)$ is the actual answer and $g(n)$ is a helper function that represents the number of ways to tile a $3 \times 2n$ rectangle with two extra squares on the end (the same as a $3 \times 2n+1$ rectangle missing one square). By combining these and doing some algebra, I was able to reduce this to f(n) = 4f(n-1) - f(n-2) which shows up as sequence A001835 , confirming that this is the correct recurrence. The number of ways to tile a $2 \times n$ rectangle is the Fibonacci numbers because every rectangle ends with either a verticle domino or two horizontal ones, which gives the exact recurrence that Fibonacci numbers do.

I also know that the sum of the inverse of prime numbers $\frac12 + \frac13 + \frac15 + \frac17 + \frac1{11} + \cdots$ diverges too, even if really slowly since it's $O(\log \log n)$. But I think I read that if we consider the numbers whose decimal representation does not have a certain digit (say, 7) and sum the inverse of these numbers, the sum is finite (usually between 19 and 20, it depends from the missing digit).

392,Intuitive understanding of the derivatives of $\sin x$ and $\cos x$,"One of the first things ever taught in a differential calculus class: The derivative of $\sin x$ is $\cos x$. The derivative of $\cos x$ is $-\sin x$. This leads to a rather neat (and convenient?) chain of derivatives: sin(x)
cos(x)
-sin(x)
-cos(x)
sin(x)
... An analysis of the shape of their graphs confirms some points; for example, when $\sin x$ is at a maximum, $\cos x$ is zero and moving downwards; when $\cos x$  is at a maximum, $\sin x$ is zero and moving upwards.  But these ""matching points"" only work for multiples of $\pi/4$. Let us move back towards the original definition(s) of sine and cosine: At the most basic level, $\sin x$ is defined as -- for a right triangle with internal angle $x$ -- the length of the side opposite of the angle divided by the hypotenuse of the triangle. To generalize this to the domain of all real numbers, $\sin x$ was then defined as the Y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle that is an angle $x$ from the positive X-axis. The definition of $\cos x$ was then made the same way, but with adj/hyp and the X-coordinate, as we all know. Is there anything about this basic definition that allows someone to look at these definitions, alone, and think, ""Hey, the derivative of the sine function with respect to angle is the cosine function!"" That is, from the unit circle definition alone .  Or, even more amazingly, the right triangle definition alone .  Ignoring graphical analysis of their plot. In essence, I am asking, essentially, ""Intuitively why is the derivative of the sine the cosine?""","['trigonometry', 'calculus']"

At first glance, it seems obvious that E is smaller than N , because for E is basically N with half of its terms taken out.  The size of E is the size of N divided by two. You could see this as, for every item in E , two items in N could be matched (the item x and x-1).  This implies that N is twice as large as E On second glance though, it seems less obvious.  Each item in N could be mapped with one item in E (the item x*2). Which is larger, then?  Or are they both equal in size?  Why?

419,What can we conclude from correlation?,"I just got my statistics test back and I am totally confused about one of the questions! A study was done that took a simple random sample of 40 people and measured whether

  The study showed that the proportion
  of left-handed people and the ages had
  a strong negative correlation. What
  can we conclude? Explain your answer. I know that we can't conclude that getting older causes people to become right-handed. Something else might be causing it, not the age. If two things are correlated, we can only conclude association, not causation. So I wrote: We can conclude that many people
  become right-handed as they grow
  older, but we cannot tell why. That's exactly what association means, but my teacher marked me wrong! What mistake did I make? Is 40 too small of a sample size to make any conclusions?",['statistics']
423,Intuitive reasoning behind the Chain Rule in multiple variables?,"I've sort of gotten a grasp on the Chain rule with one variable.  If you hike up a mountain at 2 feet an hour, and the temperature decreases at 2 degrees per feet, the temperature would be decreasing for you at $2\times 2 = 4$ degrees per hour. But I'm having a bit more trouble understanding the Chain Rule as applied to multiple variables.  Even the case of 2 dimensions $$z = f(x,y),$$ where $x = g(t)$ and $y = h(t)$, so $$\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial z}{dx} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial z}{dy} \frac{dy}{dt}.$$ Now, this is easy enough to ""calculate"" (and figure out what goes where).  My teacher taught me a neat tree-based graphical method for figuring out partial derivatives using chain rule.  All-in-all, it was rather hand-wavey.

534,"Applications of the ""soft maximum""","There is a little triviality that has been referred to as the ""soft maximum"" over on John Cook's Blog that I find to be fun, at the very least. The idea is this:  given a list of values, say $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$ , the function $g(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = \log(\exp(x_1) + \exp(x_2) + \cdots + \exp(x_n))$ returns a value very near the maximum in the list. This happens because that exponentiation exaggerates the differences between the $x_i$ values.  For the largest $x_i$, $\exp(x_i)$ will be $really$ large.  This largest exponential will significantly outweigh all of the others combined. Taking the logarithm, i.e. undoing the exponentiation,  we essentially recover the largest of the $x_i$'s.  (Of course, if two of the values were very near one another, we aren't guaranteed to get the true maximum, but it won't be far off!) About this, John Cook says: ""The soft maximum approximates the hard maximum but it also rounds off the corners.""  This couldn't really be said any better. I recall trying to cleverly construct sequences for proofs in advanced calculus where not-everywhere-differentiable operations would have been great to use if they didn't have that pesky non-differentiable trait.

blueprints for a material that show what phase, or combination of
phases, a material will exist in for a range of concentrations and
temperatures (see this
pdf presentation ). The crucial step in drawing the boundaries that separate one phase
from another on these diagrams involves minimizing a free energy
function subject to basic physical conservation constraints.  I am
going to leave out the chemistry/physics and hope that we can move forward
with the minimization using Lagrange multipliers. The free energy that is to be minimized is this: $\widetilde{G}(x_1, x_2) = f^{(1)}G_{1}(x_1) + f^{(2)}G_{2}(x_2),$ subject to: $f^{(1)}x_1 + f^{(2)}x_2 = c_1,$ $f^{(1)} + f^{(2)} = 1. $ (and also that the $x_{i} > 0$ and $f^{(i)} > 0$, for $i=1,2$.) The Lagrange formulation is: $L(x_1,x_2,f^{(1)},f^{(2)},\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3) =
f^{(1)}G_{1}(x_1) + f^{(2)}G_{2}(x_2)$ $- \lambda_{1}(f^{(1)}x_1 + f^{(2)}x_2 - c_1)$ $- \lambda_{2}(f^{(1)} + f^{(2)} - 1) $ The minimization of $\widetilde{G}$ follows from finding the $x_{i}$'s  that satisfy $\nabla L = 0:$ $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1}}   = f^{(1)}G_{1}'(x_1) - \lambda_{1}f^{(1)} = 0$ $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_2}     = f^{(2)}G_{2}'(x_2) - \lambda_{1}f^{(2)} = 0$ $\frac{\partial L}{\partial f^{(1)}} = G_{1}(x_1) - \lambda_{1}x_{1} - \lambda_2 = 0$ $\frac{\partial L}{\partial f^{(2)}} = G_{2}(x_2) - \lambda_{1}x_{2} - \lambda_2 = 0$ which yields: $(*) f^{(1)}\left[G_{1}'(x_1) - \lambda_1 \right] = 0$ $(**) f^{(2)}\left[G_{2}'(x_2) - \lambda_1 \right]= 0 $ $(\***) G_{1}(x_1) - G_{2}(x_2) = \lambda_1 \left[ x_1 - x_2\right]$ Because $f^{(1)}$ and $f^{(2)}$ are not to be zero, from (*) and (**) we have that $G_{1}'(x_1) = G_{2}'(x_2) = \lambda_{1}.$ And, a manipulation of equation (***) looks like $\frac{G_{1}(x_1) -G_{2}(x_2)}{x_1 - x_2} = \lambda_{1}.$ Now, think of $G_{i}$ as an even degree polynomial (which it isn't, but
it's graph sometimes resembles one) in the plane.  Let the points $x_1$
and $x_2$ be locations along the x-axis that lie roughly below the
minima of this curve.  The constraints (*),(**), and (***) describe the
condition that the line drawn between $(x_1,G_{1}(x_1))$ and $(x_2,G_{2}(x_2))$ form a common tangent
to the ""wells"" of the curve.  It is these points $x_1$ and $x_2$,
which represent concentrations of pure components in our alloy, that
become mapped onto a phase diagram.  It is essentially by repeating this procedure for many
temperatures that we can trace out the boundaries in the desired phase diagram. The question is: Looking at this from a purely analytic geometry
perspective, how would one derive the ""variational"" approach to find a common tangent line that we seem to have found using the above Lagrangian? (warning: I don't really know how to
model things using variational methods.) And, secondly: I have presented a model of a binary alloy, meaning
two variables to keep track of representing concentrations.  I have
been working on ternary alloys, where this free energy $\widetilde{G}$
is a function of three variables (two independent: $x_1,x_2,x_3$,
where $x_3 = 1- x_1 - x_2$) and is therefore a surface over a Gibbs
triangle.  Then $\nabla L = 0$ produces partial derivatives that no
longer ""speak geometry"" to me, although the solution is a common tangent
plane.  (I have attempted to characterize a common tangent plane
based purely in analytic geometry - completely disregarding the
Lagrangian - and have come up with several relations between
directional derivatives... How might directional derivatives relate
to the optimality conditions set forth by the Lagrangian? ) EDIT: Thank you Greg Graviton for wading through this sub-optimal notation and pointing out several mistakes in the statement of the problem.

After all, this doesn't hold for functions from $\mathbb R ^2$ to $\mathbb R ^2$. Can anyone explain what is different about complex numbers?",['complex-analysis']
655,Proof for multiplying generating functions,"I've learned that multiplying two generating functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ will give the result \begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left(\sum_{j=0}^k a_j\,b_{k-j}\right)x^k.
\end{equation*} I've used the result, but it was presented in my class without proof and I'm having some trouble tracking one down.  Weak google-foo today, I suppose.  Can anyone give me a pointer to a proof?  If this is a question better answered in book form, that is fine as well.","['generating-functions', 'sequences-and-series']"
656,How can I write an equation that matches any sequence?,"One thing I have been wondering about lately is how to write an equation that describes a pattern of numbers. What I mean is: x   0    1    2 
y   1    5    9 If I have this, I can tell that an equation that describes this would be $y=4x+1$ . In fact, I don't even need the third pair of numbers. It's very easy when the equation is a straight line. But when the equation is a parabola, its not always that easy. For example: x   0    1    2 
y   1    2    5 I can tell this is $ y=x^2+1$ , because I recognize the pattern. But I can't always tell just by looking at the numbers what the right equation should be. Is there some way to always know the right equation? I know that if you get the $x=0$ term you can get the $c$ in $y=ax^2+bx+c$ , but that's not enough to let me solve it like I can when the equation is just a line. For example, can someone show me how you would do it for x    0     1     2
y    5     4     7 It's not a homework question, I promise!",['algebra-precalculus']
664,Finding Moment of Inertia (Rotational Inertia?) $I$ Using Integration?,"I just came back from my Introduction to Rotational Kinematics class, and one of the important concepts they described was Rotational Inertia , or Moment of Inertia . It's basically the equivalent of mass in Netwon's $F = m a$ in linear motion.  The equivalent rotational equation is $\tau = I \alpha$ , where $\tau$ is rotational force, $\alpha$ is rotational acceleration, and $I$ is rotational inertia. For a point about an axis, $I$ is $m r^2$ , where $r$ is the distance from the point to the axis of rotation. For a continuous body, this is an integral -- $I = \int r^2 \,dm$ . This really doesn't make any sense to me...you have two independent variables?  I am only used to having one independent variable and one constant.  So I would solve this, using my experience with calculus (which encompasses a read through the Sparks Notes packet) as $ I = m r^2 $ . But obviously, this is wrong? $r$ is not a constant!  How do I deal with it?  Do I need to replace $r$ with an expression that varies with $m$ ?  But how could $r$ possibly vary with $m$ ?  Isn't it more likely the other way around?  But how can $m$ vary with $r$ ?  It's all rather confusing me. Could someone help me figure out what to do with all these substitutions for, example, figuring out the Moment of Inertia of a hoop with no thickness and width $w$ , with the axis of rotation running through its center orthogonal to its plane?","['calculus', 'physics']"
667,Stacks are just sheaves up to Isomorphism,"I have heard that one can think of stacks on a site as taking sheaves but instead of the restrictions being equal, we just loosen it to isomorphic, and treat the sheaf conditions with the ""obvious"" coherence relations. How seriously can one take this analogy? Note that my background is stacks is feeble at best. I hope this question isn't too vague. One may choose to respond to this question with ""That analogy is stupid because of __ gotcha"". Thanks in advance!","['algebraic-geometry', 'intuition']"
668,What's an intuitive way to think about the determinant?,"In my linear algebra class, we just talked about determinants. So far I’ve been understanding the material okay, but now I’m very confused. I get that when the determinant is zero, the matrix doesn’t have an inverse. I can find the determinant of a $2\times 2$ matrix by the formula. Our teacher showed us how to compute the determinant of an $n \times n$ matrix by breaking it up into the determinants of smaller matrices. Apparently there is a way by summing over a bunch of permutations. But the notation is really hard for me and I don’t really know what’s going on with them anymore. Can someone help me figure out what a determinant is, intuitively, and how all those definitions of it are related?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'intuition', 'determinant']"
671,"When you randomly shuffle a deck of cards, what is the probability that it is a unique permutation never before configured?","I just came back from a class on Probability in Game Theory, and was musing over something in my head. Assuming, for the sake of the question: Playing cards in their current state have been around for approximately eight centuries A deck of playing cards is shuffled to a random configuration one billion times per day Every shuffle ever is completely (theoretically) random and unaffected by biases caused by human shuffling and the games the cards are used for By ""deck of cards"", I refer to a stack of unordered $52$ unique cards, with a composition that is identical from deck to deck. This would, approximately, be on the order of $3 \cdot 10^{14}$ random shuffles in the history of playing cards. If I were to shuffle a new deck today, completely randomly, what are the probabilistic odds (out of $1$) that you create a new unique permutation of the playing cards that has never before been achieved in the history of $3 \cdot 10^{14}$ similarly random shuffles? My first thought was to think that it was a simple matter of $\frac{1}{52!} \cdot 3 \cdot 10^{14}$, but then I ran into things like Birthday Paradox .  While it is not analogous (I would have to be asking about the odds that any two shuffled decks in the history of shuffled decks ever matched), it has caused me to question my intuitive notions of Probability. What is wrong in my initial approach, if it is wrong? What is the true probability? And, if the probability is less than $0.5$, if we how many more years (centuries?) must we wait, assuming the current rate of one billion shuffles per day, until we reach a state where the probability is $0.5$+?   $0.9$+? (Out of curiosity, it would be neat to know the analogous birthday paradox answer, as well)",['probability']

676,Probability that a stick randomly broken in two places can form a triangle,"Randomly break a stick (or a piece of dry spaghetti, etc.) in two places, forming three pieces.  The probability that these three pieces can form a triangle is $\frac14$ (coordinatize the stick form $0$ to $1$, call the breaking points $x$ and $y$, consider the unit square of the coordinate plane, shade the areas that satisfy the triangle inequality edit : see comments on the question, below, for a better explanation of this). The other day in class * , my professor was demonstrating how to do a Monte Carlo simulation of this problem on a calculator and wrote a program that, for each trial did the following: Pick a random number $x$ between $0$ and $1$.  This is the first side length. Pick a random number $y$ between $0$ and $1 - x$ (the remaning part of the stick).  This is the second side length. The third side length is $1 - x - y$. Test if the three side lengths satisfy the triangle inequality (in all three permutations). He ran around $1000$ trials and was getting $0.19$, which he said was probably just random-chance error off $0.25$, but every time the program was run, no matter who's calculator we used, the result was around $0.19$. What's wrong with the simulation method?  What is the theoretical answer to the problem actually being simulated? ( * the other day was more than $10$ years ago)","['monte-carlo', 'probability']"
