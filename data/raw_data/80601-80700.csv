1042788,Smallest Convex Hulls ($n$-Simplex) of $n+2$ Points in $\mathbb{R}^n$,"""Given $n$, find the minimal value of $k$ with the following property: Any $k$ (distinct) points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets so that the intersection of the convex hulls of the two partitions is not empty."" A convex hull of a set is the ""smallest"" convex set which contains the set. A convex set $C$ is one in which $\forall x,y \in C$, $\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y \in C$ for $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$. For instance, in $\mathbb{R}$, suppose we have three points, $a,b,c$ with $a < b < c$. Then let $a$ and $c$ be in one partition and $b$ in the other. Clearly, the convex hull of $\{a,c\}$ is the line segment which indeed passes $b$. In $\mathbb{R}^2$, I think $k=4$. We have four cases: Case 1: All four points $a,b,c,d$ are collinear. Then the partitions can be $\{a,c\}$ and $\{b,d\}$ and their convex hulls clearly have non empty intersection. Case 2: Three of the points are collinear, say $a,b,c,$ with $b$ between $a$ and $c$. Point $d$ is elsewhere. Then let the partitions again be $\{a,c\}$ and $\{b,d\}$. Case 3: The four points form the vertices of a convex quadrilateral. Then let the convex hulls be the ""diagonals"". Case 4: The four points form the vertices of a concave quadrilateral. Then three of the points form the vertices of a triangle and the fourth point would be inside that. The convex hull of $\{a,b,c\}$ is exactly that triangle. I conjecture that $k=n+2$. I think that the convex hull of $n+1$ points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the $n$-simplex (I don't know if that's the right notation). We can always form a simplex with $n+1$ points and then have the last point be floating around. If that point is within the simplex (conjectured convex hull), then we are done. If it's outside it, we can sort of divide up the space based on the ""faces"" of our simplex. For instance, in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we have five points. We can build a tetrahedron with four of the points. The tetrahedron will have four faces which can be extended to be four planes, dividing up the $\mathbb{R}^3$. Each plane cuts the space into two. So if our fifth point is on one side of the face, then there is an associated vertex of the tetrahedron on the other side. We can let that vertex and this fifth point be in a partition and the other three points in the other. Thus, we have a line segment passing through a triangle. If there's problems with the point being in the plane of one of the faces, I think we can still account for that case simply by forming a triangle and line segment. But beyond $\mathbb{R}^n$, it isn't obvious to me how to prove or disprove the conjecture. I think the solution shouldn't require anything but rather elementary (not necessarily easy or simple, just techniques that a undergraduate or even high school student might recognize) methods. I don't actually know any algebraic geometry but I know that simplices and affine geometry has something to do with the problem; hence the tags. Any ideas for solving this problem are welcome and appreciated.","['geometry', 'convex-geometry']"

1042805,"Duals of representations of affine group schemes, in particular $\mathrm{GL}_n$","Duals of representations of affine group schemes Let $R$ be a commutative ring. If $G$ is a group and $V$ is a dualizable i.e. finitely generated projective $R$-module on which $G$ acts, then it is known that $G$ also acts on the dual module $V^*$ via $(g \omega)(v)=\omega(g^{-1} v)$ and that $V^*$ becomes the dual in the tensor category of representations of $G$ over $R$. Now I wonder if there is something similar for group schemes? (This should be a special case of Prop. 1.3.4 in Hovey's Homotopy theory for comodules over a Hopf algebroid .) So if $G$ is an affine group scheme over $R$ and $V$ is a dualizable $R$-module on which $G$ acts (i.e. we have natural group homomorphisms $G(A) \to \mathrm{Aut}_A(V \otimes_R A)$ for commutative $R$-algebras $A$), how to construct a dual representation $V^*$? Here is my guess: Take the dual module $V^*$. There is a group anti-homomorphism $\mathrm{Aut}_A(V \otimes_R A) \to \mathrm{Aut}_A(V^* \otimes_R A)$ which maps a linear map to its dual. The inversion map is a group anti-homomorphism $G(A) \to G(A)$. Composition yields a group homomorphism $G(A) \to \mathrm{Aut}_A(V^* \otimes_R A)$. Can someone confirm this? Specifically, how does this look like if $G=\mathrm{GL}_n$ and $V$ is the standard representation of rank $n$ (i.e. $R^n$ with obvious action)? The underlying $R$-module of $V^*$ will be $R^n$ (just as for $V$), but the action will be some non-trivial homomorphism $\mathrm{GL}_n(A) \to \mathrm{GL}_n(A)$ - which one? Out of curiosity, is there a classification of all homomorphisms of group schemes $\mathrm{GL}_n \to \mathrm{GL}_n$?","['algebraic-geometry', 'representation-theory', 'reference-request']"
1042808,are there different notions of 'boundary' in the manifold sense and the topological space sense?,"this seemingly innocent question has been bugging me for quite a while. Lets give a minimal example: The unit circle S has no boundary considered as a manifold (all points have neighborhoods homeomorphic to R). This coincides with the notion of the topological boundary when using the topology induced by the charts (as the entire circle is then open, its interior is its closure). Moreover, this topology coincides with the topology induced onto the circle as a subspace of RÂ² Now we turn to the unit interval [0,1]. Considered as a manifold, its boundary are 0 and 1 as these points are only homeomorphic to the semiopen intervals. But of course, any topology that considers [0,1] as its own space and not as a subset of R must have [0,1] open, which leads to the vanishing of its boundary in the topological sense. So i have failed to construct any topology on [0,1] in a way thats consistent with the one on the circle that would allow me to say 'the circle has no boundary, the unit interval does', unless i accept that we always talk about the manifold boundary, which must be different from the boundary of the manifold in a topological sense (in which case, using the same word for those two concepts does not exactly feel optimal to me, cosidering differential geometry and topology are so closely related). can any one confirm or explain me where i went wrong here?

1042814,A theorem from the theory of groups,"Let $K$ be a (not necessarily normal) subgroup of the group $G$ : $K < G$ A fixed element $g\in G$ can act, from the left, on all elements of $G$, thus generating a bijection of $\,G\,$ onto itself:  $\,g:\,g'\rightarrow gg'\,$. Thereby each $g\in G$ also generates a mapping ${\hat{{L}}}_g\colon g'K \rightarrow (gg')K$, which is a bijection of the factor space $\,G/K\,$ onto itself:
$$g\colon G\rightarrow G \implies \hat{L}_g\colon G/K \rightarrow G/K.$$ Let $\mathbb{L}$ be the entire set of operators $\hat{L}_g$, for all elements $g$. Then the above formula becomes:
$$\mathbb{L}\colon G \rightarrow \operatorname{Aut_{set}}(G/K) ,$$ where $\operatorname{Aut_{set}}(G/K)$ denotes all bijections of $G/K$ onto itself. The subscript emphasises that  $G/K$ is being mapped onto itself as a set, not as a group. (Recall that $K$ is not necessarily a normal subgroup, so $G/K$ is not required to be a group.) Be mindful that, while each mapping ${\hat{{L}}}_g\colon g'K \rightarrow (gg')K$ is bijection, the mapping $\,\mathbb{L}\colon G \rightarrow \operatorname{Aut_{set}}(G/K)\,$ is not even a surjection, because the surjections $\,{\hat{{L}}}_g\,$ make only a subset of the entire set $\operatorname{Aut_{set}}(G/K)$. I need to prove the following: Theorem. $\mathbb{L}$ is a monomorphism (i.e. $\ker\mathbb{L}=1$)
  if and only if $K$ contains no proper invariant subgroups of $G$. Proving this in one direction is relatively simple, and I shall now show how to do this. Proving the inverse has turned out to be less trivial, and this is where I shall ask for your help. Here is the one-way proof. Let $H$ be is the set of all elements in $G$, which leave each coset of $G/K$ invariant:
$$H\equiv \ker\mathbb{L}.$$ Then the following five facts will take place: $H$ is a group. This is trivial. $H\subset K$. This is because $H$ leaves all cosets $gK$ unmoved â including $K$. $H \lhd G$. To see this, take an arbitrary $h\in H$ and then act with $\hat{L}_{g^{-1}hg}$ on some $g'K$. Instead of $\hat{L}_{g^{-1}hg}$, I write simply $g^{-1}hg$:
$$(g^{-1}hg)g'K = g^{-1} h (gg'K) = g^{-1} (gg'K) = g'K ,$$
where we kept in mind that $h\in H$, so $h$ must stabilise any coset $gg'K$. The above formula demonstrates that $g^{-1}hg$ stabilises any $g'K$, so $g^{-1}hg\in H$. In other words, $g^{-1}Hg=H$. $H$ is the maximal normal subgroup of $G$, contained in $K$. Suppose there exists a bigger normal subgroup $H'$ contained in $K$:
$$H<H'<K,\quad H\lhd G, \quad H'\lhd G.$$
Consider a group element $x$ which is in $H'$ but not in $H$. The latter implies that $\hat{L}_x$ does not stabilise $G/K$:
$$x\in H',x \notin H \implies \exists g, xgK\neq gK,$$
or, the same:
$$\exists k\in K,xgk\notin gK\iff g^{-1}xgk\notin K,$$
the latter being in contradiction with the proposition that $H'\lhd G$. If $G$ is isomorphic to its image in $\operatorname{Aut_{set}}(G/K)$, then $H\equiv \ker\mathbb{L}=1$ and, therefore, there exist no proper invariant subgroups of $G$, contained in $K$. This indeed follows from the item (4) above. So far so good. Now, can someone please help me to prove the inverse to the item (5)? Suppose I know that there are no proper invariant subgroups of $G$, contained in $K$. How to derive from this that $G$ is isomorphic to its image in the group $\operatorname{Aut_{set}}(G/K)$ of operators, induced by $G$ on the quotient space $G/K$? I know that my second question will be ridiculous, but let me nevertheless ask it. When saying that $G$ is isomorphic to its image in the group $\operatorname{Aut_{set}}(G/K)$, we evidently imply that the isomorphism is implemented as follows: we choose some $g\in G$ and presume that it corresponds to $\hat{L}_g \colon g'K\rightarrow (gg')K$. Is it possible to arrange for some different isomorphism, so that $g$ will, generally, not correspond to the operator $\hat{L}_g$ generated by it?  (I am asking this, because the trivial isomorphism rendered $\ker{\mathbb{L}}=1$, which may not be the case for a nontrivial isomorphism if one exists.)

Bochner, Integration It is related to: Bochner Integral: Integrability Definition Given a measure space $\Omega$ and a Banach space $E$. Consider Bochner measurable functions $S_n\to F$. Suppose Bochner integrability as $\int\|F\|\mathrm{d}\mu<\infty$. Denote the abstract Bochner integral by $\int F\mathrm{d}\mu$. Define the Bochner integral axiomatically by:
$$\text{(L)}\quad\int(F+G)\mathrm{d}\mu=\int F\mathrm{d}\mu+\int F\mathrm{d}\mu,\,\int\lambda F\mathrm{d}\mu=\lambda\int F\mathrm{d}\mu$$
$$\text{(N)}:\quad\left\|\int F\mathrm{d}\mu\right\|\leq\int\|F\|\mathrm{d}\mu$$

$$\text{(C)}:\quad\int C\mathrm{d}\mu=C\mu(\Omega)$$ Construction This forces the integral for simple functions to become:
$$S=\sum_{k=1}^KS_k\chi(A_k):\quad\int S\mathrm{d}\mu=\sum_{k=1}^KS_k\mu(A_k)$$ Now, for Bochner measurable functions Bochner integrability should determine the integral, too:

If the dominated convergence theorem is to be applied, taking the derivative
has to be expressed as the limit of the difference quotient: $\int_{\mathcal{X}} sup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \frac{L(\vartheta + \frac{1}{n}, x)-L(\vartheta, x)}{\frac{1}{n}} \mu(dx)<\infty \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(3)$ But i don't understand how i get from here to (a one-dimensional version of) equation (2).
Can somebody provide the missing steps? Edit: 
Ok i got it. In equation (3) the mean value theorem alows to replace the difference quotient with the derivative w.r.t. $\vartheta$ evaluated at some $\vartheta^*\;  \in\; [\vartheta, \vartheta+\frac{1}{n}]$.

Clearly there are many counterexamples like $\prod_{i \in \omega}\mathbb{Z}_i$ or $ \oplus_{i \in \omega}\mathbb{Z}_i$ but these counterexamples can be bypassed by giving a definition. We say that a group G is $\Pi$-compact iff $$G \cong \prod_{i\in I}G_i, \  G_i \neq \{e\} \ \Rightarrow |I| < \infty.$$ We say that a group G is $\Sigma$-compact iff $$G \cong \oplus_{i\in I}G_i, \  G_i \neq \{e\} \ \Rightarrow |I| < \infty.$$ We say that a group is $\times$-compact iff it's $\Pi$ and $\Sigma$ compact. I've been working on many conjectures and with Seirios' help many of them have been solved. I'll tick ($\checkmark$) proved ones and refuse ($\neg$) false ones. $$\checkmark? \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \  G_1,G_2 \times\text{-compact} \Rightarrow G_1 \times G_2 \times\text{-compact}  $$

$$\neg \ \ \ \ \ G \times\text{-compact} \Rightarrow \text{cancellation property holds}.$$ What's clearly true is that: finite groups are $\times$-compact (and I've seen on the web that cancellation property holds for them), simple groups are $\times$-compact, free groups are $\times$-compact . Applying $(3) \wedge (4)$ on free groups we may get (2) but $(3) \wedge (4)$ have to be false because any group is quotient of a free group.
$$ \neg ( (3) \wedge (4)).$$
As Seirios has observed for countable groups it holds that $\times$-compact $\Leftrightarrow$ $\Sigma$-compact.
Again Seirios noted, here is proved that cancellation is not true for finitely presented groups so if (2) is true (5) is false. $$ (2) \Rightarrow \neg (5)  $$ Seirios proved (2) here . A sketch of proof for (1).
Let's assume that $G_1 \times G_2$ is not $\times$-compact. So $G_1 \times G_2 \cong \prod_{i\in \nu}P_i$. Let's call $\pi_1$ projection on first coordinate. So $G_1\cong \pi_1 (G_1 \times G_2) \cong \pi_1(\prod P_i) \cong \prod (\pi_1 P_i)$ so finitely many $P_i$ are not in $\{0\} \times G_2$. Same argument on the other side rise to absurd $\square.$
Is this correct? I have a counterexample for (4). Let's consider $G:=*_{i \in \omega}\mathbb{Z}_i$ Since it's free it's $\times$-compact. Its commutator [G,G] is $\times$-compact but quotient $$G/[G,G] \cong \oplus_{i \in \omega} \mathbb{Z} $$ which is not $\times$-compact.

1043083,Borel algebra is generated by the collection of all half-open intervals,"This question is based on the following from Elements of Integration and Lebesgue Measure by Bartle. We are given the following example and exercise: Let X be the set ${\mathbf R}$ of real numbers. The Borel algebra is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by all open intervals $(a,b)$ in ${\mathbf R}$. Observe that the Borel algebra ${\mathbf B}$ is also the $\sigma$-algebra generated by all closed intervals $[a,b]$ in ${\mathbf R}$ Exercise 2.B. Show that the Borel algebra ${\mathbf B}$ is also generated by the collection of all half-open intervals $(a,b]=\{x\in {\mathbf R}: a<x\leqslant b\}$ The definition of sigma algebras we are given is that they are unions and complements of a family of sets on a universal set $X$. My thought on the way to solve this was to use something like
$$
(a,b)=\cup_{n=1}^\infty[a+1/n,b-1/n]
$$
and similarly
$$
(a,b)=\cup_{n=1}^\infty(a,b-1/n]
$$
to show that we can construct $(a,b)$ as a union of either the closed or the half-open intervals.

1043133,How can I infer order from partially ordered discrete sequences?,"A really interesting problem that I can't stop thinking about! Have run in to this a couple of times but yet to find a smart approach to either solve or frame this problem. This is my try at generalizing it: Assume that we have an application where a user in each session can make one or many actions, each of those actions falls into the categories, say $\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\}$. In one of the sessions the user makes some kind of 'defining action' that leads to termination of the sequence, in most cases terminating it immediately but there are occasionaly actions even afterwards. Aim: We want to classify users according to which their 'defining' action was Variables $\mathcal{O}$= the order of the actions ( Unknown ) $S$= Session of the action $\mathcal{D}$= binary, '1' indicating the 'defining action' ( Unknown ) $W$= binary, '1' indicating that the 'defining' action was made in this session $A$= Type of action Data We have data for some large amount of $N$ users. Example of data for a user that should be classified as type 'c', where 
$W=1$ marked in red: \begin{array}{c|c|c|c} 
\hline 
\mathcal{O}& S& \mathcal{D}& W & A &\\ \hline 
1&1& 0&0&a\\ \hline 
2&2& 0&0&e\\ \hline 
\color{red}{3} &\color{red}{3} &\color{red}{0}&\color{red}{1}& \color{red}{b}\\ \hline 
\color{red}{4} &\color{red}{3} &\color{red}{1}&\color{red}{1}& \color{red}{c}\\ \hline 
5&4& 0&0&a\\ \hline 
6&5& 0&0&f\\ \hline 
\end{array} Problem: We would only need $\mathcal{D}$ together with $A$ to conclude that this user is of category 'c'  but $\mathcal{D}$ is not known explicitly. When there's only one action done in the session where the the determining action was taken $W$ is identically $\mathcal{D}$. This is the fact in most of the cases. Here on the other hand we only know which session the decision was taken so for all we know the user can either be classified as a ' b '- or ' c '- user. Illustrated below In most cases only one action per session is made so $\mathcal{D}=W$ in each case and thus the defining action is known. There is some a set of unknown rules in what sequences of actions can lead to particular defining actions. For example; "" b cannot be the determining action if action a followed by e has been taken'. Those rules are not followed consistently, there's some random variation. And in particular, they are unknown. We assume that the event that some sessions has multiple actions is randomly distributed. How can I approach trying to infer which the defining decision is for each user based upon my observations? Preferrably I'd get some model assigning membership scores/probabilites for each category given data. Why is this interesting? This is a terminating sequence of varying length wich we can only observe as a partially ordered set. Usually one can use domain knowledge/theory to infer this order. When there are no such knowledge one can sometimes use exploratory analysis to figure it out. That is not always possible due to complexity and is inherently biased and timeconsuming.

1043309,Writing $G/A\times G/B$ explicitly as union of orbits,"Let $G$ be a finite abelian group, and let $A$ and $B$ be subgroups. I'm interested in $G/A\times G/B$ with its natural $G$-set structure. In $G/A\times G/B$, the stabilizer of any element is $A\cap B$, so by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, there is a decomposition into orbits like this:
$$G/A\times G/B \cong \coprod (G/A\cap B)$$
However, I would like to make this isomorphism of $G$-sets explicit - that is, I want to find a natural choice of elements $\{x_1,\ldots,x_k\}$ of $G/A\times G/B$ whose orbits are the copies of $G/A\cap B$:
$$G/A\times G/B=Gx_1\sqcup \cdots \sqcup Gx_k,\quad\text{each }Gx_i\cong G/A\cap B\text{ as $G$-sets}$$
For example, suppose that $G$ is cyclic. Let's say $$G = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} = \{\overline{0},\overline{1},\ldots,\overline{n-1}\},\quad A=a\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},\quad B=b\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$$
Then it's easy to see that
$$k=\frac{[G:A][G:B]}{[G:A\cap B]} = \frac{ab}{\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)}=\gcd(a,b)$$
and that (by the Chinese remainder theorem) a good choice of representatives is

I think the claim is true, but, up to now, I have been able to prove only the following fact (for $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{R}$), using Hahn-Banach's extension Theorem: for every real number $\lambda$ with $-1\leq \lambda \leq 1$, there exists a linear extension $h_{\lambda}$ of the limit functional to the whole $\ell^{\infty}$ such that, for all $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ and any convergent sequence $x\in c$, if $y$ is the sequence $((-1)^{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, then $$h_{\lambda}(ay+x)=a\lambda +\lim(x)\leq \limsup(ay+x).$$
In particular, there are uncountably many linear extension of the limit functional. I can not prove that at least two of these are continuous though. Can someone help me solving this problem with a worked solution? (I have looked for Banach limits around, but I have not found an explicit proof of non uniqueness of such continuous extensions of the limit extension).

Since any two vertices of C are connected by a path of length at most 3 on C, any additional edge with endpoints on C would create a cycle of length at most 4. Hence the third neighbor of each vertex on C is not on C. Thus there are seven edges from V(C) to the remaining three vertices. By the pigeonhole principle, one of the remaining vertices receives at least three of these edges. This vertex x not on C has three neighbors on C. For any three vertices on C, either two are adjacent or two have a common neighbor on C (again the pigeonhole principle applies). Using x, this completes a cycle of length at most 4. We have shown that the assumption of a 7-cycle leads to a contradiction.

where k is an integer with k â¥ 15. To complete the inductive step, we assume that we can form
postage of j cents, where 12 â¤ j â¤ k. We need to show that under the assumption that P (k + 1)
is true, we can also form postage of k + 1 cents. Using the inductive hypothesis, we can assume
that P (k â 3) is true because k â 3 â¥ 12, that is, we can form postage of k â 3 cents using
just 4-cent and 5-cent stamps. To form postage of k + 1 cents, we need only add another 4-cent

Gauss gave an explicit formula for $K$ which only depends on $E,F,G$ and their derivatives, where $E,F,G$ are the matrix elements of the metric. Because of the independence of the embedding, it makes sense to study surfaces in their own right, i.e. not being embedded into $\mathbb{R}^3$, right? What I don't understand is that $E,F,G$ are coming from the metric upstairs. How could someone living on this surface calculate the curvature using this formula? That would mean they know $E,F,G$ which would mean they know the embedding, which means they know that there exists some higher dimensional space. A person living on a surface doesn't know of the third dimension. To them, their world is a 2 dimensional plane, right? So to them they would always measure distance the standard way, using $dx^2+dy^2$. This person could perhaps calculate the interior angles of a triangle and see that the sum is not $180$, but that's not using the formula for $K$. It seems that a person in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is calculating the induced metric and saying this is the metric on the surface. But a person on the surface thinks they live in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and so are using a metric that has no dependence on the $z$-coordinate. How does a person on the surface calculate the Gaussian curvature of their world?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
1044264,Projections of a rational normal curve of $\mathbb{P}^4$ (Exercise 3.9 in Harris' _Algebraic Geometry_),"In exercise 3.9 of his Algebraic Geometry book, Prof. Harris asks to show that the rational quartic curves $$C_{a,b}=[X^4-aX^3Y,X^3Y-aX^2Y^2,bX^2Y^2-XY^3,bXY^3-Y^4]$$ are projections of a rational normal curve of $\mathbb{P}^4$ from points $p_{a,b}$. I managed easily to show that indeed the projections of the rational normal curve of  $\mathbb{P}^4$ $$[X^4,X^3Y,X^2Y^2,XY^3,Y^4]$$ from the points $$p_{a,b}=(a^2,a,1,b,b^2)$$ to the hyperplane $$\mathbb{P}^3=[Z_0,Z_1,Z_3,Z_4]$$ give rational quartics projectively equivalent to the family $C_{a,b}$, but I failed to find projections of a rational normal curve of  $\mathbb{P}^4$ from points parametrized by $a$ and $b$ on hyperplanes that give exactly the quartic curve $C_{a,b}$.

1044278,A specific kind of probabilistic proof for central binomial coefficients,"I'm looking for a specific kind of proof of the statement
$$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac1{4^n}\binom{2n}{n} = 0 $$
I know how to show this using Stirling's formula; I have seen the very nice elementary estimates in this question which imply this limit; and I am aware of the proofs of this limit in this question .  None of these are quite what I'm looking for right now. What I want is a probabilistic proof which establishes a general upper bound on $P(X=EX)$, or perhaps $P(|X-EX|<t)$, in terms of some statistical parameters of the random variable $X$, and then applies that result for $X\sim B(2n,\frac12)$.  For example, something like: If $X$ is a random variable with $\operatorname{Var} X>0$ and $a\le X\le b$ a.s., then $P(X=EX)\le$ (something in terms of $\operatorname{Var} X$, $a$, and $b$). This particular formulation cannot work, because the random variable $Y$ with $P(Y=0)=P(Y=2n)=\frac1{8n}$ and $P(Y=n)=1-\frac1{4n}$ has the same variance and a.s. bounds as a variable with distribution $B(2n,\frac12)$, but $P(Y=EY)\to 1$. Is there something in the same spirit that does work?","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'binomial-coefficients']"
1044329,An inequality related to the cosine theorem,"Let $A,B,C$ be the three angles in the a triangle (with length $a,b,c$). Can we show that 
$$x^2+y^2+z^2\geq 2x y \cos A+2xz\cos B+2yz\cos C?$$
for all $x,y,z\in\Bbb R$. I do not see whether it is true, but I find it in some book. I suspect it is false. My idea is that if $x=a$, $y=b$, $z=c$, then the cosine theorem implies that the inequality is in fact equality...
Hence the matrix 
$$\begin{pmatrix}1&-\cos A&-\cos B\\-\cos A&1&-\cos C\\ -\cos B&-\cos C&1\end{pmatrix}$$
is positive semidefinite. 
However, there may be some minors (say $-\cos A$) be negative, contradicting to the fact that $M$ is positive semi-definite $\Leftrightarrow$ all minors $\geq 0$...","['geometry', 'inequality', 'vectors', 'triangles', 'linear-algebra']"

1044358,How do I succinctly note the sum of $(n-1)+(n-2)+...$?,"I was playing with numbers and wanted to see how many possible connections there are in a network of $n$ nodes. I found that the answer was equal to the number of nodes minus one, plus the number of nodes minus two, until zero because each node can connect to every other node ($n-1$ other nodes), but then since this is undirected, each subsequent node already defined that connection, so the second node can only connect to $n-2$ nodes. So, a network of $5$ nodes has $10$ connections â $\quad4+3+2+1$.
This looks very similar to factorials, and I figured there was some simplified form for representing this. If not, how would I express this in sigma notation? Forgive my ignorance and also note I've found that the interconnectivity of a network can be defined with $n(n-1)/2$ (or not divided by 2 for directed edges), and my question is about notation, not graphs.","['notation', 'graph-theory', 'summation', 'combinatorics']"

  of a differential operator is well-defined comes from the fact that the commutator
  of two vector fields is again a vector field. Why is this remark even needed? Did we not define $\operatorname{Diff}^n(M)$ in a coordinate-independent way?

1044432,probability matching strategy for coin flips,"imagine a betting game where we observe $N$ independent coin flips $x_1,...,x_n$ (where each $x_i \in {H,T}$) from the same coin, whose true weight is $\theta$. the task is to predict how many Heads we will get in the next $M$ flips of the same coin. the closer you are to the true number of heads, the higher your payoff will be. as example, the reward may be $r/(abs(Guess_H - True_H) + 1)$ where $Guess_H$ is your guess for number of Heads on next $M$ flips, $True_H$ is actual number of Heads in the next $M$ flips, and $r$ is some value $r > 1$. what is the optimal strategy? how do you show formally which of the two following strategies is better? strategy 1: estimate coin weight $\theta$ from $N$ first flips. if $\theta > 0.5$, predict all Heads for next $M$ flips ($M$ Heads), if $\theta < 0.5$, predict all Tails for next $M$ flips (0 Heads). strategy 2: estimate coin weight $\theta$ from $N$ first flips. predict $\theta*M$ many heads for next $M$ flips. which strategy is better? can this be shown formally? attempt: expected reward for strategy 1 : assume $\theta = 0.75, M = 10$ $E(reward|strategy 1) = Binomial(10; 10, 0.75)*r$ expected reward for strategy 2 : $E(reward|strategy 2) = Binomial(0.75 * 10; 10, 0.75)*r$ this shows that for this case, strategy 2 is better, since: $Binomial(0.75 * 10; 10, 0.75) > Binomial(10; 10, 0.75)$ how can this be shown analytically and in general, not assuming particular values for $M$ and the true $\theta$?","['bayesian', 'decision-theory', 'statistics', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

1044479,Question about generalized version of Second Borel-Cantelli lemma,"I was reading the Durrett's book and encounter some questions about the proof of generalized version of the second Borel-Cantelli lemma:
Here is the setting: Second Borel-Cantelli lemma, II. Let $\mathcal F_n, n \ge 0$ be a filtration
  with $F_0 = \{\emptyset, \Omega\}$ and $A_n , n \ge 1$ a sequence of events with $A_n â \mathcal F_n$ . Then
  $$
\{A_n \,i.o.\} = \left\{\sum_{n \ge 1} P (A_n |\mathcal F_{nâ1}) =\infty \right\}.
$$ The proof use the following fact:  a bounded increments martingale either converge of oscillate between $\pm \infty$; i.e., Let $X_1,X_2...,$ be a martingale with $|X_{n+1} - X_n| \le M < \infty$. Let
\begin{array}{l}
C: = \left\{ {\mathop {\lim }\limits_n {X_n}\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{}
\end{array}{\rm{exists}}\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{}
\end{array}{\rm{and}}\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{}
\end{array}{\rm{is}}\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{}
\end{array}{\rm{finite}}} \right\}\\
D: = \left\{ {\mathop {\lim \sup }\limits_n {X_n} = \infty \begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{}
\end{array}{\rm{and}}\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{}
\end{array}\mathop {\lim \inf }\limits_n {X_n} =  - \infty } \right\}
\end{array}
Then, $P(C \cup D) =1$. Hence, from the Durrett's proof of second Borel-Cantelli lemma, we first define 
$${X_n}: = \sum\limits_{m = 1}^n {{1_{{A_m}}}}  - \sum\limits_{m = 1}^n {P({A_m}|{F_{m - 1}})} $$
Then this $X_n$ is a bounded increments martingale with $|X_n - X_{n-1}| \le 2$. Hence,
apply the fact, we can split to two cases: case 1: for the event $C$, $$ \left\{ {{A_n}\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{}
\end{array}i.o.} \right\} = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {{1_{{A_n}}}}  = \infty  \Leftrightarrow \sum\limits_{m = 1}^n {P({A_m}|{F_{m - 1}})}  = \infty $$ case 2: for the event $D$,  $$\left\{ {{A_n}\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{}
\end{array}i.o.} \right\} = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {{1_{{A_n}}}}  = \infty \; \text{  and  } \; \sum\limits_{m = 1}^\infty {P({A_m}|{F_{m - 1}})} = \infty$$. Since we have $P(C \cup D) =1$, the desired result follows. $\square$ Here is my question: for the event $C$ (case 1): is this because that if $\{A_n i.o.\} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1_{A_n}=\infty$, but by the definition of $X_n$, we know $${\lim X_n} = \sum\limits_{m = 1}^\infty {{1_{{A_m}}}}  - \sum\limits_{m = 1}^\infty {P({A_m}|{F_{m - 1}})} $$ and since $\lim X_n$ is bounded in this case, we must have $\sum\limits_{m = 1}^\infty {P({A_m}|{F_{m - 1}})} = \infty$ ? Is this thinking process correct? for the event $D$ (case 2): in this case, we have both $\limsup X_n = \infty$ and $\liminf X_n = -\infty$. So, for $\{A_n i.o\}$, I don't see why $\sum\limits_{m = 1}^\infty {P({A_m}|{F_{m - 1}})} = \infty$ also hold because I was thinking that $\infty- \infty$ happens.
