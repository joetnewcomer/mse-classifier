125298,how to strictly prove $\sin x<x$ for $0<x<\frac{\pi}{2}$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Prove the inequality $\frac{\sin(x)}{x}<1$ (4 answers) Closed 1 year ago . $$\sin x<x\,(0<x<\frac{\pi}{2})$$
In most textbooks, to prove this inequality is based on geometry illustration (draw a circle, compare arc length and chord ), but I think that strict proof should be based on analysis reasoning without geometry illustration. Who can prove it? Thank you very much. ps : By differentiation, monotonicity and Taylor formula, all are wrong, because $(\sin x)'=\cos x$ must use $\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{\sin x}{x}=1$, and this formula must use $\sin x< x$. This is vicious circle. If we use Taylor series of $\sin x$ to define $\sin x$, strictly prove $\sin x<x$ is very easy, but how can we obtain geometry meaning of $\sin x$?","['inequality', 'trigonometry', 'calculus']"
125299,Prove that a set consisting of a sequence and its limit point is closed,"Can someone please check whether the following simple proof is ""mathematical""? Is it correct, complete, rigid? Can it be simplified ? I'm a complete autodidact so I'm looking for someone to give me feedback to gain experience in writing proofs... This is also my first question on MSE. The proposition: Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $x_n \to x$ where each $x_n \in X$ and $x \in X$. Let $A$ be the subset of $X$ which consists of $x$ and all of the points $x_n$. Prove that $A$ is closed in $(X, d)$. My tentative to prove this: We first show that all infinite sequences in $A$ converge to $x$: Let $y \in X$, $y \ne x$. Then there is some open ball $B_\epsilon(x)$ with $\epsilon < d(x,y)$ containing all but finitely many elements of $A$. As $y \notin B_\epsilon(x)$ there can be no infinite sequence in $A$ converging to $y$. Consequently all infinite series in $A$ converge to a point in $A$ which therefore must be a closed set. Edited : As rightly pointed out in the comments, I should have written in the first sentence ""...sequences with infinitely many distinct terms and which converge to some point of $X$"" and the last sentence should be ""Consequently all infinite sequences ..."".","['general-topology', 'sequences-and-series', 'proof-writing']"
125306,Combinatorial question about sets of rational numbers,"The following question came up in my research.  Since lots of clever people post here, I thought I'd ask it. Recall that the group ring of a group $G$ is the abelian group $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ consisting of linear combinations of formal symbols $[g]$, where $g$ ranges over elements of $G$ (the abelian group $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ also has an obvious ring structure, but that's not important for this question). Consider the group ring $\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Q}]$ of the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ (considered as an additive group).  There is a natural projection $\pi : \mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Q}] \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}]$.  It has a large kernel; for instance this kernel contains $[n]-[0]$ for integers $n$ and things like $[3/2]-[1/2]$.  There is also a natural involution $i : \mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}] \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}]$ defined by $i([q]) = [1/q]$.  Here by $\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}]$ I just mean formal sums of $[q]$ where $q$ is a nonzero rational number.  We have a natural inclusion $\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}] \subset \mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Q}]$. Question.  What is $\text{ker}(\pi) \cap \text{ker}(\pi \circ i)$?  It clearly contains things like $[1]-[-1]$, but I don't know if it contains any more ""exotic"" elements.","['rational-numbers', 'elementary-number-theory', 'combinatorics']"
125317,"Given a fiber bundle $F\to E\overset{\pi}{\to} B$ such that $F,B$ are compact, is $E$ necessarily compact?","Consider a (locally trivial) fiber bundle $F\to E\overset{\pi}{\to} B$, where $F$ is the fiber, $E$ the total space and $B$ the base space. If $F$ and $B$ are compact, must $E$ be compact? This certainly holds if the bundle is trivial (i.e. $E\cong B\times F$), as a consequence of Tychonoff's theorem. It also holds in all the cases I can think of, such as where $E$ is the Möbius strip, Klein bottle, a covering space and in the more complicated case of $O(n)\to O(n+1)\to \mathbb S^n$ which prompted me to consider this question. I am fairly certain it holds in the somewhat more general case where $F,B$ are closed manifolds. However, I can't seem to find a proof of the general statement. My chief difficulty lies in gluing together the local homeomorphisms to transfer finite covers of $B\times F$ to $E$.

125328,Taylor Expansion of Error Function,"I am working on a question that involves finding the Taylor expansion of the error function. The question is stated as follows The error function is defined by $\mathrm{erf}(x):=\frac {2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{0}^{x} e^{-t^{2}}dt$. Find its Taylor expansion. I know that the Taylor series of the function $f$ at $a$ is given by $$f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac {f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^{n}.$$ However, the question doesn't give a point $a$ with which to center the Taylor series.

125343,Lie group heuristics for a raising operator for $(-1)^n \frac{d^n}{d\beta^n}\frac{x^\beta}{\beta!}|_{\beta=0}$,"Consider the fractional integro-derivative $\displaystyle\frac{d^{\beta}}{dx^\beta}\frac{x^{\alpha}}{\alpha!}=FP\frac{1}{2\pi i}\displaystyle\oint_{|z-x|=|x|}\frac{z^{\alpha}}{\alpha!}\frac{\beta!}{(z-x)^{\beta+1}}dz=FP\displaystyle\int_{0}^{x}\frac{z^{\alpha}}{\alpha!}\frac{(x-z)^{-\beta-1}}{(-\beta-1)!} dz$ $= \displaystyle\frac{x^{\alpha-\beta}}{(\alpha-\beta)!}$ where  FP  denotes a Hadamard-type finite part, $x>0$, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are real. Identify Lie group elements and multiplication as $\displaystyle(\frac{x^{\alpha}}{\alpha!},\frac{x^{\beta}}{\beta!})=FP \displaystyle\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{\alpha}}{\alpha!}\frac{d}{dx}H(x-z)\frac{(x-z)^{\beta}}{\beta!}dz= \frac{x^{\alpha+\beta}}{(\alpha+\beta)!}$ with $H(x)$ as the Heaviside step function. The complex contour integral gives a continuation of the multiplication rule to the identity element $\beta=0$, so assume taking its derivative w.r.t. $\beta$ at $\beta=0$ gives a convolutional “infinitesimal generator” $R$ leading to $\displaystyle(1-\epsilon R)\frac{x^{\alpha}}{\alpha!}=\frac{x^{\alpha}}{\alpha!}-\epsilon\frac{1}{2\pi i}\displaystyle\oint_{|z-x|=|x|}\frac{-ln(z-x)+\lambda}{z-x}\frac{z^{\alpha}}{\alpha!} dz$
approximating $\frac{x^{\alpha+\epsilon }}{(\alpha+\epsilon)!}$ for small $\epsilon$ where $\lambda=d\beta!/d\beta|_{\beta=0}$. Then, analogous to $(1+tA/n)^n$ tending to $exp(tA)$ as n tends to infinity, assume (letting $\alpha=0$ and $tA/n =-\beta R/n=-\epsilon R$) $\displaystyle\frac{x^\beta}{\beta!} = exp(-\beta R) 1$. Here $R^n$ represents repeated convolution initially acting on 1. If this is true, then, equivalently, $R$ represents a raising operator for $\psi_{n}(x)=(-1)^n \frac{d^n}{d\beta^n}\frac{x^\beta}{\beta!}|_{\beta=0}$; that is, $\psi_{n+1}(x)=R\psi_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\displaystyle\oint_{|z-x|=|x|}\frac{-ln(z-x)+\lambda}{z-x}\psi_{n}(z) dz$. Update : The contour can be collapsed to the real line to obtain $\psi_{n+1}(x)=R\psi_{n}(x)=(-ln(x)+\lambda)\psi_{n}(x)+\displaystyle\int_{0}^{x}\frac{\psi_{n}\left (  x\right )-\psi_n(u)}{x-u}du$. I have basically two questions about the validity of these relations: A) Can the Lie group argument be made rigorous, and if so, how?
B) Can anyone provide a proof of the raising operation independent of group theoretic arguments? Any history on these relations would be appreciated also. PS: By considering the limit of  $\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}[\frac{(-1+a)!}{(z-x)^a}+\frac{(-1-a)!}{(z-x)^{-a}}]$ as $a$ tends to zero, using $\displaystyle\frac{sin(\pi u)}{\pi u}=\frac{1}{u!(-u)!}$, you can show that $I_x=[R,x]=Rx-xR$  is the raising operator for $\displaystyle\frac{x^{\alpha}}{\alpha!}$  ; i.e., $\displaystyle I_x\frac{x^{\alpha}}{\alpha!}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\displaystyle\oint_{|z-x|=|x|}(-ln(z-x)+\lambda)\frac{z^{\alpha}}{\alpha!}dz=\frac{x^{\alpha+1}}{(\alpha+1)!}$. So, $\displaystyle\frac{x^\beta}{\beta!} = \frac{1}{1+I_{\beta}R} 1$  also, eliminating all factorials, for $\beta>0$.","['calculus', 'operator-theory', 'lie-groups', 'analysis', 'complex-analysis']"

125356,Compactness theorem for propositional calculus - nice uses?,"The compactness theorem for propositional calculus states that a set of propositional sentences has a model (satisfying assignment) if and only if every finite subset of it has a model. I'm looking for uses of the theorem for something outside of logic that are simple enough to present without additional background. An example is tiling, e.g. tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ using Wang tiles . Given a set of Wang tiles one can introduce variables $X_{i,j}^k$ that means ""Tile no. $k$ was placed in $(i,j)$"". We now construct an infinite set of sentences saying that the assignment to the variables defines a legal tiling (i.e. for every $(i,j)$ exactly one $X_{i,j}^k$ is true, and we also check edge compatability). Now the compactness theorem can be used to prove that a set of tiles tiles the entire plane if and only if it tiles any finite zone in the plane. Are there more uses in the same spirit?","['logic', 'combinatorics']"

125522,Number of limit points of a continued exponential,"Inspired by the work of C. Bender, I recently played with continued exponentials (like continued fractions but with exponential functions ;) ). Given all prefactors are equal to 1, the continued exponential reads $\exp(z \exp(z \exp(...))) $. This converges in a cardioid, but the more interesting thing happens outside the region of convergence, giving rise to the following problem: Let $a_0 = 1$ and $a_{n+1} = \exp(z\cdot a_n)$. Given a $z\in\mathbb{C}$, how many limiting points does the sequence $\{a_i(z)\}$ have? When coloring every region with a different number of limiting points in a different color, a fractal pattern emerges (see picture). The only divergent points (with values going off to $\infty$) are $\{x\in\mathbb{R}|x>1/e\}$. At the border between any two regions, there are smaller and smaller regions of higher number of limiting points so that there is an infinitesimal line around every region, where the sequence has an infinite number of limiting points. The sequences approach N-circles for high n. That is: a sequence with 5 limiting points will always iterate through these 5 points in the same order at high n. The picture I created took about 15 hours of calculations and as you can see there are still a lot of black regions, where my code was not able to determine the number of limiting points (and there are some wrong colorings at the cardioid, but that is not too bad). This is mainly due to slow convergence. My question to you: do you have any idea how to quickly find the number of limiting points (ie faster than calculating the sequence until the pattern becomes obvious)? Is there a way to find all points for which there are infinitely many limit points ie. calculate the borders of these regions directly? To clarify: what I am doing so far is to calculate something like 300 elements of this sequence and check whether $||a_N - a_{N-m}|| < \epsilon\cdot ||a_N||$ for some predefined $\epsilon$ and any $m$.

125627,"Small magmas with identity, inverses, and almost associativity","In constructing a good pedagogical non-example of a group, it would be pleasing to have an example that satisfies all of the properties of being a group except that there is precisely one counterexample to the associative property (especially since this is difficult to read off of a ""multiplication table"").

125630,How to get from relation matrix in smith normal form to direct product of cyclic groups?,"So...we have an abelian group $G$ with generating set {$g_1,\ldots,g_n$} the following homomorphism has been formed ($F$ is a free group generated by {$f_1,\ldots,f_n$});
\begin{align}
\phi:F &\rightarrow G \newline
k_1f_1+\ldots +k_nf_n &\mapsto k_1g_1+\ldots +k_ng_n
\end{align}
Using the first isomorphism theorem $G \cong F/K$ where $K = \operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$. It can be shown that since $K$ is a subgroup of $F$ that it is itself free and finitely generated by {$r_1,\ldots,r_m$}, where $m \leq n$. The generators of $K$ can be expressed as;
\begin{equation}
\textbf{r} = A\textbf{f}
\end{equation}
where $\textbf{r} = (r_1,\ldots,r_m)^T$, $\textbf{f} = (f_1,\ldots f_n)^T$ and $A = (a_{ij})$ is an $m \times n$ matrix. It can be shown that $P\textbf{r}=PA\textbf{f}$ also generates $K$, and also that $P\textbf{r} = PAQ(Q^{-1}\textbf{f})$ generates $K$. So choosing suitable matrices $P$ and $Q$ we can show that $K$ is generated by {$a_1f'_1,\ldots,a_nf'_n$} where $a_i \in \mathbb{N}$ for $i=1,\ldots,m$ and $a_i = 0$ for $i = m+1,\ldots,n$. Now this is where my difficulties begin, that is if what i've outlined up to now makes any sense, using $\phi$ we can investigate the orders of the generating set for $G$. An element $x = k_1g_1+\ldots +k_ng_n \in G$ is equal to the identity iff $k_1f'_1+\ldots +k_nf'_n \in K$  therefore $k_ig_i=e$ iff $k_if'_i \in K$ and $k_if'_i \in K$ iff $a_i |k_i$. So we conclude from this that $|g_i| = a_i$ for $i=1,\ldots ,m$ and $|g_i| = \infty$ for $i = m+1,\ldots,n$, and also that $\langle g_i \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}/a_i\mathbb{Z}$ for $i=1,\ldots ,m$ and $\langle g_i \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}$ for $i = m+1,\ldots,n$. Now I need to show that $G \cong \langle g_1 \rangle \oplus \ldots \oplus \langle g_m \rangle \oplus \mathbb{Z}^{n-m}$ but haven't got a clue how to go about it. I know i must show that the intersection $\langle g_i \rangle \cap \langle g_j \rangle=e$ for $i \not = j$ and that any $x \in G$ can be expressed as $k_1g_1+\ldots +k_ng_n$ (this follows from the fact that the set {$g_1,\ldots,g_n$} generates $G$ ?) and that $|G| =|g_i|\ldots|g_n|=a_1\ldots a_n$.

Specifically, $$\frac{\gamma-\psi(t+1)}{t}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n(n+t)}$$ Now, integrating this is the problem: $$\int_0^1 \frac{\gamma+\psi(t+1)}{t} \; dt=1.257746887\ldots$$ That $t$ in the denominator causes a fit.

I had my first course in topology a couple of years ago and did later very little about the subject. I received a good grade then and thought I wouldn't have much trouble during the Topology II course. Unfortunately, this is very far from the truth. I'm struggling to understand almost every sentence that is said there. And one of the things that cause me the most trouble is quotient spaces. I know the definition of course and I know that taking quotients means ""gluing equivalent points together"". The problem is that it doesn't give me much insight into how a given quotient space behaves. I find myself staring with my jaw dropped at people juggling with different interpretations of the same space as quotients of different spaces. When the real projective plane was discussed, I asked how I can visualize it. I was told to ""simply take a sphere and glue antipodal points together."" Well, fine, I understand that this is a well-defined operation on topological spaces, but the problem is that I can't visualize such a thing at all. It's impossible to do this to a sphere in the world I live in. I've studied mathematics long enough to understand that I won't be able to visualize everything.

And then we could say that $P$ is not countably additive. But I think that we can't have more than one $A_i$ cofinite such that $A_i\cap A_j=\phi$. Suppose that infinites $A_i$ is cofinite.

$$ \frac{A_1^2}{q^2} = \frac{(\frac{A_1}{A_2})^2-1}{2gh} $$
Multiply both sides by $2gh$:
$$ 2gh\frac{A_1^2}{q^2} = (\frac{A_1}{A_2})^2-1 $$ $$ \frac{2ghA_1^2}{q^2} = (\frac{A_1}{A_2})^2-1 $$
Add 1 to both sides and re-arrange:
$$ \frac{A_1^2}{A_2^2} = \frac{2ghA_1^2}{q^2} +1 $$
Invert again:
$$ \frac{A_2^2}{A_1^2} = \frac{q^2}{2ghA_1^2} +1 $$
Multiply by $A_1^2$:
$$ A_2^2 = \frac{A_1^2q^2}{2ghA_1^2} +1 $$
Get the square root: $$ A_2 = \sqrt{\frac{A_1^2q^2}{2ghA_1^2}+1} $$ I cannot see where the $q^2$ on the bottom of the textbook answer comes from.",['algebra-precalculus']
125862,How can I construct the matrix representing a linear transformation of a 2x2 matrix to its transpose with respect to a given set of bases?,"I have been given that I am working with the space of all 2x2 matrices.

Assume that $K$ and $K'$ both have a smooth ($\mathcal{C}^2$) boundary. Assume moreover that $K \cup K'$ is convex. Then is the boundary of $K \cup K'$ also $\mathcal{C}^2$? ~~~~~ Edit : I'll add some context. The motivation of the question is that I would like to prove that curvature integrals are additive over the space of $\mathcal{C}^2$ convex compact sets, which basically boils down to this problem. My guess is that the answer is positive. Here are some elements in two dimensions. Let $K$ and $K'$ be two convex compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with smooth boundary, and assume that $K \cup K'$ is also convex. Let $x \in \partial K \cap \partial K'$. Then $\partial K$ and $\partial K'$ have the same tangent space in $x$; otherwise, $K \cup K'$ would not be convex.
 Now, let us look at the curvature at $x$. If the curvature of $\partial K$ is strictly smaller than the curvature of $\partial K'$, then $K'$ is locally included into $K$, so $\partial K \cup K'$ is locally $\partial K$, which is $\mathcal{C}^2$. The same holds if we exchange $K$ and $K'$. The last possibility is that both curvatures are equal, which ""trivially""* imply that the second derivative of any reasonable parametrization of $\partial K \cup K'$ in a neighborhood of $x$ is $\mathcal{C}^2$. In all cases, $\partial K \cup K'$ is a $\mathcal{C}^2$ curve.

126010,Continuity and the Axiom of Choice,"In my introductory Analysis course, we learned two definitions of continuity. $(1)$ A function $f:E \to \mathbb{C}$ is continuous at $a$ if every sequence $(z_n) \in E$ such that $z_n \to a$ satisfies $f(z_n) \to f(a)$ . $(2)$ A function $f:E \to \mathbb{C}$ is continuous at $a$ if $\forall \varepsilon>0, \exists \delta >0:\forall z \in E, |z-a|<\delta \implies |f(z)-f(a)|<\varepsilon$ . The implication $(2)\implies(1)$ is trivial (though I will happily post a proof if there is sufficient interest).  The proof of the implication $(1)\implies(2)$ is worth remarking on, though. Proof that $(1)\implies(2)$ : Suppose on the contrary that $\exists \varepsilon>0:\forall \delta>0, \exists z \in E:\left (|z-a|<\delta \; \mathrm{and} \; |f(z)-f(a)|\ge \varepsilon\right )$ .  Let $A_n$ be the set $\{z\in E:|z-a|<\frac{1}{n} \; \mathrm{ and }\; |f(z)-f(a)|\ge\varepsilon\}$ .  Now use the Axiom of Choice to construct a sequence $(z_n)$ with $z_n \in A_n \; \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ .  But now $a-\frac{1}{n}<z_n<a+\frac{1}{n}\; \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ so $z_n \to a$ .  So $f(z_n) \to f(a)$ .  But $|f(z_n)-f(a)|\ge\varepsilon\; \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ , which is a contradiction. You will have noticed that the above proof uses the Axiom of Choice (the lecturer didn't explicitly spell out the dependence, but it's definitely there).  My question is: is it possible to prove that $(1) \implies (2)$ without using the Axiom of Choice.  I strongly suspect that it isn't.  In that case, can anyone prove that we have to use the Axiom of Choice?  I can think of three ways to do this: (A) Show that $\left( (1) \implies (2)\right)\implies \mathrm{AC}$ . I suspect that this statement is untrue. This is definitely untrue, as Arthur points out, because I only used the axiom of countable choice, which is strictly weaker than AC. (B) Show that $(1)\implies (2)$ is equivalent to some other statement known to require the Axiom of Choice (the obvious example being the well-ordering of the real numbers). (C) Construct or show the existence of a model of ZF in which there exist sequences which satisfy $(1)$ but not $(2)$ . Of course, if anyone can think of another way, I would be very interested to hear about it. One final note - I am aware that very many theorems in Analysis use the Axiom of Choice in one way or another, and that this is just one example of such a theorem.  If there exists a model of ZF like the one described in (C), is the study of Analysis in that model interesting?","['set-theory', 'axiom-of-choice', 'continuity', 'analysis']"

126016,"Meaning of ""kernel""","In analysis, there are at least three kinds of "" kernel "" concepts: In probability theory, there is a concept called transition
probability , also called probability kernel, from one measure space
$X$ to another $Y$. It is actually a family of measures on $Y$,
indexed by members of $X$. It can transform a measure on $X$ to a
measure on $Y$, in terms of integration. A special case is kernel density estimation of probability density function in statistics, where the kernel is actually a probability kernel. In real/complex analysis, there is a concept called kernel function from a product space $X \times Y$ to $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.
It can transform some special function: $X \to \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ to
another one:$Y \to \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. This is used
for defining integral transformation In Hilbert space theory, there is concept called positive definite
kernel , which is a family of bounded mappings for a family of
Hilbert spaces. For every two Hilbert spaces $X$ and $Y$ in the family,
there are exactly two members of the kernel, one mapping from $X$ to $Y$ and
the other from $Y$ to $X$. I wonder Are they related concepts, since they seem to share some indescribable similarity? Can they be unified? In particular, the first two are similar to each other as the kernels induce transformations on measures and on functions in terms of integrals. It is however not obvious to me how the third one, i.e. the Hilbert space one, is related to the second one. Are they related to the algebraic kernel concepts? Or even to the categorical kernel concept? I feel like some insights and references for catching the general ideas shared across as many kinds of ""kernels"" as possible.

Need $\xi_0$ still be separating for $M$?  That is, $x\in M, x(\xi_0)=0 \implies x=0$? Actually, I think I can prove this.  We turn $\mathfrak A = \{ a(\xi_0) : a\in A \}$ into a left Hilbert algebra algebra in the obvious way.  Then run the Tomita-Takesaki machinery (actually not needed in full generality as we start with a state, not a weight).  Then the von Neumann algebra generated by $\mathfrak A$ is nothing but $M$, and so the general theory tells us that $\varphi(x) = \|x\xi_0\|$ will be a faithful weight on $M$, which is what we need. Is this right?  Surely this argument is far, far more complicated then necessary?

I seek to express the above volume formula in such a form. Note that, with $A$, $B$, $C$ the dihedral angles between respective face-pairs $(y,z)$, $(z,x)$, $(x,y)$, we have this formula for volume: $$81 V^4 = 4 x^2 y^2 z^2 \left( 1 - 2 \cos{A} \cos{B} \cos{C} - \cos^2 A - \cos^2 B - \cos^2 C \right) = 4 x^2 y^2 z^2 \left|\begin{array}{ccc}

Can we do better? (Yes, ""better"" is subjective, but I think we know what I mean: it should have the Cayley-Menger spirit . I suppose my primary criterion is that the determinant be symmetric in the four face areas and the three pseudo-face areas; ideally, the individual entries are (subjectively) ""uncomplicated"".) Here's a possibly-helpful discussion from the previous version of this question: If $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, $f$ are edges of the tetrahedron with $w = \triangle def$, $x = \triangle dbc$, $y = \triangle aec$, and $z = \triangle abf$, then 
$$
9 V^2 a^2 = [h,y,z] \qquad 9 V^2 \; b^2 = [j,z,x] \qquad 9 V^2 \; c^2 = [k,x,y]\\
9 V^2 d^2 = [h,w,x] \qquad 9 V^2 \; e^2 = [j,w,y] \qquad 9 V^2 \; f^2 = [k,w,z]

Consequently, we can substitute into the Cayley-Menger determinant formula to write

Since $\mathrm{det}M$ is proportional to the 8th-power of $V$ ---and therefore, the square of the target formula--- perhaps I should attempt to construct $\sqrt{M}$. My investigations of matrix $M$ have been fruitless. (Note, though, that despite its complexity ---and the fact that it generates the square of what I want--- $M$ has the kind of symmetry I would expect from a properly Cayley-Menger-esque result.) I think it's time to add a bounty to this question. [Bounty expired.] Edit Here's a tantalizing alternative ""(negative-)square-of-what-I-want"" matrix: $$N := \left|\begin{array}{cccccc}

y^2 & j^2 & y^2 & w^2 & 0 & w^2 \\
z^2 & z^2 & k^2 & w^2 & w^2 & 0
\end{array}\right| \qquad \mathrm{det}N = -\left(81 V^4\right)^2$$ The pattern in the entries can be described thusly: Index the rows and columns with edges $(a,b,c,d,e,f)$. Then the $pq$-th element ($p\ne q$) corresponds to the face determined by edges $p$ and $q$. (Opposite edges $p$ and $q$ determine a pseudo-face.) The minors of $N$ are very interesting. Writing $N_p$ for the matrix obtained by removing row and column $p$ from $N$: $$\begin{array}{ccc}
\mathrm{det} N_a = 2 w^2 x^2 \cdot 81 V^4 & \mathrm{det} N_b = 2 w^2 y^2 \cdot 81 V^4 & \mathrm{det} N_c = 2 w^2 z^2 \cdot 81 V^4 \\
\mathrm{det} N_d = 2 y^2 z^2 \cdot 81 V^4 & \mathrm{det} N_e = 2 z^2 x^2 \cdot 81 V^4 & \mathrm{det} N_f = 2 x^2 y^2 \cdot 81 V^4 \\
\end{array}$$ Note, for instance in the case of $N_a$, that faces $w$ and $x$ meet along edge $d$, which is opposite edge $a$. Moreover, with $N_{pq}$ the matrix obtained by removing row $p$ and column $q$ (with $p\ne q$): $$\mathrm{det} N_{ab} = - w^2 \left( k^2 - x^2 - y^2 \right) \cdot 81 V^4 = 2 w^2 x y \cos C \cdot 81 V^4 \qquad \text{etc}$$ I get the sense that this gets me closer to my goal. Edit. Getting even closer. Augmenting matrix $N$ into more Menger-like form gives $$\begin{align}
P &:= \left|\begin{array}{ccccccc}

Now, I want to prove that $\lim_{n \to \infty} x^n = 0$ as long as $|x| < 1$. I've split it into two possible cases: (1) $0 < x < 1$.  Let $p = \frac{1}{x} - 1$,
so that $x = \frac{1}{1 + p}$ and $p > 0$ (since $x < 1$).
Then we let $\alpha = 0$ to see that
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} x^n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^0}{(1 + p)^n} = 0$$ (2) $-1 < x < 0$.  Here we cannot use the sequence $\frac{n^\alpha}{(1 + p)^n}$ again,
since if we let $p = \frac{1}{x} - 1$, then $p$ isn't necessarily positive
(for example, if $x = - \frac{1}{2}$, then $p = -3 < 0$). How can I prove Case (2)?",['sequences-and-series']

126105,Question about limit points of a Subset of $\mathbb{R}$,"The question : Let $D$ be a nonempty subset of the reals that is bounded above. Is the supremum of $D$ a limit point of $D$? My Reasoning: I think this is false for these two cases.
Case 1:If I look at $D = \{n \in \mathbb{Z} | n \le 0\}$ the supremum is $0$. And since I need a convergent sequence $\{x_n\} \subset D/\{0\}$ the converges to $0$ for it to be a limit point I can say in this case if I look at $\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}$ for the converges of the sequence it will fail to converge and so $0$ isn't a limit point. Case 2: Also if I look at $D = {0}$ then the supremum is $0$. And $D$ is a subset of the reals. So if I look for a sequence $\{x_n\} \subset D/\{0\}$ I can't make one because $D/\{0\}$ is the empty set. My question is this. Since the problem asked about an arbitrary subset of the reals $D$, can I define $D$ to give a counterexample like above or have I misunderstood the question? --Thanks in advance.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"

Assume the measure space has the property that for each $\varepsilon \gt 0$, $X$ is the union of a finite collection of measurable sets, each of measure at most $\varepsilon$. Can I get some hints to prove that $f$ is integrable over $X$? Attempt: since $f_n$ is uniformly integrable,  there is a $\delta \gt0$ such that for each $n$ $$\int_E |f_n|~d\mu \lt 1,$$ where $E$ is a measurable subset of $X$. I can use Fatou's Lemma to show that on $E$ $$\int_E |f|~d\mu\lt 1.$$ Let $X = \bigcup_{n=1}^k E_n$ where $\mu(E_n) \le \varepsilon$ for each $n$. Then I can say $\mu(X) \le k\varepsilon$.

126115,A contradiction when calculating the expected value of a discrete random variable,"Let $f_x = \mathrm{Pr}\{X = x\}$ be a probability mass function. The cumulative distribution function of $X$ is then defined as $F_x = \mathrm{Pr}\{X \le x\} = \sum_{z=0}^{x} f_z$. Therefore, the probability mass function can be written in terms of the cumulative distribution function as $f_x = F_x - F_{x-1} ~\forall x \in \mathbb{N}$. The expected value of $X$ is also defined as $\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{x=1}^{\infty} x \, f_x$. Expanding this equation using the previous statements, we get: $$\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[X] & = \sum_{x=1}^\infty x \cdot ( F_x - F_{x-1} ) \\
& = \sum_{x=1}^\infty x \, F_x - \sum_{x=1}^{\infty} x \, F_{x-1} \\
& = \sum_{x=1}^\infty x \, F_x - \sum_{x=1}^{\infty} (x-1) \, F_{x-1} - \sum_{x=1}^\infty F_{x-1} \\
& = \sum_{x=1}^\infty x \, F_x - \sum_{x=0}^{\infty} x \, F_x - \sum_{x=0}^\infty F_x \\

& = -\sum_{x=0}^\infty F_x.
