Under what conditions does $f^{-1}(A)$ have Lebesgue measure zero? I  found a possible answer here but I cannot fully understand the proof. The claim is that $f\in C^1$ and the set $\{x:\ \nabla f(x)=0\}$ having measure zero suffices. Now the proof given starts with: ""To prove this, note that this is true locally, in a neighborhood of each point where $\nabla f(x)\neq 0$, due to the implicit function theorem."" Take a point $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\nabla f(x)\neq 0$ and $f(x)=c$ for some $c\in A$. By the implicit function theorem one can find neighborhoods $U$ and $V$ of $(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1})$ and $x_n$ respectively such that $f^{-1}(\{c\})\cap (U\times V)=\{(y,g(y)):y\in U\}$ for some function $g$ on $U$ and $\nabla f(x)\neq 0$ for all $x\in U\times V$.

657159,Pullback of a form using the Hopf fibration,"I embed the 2-sphere and the 3-sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\mathbb{R}^4$ respectively. Then denote by $\{x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4\}$ the coordinates on the 3-sphere and $\{y_1,y_2,y_3\}$ on the 2-sphere. So $\sum_{i=1}^4 x_i^2 = 1 = \sum_{i=1}^3 y_i^2$ . Now consider the 2-forms $$\omega=dx_1\wedge dx_2+dx_3\wedge dx_4$$ on $S^3$ and $$\alpha=y_1\, dy_2\wedge dy_3+y_2\, dy_3\wedge dy_1 + y_3\, dy_1\wedge dy_2$$ on $S^2$ . I wish to show that when pulling back $\alpha$ to $S^3$ using the Hopf map $H:S^3\rightarrow S^2$ given by $$(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\mapsto \left(x_1^2+x_2^2-x_3^2-x_4^2, 2(x_2x_3 - x_1 x_4), 2(x_2x_4+x_1x_3)\right)\,,$$ the result is proportional to $\omega$ , so: $H^*\alpha=c\omega$ for some $c\in\mathbb{R}$ . I tried starting from the left hand side, so by definition of the pullback I just wrote down the form $\alpha$ with the $y_i$ replaced by the $i^{th}$ component of $H(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$ , and then I used $\sum_{i=1}^4 x_i^2 = 1$ and $\sum_{i=1}^4 x_idx_i = 0$ .

657257,Cogroup structures on the profinite completion of the integers,"Let $\mathsf{ProFinGrp}$ be the category of profinite groups (with continuous homomorphisms). This is equivalent to the Pro-category of $\mathsf{FinGrp}$. Notice that $\widehat{\mathbb{Z}} = \lim_{n>0} \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is a cogroup object, since it represents the forgetful functor $U : \mathsf{ProFinGrp} \to \mathsf{Set}$. Although $\mathsf{ProFinGrp}$ has no coproducts (?), the coproduct $\widehat{\mathbb{Z}} \sqcup \widehat{\mathbb{Z}}$ exists, it coincides by formal nonsense with $\widehat{F_2}$, where $F_2$ is the free group on two generators $x,y$. Let us denote the generator of $\mathbb{Z}=F_1$ by $x$. Then the comultiplication of $\widehat{F_1}$ is given by $\widehat{F_1} \to \widehat{F_2}$, $x \mapsto x * y$. There is another cogroup structure on $\widehat{F_1}$, corresponding to the opposite group. The corresponding comultiplication is $\widehat{F_1} \to \widehat{F_2}$, $x \mapsto y * x$. Question. Are these two the only cogroup structures on $\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}$? Here is a down-to-earth description what a cogroup structure on $\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}$ is: It is an element $m(x,y) \in \widehat{F_2}$ (a sort of ""profinite word"" in $x$ and $y$) such that $m(x,1)=m(1,x)=x$ in $\widehat{F_1}$ $m(x,m(y,z))=m(m(x,y),z)$ in $\widehat{F_3}$ There is some $i \in \widehat{F_1}$ such that $m(x,i(x))=m(i(x),x)=1$. This is very similar to the definition of a one-dimensional formal group law (which is a cogroup structure on $R[[t]]$ in the category of complete topological $R$-algebras). Background: An affirmative answer would answer math.SE/656279 . It is known that $\mathbb{Z} \in \mathsf{Grp}$ has only two cogroup structures.","['profinite-groups', 'formal-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'category-theory', 'group-theory']"

657302,Divergence as a surface integral,"I had a shot at the final problem of section 16.4 in 'Calculus a Complete Course' by Adams, I knew full well that I wasn't even going to come close to a correct answer so my question relates to the answer provided in the solution manual. Note: I can't get the surface integral to show up as a closed surface integral, so where ever you see a double integral please assume that i'm referring to the integral over a closed surface. Problem statement: Let $P_{0}$ be a fixed point and for each $\epsilon>0$ let $D_\epsilon$ and $S_\epsilon$ define the the domain and boundary respectively. (such that the conditions of the Divergence Theorem are satisfied) Suppose that the maximum distance from $P_0$ to some other point $P\in D_\epsilon$ approach zero as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0^+$. If $D_\epsilon$ has volume $vol(D_\epsilon)$, show that
$$\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \frac{1}{vol(D_\epsilon)} \iint_{S_\epsilon} \boldsymbol{F\cdot\hat{N}} dS = \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{F}(P_0)$$ My Problem: So the proof given by Adams starts out by stating the divergence theorem and dividing both sides of the equation by the volume of the domain. Some algebraic manipulation brings me to this point. $$\begin{array}{lcr} \left|\frac{1}{vol(D_\epsilon)} \iint_{S_\epsilon}\boldsymbol{F\cdot\hat{N}}\, dS - \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{F}(P_0)\right| & \leq &\frac{1}{vol(D_\epsilon)} \iiint_{D_\epsilon}\left|\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{F}-\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{F}(P_0)\right|dV \\& \leq & \max\limits_{P\in D_\epsilon} \left|\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{F}-\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{F}(P_0)\right|\end{array}$$ Now the first line seems to result from some algebraic manipulation and application of the triangle inequality, but the jump to the second line baffles me.

Can we always extend $f$ analytically past $\partial\Omega$? If it's not right, what about assuming that $f$ is injective? Background In Ahlfors' Complex Analysis , while proving Schwarz-Christoffel formula, he proves many propositions on the boundary behavior. Approximately, they follow the paradigm: If $\Omega$ is a simply connected domain and $\partial\Omega$ is well-behaved enough, $f\colon\Omega\to\mathbb D$ is a biholomorphism onto the unit disc, then $f$ could be extended analytically past $\partial\Omega$. For example, if $\partial\Omega$ is a polygon or ( EDIT: I've reread that paragraph and found that he didn't claim such a proposition for the polygon, though in the proof he did some analytic extension, which couldn't be pullbacked in a transformation) a real analytic simple closed curve, then the extension is possible. I don't want to repeat the argument, which is quite lengthy, but only point out the key idea. We use a good function (at least, locally biholomorphic) $\varphi$ to parametrize a neighborhood of $z_0\in\partial\Omega$ locally, then consider $F(\zeta)=\log f(\phi(\zeta))$, where $\log$ is an appropriate branch of the logarithm function. When $\phi(\zeta)$ tends to the boundary, $f(\phi(\zeta))$ tends to the unit circle and the imaginary part of $F(\zeta)$ tends to $0$, then we can apply Schwarz reflection principle to extend $F$, therefore $f$ to some degree. Apparently, the preceding argument relies on the analyticity of $\partial\Omega$, and the bijectivity of $f$. It seems to me that non-extendability happens at unbounded points, just like Riemann's theorem on removable singularities , or Casorati-Weierstrass theorem for essential singularities. I need to see whether it's generally true for good boundaries, so I pay attention on smooth or piecewise smooth boundaries, and no matter whether you define smooth as $\mathcal C^1$ or $\mathcal C^\infty$. Any idea? Thanks.",['complex-analysis']

657752,Question on using Leibniz formula to derive thin-film equation from Navier-Stokes,"I am trying to work through the derivation in this paper by Petr Vita, which derives a thin-film simplification of the Navier-Stokes equation, similar to the Reynolds or Lubrication Equation , but including inertial terms as well.  To walk through the major steps to the point where I have questions: Start with basic N-S equation (eq 1 in the paper):
$$\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot(\mathbf{u u}) \right) = -\nabla p + \rho \mathbf{g} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{\underline{T}} $$
Here $ \mathbf{\underline{T}}$ is the deviatoric stress tensor, and I have left off the final body force term since it isn't used in the rest of the paper. Use the thin-film assumption that $u_z=0$ and define (eq 4 in the paper) $$\bar{\mathbf{u}}=\frac{1}{h}\int_0^h \mathbf{u}\, dz$$ Integrate the N-S equation with respect to $z$ from $0$ to $h$ (equation 8 in the paper). $$ \rho \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (h \bar{\mathbf{u}}) + \rho \int_0^h \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u u})dz = -h \nabla p -\left.\mu \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial z}\right|_{z=0} $$
Obviously there are a few steps being skipped over here.  For the time-derivative term, I use the Leibniz formula to derive the following:
$$ \int_0^h \rho \frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t} dz = \rho \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_0^h \mathbf u\,dz - \rho \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} \mathbf u (x,y,h,t) + \rho \frac{\partial 0}{\partial t} \mathbf u (x,y,0,t)$$
Obviously the last term is $0$ and can be dropped. Also $ \rho \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_0^h \mathbf u\,dz = \rho \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (h \bar{\mathbf{u}}) $, giving the form seen in the equation.  However, I don't see how $ \color{blue}{\rho \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} \mathbf u (x,y,h,t)} $ can be taken to be $0$.  The height of the film is certainly changing with time, and the top surface has a von Neumann boundary condition, not a Dirichlet no-slip boundary. Any insight here? Also, the deviatoric stress has to be integrated as well.  I think the divergence theorem can be used here:
$$ \int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{\underline{T}}\, dV = \int_S \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{\underline{T}} \, dS$$
In this case that should come out to be
$$ \int_0^h \nabla \cdot \mathbf{\underline{T}}\, dz =\left.\mu \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial z}\right|_{z=h} - \left.\mu \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial z}\right|_{z=0} $$
The top surface stress is $0$, leaving the bottom stress term as is found in the derived equation, right? Now we get to my main question, the integration of the $\nabla \cdot(\mathbf{u u})$ term.  The author is able to evaluate this term by using a combination of Pohlhausen's method of assuming a cubic profile for the liquid flow, and the Reynold's Averaged Navier-Stokes method of splitting the velocity into an average velocity and deviation from that average. For the cubic profile he defines:
$$ \mathbf{u}(x,y,z) = u(x,y,\xi) \text{, where} $$
$$ u(x,y,\xi) = a_0 + a_1\xi + a_2\xi^2 + a_3\xi^3,\quad \xi \in \langle 0,1
\rangle,\; z=h\xi $$
Then he applies the boundary conditions and integral relation to obtain 
$$ u(x,y,\xi) = \mathbf{u}_{disk} + (\bar{\mathbf{u}}-\mathbf{u}_{disk})\left( \frac{12}{5}\xi - \frac{4}{5}\xi^3 \right) $$ This step is fine, I had no problems figuring it out.  Then the author defines the velocity fluctuation (with respect to the vertical direction) $\mathbf{\tilde u}$ as 
$$ \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{\bar u} + \mathbf{\tilde u} \text{.  This makes:} $$
$$ \int_0^h \mathbf{\bar u}\, dz = h\,\mathbf{\bar u}\text{, and } \int_0^h \mathbf{\tilde u}\, dz = 0 \text{.}$$ Anyway, so the author does this to integrate the advection term:
$$ \int_0^h \nabla \cdot ( \mathbf{uu} )\,dz = \nabla \cdot \left( \int_0^h \left[ \mathbf{\bar u} \mathbf{\bar u}+\mathbf{\bar u} \mathbf{\tilde u} + \mathbf{\tilde u} \mathbf{\bar u} + \mathbf{\tilde u} \mathbf{\tilde u} \right]\,dz \right)$$ So on the RHS the 1st term is just a constant, the 2nd and 3rd terms become $0$, and then he uses the derived polynomial form of $u$ to evaluate the last term.  However, how was he able to pull the divergence operator out of the integral?  He didn't use the divergence theorem, and I don't know if you can use the Leibniz formula on a divergence operator.  If you could do that though, wouldn't you have a term that's something like $\nabla \cdot h \left.(\mathbf{u}\mathbf{u})\right|_{z=h}$ leftover as well?","['fluid-dynamics', 'multivariable-calculus']"

            Note that:
            $$
			\sum_{\Lambda_1}^* \Delta y_i <\sum_{\Lambda_1^1}^* \Delta y_i

			\sum_{\Lambda_2}^* \Delta y_i <\sum_{\Lambda_1^2}^* \Delta y_i

            because $|Q|<\delta$. So, $c_e(A,Q)<c_e(A,P)=\eta$ (b)Let $0<\delta<|P|$, $|Q|<\delta$, $Q=\{y_0,...,y_m\}$. As $\{ \bigcup [x_{i-1}, x_i]:  [x_{i-1}, x_i] \subset A\} \subset \{ \bigcup [y_{j-1}, y_j]:  [y_{j-1}, y_j] \subset A\}$ follows that

            So, $ \lim_{n\rightarrow+\infty}{c_e(A,P_m)}=\inf\{c_e(A;P):P\in\textrm{Part}([a,b])\}=c_e(A)$ Now note that, using ""(b)"", for all partition $P$ such that $c_i(A;P)>\eta>0$, let $|P|>\delta>0$ and $0<|Q|<\delta \Rightarrow c_i(A,Q)>\eta$. So we can write that $P_m$ where $|P_m| \rightarrow 0$, exists subsequence $P_{i_k}$ such that for all $i_k$

657882,"Showing that the Lebesgue measure is ""continuous""","Problem : Let $m$ denote the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$. Let $E$ be a Lebesgue measurable set of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $m(E \cap (E+t)) = 0$ for all $t \neq 0$. Prove that $m(E)=0$. I am aware of several solutions to this problem, and some of them we can find here on Math.SE,  but I am curious if I can also apply continuity of measure directly. In particular, we know by the continuity of measure that if $\{B_k\}$ is an ascending sequence of measurable sets, then $m\left( \bigcup^{\infty}_{k=1} B_k\right)=\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} m(B_k)$. To specialize this for our case, suppose we consider the sequence $A_n = E \cap (E+\frac{1}{n})$ of sets. Clearly the conditions of the theorem are satisfied, since $m(A_n) < \infty$ and $A_1 \subseteq A_2 \subseteq \cdots$, and so we have that $m\left( \bigcup^{\infty}_{k=1} A_k\right)=\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} m(A_k) = \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} m(E \cap (E+\frac{1}{k})) = m(E)$, but this must be zero since unions of sets of measure zero is zero (left-most left-hand side of the equation).

658072,"Prove the following statement: If A is any set, then $A \subseteq A$","I'm doing some practice problems and I'm wondering if I got this right. I think this is a very short proof, but I'm not sure. Given: P: A is any set Q: $A \subseteq A$ We have a $P \rightarrow Q$ statement. Definition 3.1.2 states that we let A and B be sets. Then A is a subset of B, written $A \subseteq B$, when the statement $(\forall x)[x \in A \rightarrow \in B ]$ is true. Since A is any set, then by Definition 3.1.2, $(\forall x)[x \in A \rightarrow \in A ]$. Therefore,  $A \subseteq A$ I still remember the truth table for $P \rightarrow Q$. Both statements of $P$ and $Q$ had to be true for $P \rightarrow Q$ to be true. 
So, if A is any subset, then $A \subseteq A$ If $P$ was false and $Q$ was false, the $P \rightarrow Q$ would be true.
If A isn't any subset, then A is not a subset of A. If A is a subset, then  A is not a subset of A is the only false statement for $P \rightarrow Q$ because $P$ is true, but $Q$ is false.","['logic', 'elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"

My question is this: What are some classical examples of properties we specifically prove about a group from representation theory that we might not be able to do otherwise? We had a couple of problems in which we were to prove facts about very specific instances of groups based on the representations but they could all be done with group theoretic notions anyway; I'm looking for maybe a more fundamental paradigm underlying representation theory.

Question: Let $\kappa_s(t)$ be the signed curvature of $\gamma$ at $t$. Show that if $\lambda\kappa_s(t)\neq1$  then $\gamma$ is a regular
  curve and its signed curvature is
  $\frac{\kappa_s}{|1-\lambda\kappa_s(t)|}$. My work so far: $\gamma^\lambda(t)=\gamma(t)+\lambda n_s(t)$ $\implies$ $\frac{d\gamma^\lambda(t)}{d s^\lambda}\frac{ds^\lambda}{dt} = \frac{d\gamma(t)}{ds}\frac{ds}{dt}+\lambda\frac{dn_s(t)}{ds}\frac{ds}{dt}$. Let $T_\gamma(t)$ denote the tangent vector of $\gamma$ at $t$. Since $n_s'=-\kappa_sT$ we have: $T_{\gamma^\lambda}\frac{ds^\lambda}{dt} = T_\gamma\frac{ds}{dt}+\lambda(-\kappa_sT_\gamma)\frac{ds}{dt}$ $\implies$ $T_{\gamma^\lambda}\frac{ds^\lambda}{dt} = (1-\lambda\kappa_s)T_\gamma\frac{ds}{dt}$.

Here's what I have and I'd like to confirm with everyone to see if there's anything else I need to add. Thanks in advance! Proof: The metric space $\mathbb{R}^k$ clearly contains $\mathbb{Q}^k$ as a subset. We know that $\mathbb{Q}^k$ is countable from theorem 2.13 (Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis 3rd Edition, Pg. 29). To prove that $\mathbb{Q}^k$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}^k$, we need to show that every point in $\mathbb{R}^k$ is a limit point of $\mathbb{Q}^k$. Let $a=(a_1,a_2,...,a_k)$ be an arbitrary point in $\mathbb{R}^k$ and let $N_r(a)$ be an arbitrary neighborhood of $a$. Let $b=(b_1,b_2,...,b_k)$ where $b_i$ is chosen to be a rational number such that $a_i<b_i<a_i+\frac{r}{\sqrt{k}}$ (this is possible because of theorem 1.20(b)) (Rudin, Pg. 9). The point $b$ is clearly in $\mathbb{Q}^k$, and $d(a,b) = \sqrt{(a_i-b_i)^2 + ... + (a_k-b_k)^2} < \sqrt{\frac{r^2}{k} + ... + \frac{r^2}{k}} = \sqrt{\frac{kr^2}{k}} = r$ This shows that every point in $\mathbb{R}^k$ is a limit point of $\mathbb{Q}^k$, which completes the proof that $\mathbb{R}^k$ is separable.

In other words, every open set in $X$ is the union of a subcollection of $\{ V_\alpha \}$. Prove that every separable metric space has a countable base. Here is what I have, just wanted to make sure that it's sufficient enough? Thanks in advance! Proof: Let $X$ be a separable metric space. From the definition of separable in the previous exercise, we know that $X$ contains a countable dense subset $E$. For each $e_i \in E$, let $N_q(e_i)$ be a neighborhood with rational radius $q$ around point $e_i$. Let $\{ V_\alpha \} = \{ N_q(e_i) \ | \ q \in \mathbb{Q}, i \in \mathbb{N} \}$ be the collection of all neighborhoods with rational radius centered around members of $E$. This is a countable collection of countable sets, and therefore $\{V_\alpha \}$ has countably many elements. Let $x$ be an arbitrary point in $X$, and let $G$ be an arbitrary open set in $X$ such that $x \in G$. Because $G$ is open, we know that $x$ is an interior point of $G$. So there is some neighborhood $N_r(x)$ such that $N_r(x) \subseteq G$. But we can choose a rational $q$ such that $0 < q < \frac{r}{2}$, so that $ x \in N_q(x) \subseteq N_r(x) \subseteq G$. Because $E$ is dense in $x$, every neighborhood of $x$ contains some $e \in E$. So $e \in N_q(x)$, which means that $d(e,x) < q$. But, on the other hand, this also means that $d(x,e)<q$ so that $x \in N_q(e)$. And $N_q(e) \in \{ V_\alpha \}$, by definition. Having shown that $x \in N_q(e)$, we need to prove that $N_q(e) \subseteq G$. Let $y$ be any point in $N_q(e)$. We know that $d(x,e) < q$ and $d(e,y)<q$. So $d(x,y) < d(x,e) + d(e,y) = 2q$ by definition of metric spaces. But we defined $q$ so that $0 < q < \frac{r}{2}$, so we know that $d(x,y) < r$. This means that every $y \in N_q(e) \rightarrow y \in N_r(x)$, or $N_q(e) \subseteq N_r(x)$. And we choose $r$ so that $N_r(x) \subseteq G$, so by transitivity we know that $N_q(e) \subseteq G$. We started by choosing an arbitrary element $x$ in an arbitrary open set $G \subseteq X$, and proved that there was an element $N_q(e) \in \{ V_\alpha \}$ such that $ x \in N_q(e) \subseteq G$. We've shown that $\{V_\alpha \}$ has a countable number of elements, and each element is an open neighborhood. This proves that $\{ V_\alpha \}$ is a base for $X$.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'proof-verification', 'analysis']"

658404,Simple optimization of cylindrical radius for volume,"I'm having trouble solving this simple optimization problem, can't work out where I'm going wrong. A brewery wants to make a cylindrical aluminium beer can which will hold 375ml. (This means the volume of the can is 375 cm3 ). (Assume that any aluminium used for the joins and tab are not  included in the calculations.) Set up an appropriate mathematical model which can be used to calculate the radius 
of the base of the can if the amount of aluminium used in its construction is to be 
minimised. So I think: write an equation for the volume (V) and area (A) based on the radius & height: $$375 = V = \pi h r^2$$
$$A = 2\pi r^2 + \pi h r^2$$ Let's use the constant V to simply to a single variable: $$h=\frac{V}{\pi r^2}$$
$$A = 2\pi r^2 + \frac{\pi r^2 V}{\pi r^2}$$
$$A = 2\pi r^2 + V$$ To find the optimal value of r which minimizes A, we take the first derivative and solve for 0: $$\frac{dA}{dr} = 4\pi r$$
$$4\pi r = 0$$ Therefore the optimal value for r to minimize A is: $$r=0$$ This is clearly wrong, where have I messed up??","['optimization', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"
658414,Proving that e.g. 421 is prime in a formal system,"I'm working in the formal system Metamath , and in the course of learning about number theory I've become acquainted with theorems, such as Bertrand's postulate, that require hand-calculation that a given set of numbers up to 4000 is prime. What would be the most efficient method for doing such a proof? Working with specific numbers is quite difficult in a formal system, since proving that the number $n=((\dots(1+1)\dots+1)+1)$ is even a natural number requires $O(n)$ steps. Numbers up to 10 are defined this way in Metamath, and this style is convenient for its uniformity, which allows you to write a single inference schema $k\in\Bbb N\to k+1\in\Bbb N$ and apply it $n$ times to prove $n\in\Bbb N$. For large numbers, it becomes convenient to represent them in other forms, say $2^k+m$ where $k$ and $m$ are specified as above. Thus you could prove that such a large number is a natural number in only $O(k+m)$ steps, and more generally you could use a form of decimal notation, i.e. $a+10\cdot(b+10\cdot(c+10\cdot d)))$ to achieve $O(\log n)$ steps in the long run. This is how you would tackle the problem of proving closure for large numbers, but what is the most efficient way to prove primality? For the range I'm talking about (still ""small"" numbers as far as number theorists are concerned), the most efficient method is probably the sieve of Erastothenes, which builds up a complete list of all primes less than some number (so there is no avoiding at least $n$ assertions of the form $k\in\Bbb P$ or $k\notin\Bbb P$), and building the $n$-th assertion requires using at least the first $\sqrt n$ assertions, so we're looking at $O(n^{3/2})$ total steps in a proof that $n\in\Bbb P$. Is there any better approach here? The strength of the system is in proving general assertions once and reusing them to achieve better compression of this process, the same way a human would, so it's not necessarily as brain-dead as a computer verification, but since prime numbers are so erratic, I don't see how you could achieve much savings off the brute-force approach. In particular, I'd like to avoid too many assertions that certain numbers are composite , but it is usually not clear that certain number is composite unless it is a multiple of the base (assuming you are using the decimal notation described above). There is nothing stopping you from using whatever notational system is convenient for the given number, but then converting between systems is overhead. Any ideas? Note: I'm not asking for an actual proof here that some big number is prime, but rather an efficient approach to the problem, since the numbers involved are big enough that the big-O is going to dominate the overall length of the complete proof. The specifics of the Metamath system are also irrelevant, for the most part; what matters is that you can't just draw lines on a grid and take that as the proof, like one would do in a ""regular"" proof that a given number around 100 is prime. (Actually most people just brush this issue under the rug, which is why I'm asking this question for advice on how to tackle the problem.)","['prime-numbers', 'theorem-provers', 'formal-languages', 'number-theory']"

658429,"Example of a function on a locally noetherian $X$, one of the irreducible components of whose support is the union of more than one associated point","Let $X$ be a locally noetherian scheme. Ravi Vakil points out on page 167 of FOAG that Each of the irreducible components of the support of any function
  on a locally Noetherian scheme is the union of the closures of some subset of the
  associated points. I am having a hard time coming up with a non-trivial example where the union does not consist of only one associated point. If $X$ were just the spectrum of a ring $A$, then no irreducible component of the support of any function could be written as the union of the closures of more than one associated point. This follows because if $C$ is an irreducible component of Supp $f$ then $C$ cannot be written as a finite union of proper closed subsets, and $A$ has only finitely many irreducible components. On the other hand, for a locally Noetherian scheme $X$, the associated points are those points $p ∈ X$ such that, on any affine open set Spec $A$ containing $p, p$ corresponds to an associated prime of $A$. This allows indeed for an irreducible component $C$ of the support of a function to be the union of the closure of more than one associated prime, since $C$ can extend pass any affine open (more precisely, there could be no affine open that contains $C$). To come up with an example, I first thought of projective space. But then, $\Gamma(\Bbb P^n_k,\mathcal O_{\Bbb P^n_k}) =k$ so the only thing I get is the empty set or the whole space as the support of any function. None of them would be the union of the closures of more than one associated prime, since the closure of a chart $\Bbb A^n_k$ is the whole projective space. My trivial example that works would be the union of two projective spaces. On the other hand, if Vakil used ""functions"" to mean not only section of the global, but also of smaller open sets (could anyone tell me?), then, maybe, it would be possible to produce non-reduced behaviour at the origin (much in the spirit of $k[x,y]/(y^2,xy)$) and at another point somewhere at infinity and pick function that has support on both points. But I have no idea of how to do this, and I think that it's probably wrong.",['algebraic-geometry']

658444,Problems implementing Euler's Method on a second order ODE,"I am trying to teach myself some numerical methods and having more issues than expected trying to solve $$y'' = -y$$ with initial conditions $y'(0) = 0$ and $y(0) = 1$. As I understand the problem, based on the information found here Solve a second order DEQ using Euler's method in MATLAB , I made the substitution $u = y'$ and reduced the problem to the following coupled system: \begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
y' = u;\\
u' = -y.
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
So in this case, since $y'(0) = 0$, this implies $u=0$ and $y(0) = 1$ implies $u'(0) = -1$. With these initial conditions, I have the vector $[y_{0},u_{0}] = [0,-1]^{T}$. I tried to use a forward Euler method on this system using \begin{align*}
y_{n+1} = y_{n} + hu_{n}\\
u_{n+1} = u_{n} - hy_{n}
\end{align*}
with $y_{0} = 0$, $u_{0} = -1$ but at this point I am not sure how I can extract the solution to my original differential equation. I am storing my $y_{i}$'s and $u_{i}'s$ in a $2\times n$ matrix where the first row contains $[y_{0},y_{1},y_{2},\dots, y_{n}]$ and the second row contains the same information for $u_{i}$'s in the same manner. It appears to me, that my matrix should contain the solution to my original differential equation in the first row, but this cannot be the case because the solution to the differential equation is $y(t) = \cos(t)$, and  $\cos(t_{0}) = \cos(0) = 1\neq 0$. Similarly, it cannot be the second row because $\cos(0) = 1 \neq -1$. If I change the initial condition to $[y_{0},u_{0}]^{T} =[0,1]$ and I take the solution to be the second row corresponding to the $u_{i}$'s, it looks like I get a reasonable answer, but I cannot understand whether this is simply a numerical fluke or if I made a flawed calculation.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'numerical-methods']"
658446,Is conditional probability also probability?,"Some pondering leads me to the question below, which prevents me from the reckless calculation of conditional probability... As defined, conditional probability is: $$
P(A|B)=P(A\cap B)/P(B).
$$ So, we can see conditional probability is the ratio of 2 probabilities . If we consider conditional probability also as probability, we are literally saying some quantity describes the similar thing as its ratio. This is very bizarre because when we measure length, we can say something is 2 meters long and the other thing is 5 meters long. But we cannot consider 2/5 or 5/2 as the same thing as 2 or 5 because the ratio 2/5 or 5/2 is just another level of comparison as I understand， while the 2 or 5 is merely the comparison to the unit. So why do we still treat conditional probability just as the ordinary probability? I wish someone could shed some light on this thing. Or is there any other examples like this besides in probability theory? ADD 1 (Thanks for so many responses.) Almost all of the responses so far try to convince me that probability is a ratio itself. And both ratio and ratios' ratio are ratio. Personally, I haven't found any contradiction about the conditional probability definition as far as only ratio interpretation is concerned yet . And it seems ratio is the only realm where probability is mathematically possible. So I took it that people generalize this ratio-based theory to a much broader realm where probability issues also arise but no apparent mathematics is applicable (such as the degree-of-belief scenario.). The only thing I can find to support this for now, is the Principle of the Permanence of Equivalent Forms and the boldness of human nature for mathematical generalization . (I will not close this question as of now and more opinions are appreciated.)","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

I used the multiplicative modulo groups (as I know (if $n$ is prime at least) that these can be generated/are cyclic -can someone confirm this for all?)
