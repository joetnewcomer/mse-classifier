1243770,"How various properties of numbers, operations are found?","I know that how the term ""property"" is defined. Definition: An attribute, quality, or characteristic of something. Like one of the property of addition is ""commutativity"" which behaves like, $a+b=b+a$ And similarly associativity, $a+(b+c)$ = $a+(b+c)$ But I always keep apprehending that How were they found and so properties similar to them? , How were they proved true for all numbers? , Does it need some type of induction proof? When I asked my cousin about that, he said, ""They have no need to be proved since they are properties like you possess and so you can make sense of them"". But I replied him, ""As far as properties of addition, multiplication are concerned, I can make sense of them but what about these types of properties, Exponential property: $a^n=\frac{1}{a^{-n}}$.

1243814,Squarefree products of a class of primes,"Numbers which are the sum of two squares are the product of a square and a collection of distinct primes which are 1 or 2 mod 4. Landau proved that there are $\sim kx/\sqrt{\log x}$ such numbers up to $x$ for a constant $k\approx0.76422.$ Restricting to the squarefree members reduces the incidence by a factor of $\zeta(2).$ So there are $\sim0.46459\ldots x/\sqrt{\log x}$ products of primes =1,2 mod 4 up to $x$. Does this generalize to other congruence classes of primes? That is, given $m$ and some set $S$ and numbers which are the product of distinct primes $\equiv s\pmod m$ for some $s\in S$ (with at least one $s$ coprime to $m$), is their density $kx/\sqrt{\log x}$ for some suitable constant $k$?

1243990,Basic finite dimensional distribution question,"I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the basic idea of a finite dimensional distribution.  Suppose $(\Omega, \Bbb P, \mathcal{F})$ is a probability space. Let $(X_{t})_{t \geq 0}$ be a stochastic process, i.e., $X_{t}: \Omega \to \Bbb R $ is a random variable for each $t$. Let $\mu_{t}$ be the distribution measure of $X_{t}$ on $\mathcal{B}(\Bbb R)$, i.e., $\mu_{t}(A) = \Bbb P(X^{-1}(A))$ for each $A \in \mathcal{B}(\Bbb R)$. Given $t_{1}, t_{2}, \dots, t_{n} \geq 0$, we can talk about the finite dimensional distribution of the vector $(X_{t_{1}},X_{t_{2}},\dots,X_{t_{n}})$.  Specifically, this is the measure $\mu$ defined by: $$\mu(D) = \Bbb P \{ \omega \in \Omega \mid (X_{t_{1}}(\omega), X_{t_{2}}(\omega), \dots, X_{t_{n}}(\omega)) \in D \} $$ where $D \subseteq \Bbb R^{n}$ is a Borel set.  So $\mu$ is a measure on $\mathcal{B}(\Bbb R^{n})$. For some reason, I'm having trouble understanding what this measure is doing.  For example, what if we have a measurable rectangle $A_{1} \times \cdots \times A_{n}$?  My gut is telling me that the measure of this is just the product of the distribution measures, i.e., $\mu(A_{1} \times \cdots \times A_{n}) = \mu_{t_{1}}(A_{1})\mu_{t_{2}}(A_{2}) \cdots \mu_{t_{n}}(A_{n})$.  Is that right?  Can anyone give me more information about this distribution?  I'm very new to this material.","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'measure-theory']"

1244108,Pushout in $\mathsf{Set}$ where one of the maps is injective,"From I.M. James' book General Topology and Homotopy Theory : Suppose we have a cotriad $$X \xleftarrow{\xi}W \xrightarrow{\eta}
 Y.$$ ... we might expect the pushout of the cotriad to be a quotient
set of $X \sqcup Y$ . So consider the triad $$X \xrightarrow{\sigma} X
 \sqcup Y \xleftarrow{\tau} Y.$$ The obvious relation $\sim$ on $X
 \sqcup Y$ to try is the one where $\sigma x \sim \tau y$ if there
exists a point $z \in W$ such that $\xi z = x$ and $\eta z = y$ .
Unfortunately, this is not, in general, an equivalence relation... in general, it is necessary to form the transitive closure in order to obtain a quotient of $X \sqcup Y$ which satisfies the conditions for a push-out. The procedure of forming the transitive closure can, however, be omitted if one of the insertions [EA: i.e. either $\xi$ or $\eta$ ] is
injective. I just have no idea why the sentence in bold would be true. I can think of a situation where $\xi$ is injective, $\eta$ is not, and the relation is not transitive: suppose $\xi(b_1) = x_1, \, \xi(b_2) = x_2, \, \eta(b_1)= \eta(b_2) = y$ . Then $x_1 \sim y$ and $x_2 \sim y$ but $x_1 \not \sim x_2$ .

1244235,Why this particular definition for the derivative on a group ring?,"I am reading Introduction to Knot Theory by Crowell and Fox, and I am a bit confused at the way they define a derivative on a group ring (and on a group). I understand a derivative (or derivation maybe more properly) to be a linear map which satisfies the Leibniz rule. However, they first define the derivative on a group to be $D:G\to JG$
$$D(g_1g_2)=Dg_1+g_1Dg_2$$
which can be uniquely extended to the map on the group ring $D:JG\to JG$ as
$$D(v_1v_2)=(Dv_1)\mathfrak{t}(v_2)+v_1Dv_2$$
where $\mathfrak{t}$ is the trivializer
$$\mathfrak{t}(\sum_i n_ig_i)=\sum n_i.$$

$$D(g_1g_2)=(Dg_1)g_2+g_1(Dg_2)$$
With a natural (unique, I think) extension to

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the Lie algebra of $G$ and $\text{ad}:G\rightarrow GL(\mathfrak{g})$ be the adjoint representation. Let $\text{ad}P:=P\times_{\text{ad}} \mathfrak{g}$ be the adjoint bundle. I am seeking a bit of clarification on the sections of $\text{ad}P$. Let $\sigma\in \Gamma(\text{ad}P)$. Since $\sigma$ is a map $M\rightarrow \text{ad}P$, it follows that $\sigma(m)\in \text{ad}P$ and so $\sigma(m)=[(p,v)]$ for some $p\in P$ and $v\in \mathfrak{g}$. (Here $[,]$ denotes the equivalence class defined by the right action of $G$). However, since $\sigma$ is a section of the vector bundle $\pi_{\mathfrak{g}}:\text{ad}P\rightarrow M$, it follows that $\sigma(m)\in \pi_{\mathfrak{g}}^{-1}(m)$. The space $\pi_{\mathfrak{g}}^{-1}(m)$ has the structure of a vector space. Thus, $[(p,v)]$ is an element of a vector space. Question 1: is it true to say that \begin{align*}

If $p,q\in\pi^{-1}(m)$, and $v,w\in \mathfrak{g}$, then how do we define $[(p,v)]+[(q,w)]$ ? Is it by noting that since $p$ and $g$ lie in the same fibre over $m$, then $q=pg$ for some $g\in G$, and thus \begin{align*}
[(q,w)]=[(pg,w)]=[(p,\text{ad}_g w)g]=[(p,\text{ad}_g w)].

1244378,The difference between the ring version and module version of Chinese Remainder Thereom.,"Chinese Remainder Theorem for Commutative Rings If $R$ is a commutative ring with $1$ and $I, J$ are ideals of $R$ that are pairwise coprime or comaximal (meaning $I + J = R$), then $IJ = I \cap J$, and the quotient ring $R/I \cap J$ is isomorphic to $R/I \times R/J$. I will first prove that $IJ = I \cap J$. If $x \in IJ$, then $x = \sum a_i b_i$ where $a_i \in I$ and $b_j \in J$. Thus for any fixed $i$, we have that $a_i b_i \in I$ since $a_i \in I$ and $a_i b_i \in J$ since $b_i \in J$. Thus, $\sum a_i b_i \in I$ and $\sum a_i b_i \in J$, which means that x = $\sum a_i b_i \in I \cap J$. Therefore, $IJ \in I \cap J$. Note that since $R$ contains 1, we can write $I \cap J = R(I \cap J)$. Therefore, $I \cap J = R(I \cap J) = (I+J)(I \cap J) = I(I \cap J) + J(I \cap J) \subseteq IJ + JI = IJ$. Now, I will prove that $R/IJ \cong R/I \times R/J$. Consider the ring homomorphism $\phi: R \rightarrow R/I \times R/J$ defined by $\phi(r) = (r+ I, r+J)$ with kernel $I \cap J$. If we can prove that $\phi$ is surjective, then we can apply the first ring isomorphism theorem to show that $R/(I \cap J) \cong R/I \times R/J$. Since $I + J = R$, for any $r_1, r_2 \in R$, we can write $r_1 = i_1 + j_1$ and $r_2 = i_2 + j_2$, where $i_1, i_2 \in I$ and $j_1, j_2 \in J$. Let $x = i_1 + j_2$. This gives us $x - r_1 = j_2 - j_1 \in J$ and $x - r_2 = i_1 - i_2 \in I$. In particular, we have $x + I = r_2 + I$ and $x + J = r_1 + J$. Hence, for all $(r_1 + I, r_2 + J)$, we can find an element $x$ such that $\phi(x) = ( x+ I, x+ J) = (r_2 +I, r_1 + J)$. This shows that $\phi$ is surjective. Hence, we can conclude that $\phi: R/(I\cap J) \cong R/I \times R/J$. (Can someone verify if the proof is correct?) Using module homomorphism, the result also hold (I think.) So, now my concern is proving the converse. Converse to Chinese Remainder Theorem According to this post the converse is false if the isomorphism is of rings. I don't quite understand how the link given shows this. I will put the link here: Can $R \times R$ be isomorphic to $R$ as rings? Can someone explain to me how the result in this link shows that it is only true when the isomorphism is of $R$-modules? If so, am I correct to say that chinese remainder theorem shows that $R/I \cap J \cong R/I \times R/J$ both as rings and $R$-modules, but the converse is only true when the isomorphism is of $R$-modules? What about this, Show that $R/(I \cap J) \cong (R/I) \times (R/J) $ Can it be used to show that the converse is true by saying that since $\phi: R \rightarrow R/I \times R/J$ is surjective if and only if $I+J = R$, so $R/I \cap J \cong R/I \times R/J$ if and only if $I+J = R$ I think we cannot because in the post the $\phi$ is predefined, but here we are talking about the general case, $R/I \cap J \cong R/I \times R/J$ and the homomorphism might not be the same. Am I right? I am very confused about this. Note that this is only my first algebra course, so please don't use stuff that is too advanced to explain to me.

The intuition seems clear to me, we have the three vertices of a triangle given by $0$, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. All points in the plane are one of the vertices of that triangle under a suitable parallel translation. The constant value will be $f(0)$, fine. Throwing values for $z$ there, I have found that $$f(n\omega_1) = f(\omega_1) = f(0)=f(\omega_2) = f(n\omega_2), \quad \forall\, n \in \Bbb Z.$$ I don't know how to improve the above for, say, rationals (at least). Some another ideas would be: Checking that $f' \equiv 0$. I don't have a clue of how to do that. Write $w = a\omega_1+b\omega_2$, with $a,b \in \Bbb R$, do stuff and conclude that $f(w) = f(0)$. This approach doesn't seem good, because I only have a weak result with integers above. Finding that $f$ coincides with $f(0)$ on a set with an accumulation point. This seems also bad: the set on with $f$ coincides with $f(0)$ by which I found above is discrete. Nothing works and this is getting annoying... And I don't see how analyticity comes in there.

Show that there exists a continuous function $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $f$ does not achieve a maximum. I proved this assertion as follows: If $X$ is non-compact, there exists a sequence which has no converging subsequence. Therefore, the set $E$ of elements of this sequence is infinite and has no limit points. Therefore, in the induced topology, $E$ is a countable discrete space. Let $e_n$ be a enumeration of $E$. Define $f: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ as $f(e_n)=n$. Since $E$ is discrete, $f$ is continuous. By Tietze (note that $E$ is closed in $X$), there exists a continuous function $g: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ which extends $f$. But $f$ is unbounded, then so is $g$, and $g$ does not achieve a maximum. $\square$ My first question is: Is everything in the proof fine? Now, my second question is: Can you provide me a proof which is more elementary? (Not using Tietze, for example. This exercise is just after the definition of compactness.

Here is the question (and the parts of the question): Suppose parking rules are enforced from 8AM to 12AM (midnight), say from $t = 8$ to $t = 24$. It is also known that the parking rules are enforced once a day. It is also known that a ticket can be issued anytime during the 16-hour period (ie. any time point is equally likely). Let $T$ denote the time of enforcement. a. Suppose you do not have the right to park your vehicle in the parking lot, but you parked there from 10AM ($t = 10$) to 1PM ($t = 13$). What is the probability of receiving a ticket? b. If a ticket is 160 dollars, what is the expected loss from the illegal parking? c. The parking rate is 2 dollars per hour. What is an appropriate action based on the expected loss. Justify your answer. My answer for a and b: a. First of all $S_t = (8,24)$, and since T is continuous, $f(t) = \frac{1}{24 - 8} = \frac{1}{16}, 8 < t < 24$. To find the probability of getting a ticket between $t = 10$ and $t = 13$, I did this: $P(10 < t < 13) = \int_{10}^{13}\frac{1}{16}dt = \frac{3}{16} = 0.1875$ b. This is where I get a little confused. So far, I made a new variable called $L$ which is loss. And the support is $S_L = (0,160)$, where 0 is no ticket and 160 is the price of getting a ticket. For the expected loss, since I think I'm trying to find $E(160)$, then this would just $= 160$. Is it really that easy? Finally, I'm confused for part c. If the parking rate is 2 dollars per hour, then the expected loss if you pay for parking for 3 hours would be $E(6) = 6$. This would mean that in order to be worth it (I think), $E(pay) > E(160)$. But since this never happens in a 16 hour period, then the appropriate action would be to just purchase parking.

1245033,This one weird trick integrates fractals. But does it deliver the correct results?,"It occurs to me that people most likely already know how to explicitly integrate over fractals, but my method (edit: seems to have been highlighted out in a paper, see comments) seems to vastly simplify the process (So even a comparative layman like me can do it). Firstly, we'll be integrating with respect to measure, since the cantor set is obviously discontinuous. I'll also be interpreting the result of integrating the cantor set as $1.63...=1+0.63$ dimensional (correct me if I'm wrong). If your interested I've been investigating this for a while: the inspiration and the investigation . We want to find $\int_C f(x) d \mu(x)$ where the integral is taken over the entire cantor set. We'll let $f(x)=x$ to start. Here's my trick, instead of directly evaluating the integral, redefine the integral in terms of itself. The cantor set is identical under a transformation that thirds the length of the set and places on at $0$ and one at $2/3$. We'll use that now. $$\int_C x \ d\mu (x)=\int_{C/3} x \ d\mu (x)+\int_{C/3} x+{2 \over 3} \ d\mu (x+{2 \over 3})$$ The measure we are using is uniform and defined to evaluate to 1 under the integration scheme, so we can simplify the part on the right hand side. $$\int_C x \ d\mu (x)=\int_{C/3} x \ d\mu (x)+\int_{C/3} x+{2 \over 3} \ d\mu (x)=2 \cdot \int_{C/3} x \ d\mu (x)+\int_{C/3} {2 \over 3} \ d\mu (x)$$ Now do this recursively....
$$\int_{C} x \ d\mu (x)=4 \cdot \int_{C/9} x \ d\mu (x)+2 \cdot \int_{C/9} {2 \over 9} \ d\mu (x)+\int_{c/3} {2 \over 3} \ d\mu(x)$$ $$\int_{C} x \ d\mu (x)=8 \cdot \int_{C/27} x \ d\mu (x)+4 \cdot \int_{C/27} {2/27} \ d\mu (x)+2 \cdot \int_{C/9} {2 \over 9} \ d\mu (x)+\int_{c/3} {2 \over 3} \ d\mu(x)$$ Time for assumptions. I'll assume the first term in this eventually infinite series becomes 0, and we'll be left with... $$\int_{C} x \ d\mu (x)=0+2^{N-1} \cdot \int_{C/{3^N}} {2 \over {3^N}} \ d\mu (x)+...+4 \cdot \int_{C/27} {2 \over 27} \ d\mu (x)+2 \cdot \int_{C/9} {2 \over 9} \ d\mu (x)+\int_{c/3} {2 \over 3} \ d\mu(x)$$ Where N indicates the number of times the equation has been iterated. We now notice that when you third the cantor set, you only half the measure of the resulting set... $$\Rightarrow \int_{C} x \ d\mu (x)=\sum_{j=1}^N \left( {{2^{j-1}} \cdot 2} \over {3^j \cdot 2^j} \right)$$ As $N$ approaches infinity, this sum converges to ${1 \over 2}$ $$\Rightarrow \int_{C} x \ d\mu (x)={1 \over 2}$$ Questions: Did I get the right result? I expected something different from 1/2 since the cantor set has a different dimensionality than just a typical line. My method seems to be able to handle more than just the ternary cantor set, in fact it also gives consistent results when applied to the line. I should also mention that since we know the value for $f(x)=x$ we can derive the result for $f(x)=x^2$ in a very similar way.","['fractal-analysis', 'fractals', 'measure-theory', 'integration']"

But I think that it is not an optimal algorithm, may be it is better to divide my set at an another ratio than one to one because of not equal costs of questions. May be at a ration two to one. Help to find the best solution please. Thank you in advance.","['probability-theory', 'information-theory']"
1245273,"Find $f:C\to\mathbb{R}^2$ continuous and bijective but not open, $C\subset\mathbb{R} ^2$ is closed and connected","Are there a closed connected subspace  $C$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and a continuous, bijective function  $f:C\to\mathbb{R}^2$ that is not open?

$$R=1+\left(\frac{2}{n-1}\right)^{1/2}.$$ I was hoping to use Induction and Rouche's Theorem.  For the base case (n=3) I was easily able to show that the polynomial has $3$ zeros inside $|z|=R$.  It's the base case that's giving me trouble.  I assume that, for $k\geq 3$, the polynomial has exactly $k$ zeros inside $|z|=1+\left(\frac{2}{k-1}\right)^{1/2}$.  Then I want to look at what happens with the polynomial $z^{k+1}+(k+1)z-1$.  Letting $f(z)=z^{k+1}$, $g(z)=(k+1)z-1$, and considering $R=1+\left(\frac{2}{k}\right)^{1/2}$, I can't figure out the moduli of $f$ and $g$ and compare them to verify that I can use Rouche's Theorem.
