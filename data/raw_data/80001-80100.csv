Questions : Let $P(n)$ be of these two types and range restricted to $n \ge 0$ : Any other $P(n)$ with total range $T \ge 24$ ? ( Mathworld missed #12 which is $P(n)=4n^2+4n-1591$ with $T=35$ , so I assume there are more.) Is there one with $T>40$ ? Why does the real quadratic field with $d=398$ appear often? Can a $P(n)$ have two prime ranges that are relatively long? $\color{green}{Update}$ : Regarding question 4. Turns out $P(n)=4n^2+4n+397$ is prime for ranges $n=0-26$ and $n=122-137$ . I also checked $P(n)=n^2+n+41$ and found that the only other long range is $n=219-231$ .","['prime-numbers', 'quadratics', 'class-field-theory', 'number-theory']"
1032113,maximal injective neighborhoods centered at the zero of a polynomial,"I was working on a particular problem involving the injectivity of a certain polynomial, $p(z) = z^5 + z -1$, $z \in \mathbb{C}$, in which I needed to find a neighborhood around it's real root so that $p(z)$ was one to one in, say $D(\alpha,r)$ where $\alpha$ is the real root of the polynomial, and $r > 0$. The natural question to me was: How big can we make $r$ so that $p(z)$ is injective in this disk? I figured that there must be a maximal value, but was not sure how to find (other than numerically), how large r would be. Another question might be to ask what are the largest sets surrounding $p(z)$'s zeros that guarantee injectivity in those regions? It is worthy to note that in this case, all of the zeros of $p(z)$ are of multiplicity $1$, I would assume that it would be impossible to find such a set if there were even multiplicities.","['roots', 'complex-analysis', 'polynomials']"
1032117,Martingale convergence proof,"This is out of Durrett 5.5.7. Let $X_n \in [0,1]$ be adapted to $\mathcal{F_n}$. Let $\alpha,\beta > 0$ such that $\alpha + \beta = 1$. Suppose that
$$
 P(X_{n+1} = \alpha + \beta X_n | \mathcal{F_n}) = X_n, \qquad P(X_{n+1}=\beta X_n | \mathcal{F_n} ) = 1 - X_n
$$
Then $X_n \rightarrow X_{\infty}$ a.s., where $X_{\infty} \in \{0,1\}$, and $P(X_{\infty}=1) = \theta$ if $X_0 = \theta$. Here's my attempt, that I'd like to get some help on. I think the high level idea is right: you show a limit exists a.s. in $[0,1]$, and then you argue the set of sequences which converge to some $\phi \in (0,1)$ must have measure zero. But of course, the formalism is the tricky part. It's easy enough to check that $(X_n)$ is a martingale w.r.t. $(\mathcal{F_n})$. Therefore, by the martingale convergence theorem, we have $X_n \rightarrow X_{\infty}$ a.s. for some $X_{\infty}$. Clearly $X_{\infty} \in [0,1]$. Now, let $\omega \in \Omega$ be such that $X_n(\omega) \rightarrow X_{\infty}(\omega)$, and suppose $X_{\infty}(\omega) = \phi$, where $\phi \in (0,1)$. Clearly, for any $z \in (0,1)$, we have $\beta z < z < \alpha + \beta z$. 
Set 
$$
\epsilon = \min( \phi (1-\beta)/(1+\beta), (\alpha - \phi(1-\beta))/(1+\beta) ).
$$
There exists an $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$, we have $| X_n(\omega) - \phi | \leq \epsilon$. But we have set $\epsilon$ such that
$\alpha + \beta X_n(\omega) > \phi + \epsilon$ and $\beta X_n(\omega) < \phi - \epsilon$. But $X_{n+1}(\omega) \in \{\alpha + \beta X_n(\omega), \beta X_n(\omega)  \}$ ( * I can't figure out how to make this argument here more rigorous * ). Hence,
$$
  P( \{ \omega : X_{\infty}(\omega) \in (0,1) \}) = 0
$$
which yields the first part of the result. Now suppose $X_0 = \theta$. But now we have
$E(X_{\infty}) = P(X_{\infty}=1)$. Since $(X_n)$ is a martingale, $\theta = E(X_0) = E(X_n)$. Since $X_n \rightarrow X_\infty$ a.s., by the dominated convergence theorem we have $E(X_n) \rightarrow E(X_\infty)$, which yields the second result.","['probability-theory', 'martingales', 'convergence-divergence']"

1032137,Derivative of Fourier transform: $F[f]'=F[-ixf(x)]$,"Let us define the Fourier transform of the Lebesgue-summable function $f\in L_1(\mathbb{R},\mu_x)$ as $F[f](\lambda)=\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(x) e^{-i\lambda x} d\mu_x$, where $\mu_x$ is the Lebesgue linear measure.
Kolmogorov-Fomin's (p. 430 here ) states that, if $x\mapsto xf(x)$ is Lebesgue-summable too, then the Fourier transform is differentiable and$$\frac{d}{d\lambda}F[f](\lambda)=-i\int_{\mathbb{R}}x f(x) e^{-i\lambda x} d\mu_x$$ EDIT : I would be very grateful to the people having voted to close the question, and to anybody else, if they explained how to use the question linked as a duplicate to prove this equality , which I am not able to do. I am trying to teach myself and cannot afford university for the moment and have not got the sufficient mathematical ability to understand how that result implies this equality. I heartily thank you all!!! Previous trial of mine which may or may not be useful to prove the given equality: In order to prove the statement to myself I had thought that the fact that if the sequence $\{\varphi_n\}\subset L_1(\mathbb{R},\mu_x)$ converges to $\varphi$ with respect to the metric of $L_1(\mathbb{R},\mu_x)$, then $F[f_n]\xrightarrow{n\to\infty} F[f]$, but I cannot apply it. In fact I see that the derivative $F[f]'(\lambda)$ can be seen, if we define $\varphi_n(x)=f(x)\frac{e^{-ih_n x}-1}{h_n}$, where $\{h_n\}$ converges to 0, as the limit $$\lim_n \int_{\mathbb{R}}f(x)\frac{e^{-i(\lambda+h_n)x}-e^{-i\lambda x}}{h_n}d\mu_x=\lim_n \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) \frac{e^{-ih_n x}-1}{h_n} e^{-i\lambda x} d\mu_x$$$$=\lim_n F[\varphi_n](\lambda)$$but I cannot prove that $\int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) \frac{e^{-ih_n x}-1}{h_n} e^{-i\lambda x} d\mu_x$ converges to $-i\int_{\mathbb{R}}x f(x) e^{-i\lambda x} d\mu_x$. I thought about Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem, but I am not convinced at all that we can majorate $|\varphi_n(x)|$ with a summable function and I am not sure this is the right path to prove the desired equality... P.S.: I assume that the equality holds for any $f\in L_1(\mathbb{R},\mu_x)$ because the book does not specify any other conditions, but it is perfectly in the style of the book to state theorems valid only under certain conditions without explicitly declare them. So, if you noticed that some other condition is needed...","['lebesgue-integral', 'fourier-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
1032228,Continuity of vector space operations in a normed space,"Here's problem 4 immediately following section 2.3 in Erwine Kryszeg's book, Introductory Functional Analysis With Applications : Show that in a normed space $X$, vector addition and scalar multiplication are continuous operations with respect to the norm; that is, the mappings defined by $(x,y) \mapsto x+y$ and $(\alpha,x) \mapsto \alpha x$ are continuous. Now the map $(x,y) \mapsto x+y$ is a map from $X \times X$ to $X$; so we can consider $X\times X$ under the norm defined as follows: 
$$|| (x,y) ||_{X\times X} \colon= ||x||_X + ||y||_X$$ 
for all $(x,y) \in X \times X$. With this norm, we can easily prove the vector addition map to be continuous. But what about the norm on $K \times X$ for the continuity of the scalar multiplication map?

1032318,Product of all elements of a finite group with an unique element of order 2,"I have the following problem from Aluffi's Algebra:
given a finite group $G$ with an unique element $f$ of order $2$ , show that \begin{equation}
\prod_{g\in G}g=f
\end{equation} My reasoning is the following. Since $f$ is the unique element of order $2$ , for each $g\in G$ such that $g\neq e$ and $g\neq f$ , it must be that $g^{-1}\neq g$ . So we can concoct a particular product coupling the elements with their inverses: \begin{equation}
e\cdot f\cdot (g_1\cdot g_1^{-1})\cdot(g_2\cdot g_2^{-1})\cdots (g_n\cdot g_n^{-1})

1032323,Probability and Quantum mechanics,"I don't quite understand how the probability language of sample spaces, $\sigma-$algebra, random variables, etc, fit into the quantum mechanics' formalism. To wit, we usually say that an observable is a linear operator in a Hilbert space, and afterwards we define the ""expected value"" of this operator. But what sense does this make in the probability framework? This is not a random variable in any sense. When we compute the expected value of position or moment, what is our sample space, our algebra, our probability measure? Also, it is always said that $\vert \psi \vert ^{2}$ gives the density probability function (with $\psi$ a solution of the Schrödinger equation)... the density of what random variable?  And what would be the density or distribution of the random variables ""position"" and ""moment""?  Certanly, there must be such random variables. Or they only exist formally as operators in a Hilbert space? But, if so, What sense does it have, formally, to compute its expected value? Thanks","['probability-theory', 'quantum-mechanics']"

The point $(u,t)$ with the minimum $t$ value is picked where $u \leq 0$. But I completely don't understand how I should interpret the dual function $g(\lambda)$ to begin with. $g(\lambda)$ is depicted as a line (hyperplane). But according to the definition of $g(\lambda)$ it must be a scalar value. The dual problem is $g(\lambda) = \inf_x(f_0(x) + \lambda f_1(x))$ where $\lambda \geq 0$. So, for a given $\lambda \geq 0$ we must go and seek a $(u,t)$ point in $G$ which minimizes $g(\lambda)$. How is this connected with a hyperplane to begin with? We are in $(u,t)$ space, which has no $\lambda$ parametrization in it.

We can find $f(1/2)$ as follows: $$e = f(1) = f\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\right) = f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2$$ $$f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{e} = \pm \,e^{1/2}$$ Similarly, $$f\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \sqrt[3]{e} = e^{1/3}$$ We can also get $$f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = e^{2/3}$$ It follows quite quickly that for all $p/q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $p \in \mathbb{Z}$, $q \in \mathbb{N}$ (so that $q > 0$), and $\gcd(p,q)=1$, we have $$f\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = \pm \,e^{p/q}$$ when $q$ is even, and $$f\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = e^{p/q}$$ when $q$ is odd. Since these work for all rationals, we can say that if $f$ is continuous, then $f(x) = e^x$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. But we don't know that $f$ is continuous, so there can definitely still be values of $x$ for which $f(x) \neq e^x$. Namely, $x \in \mathbb{R}$ with $x \not\in\mathbb{Q}$. Let's take the first example of an irrational which comes to mind: $\sqrt{2}$ Consider $f\left(\sqrt{2}\right) \in \mathbb{R}$. Just as we used $f(1) = e$ above, for any rational $p/q$ we can derive $$f\left(\frac{p}{q}\sqrt{2}\right) = e^{p/q}f\left(\sqrt{2}\right)$$ This could have a $\pm$ in front if $q$ is even. In any case, if we ignore the possible negative values, we can look at the graph of this function, plotting the points we know so far. At any rational $x$, it is $e^x$. At $\sqrt{2}$ it is some real number, call it $k$. At any rational multiple of $\sqrt{2}$, $x\sqrt{2}$, it is $ke^x$. So if we only look at rational multiples of $\sqrt{2}$, the function looks like a stretched copy of $e^x$, where the extent of stretching depends on the value of $f\left(\sqrt{2}\right)$. At this point, I thought I'd found a function that satisfied all three properties, and that I could explicitly write its values. Suppose $f\left(\sqrt{2}\right) = 5$ and $f\left(\frac{p}{q}\sqrt{2}\right) = 5e^{p/q}$ for any rational $p/q$. For any other $x \in \mathbb{R}$, we let $f(x) = e^x$. Unfortunately, this falls apart quickly. Consider $$a=\frac{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}}{2}$$ $$b = \frac{\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3}}{2}$$ Neither are multiples of $\sqrt{2}$ but their sum is. $f(a+b) = f\left(\sqrt{2}\right)$ has to simultaneously be $e^\sqrt{2}$ and $5$, which is a problem. My subsequent efforts all resulted in failure. I may have found some functions that satisfied the three conditions, exploiting the $\pm$ that appears with even-denominator fractions, but if I added a fourth condition for $f(x)$ to be positive, I couldn't write out any functions that worked. I asked my professor about this, and he said that it wasn't possible to write out a function, and that was why I wasn't able to. He said that mathematicians only know they exist because of something called a Hamel basis. In a fortunate turn of events, the textbook for my set theory class had a page or two on the existence of a Hamel basis, and it turns out that the proof of their existence requires the Axiom of Choice. We haven't gotten close to talking about the Axiom of Choice in my set theory class, so I'm not too clear on it, and I didn't really understand it. This brings me, at long last, to my question(s). If such functions are impossible to write out explicitly, how do we know they exist? It's not just that we've proven that they exist and simply haven't managed to find one yet, it's that we've proven (somehow!?) that they can't be explicitly written out. Is the proof of the existence of a Hamel basis uncontroversial? Is the assumption of the Axiom of Choice something that every mathematician thinks is a good one? How do we know that it's impossible to write out a function that has positive values and satisfies properites $1$, $2$ and $3$?","['axiom-of-choice', 'elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis', 'functional-equations']"
1032568,Why do two points never 'arrive at once' in a Poisson point process,"In the following, all the measure spaces are endowed with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra corresponding to their topology (we take the usual topology on $[0,\infty)$). Let $E$ be a Polish space and let $\nu$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure on $E$ . Let $\psi$ be a Poisson random measure on the space $E \times [0,\infty)$ with intensity measure $\nu \times dx$ (where $dx$ denotes the Lebesgue measure). It is often said that $$\psi ( E \times \{t\}) \in \{0,1\} \hspace{30pt} (1)$$ almost surely, for all $t \geq 0$. (This allows us to think of the random measure as a dynamic process taking values in $E \cup \{\gamma\}$ where $\gamma$ is an isolated point). But I don't understand this, because $$ (\nu \times dx ) ( E \times \{t\}) = \nu(E) \cdot dx(\{t\}) \leq \infty \cdot 0 = 0 $$ so that the number of arrivals at time $t$ has a Poisson distribution with rate $0$. That is, $0$ points arrive with probability $1$. What is the problem with this reasoning, and how is $(1)$ proved correctly?

1032661,Monty Hall Problem with Five Doors,"My math class went over the original Monty Hall problem a few days ago, then looked at a related question where the number of doors was increased to five. There was a struggle to figure out what the answer to the problem is, and after coming back to it a few more times we're still a bit unclear. In this extended problem, let's say you pick door A out of doors A, B, C, D and E. The host then opens one of the other doors to show it's empty and gives you the choice to stay or switch to one of the other remaining doors.
a) If you always stay with the door you picked, what is the probability of winning?
b) If you always switch to another door, what is the probability of winning? Note that the host will open only one door. All the extended Monty Hall problems I found online had the host open all but one, so they weren't really helpful with this particular problem my class is working on. I calculated that the chances are 1/4 regardless of whether you switch or not since the host opening only one empty door is not enough to truly affect the difference in win rates between staying and switching. Is that right? EDIT: Sorry about the confusion for me not being clear enough. The problem I bring is indeed ising the same basic principles as the original: the host will always open a door after you choose one to show it is empty, and then you are given the choice. The reason why I got to 1/4 is because I was looking at the situation by figuring out how many ways can you win/lose depending on where the prize is after the host opens an empty door as well as which door you switched to, which gave me 3/12 for every switch or 1/4 (or by putting it all together i got 12/48).

1032665,Continuum Approach to Modeling Cell Proliferation and Differentiation (PDE),"I'm new here so I hope this post is appropriate. I recently read in a bioengineering textbook about an approach to model cell proliferation and differentiation. They proposed the following partial differential equation: $$ \frac{\partial X}{\partial t} +  \delta  \frac{\partial X}{\partial \lambda} =  \big( \mu - \alpha \big) X $$ $X$ is number of cells. $t$ is time. $\lambda$ is the differentiation state, and can only have values between 0 and 1, which I will discuss below. $\delta$, $\mu$, and $\alpha$ are differentiation rate, proliferation rate, and death rate, respectively, and have units of inverse time. I'll assume they are all constant for the time being. I would be fine in solving this partial differential equation except for my interpretation of $\lambda$. In the population X, there are two kinds of cells, which I will call A and B. A transforms into B. Their sum is X.
$$A + B = X$$
If $\lambda = 0$, then X is entirely composed of A. If $\lambda = 1$, then X is entirely composed of B. That is all my textbook tells me, but I would like to understand this further. From my understanding, $\lambda$ could therefore be defined as:
$$\lambda = \frac{B}{X} = \frac{B}{A+B} $$ At first glance to me, $X$ should be a function of $t$ and $\lambda$, but if I'm saying that $\lambda$ is a function of A and B, does that mean that $X$ is only a function of time $t$? Another question I have is about the implications of $\delta$. Does $\delta$ simply imply a transformation, or transformation and increase in numbers, based solely on the differentiation equation above. I hope this question is not too biological for this forum.

1032814,Gaussian Curvature,"I am able to show that if a curve lies in a plane then it's curvature at a point $p$ is $$\kappa=\lim_{\mu\to 0}\frac{\sigma}{\mu}$$ where $\mu$ is the length of a segment of the curve containing p, and $\sigma$ is the length of the arc on $S^1$ formed by translating the velocity vectors of this segment to the origin. Analogously, it can be shown that the Gaussian curvature at a point p on a surface, is given by $$\lim_{A\to 0}\frac{A^\prime}{A}$$ where $A$ is the area of a region containing $p$ and $A^\prime$ the area of the corresponding region on $S^2$ under the Gauss map. (Apparently this is how Gauss defined the curvature) We also know that the Gaussian curvature is the product of the principal curvatures. But the principal curvatures are the curvatures of plane curves by definition (curvatures of normal sections). Hence the principal curvatures are given by the first limit above. So I guess this means that $$\lim_{A\to 0}\frac{A^\prime}{A}=\left(\lim_{\mu_1\to 0}\frac{\sigma_1}{\mu_1}\right)\left(\lim_{\mu_2\to 0}\frac{\sigma_2}{\mu_2}\right)$$ where $\mu_1,\mu_2,\sigma_1,\sigma_2$ correspond to the two normal sections. How does this happen? Does this mean that the area $A^\prime$ is equal to the product of the two arc lengths $\sigma_1\sigma_2$?

1032832,Fourier transforms in combinatorics,"I've got something like a ""meta-question"": In some parts of combinatorics, looking at Fourier transforms can be a very helpful tool. For example, an early proof of Roth's theorem (any sufficiently large subset $A$ of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ of some given density contains an arithmetic progression of length $3$ (or, more general, length $k$, but then the proof I'm going to briefly sketch won't work)) builds on using Fourier transforms. Essentially, you prove that either $A$ contains an AP of length $3$ or there exists some $r$ such that $\hat A(r)$ is fairly large (where $A$ is also used to denote the indicator function of the set $A$ and $\hat A$ denotes its Fourier transform, i.e. $\hat A(r)=\mathbb{E}f(x)\omega^{-rx}$). You then go on to show that the latter implies that there exists an AP $A'$ of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, which is fairly long and moreover, when viewed as a subset of $A$, it larger density and this eventually has to stop. Now, my question is: How should I think about $A$ having a large Fourier coefficient as in the proof? What does this tell me?","['fourier-analysis', 'combinatorics']"

Kolmogorov-Fomin's Элементы теории функций и функционального анализа states ( p. 430 ) that the complex function defined by $$g(z)=\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(x)e^{-ixz}d\mu_x$$where the integral is Lebesgue's, $\mu_x$ is Lebesgue linear measure and $z=\lambda+i\nu$, $\lambda,\nu\in\mathbb{R}$ is a complex variable, is analytic in $\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|\nu|<\delta\}$. I clearly see that the integral is the Fourier transform of $f(x)e^{\nu x}$. By trying to prove the analiticity of $g$ I have convinced myself that, if $x\mapsto e^{\delta|x|}f(x)$ is Lebesgue-summable on $\mathbb{R}$, then $x\mapsto xf(x)$ also is. If that is correct, then I think we could use the Cauchy-Riemann equations and calculate the two partial derivatives with respect to $\lambda$ by using$^1$ the fact , where I call $F$ the Fourier transform, that $\frac{d}{d\lambda}F[e^{\nu x}f(x)](\lambda)=-iF[xe^{\nu x}f(x)]$.

but that the other five outcomes are equally likely. What is the probability that an odd number
appears when we roll this die? My Question The solution from my book is as follows: We want to find the probability of the event $E = {1, 3, 5}$. By Exercise 2, we have
$p(1) = p(2) = p(4) = p(5) = p(6) = 1/7; p(3) = 2/7$.
It follows that
$p(E) = p(1) + p(3) + p(5) = 1/7 + 2/7 + 1/7 = 4/7$. I'm wondering why is it that $p(1) = p(2) .. = 1/7$. Where do we get this number?","['discrete-mathematics', 'probability']"

Suppose we are given a morphism $\pi:X\rightarrow Y$. We know that if $\pi$ is smooth, it is flat (by definition) and all the fibers  are smooth of dimension $m-n$. Under these assumptions: if all the (geometric) fibers are smooth of dimension $m-n$, does it follow that $\pi$ is flat (and hence smooth, e.g. by Vakil, Theorem 25.2.2) more generally, can we say something about flatness of $\pi$ even if the fibers are not smooth, but still of constant dimension? The first part is exercise 25.2.F from Vakil. We can readily perform a number of reductions to simplify the question: the question is local on the target and on the source, so locally we can replace $Y$ by $\mathbb{A}^n_k$, by choosing an étale surjective map to $\mathbb{A}^n_k$. We can also replace $X$ by a smooth affine variety. It should also be sufficient to check this at closed points. Hence we have a morphism of rings $B \colon= k[y_1,\dots,y_n]\rightarrow A$, where A is a finitely generated $k$-algebra of dimension $m$ with $\Omega_{\mathrm{Spec }A/k}$ locally free of rank $m$, such that all the tensor products with maximal ideals of $B$ are (possibly smooth) of dimension $m-n$.
Does it follow that $A$ is a flat $B$-algebra? I must say that I don't really know how to approach this. I can't seem to relate the flatness and smoothness conditions, and the answer to this question is clearly false if $Y$ is not smooth, think of the normalization of the node, where all fibers are smooth of dimension $0$ (and probably also if $X$ isn't, although I don't have a counterexample in my head).",['algebraic-geometry']

(Better yet, a first-countable such space.) Recall that a subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is called a zero-set if there is a continuous function $f : X \to [0,1]$ such that $A = f^{-1} (0)$. Clearly zero-sets are always closed G δ . However a closed G δ -set need not be a zero set: the Moore plane has the property that all closed subsets are G δ , and furthermore every subset of the $x$-axis is closed. However the closed G δ -set $A = \{ (x,0) : x \in \mathbb{Q} \}$ is not a zero-set. A relatively simple consequence of Urysohn's Lemma is that in a normal space the zero-sets are exactly the closed G δ -sets. Therefore, in a normal (Hausdorff) space with G δ singletons, all singletons are zero-sets. I have been trying to think of a completely regular (Hausdorff) space with G δ singletons which has a singleton which is not a zero-set. Note that the Moore plane is not an example.

Suppose we can find the eigenfunctions of the operator $\Omega$, namly $\Omega f=\lambda f $ ($\lambda$ is constant), so that any solution $f$ can be represented by linear sum of these eigenfunctions (very similar to Schrödinger equation). 
Unfortunately, no more functions other than the three above are found, though I expect that there should be some more complicated eigenfunctions, such as Fourier series. Now I am looking into wavelet theories to find a new clue. Any suggestions on the general solution to $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+f\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} =\frac{2f^2}{x}$, or to the eigenfunctions for operator $\Omega f=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} - \frac{2f}{x}$?","['eigenfunctions', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'fourier-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

Therefore we may write $f(z)=\sum_{0}^{k} c_nz^n$ where $c_n$ is Taylorian coefficients of $f$.

I want to understand whether this is true for the category of locally ringed spaces. The standard sources for categorical properties (nLab and Stacks project) do not say or contradict this fact explicitly. Though they say that the fiber product of schemes is automatically fiber product in the category of locally ringed spaces (remark 16.2 in the Schemes chapter of Stacks project). The simplest locally ringed space which is not a scheme is a single point with a local ring (which is not a field) as a structure sheaf. The tensor product of local rings need not be a local ring, but it seems possible that this tensor product is always the direct product of local rings. For fields this is true, and I was unable to verify it for the general case. Even if this holds (which I highly doubt), it's still possible that more complicated fibered product do not exist.

Since $f$ is an 'uneven' function it follows that $f(0)=-f(0) \implies f(0)=0$ so that's one check out of the above list $\checkmark$ Differentiating the first given expression I'd obtain $$f'(x+y)=f'(x)g(y)+f(y)g'(x) \implies f'(0)=f'(0)g(0)+f(0)g'(0)=g(0)=1 $$

It seems like it is crucial that $g'(0)=0$ in order to show the remaining two properties out of my list above. Which so far I didn't manage to do because all my steps are circular: $$f'(y)= f'(0)g(y)+f(y)g'(0)=g(y)+f(y)g'(0) \tag{*} $$
