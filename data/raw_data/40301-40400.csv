396000,Methods for determining the convergence of $\sum\frac{\cos n}{n}$ or $\sum\frac{\sin n}{n}$,"As far as I know, the textbook approach to determining the convergence of series like $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\cos n}{n}$$ and $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\sin n}{n}$$ uses Dirichlet's test, which involves bounding the partial sums of the cosine or sine terms. I have two questions: Are there any other approaches to seeing that these series are convergent? I'm mostly just interested to see what other kinds of arguments might be made. What's the best way to show that these two series are only conditionally convergent? I don't even know the textbook approach to that question.","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series']"
396006,Having trouble using eigenvectors to solve differential equations,"The question asked to solve $$\frac{dx}{dy} = \begin{pmatrix}
        5 & 4 \\
        -1 & 1\\
        \end{pmatrix}x$$ ,where $$ x = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ 
x_2 \\ \end{pmatrix}$$ I went ahead an found the determinant of matrix $$ |A - I\lambda| = \lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 9$$
And found $\lambda = 3$ Then the $\alpha$ matrices was found to be $$ \begin{pmatrix}
5 & 4\\
-1 & 1\\
\end{pmatrix} \alpha = 3\alpha$$ where $$\alpha = \begin{pmatrix} 
\alpha_1 \\
\alpha_2 \\
\end{pmatrix}$$ Ultimately $-\alpha_1 = 2\alpha_2$ so I write $$\alpha = \begin{pmatrix} 
-1 \\
2 \\
\end{pmatrix}$$ Then because $\lambda$ is a repeated root I know the solution is supposed to look something like this: $$x = c_1\alpha e^{\lambda t} + c_2( \alpha t + \beta) e^{\lambda t}t$$ And then this is where it gets tricky for me. I know we find the $\beta$ matrix by figuring this out: $$(A - I\lambda)\beta = \alpha$$ Now when I multiply all that out I get $$2\beta_1 + 4\beta_2 = -1$$
$$\beta_1 + 2\beta_2 = -2$$ This is the system of equations I can't seem to solve to get a suitable $\beta$. One option I have is to make $$\beta = \begin{pmatrix} 
0\\
-1\\

396014,Bound on expectation of absolute value in terms of variance,"In my book it says that a white noise process $\{Z_t\}$ with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$ has the following property: E$|Z_t| \leq \sigma$. This had me thinking of Jensen's inequality, that $\text{E}(g(X)) \geq g(\text{E}(X))$, for convex functions g. Since we have that $\text{E}(Z^2_t) = \sigma^2$ and $\text{E}(Z_t) = 0$, we could apply this inequality to to  $\text{E}(Z_t)$ and obtain $\text{E}(|Z_t|) \geq |\text{E}(Z_t)| = 0$, since the absolute value is a convex function.  But we need the upper bound, and the inequality is only for convex functions, so we can't use $\text{E}(Z^2_t) = \sigma^2$ and take square roots on both sides..","['time-series', 'probability']"
396028,hint with Bayes rule problem,"The pirate Captain Queequeg has a lazy crew and suspects they are planning to stage a mutiny. Captain Queequeg's solution is to have every member of the crew roll Queequeg's lucky die. If the roll is even, the crew member must walk the plank. If the roll is odd, the crew member must take a swig of truth serum and then reveal his or her true intent. If the crew member was planning on mutiny, he or she must walk the plank, and if not, is allowed to remain on the ship. Queequeg's die has been cursed so that evens are rolled 61% of the time. Crew members are either lazy or mutinous but not both. Of the crew members who take the serum, 18% are forced to reveal they were planning mutiny. 1) What is the chance a crew member will walk the plank, given he or she is mutinous? 2) What is the chance a crew member will walk the plank, given he or she is just plain lazy (but not mutinous)? 3) What is the chance a crew member is mutinous, given he or she walked the plank? This is what I have so far: The probability of walking the plank seems to be $P(\text{plank}) = P(\text{mutinous} \cap \text{odd})+P(\text{lazy} \cap \text{even})$ $P(\text{plank}) = P(\text{mutinous})P(\text{odd})+P(\text{lazy})P(\text{even})$ Rolling the die is independent of being mutinous or lazy. $P(\text{lazy})= P(\lnot \text{mutinous})$ 1) I tried applying Bayes rule, but then I need the posterior probability from part 3) first. $$P(\text{plank} \mid \text{mutinous}) = {P(\text{mutinous} \mid \text{plank})P(\text{plank}) \over P(mutinous)}$$ Expanding the likelihood using total probability $$P(\text{plank} \mid \text{mutinous}) = {P(\text{mutinous} \mid \text{plank})P(\text{plank}) \over P(\text{mutinous} \mid \text{plank})P(\text{plank}) + P(\text{mutinous} \mid \lnot \text{plank})P(\lnot \text{plank})}$$ Using conditional probability, substituting the joint probability for the posterior and prior $$P(\text{plank}\mid\text{mutinous}) = {P(\text{mutinous} \cap \text{plank}) \over P(\text{mutinous}\mid\text{plank})P(\text{plank}) + P(\text{mutinous}\mid\lnot\text{plank})P(\lnot\text{plank})}$$ Being mutinous and walking the plank aren't independent events, so I am not sure where to go from here.","['bayesian', 'probability']"

  $(b^ic^ja^k) (b^{i'}c^{j'}a^{k'}) = b^{i+i'}c^{j+j'+ki'}a^{k+k'}$ The order of $(b^ic^ja^k)$ is n if n is odd and 2n if n is even. Now suppose that $s: K \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha} K$ is given by s(k)=(e,k) and $i : H \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha} K$ is given by $i(h)=(h,e)$. Proposition 4.6.9 Let Î± : K â†’ Aut(H) be a homomorphism. Suppose given homomorphisms $f_1$ : H â†’ G and $f_2$ : K â†’ G for a group G. Then there is a homomorphism f : $H \rtimes_{\alpha}$ K â†’ G with $f_1 = f$ â—¦ i and $f_2$ = f â—¦ s if and only if $f_2(k)f_1(h)(f_2(k))^{âˆ’1} = f_1(\alpha(k)(h))$ for all h âˆˆ H and k âˆˆ K.

  4.6.9, that $G$ is isomorphic to the group constructed in Corollary 4.6.8. I already showed that $G$ is a group under matrix multiplication, but I'm having trouble with the second part of this problem. Let $G = \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \bar{x} & \bar{y} \\0 & 1 & \bar{z} \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \mid \bar{x}, \bar{y}, \bar{z} \in Z_n \right\}$ Let $G' = \{ b^ic^ja^k \mid 0 \leq i, j, k < n \}$ where a, b, c all have order n, and b commutes with c, a commutes with c, and $aba^{-1} = bc$. Thus, $$(b^ic^ja^k)(b^{i'}c^{j'}a^{k'}) = b^{i+i'}c^{j + j' + ki'}a^{k+k'}.$$ I want to show that G is isomorphic to G' by using proposition 4.6.9 However, in order to use that proposition, I need to come up with an H and a K, right? So... Let $H = \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 1 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \right\}$ Let K=G Obviously $G \cong H \rtimes_{\alpha} K$ Let $f_1 : H \rightarrow Gâ€™$ be the trivial homomorphism.

So the homomorphism $f: H \rtimes_{\alpha} K \rightarrow G$ exists. So now we just need to show that this homomorphism is an isomorphism. I tried to show that by proving that $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \bar{x} & \bar{y} \\0 & 1 & \bar{z} \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ has order n when n is odd and order 2n when n is even.

We need to show that, for 2(w+1)+1 = 2w+3, an exponent of $ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \bar{x} & \bar{y} \\0 & 1 & \bar{z} \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ must be 2w+3. By induction, we know that $$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \bar{x} & \bar{y} \\0 & 1 & \bar{z} \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}^{2w+1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & (2w+1)\bar{x} & (2w+1)\bar{y}+(2w+1)\bar{xz} \\0 & 1 & (2w+1)\bar{z} \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$ However, $$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \bar{x} & \bar{y} \\0 & 1 & \bar{z} \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}^{2w+3} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \bar{x} & \bar{y} \\0 & 1 & \bar{z} \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}^{2w+1} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \bar{x} & \bar{y} \\0 & 1 & \bar{z} \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}^2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & (2w+1)\bar{x} & (2w+1)\bar{y}+(2w+1)\bar{xz} \\0 & 1 & (2w+1)\bar{z} \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2\bar{x} & 2(\bar{y})+\bar{xz} \\0 & 1 & 2\bar{z} \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2(\bar{x})+(2w+1)(\bar{x}) & 2(\bar{y})+\bar{xz}+(2w+1)(\bar{x})(2)(\bar{z})+ (2w+1)(\bar{xz})+(2w+1)\bar{y} \\0 & 1 & (2w+1)\bar{z}+2(\bar{z}) \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$ But that wasnâ€™t the result we were supposed to get, right?

396943,Proving one function is greater than another,"How can I prove $f(x)$ $>$ $g(x)$ for all $x > 0$ given $f(x) = (x+1)^{2}$ and $g(x) = 4qx$ where $q$ is a constant in $(0, 1)$? My approach was to show that $(x+1)^2 > 4qx$ for the interval endpoints, e.g. $q=0$ and $q=1$. E.g. $(x+1)^2 \geq 4x$ for all $x$ and $(x+1)^2 > 0$ for all $x$. However, $q \neq 0,1$ so $f(x) > g(x)$ for all $x$. However, I'm looking for something more mathematically rigorous. Any suggestions?",['calculus']
396949,Question about comultiplication,"I have a question about comultiplication for coalgebras: Suppose $C$ is a coalgebra over the field $k$. How does one show that the comultiplication map $\Delta:C\to C\otimes C$ is a coalgebra map if and only if $C$ is cocommutative? The main problem that I encounter is that when I tried to do it by definition, I was struggling to find a relation between $c_{(1)(2)}$ and $c_{(2)(1)}$. In that case, is there any other way for which I could tackle this question?","['hopf-algebras', 'coalgebras', 'abstract-algebra']"
396955,Application of Urysohn's lemma,"I am working on the following hw problem: If we have that $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space, with $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}$, then we can find a finite number of continous functions $f_1,...,f_k$, with $f_i:X\mapsto [0,1]$ such that $f_1(x)+...+f_k(x)=1$ for all $x$, and for each $i$ there exists a $\alpha_i$ such that $\overline{f_i^{-1}((0,1])}\subset U_{\alpha_i}$. So this are my thoughts at the moment. Since $X$ is Hausdorff and compact it is normal, so we know that Urysohn's lemma applies. Meaning, if I have any two disjoint sets I can find a continous function that is $0$ is one of the sets and $1$ in the other one. My intuition is telling me to use compactness and find $U_{\alpha_1},..., U_{\alpha_k}$ that cover $X$, and then by the last requirement of the problem we would need $f_i(x)=0$ if $x\notin U_{\alpha_i}$. The problem is very clear if I can write my space $X$ as the disjoint union of finite closed sets cause then I could just apply Urysohns and get my functions very easily, but I do not see how to apply this lemma using the open cover given. Any hints would be greatly appreciated.",['general-topology']

396967,$-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ if and only if $p\equiv 1\pmod{4}$,I came across this problem and I believe Lagrange's theorem is the key to its solution.

396982,Fisher information of a Binomial distribution,"The Fisher information is defined as $\mathbb{E}\Bigg( \frac{d \log f(p,x)}{dp} \Bigg)^2$, where $f(p,x)={{n}\choose{x}} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$ for a Binomial distribution. The derivative of the log-likelihood function is $L'(p,x) = \frac{x}{p} - \frac{n-x}{1-p}$. Now, to get the Fisher infomation we need to square it and take the expectation. First, we know, that $\mathbb{E}X^2$ for $X \sim Bin(n,p)$ is $ n^2p^2 +np(1-p)$. Let's first focus on on the content of the paratheses. $$
\begin{align}
\Bigg( \frac{x}{p} - \frac{n-x}{1-p} \Bigg)^2&=\frac{x^2-2nxp+n^2p^2}{p^2(1-p)^2}
\end{align}
$$ No mistake so far (I hope!). \begin{align}
\mathbb{E}\Bigg( \frac{x}{p} - \frac{n-x}{1-p} \Bigg)^2 &= \sum_{x=0}^n \Bigg( \frac{x}{p} - \frac{n-x}{1-p} \Bigg)^2 {{n}\choose{x}} p^x (1-p)^{n-x} \\
&=\sum_{x=0}^n \Bigg( \frac{x^2-2nxp+n^2p^2}{p^2(1-p)^2} \Bigg) {{n}\choose{x}} p^x (1-p)^{n-x} \\
&= \frac{n^2p^2+np(1-p)-2n^2p^2+n^2p^2}{p^2(1-p)^2}\\
&=\frac{n}{p(1-p)}
\end{align} The result should be $\frac{1}{p(1-p)} $ but I've been staring at this for a few hours incapable of getting a different answer. Please let me know whether I'm making any arithmetic mistakes.","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'probability-theory']"
396988,Group actions and associated bundles,"Let $P$ be a principal $G$-bundle over $B$, and let $G$ act on some space $F$ (feel free to work in your favorite category of spaces, if this helps). Then $\text{Aut}{P}$ (aka the group of gauge transformations of $P$) acts on the space of sections of the associated bundle $P\times_G F$ as follows: if $\alpha\in\text{Aut}P$ then for each section $s\colon B\to P\times_G F$ we define $(\alpha\cdot s)(x)=[(\alpha u_x,f)]$ where $s(x)=[(u_x,f)]$ (since $\alpha$ is equivariant, this definition is independent of the representative $(u_x,f)$ for $s(x)$). For brevity let us agree to denote by $a$ the action of $G$ on $F$, and by $A$ the action of $\text{Aut}{P}$ on $P\times_G F$. My questions are the following: what properties of $a$ pass to $A$, in general (i.e. for any $P$)? In particular, what about transitivity? It might be worthwhile to check a few special cases. If $a$ is the trivial action then $A$ is also trivial. If $a$ is the action of $G$ on itself by conjugation then $A$ is (up to some isomorphism) the action of $\text{Aut}P$ on itself by conjugation (where the multiplication is composition of automorphisms). If $a$ is the action of $G$ on itself by multiplication and $P$ is trivial then $A$ is (again up to some isomorphism) the action of $\text{Aut}P$ on itself by composition (here the case $P$ non-trivial implies $P\times_G G\simeq P$ has no section, making the question moot). In all these cases it can be seen that transitivity, freeness, faithfulness pass from $a$ to $A$. EDIT: I split the question in two, so the part dealing with the case $P$ trivial has now become this other question .","['principal-bundles', 'differential-geometry', 'fiber-bundles', 'group-actions', 'gauge-theory']"
