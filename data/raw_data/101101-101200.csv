1403857,Rudin's Rank theorem,"Rudin states the following: 9.32 Theorem: Suppose $m,n,$ are nonnegative integers, $m\geq r,n\geq r$, $F$ is a $C^1$ mapping of an open set $E\subset R^n$ into $R^m$, and $F'(x)$ has rank $r$ for every $x\in E$. Fix $a\in E$, put $A=F'(a)$, Let $Y_1$ be the range of A, and let $P$ be the projection in $R^m$ whose range if $Y_1$. Let $Y_2$ be the null space of $P$. Then there are open sets $U$ and $V$ in $R^n$, with $a\in U,U\subset E$ and there is a 1-1 mapping $H$ of $V$ onto $U$(whose inverse is also of class $C^1$) such that (66) $F(H(x))=Ax+\phi(Ax)$ $(x\in V)$ where $\phi$ is a $C^1$ mapping of open set $A(V)\subset Y_1$ into $Y_2$. So basically, I got the intuition (from his remarks after the proof) that $F$ can basically be projected in a one-to-one manner in some neighborhood of $a$ and that this projection determines $F$. However, I don't think my intuition fully got it. The problem however is the following, why use $H$? What's the point of introducing something this absurd? Can anyone please explain? Thanks. Edit: I just thought that maybe this is because $P$ is arbitrary and we need to make a certain change of coordinates to accomodate for that, but I don't see why.","['analysis', 'multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"
1403861,"Continuity of a ""minimal distance"" projection $f:(X,d) \to (K, d_{|K})$ for a compact $K \subset X$. (Hint preferred)","Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and $K$ be a compact subset of $X$. Show that for every $x \in X$ there exists $k_x \in K$ such that $$d(x,K)=d(x,k_x)$$ Suppose that for every $x\in X$, there exists a unique $k_x \in K$ such that $$d(x,k_x)= d(x,K).$$ Show that the projection $f:(X,d) \to (K, d_{|K})$, $f(x) = k_x$ is continuous. I have solved the first question by extracting a convergent subsequence of the sequence $(k_n)$ in $K$ such that $d(x,k_n) - d(x,K)< \frac{1}{n}$. Now for the second one, I supposed that the easiest path would be to show that if $A$ is closed in $K$ then $f^{-1}(A)$ is also closed, hoping to use the fact that a closed subset of a compact  set is compact. However, I seem to be missing something: Supposing that $f^{-1}(A)$ is non-empty, I choose a convergent sequence $(x_n) \in f^{-1} (A)^{\mathbb{N}}$ with limit $x_0$. Now i need to show that $f(x_0) \in A$ but it seems to lead me to a dead end. Source: University exercise sheet","['metric-spaces', 'general-topology', 'compactness']"

1404023,Solving the equation $ x^2-7y^2=-3 $ over integers,"I'd like to solve the following Pell equation:
$$
x^2-7y^2=-3
$$
Where $x$ and $y$ are integers. I applied the usual procedure, which avoids continued fractions: The two minimal positive integer solutions are $(x_0,y_0)=(2,1)$ and $(x_1,y_1)=(5,2)$, thus the minimal rational solution of $x^2-7y^2=1$ should be $(p,q)=\left(\frac{4}{3},\frac{1}{3}\right)$. My script (it is in german so I don't link it here) tells me, that in this case, every pair of solutions is given by:
$$
x_{n+1}=\frac{4}{3}x_{n}+7\cdot\frac{1}{3}y_n \\
y_{n+1}=\frac{1}{3}x_{n}+\frac{4}{3}y_n
$$
If we proceed further, we can find that this gives:
$$
x_n=\frac{a_n}{3^n} \space\text{where}\space a_0=2,\space a_1=15,\space a_{n+1}=8a_n-9a_{n-1} \\
y_n=\frac{b_n}{3^n} \space\text{where}\space b_0=1,\space b_1=6,\space b_{n+1}=8b_n-9b_{n-1}

1404130,Hessian Matrix of an Angle in Terms of the Vertices,"I am attempting to derive the analytical formula for the Hessian matrix of a the second derivatives of the value of an angle in terms of the (9) coordinates of the 3 3D points that define it. While I have derived a formula for this (given below), when I attempt to validate it numerically, I get incorrect answers; e.g., non-symmetric matrices. I suspect that I have misunderstood or misapplied some principle of vector calculus in coming up with these formulae and would appreciate it if anyone can either (a) find the error, (b) provide an alternate formula, or (c) point me toward a derivation elsewhere. Consider the following three points: $a = (x_a, y_a, z_a)\\ b = (x_b, y_b, z_b)\\ c = (x_c, y_c, z_c)$ Let $\theta = \arccos\left( \frac{b - a}{||b - a||} \cdot \frac{c - a}{||c - a||} \right)$ be the angle between vectors $\mathbf{v}_{ab} = b-a$ and $\mathbf{v}_{ac} = c-a$.
Additionally, let $\mathbf{u}_{ab} = \frac{b - a}{||b - a||}$ and $\mathbf{u}_{ac} = \frac{c - a}{||c - a||}$. I am performing a minimization for which I need a closed form of both the gradient vector and Hessian matrix of $\theta$ in terms of the coordinates of the points $a$, $b$, and $c$. The details of the problem are not important aside from the fact that estimation is not an option due to the size of the problem. Formally, the formula I need are: $\nabla \theta = \begin{pmatrix}
  \partial\theta/\partial x_a\\
  \partial\theta/\partial y_a\\
  \partial\theta/\partial z_a\\
  \vdots\\
  \partial\theta/\partial z_c
\end{pmatrix}\;$ and $\;\mathbf{H}(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix}
   \partial^2 \theta / \partial x_a^2 & \partial^2 \theta / \partial x_a \partial y_a & \cdots & \partial^2 \theta / \partial x_a \partial z_c \\
   \partial^2 \theta / \partial y_a \partial x_a & \partial^2 \theta / \partial y_a^2 & \cdots & \partial^2 \theta / \partial y_a \partial z_c \\
   \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
   \partial^2 \theta / \partial z_c \partial x_z & \partial^2 \theta / \partial z_c \partial y_a & \cdots & \partial^2 \theta / \partial z_c^2
\end{pmatrix}$ I have already found the gradient analytically and tested it numerically; I define it as follows: $\nabla \theta = \begin{pmatrix} \theta_a \\ \theta_b \\ \theta_c \end{pmatrix}$ where $\theta_a$, $\theta_b$, and $\theta_c$ are column vectors representing $\nabla \theta$ in terms of points $a$, $b$, and $c$: $\theta_a = \begin{pmatrix} \partial \theta / \partial x_a \\ \partial \theta / \partial y_a \\ \partial \theta / \partial z_a \\\end{pmatrix} = -(\theta_b + \theta_c) \\
 \theta_b = \begin{pmatrix} \partial \theta / \partial x_b \\ \partial \theta / \partial y_b \\ \partial \theta / \partial z_b \\\end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{||c-b||}(\mathbf{u}_{ab} \cot\theta - \mathbf{u}_{ac} \csc\theta)\\
 \theta_c = \begin{pmatrix} \partial \theta / \partial x_c \\ \partial \theta / \partial y_c \\ \partial \theta / \partial z_c \\\end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{||c-b||}(\mathbf{u}_{ac} \cot\theta - \mathbf{u}_{ab} \csc\theta) $ I would like to derive the Hessian using this gradient as a starting place; i.e., if I could find $\mathbf{J}(\theta_b)$ and $\mathbf{J}(\theta_c)$ (where $\mathbf{J}(f)$ is the Jacobian matrix of $f$) in terms of the coordinates $x_a, y_a ... z_c$, expressing the Hessian would be a trivial matter of packing the Jacobians into a larger matrix: $\mathbf{H}(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix}
 \mathbf{J}(\theta_a) & \mathbf{J}(\theta_b) & \mathbf{J}(\theta_c)
 \end{pmatrix}$ To further simplify, I can split the Jacobians further into the following $3\times 3$ sub-matrices and express the Hessian using them: $\mathbf{H}(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix}
 \theta_{aa} & \theta_{ba} & \theta_{ca} \\
 \theta_{ab} & \theta_{bb} & \theta_{cb} \\
 \theta_{ac} & \theta_{bc} & \theta_{cc}
 \end{pmatrix}$ where $\theta_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
 \partial \theta_i / \partial x_j   & 
   \partial \theta_i / \partial y_j & 
   \partial \theta_i / \partial z_j
 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
 \partial^2 \theta / \partial x_i \partial x_j   & 
   \partial^2 \theta / \partial x_i \partial y_j & 
   \partial^2 \theta / \partial x_i \partial z_j \\
 \partial^2 \theta / \partial y_i \partial x_j   & 
   \partial^2 \theta / \partial y_i \partial y_j & 
   \partial^2 \theta / \partial y_i \partial z_j \\
 \partial^2 \theta / \partial z_i \partial x_j   & 
   \partial^2 \theta / \partial z_i \partial y_j & 
   \partial^2 \theta / \partial z_i \partial z_j \\
 \end{pmatrix}$. Note that $\theta_{ij} = \theta_{ji}^\intercal$. I now go about deriving the functions $\theta_{ij}$, starting with $\theta_{ba}$, $\theta_{bb}$, $\theta_{bc}$, $\theta_{ca}$, and $\theta_{cc}$. Using these, the remainder will be trivial to derive. I formulate these matrices by considering the dot product of a column vector, $\theta_i$ with $\nabla_j^\intercal = \begin{pmatrix} \partial/\partial x_j & \partial/\partial y_j & \partial/\partial z_j \end{pmatrix}$:
$\theta_{ij} = \theta_i \cdot \nabla_j^\intercal$. To simplify the derivation slightly, note that the following can be easily defined: $\mathbf{J}_i(\mathbf{u}_{ij}) = \begin{pmatrix}
  \partial x_{\mathbf{u}_{ij}} / \partial x_i &
     \partial x_{\mathbf{u}_{ij}} / \partial y_i &
     \partial x_{\mathbf{u}_{ij}} / \partial z_i \\
  \partial y_{\mathbf{u}_{ij}} / \partial x_i &
     \partial y_{\mathbf{u}_{ij}} / \partial y_i &
     \partial y_{\mathbf{u}_{ij}} / \partial z_i \\
  \partial z_{\mathbf{u}_{ij}} / \partial x_i &
     \partial z_{\mathbf{u}_{ij}} / \partial y_i &
     \partial z_{\mathbf{u}_{ij}} / \partial z_i \\
 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{v}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf{v}_{ij}^\intercal - ||\mathbf{v}_{ij}||^2 \mathbf{I}$. Additionally, if we let $\gamma(i,j) = 1/||\mathbf{v}_{ij}||$ (this cleans up the notation slightly), then we have: $\nabla_i \gamma(i,j) = \begin{pmatrix}
   \partial \gamma(i,j) / \partial x_i \\
   \partial \gamma(i,j) / \partial y_i \\
   \partial \gamma(i,j) / \partial z_i
 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{v}_{ij} / ||\mathbf{v}_{ij}||^3$. We can now begin the derivation; using the notation defined above, we can start with $\theta_{ba}$: $\begin{align}
\theta_{ba} &= \theta_b \cdot \nabla_a^\intercal \\
  &= (\gamma(b,c) \mathbf{u}_{ab}\cot\theta - \gamma(b,c) \mathbf{u}_{ac}\csc\theta) \cdot \nabla_a^\intercal \\
  &= (\gamma(b,c) \mathbf{u}_{ab}\cot\theta)\cdot \nabla_a^\intercal - (\gamma(b,c) \mathbf{u}_{ac}\csc\theta) \cdot \nabla_a^\intercal \\
  &=  \gamma(b,c)(

Dividing by $f'$, we get $f''=1/2+1/f^3$, at all points $x$ where $f'(x)\neq 0.$ Since $(f')^2=\frac{f^3-1}{f^2}$, we have $f'(x)=0$ only for $f(x)=1$. So I need to compute $f''(x)$ for such $x$. Using the hint, I first guessed that Theorem $7$(applied to $f'$) implies that the formula holds in this case also, with $f''(x)=\lim_{y\to x}1/2+1/f^3(y)=\frac{1}{2}+1=\frac{3}{2}$. However, upon close inspection, I realized that this may not be true, as for any neighborhood around such $x$, there may be another $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)=1$, and in such case I cannot compute the limit as above. How can I resolve this situation, or is the problem wrong? I would greatly appreciate any help.","['analysis', 'calculus', 'real-analysis', 'derivatives']"

1404213,Maximal ideals and the projective Nullstellensatz,"This is a simple question, but it's one of those things that I've been thinking about so much that I've just kind of lost where I am and need some explicit reference. One of the main corollaries of the affine Nullstellensatz (i.e. that $\mathbb{I}(\mathbb{V}(I)) = \sqrt{I}$) is that maximal ideals in $R=k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ are in bijective correspondence with points in $\mathbb{A}^{n+1}$.
In all (but one -- see below) of the literature I've read that talks of the projective Nullstellensatz, there is no mention of what maximal ideals of $R$ correspond to, just what prime ideals in general correspond to.
I assumed that, if there were a similar fact, then I would have found it somewhere. But after some thinking we see that points in projective space correspond to lines through the origin in affine space, which are irreducible affine varieties, but not affine points .
Thus points in projective space correspond to (prime) ideals in $R$ coming from lines through the origin. In the opposite direction, maximal ideals in $R$ correspond to points in affine space, and so can't correspond directly to points in projective space but each point in affine space uniquely determines a point in projective space, since it uniquely determines a line through the origin and that point.
So it seems like there should be some maximal ideal/points in projective space correspondence, and one way kind of seems almost clear to me, but the other doesn't so much. In essence could anybody please explain the correspondence between maximal ideals properly contained in $k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ and points of projective space.
We know that all maximal ideals are of the form $(x_0-a_0,\ldots,x_n-a_n)$, and these correspond to the point $(a_0,\ldots,a_n)$ in affine space.
Is there an equally nice formulation for the projective case? Here is the one reference that I could find:","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

1404291,Whether a real number is a dyadic rational iff its binary expansion terminates?,"In self-studying a textbook on computability theory, I found that many of the exercises depend on the following factlet: A dyadic rational is a rational number whose denominator is a power of two, i.e. a rational number of the form $\frac{a}{2^b}$. A real number is a dyadic rational if and only if its binary expansion terminates. I have the following for the forward direction: The binary expansion of a number between $0$ and $1$ is of the form
    \begin{equation*}
    0.x_1x_2x_3\cdots = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}x_k2^{-k} = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{x_k}{2^k}
  \end{equation*}
    Suppose a number $0 < x < 1$ has a terminating binary expansion.
    Then its expansion is of the form $0.x_1\cdots x_k$, where $x_k$ is the last $1$ digit.
    Then
    \begin{equation*}
    x = \frac{x_1}{2^1} + \frac{x_2}{2^2} + \ldots + \frac{x_k}{2^k} = \frac{x_12^{k-1} + x_22^{k-2} + \ldots + x_k}{2^k}
  \end{equation*}
    Since this is base-$2$, each $x_i$ must be either $0$ or $1$, whence it follows that the denominator and numerator are integers, and the denominator is a power of two, which means $x$ is a dyadic rational. For the converse, I have the following idea, but do not have the background to write up a rigorous proof (in particular, I cannot imagine how to deal with the ambiguity of infinite $1$s versus infinite $0$s at some point in the expansion): Conversely, we must show that if $0 < \frac{a}{2^b} < 1$ is a dyadic rational, then its binary expansion terminates.
    Every dyadic rational can be represented as the finite sum/product $\left(\frac{1}{2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{1}{2}\cdot\ldots\cdot\frac{1}{2}$.
    The binary expansion of the sum of two numbers with terminating binary expansions terminates, same for the product; and it follows that the binary expansion of a dyadic rational terminates. I have not yet formally tackled (but have vague, possibly incorrect, intuition of) the construction of real numbers, Cauchy convergence and proof by induction (which I gather could be used somehow...), but I need to convince myself of the factlet and its possible pitfalls to continue with the material for the time being (namely, Cantor's diagonalization proofs). Any detailed hints or full-on proofs would be greatly appreciated. (I have found this question but the hint in the answer seems unhelpful given my lack of background.) EDIT : Observe that $a$ is a finite integer, and so can be written as the finite-term sum $x_12^{k-1} + x_22^{k-2} + \ldots + x_k$, where $x_i \in \{0, 1\}$.
    Since $\frac{a}{2^b} < 1$, it follows that $a < 2^b$.
    By the definition of binary expansion, $x_1 = 1$, whence $2^{k-1} \le a < 2^b$, and we have $k-1<b$.
    But $1 \le i \le k$, whence $k-i<b$.
    Then we can divide each term by $2^b$, obtaining:
    \begin{equation*}
    \frac{a}{2^b} = \frac{x_1}{2^{b-k+1}} + \frac{x_2}{2^{b-k+2}} + \ldots + \frac{x_k}{2^b},
  \end{equation*}
    which gives us a finite binary expansion; this completes the proof.","['proof-verification', 'proof-writing', 'binary', 'elementary-number-theory', 'analysis']"

Here's the question: Use mathematical induction and Euclid's Lemma to prove that for all positive integers $s$, if $p$ and $q_1, q_2, \dotsc, q_s$ are prime numbers and $p$ divides $q_1q_2\dotsb q_s$, then $p=q_i$ for some $i$ with $1 ≤ i ≤ s$. Here's what I know: Euclid's Lemma says that if $p$ is a prime and $p$ divides $ab$, then $p$ divides $a$ or $p$ divides $b$. More generally, if a prime $p$ divides a product $a_1 a_2 \dotsb a_n$, then it must divide at least one of the factors $a_i$. For the inductive step, I can assume $p$ divides $q_1q_2\dotsb q_{s+1}$ and let $a=q_1q_2\dotsb q_s$. Then, $p$ divides $aq_{s+1}$ and either $p$ divides $a$, $p$ divides $q_{s+1}$, or $p=q_{s+1}$. I know that since $q_i$ is prime, it cannot divide $q_i$ unless $p=q_i$ for some $1 ≤ i ≤ s$. I'm just not sure how to formulate the proof. Usually with Induction I can set some property $P(n)$ and test it is true for some base like $P(0)$ or $P(1)$ for the base step.

1404565,"The behavior of $f(x)=\alpha x+x^2\operatorname{sin}1/x$ for $x\neq 0$ near $0$, where $\alpha \ge 1$.","Consider $\alpha \ge 1$. Let $f(x)=\alpha x+x^2\operatorname{sin}1/x$ for $x\neq 0$ and let $f(0)=0.$ In order to find the sign of $f'(x)$ when $\alpha \ge 1$ it is necessary to decide if $2x\operatorname{sin}1/x-\operatorname{cos}1/x$ is $\lt -1$ for any numbers $x$ close to $0$. It is a little more convenient to consider the function $g(y)=2(\operatorname{sin}y)/y-\operatorname{cos}y$ for $y\neq 0$; we want to know if $g(y)\lt -1$ for large $y$. This question is quite delicate; the most significant part of $g(y)$ is $-\operatorname{cos}y$, which does reach the value $-1$, but this happens only when $\operatorname{sin}y=0,$ and it is not at all clear whether $g$ itself can have values $\lt -1$. The obvious approach to this problem is to find the local minimum values of $g$. Unfortunately, it is impossible to solve the equation $g'(y)=0$ explicitly, so more ingenuity is required. (a) Show that if $g'(y)=0,$ then $$\operatorname{cos}y=(\operatorname{sin}y)(\frac{2-y^2}{2y}),$$ and conclude that $$g(y)=(\operatorname{sin}y)(\frac{2+y^2}{2y}).$$ (b) Now show that if $g'(y)=0, then $$\operatorname{sin}^2y=\frac{4y^2}{4+y^2},$$ and conclude that $$|g(y)|=\frac{2+y^2}{\sqrt{4+y^4}}.$$ (c) Using the fact that $(2+y^2)/\sqrt{4+y^4}\gt 1$, show that if $\alpha=1$, then $f$ is not increasing in any interval around $0$. (d) Using the fact that $\lim_{y\to \infty}(2+y^2)/\sqrt{4+y^4}=1,$ show that if $\alpha \gt 1$, then $f$ is increasing in some interval around $0$. I've worked through (a) and (b) but I have trouble solving (c) and (d). In fact, I can't even understand what the solution is saying. Below is what is written on the solution to this problem. (c) We have $$f'(x)=1+g(1/x).$$ Now we clearly have $g(y)\lt 0$ for arbitrarily large $y$ (since $g(y)$ is practically $-\operatorname{cos}y$ for large $y$), so for arbitrarily large $y$ we have $$g(y)\lt -\frac{2+y^2}{\sqrt{4+y^4}}\lt -1$$ by part (b). Thus $f'(x)\lt 0$ for arbitrarily small $x$, while we also have $f'(x)\gt 0$ for arbitrarily small $x$. First of all, I have confusion over the statement $g(y)\lt 0$ for arbitrarily large $y$. Usually I would interpret this as saying $g(y)\lt 0$ for all $y\lt a$ for some $a$, but I think in this case that is not true and the author merely means that there are negative values for very large $y$. More importantly, I don't understand why the strict inequality below follows. I think what the author suggests is since for points where $g'(y)=0$, $|g(y)|=\frac{2+y^2}{\sqrt{4+y^4}}$, and at local minima we have $g'(y)=0$, there should be arbitrarily large values less than $-\frac{2+y^2}{\sqrt{4+y^4}}$. However, how do we know that there are even points with $g'(y)=0$?Also, even if there are such points, how do we know that they are local minimum points, or that local minimum of this function even exists anywhere? Moreover, why is the first inequality strict? Finally, the solution to (d) is We have $$f'(x)=\alpha + g(1/x).$$ For sufficiently large $y$ we have $g(y)\gt -\alpha.$ So for sufficiently small $x$ we have $f'(x)\gt 0.$ My understanding of this proof is that for large $y$ g(y) is practically $-cosy$ which is bounded below by $-1$ and since $-\alpha\lt -1$, we have $g(y)\gt -\alpha.$ From here the rest follows easily, but I don't see where the fact that $\lim_{y\to \infty}(2+y^2)/\sqrt{4+y^4}=1$ is used as the the problem said.

1404632,Proof of the Inverse Function Theorem using the Contraction Mapping Principle.,"I've been set this problem recently and I'm having a lot of trouble with it. Any help would be much appreciated! Let $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function with continuous derivatives of all orders and suppose that, for some $x_{0}\in \mathbb{R}$ the derivative $f'(x_{0})$ is non-zero. Write $f(x_{0})=y_{0}$. (a) Show there exists an open interval D containing $x_{0}$ such that $f'(x)\neq 0$ for all $x\in D$. (b) Define $F_{y_{0}}:D\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by $F_{y_{0}}(x)=x-\frac{f(x)-y_{0}}{f'(x)}$. Show that $F_{y_{0}}$ is a Lipschitz function with Lipschitz constant less than 1. (c) Using the Contraction Mapping Principle, show that there is a unique function $g:f(D)\rightarrow D$ such that $f\circ g$ and $g\circ f$ are the identity maps on $D$ and $f(D)$ respectively. (d) Show that g is continuous. Hint: Write $\mid g(y)-g(y_{0})\mid = \mid F_{y}(g(y))- F_{y_{0}}(g(y_{0})\mid \leq \mid F_{y}(g(y))- F_{y}(g(y_{0})) \mid + \mid F_{y}(g(y_{0})) - F_{y_{0}}(g(y_{0}))\mid$ (e) Show that g is differentiable.

The DE isn't particularly nicely solvable as you end up with exponential integrals.

I have no idea how it found that and i don't understand. What i did is expand $(1+e^x)^{-1} $ as in the binomial MacLaurin expansion. I want until the $x^4$ term. So what i found is the following: $$ (1+e^x)^{-1} = 1 - e^x + e^{2x} + e^{3x} + e^{4x}+\cdots\tag1 $$
Then by expanding each $e^{nx}$ term individually:
$$ e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^4}{24}+\cdots\tag2 $$
$$ e^{2x} = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + \frac{3x^3}{2} + \frac{2x^4}{3}+\cdots\tag3 $$
$$ e^{3x} = 1 + 3x + \frac{9x^2}{2} + \frac{9x^3}{2} + \frac{27x^4}{8}+\cdots\tag4 $$ 
$$ e^{4x} = 1 + 4x + 8x^2 + \frac{32x^3}{3} + \frac{32x^4}{3}+\cdots\tag5 $$

1405150,The usage of induction in the proof of Urysohn's lemma,"[Proof taken from]: Kelley's book ""General Topology"". If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint closed subsets of a normal space $X$ , then there is a continuous function $f$ on $X$ to the interval $[0,1]$ such that $f$ is zero on $A$ and one on $B$ . The proof is structured as follows (here $F(-)$ will be a family of sets in $X$ ): Let $D$ the set of positive dyadic rational numbers. For $t$ in $D$ and $t > 1$ let $F(t) = X$ , let $F(1) = X - B$ and let $F(0)$ be an open set containing $A$ such that cl $(F(0))$ is disjoint from $B$ .
(This part is clear) 2.For $t$ in $D$ and $0 < t < 1$ write $t$ in the form $t = (2m+1)2^{-n}$ and choose, inductively on $n$ , $F(t)$ to be an open set containing cl $(F(2m2^{-n}))$ and such that cl $(F(t)) \subseteq F((2m+2)2^{-n}))$ . This choice is possible because $X$ is normal. Here there are my problems...
How exactly does he use induction? And what exactly is the the role of $m$ during this operation? Please, is there someone that could explain me all the details regarding this point?
I would to specify that: I found another related topic here ( Urysohn's Lemma: Proof ), but I actually don't understand more or less the fourth line of the proof (which is exactly my problem); I know that there are a lot of variants of this proof (for example the one on the book by Munkres, or another one on the classic by Rudin), but I strongly prefer to understand this one; I have searched on the web, but without finding any detailed explanation; Let $f(x)  = \inf\{t : x \in F(t) \}$ . The previous lemma shows that $f$ is continuous. Furthermore, the function is zero on $A$ and one on $B$ [some related considerations]. (This part is clear).

1405195,'Proof' of the correspondence between maximal ideals and points in projective space,"The affine Nullstellensatz tells us that we have an inclusion-reversing bijection between radical ideals of $A=k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and affine varieties of $\mathbb{A}^n$, given by $\mathbb{V}\colon A\to\mathbb{A}^n$ and $\mathbb{I}\colon\mathbb{A}^n\to A$. A fact that is often mentioned is that, under this correspondence, maximal ideals correspond to points in affine space.
Proofs for this often look at the kernel of the evaluation map, and use the fact that $k$ is algebraically closed along with some ring theory, and are not just one-line proofs.
Here is a sketch proof of the above fact; I am convinced that it is wrong, but can't see why: Let $m$ be a proper maximal ideal of $A$. Now
  $X=\mathbb{V}(I)\subseteq\mathbb{V}(m)$ if and only if
  $m\subseteq I$. But since $m$ is maximal, either $I=A$ or
  $I=m$. So $\mathbb{V}(m)$ has no non-trivial subvarieties apart from
  itself and $\emptyset$. But any $a\in\mathbb{V}(m)$ is a subvariety
  (since $a=\mathbb{V}(x-a)$). So either $\mathbb{V}(m)=\emptyset$,
  which cannot happen since $k$ is algebraically closed, or
  $\mathbb{V}(m)=\{a\}$. Edit: Thinking about it for a second, the fact that $k$ is algebraically closed does not give us that $\mathbb{V}(m)$ is non-empty straight away, it needs some extra work.",['algebraic-geometry']
1405220,Haar measure on a profinite group is the inverse limit of the counting measure on its quotients?,"I've heard this a few times now, though I've never seen a precise result. I guess the precise statement would be close to: Let $N_i$ be a basis normal subgroup neighborhoods of the identity in a profinite group $G$, $\pi_i : G \to G / N_i = G_i$ the natural projections, and $U$ an open set. Then $\mu(U) = \lim |\pi_i(U)| / |G_i|$, where $\mu$ is the Haar measure, and $||$ is the counting measure on the quotient. Is this correct? What exactly does ""lim"" mean there - limit as a net in the real numbers? I think it is more or less clear that such a function is bi-invariant, and has $\mu(G) = 1$. I'm less sure about how to prove that this is countable additive - it's clear for cosets of open subgroups, but I don't see how to jump from those to all open sets. I guess one would also have to prove some kind of regularity, or maybe those follow from measure theoretic machinery - I don't remember these details of measure theory too well. Anyhow, I would appreciate a reference or an explanation!","['locally-compact-groups', 'group-theory', 'profinite-groups', 'measure-theory']"

1405242,Elementary proof that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{m^{k^2}}}$ is irrational (for any integer $m > 1$),"I used similar technique as Fourier's proof of irrationality of $e$ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_e_is_irrational to show that this series is indeed an irrational number but I was wondering if there are other elementary proofs, specially techniques related to polynomials with rational coefficients. Any hint, complete proof, reference, etc. is much appreciated. EDIT : presenting my proof as @AndréNicolas requested : I just followed the same steps; let's assume the series is $s$. Now choose $k_0$ such that $m^{k_0^2} > q$. Define $x = q m^{k_0^2} \left(s - \sum_{k=1}^{k_0}{\frac{1}{m^{k^2}}} \right)$. Now if $s$ is not irrational then $s=\frac{p}{q}$ for some non-negative $p$ and $q$. Then it is easy to check that $x$ is an integer. Now we need to reach to a contradiction by proving that $x < 1$. 
After simple manipulations, $x = q m^{k_0^2} \sum_{k=k_0+1}^{k_0}{\frac{1}{m^{k^2}}}$
Now, for $k=k_0+1,k_0+2, \ldots$, we have $k^2 > k+k_0^2$ so
$$ q m^{k_0^2} \sum_{k=k_0+1}^{k_0}{\frac{1}{m^{k^2}}} < q m^{k_0^2} \sum_{k=k_0+1}^{k_0}{\frac{1}{m^{k+k_0^2}}} = \frac{q}{m^{k_0^2+1}}\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{m}}=\frac{1}{m-1}$$ which follows from our assumption about $q$ and $k_0$.","['sequences-and-series', 'number-theory', 'square-numbers', 'rationality-testing']"

1405264,"Application of Legendre, Jacobi and Kronecker Symbols","Legendre , Jacobi and Kronecker Symbols are powerful multiplicative functions in computational number theory. They are useful mathematical tools, essentially for primality testing and integer factorization ; these in turn are important in cryptography. Yet, it would be nice to have a discussion here on their use in classical number theory and math problems. In other words, what kind of problems can they be effectively applied to? Or simply, when/where to use them? Definitions For any integer $a$ and any positive odd integer $n$ the Jacobi symbol is defined as the product of the Legendre symbols corresponding to the prime factors of $n$: $\left(\tfrac{a}{p}\right)$ represents the Legendre symbol, defined for all integers $a$ and all odd primes $p$ by
$$\Bigg(\frac{a}{n}\Bigg) = \left(\frac{a}{p_1}\right)^{\alpha_1}\left(\frac{a}{p_2}\right)^{\alpha_2}\cdots \left(\frac{a}{p_k}\right)^{\alpha_k}\mbox{ where } n=p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}.$$
$$
\left(\frac{a}{p}\right) = \left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
0 & \text{if } a \equiv 0 \pmod{p},\\
1 & \text{if } a \not\equiv 0\pmod{p} \text{ and for some integer } x:\;a\equiv x^2\pmod{p},\\
-1 & \text{if } a \not\equiv 0\pmod{p} \text{ and there is no such } x.
\end{array}
\right.
$$ 
Following the normal convention for the empty product, $\left(\tfrac{a}{1}\right) = 1$. The Legendre and Jacobi symbols are indistinguishable exactly when the lower argument is an odd prime, in which case they have the same value. The Kronecker symbol, written as $\left(\frac an\right)$ or $(a|n)$, is an extension of the Jacobi symbol to all integers. Let $n$ be a non-zero integer, with prime factorization $$n=u \cdot p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_k^{e_k},$$ where $u$ is a unit (i.e., $u=\pm1$), and the $p_i$ are primes. Let $a$ be an integer. The Kronecker symbol $(a|n)$ is defined by $$ \left(\frac{a}{n}\right) = \left(\frac{a}{u}\right) \prod_{i=1}^k \left(\frac{a}{p_i}\right)^{e_i}. $$ For odd number $p_i$, the number $(a|p_i)$ is simply the usual Legendre symbol. This leaves the case when $p_i=2$. We define $(a|2)$ by $$ \left(\frac{a}{2}\right) = 
\begin{cases}
 0 & \mbox{if }a\mbox{ is even,} \\
 1 & \mbox{if } a \equiv \pm1 \pmod{8},  \\
-1 & \mbox{if } a \equiv \pm3 \pmod{8}.
\end{cases}$$ Since it extends the Jacobi symbol, the quantity $(a|u)$ is simply $1$ when $u=1$. When $u=-1$, we define it by $$ \left(\frac{a}{-1}\right) = \begin{cases} -1 & \mbox{if }a < 0, \\ 1 & \mbox{if } a \ge 0. \end{cases} $$ Finally, we put $$\left(\frac a0\right)=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }a=\pm1,\\0&\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$ These extensions suffice to define the Kronecker symbol for all integer values $a,n$.","['legendre-symbol', 'number-theory', 'kronecker-symbol', 'elementary-number-theory']"
