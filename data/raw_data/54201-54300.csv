578372,Tensors constructed out of metric other than the Riemann curvature tensor,"Let $(M,g_{ab})$ be a Riemannian (or Pseudo-Riemannian) manifold and let us define a tensor field as 'something' that transforms in an appropriate way under coordinate transformations. (This is how tensors are defined in Physics texts, see Gravitation & Cosmology by Steven Weinberg for example). Thus $R_{abcd}$ and $R_{ab}$ defined by taking derivatives of the metric are tensors. (One considers scalars as tensors too). These involve taking the double derivative of the metric. My question is : Can any tensors be constructed out of the metric by taking 3 or more derivatives of the metric ? If yes, what are they ? If no, is there a proof that no quantity involving derivatives higher than the double derivatives of the metric can transform (under coordinate transformations) in the way tensors do ? I wish to mention that this question is related to (but different from) a question that I asked here . I must admit that this question as it stands is a bit vague. I shall try to formulate it more precisely if I can. Any relevant references are welcome. EDIT : As a comment points out, some such tensors can be obtained simply by taking iterated covariant derivatives of the curvature tensor. This leads me to ask whether tensors obtained in this fashion are all the tensors which can be formed by taking higher derivatives of the metric.","['riemannian-geometry', 'geometry', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

578390,Regularized distance function on Riemannian manifolds,"Suppose $(M,g)$ is a complete Riemannian manifold. $p\in M$ is a fixed point. $d_{p}(X)$ is the distance function defined by $p$ on M (i.e., $d_p(x)$=the distance between $p$ and $x$). Let $\epsilon>0$ be an arbitrary positive number. Is there a smooth function $\tilde{d}_p(x)$ on $M$, such that 
$$ | d_p(x)-\tilde{d}_p(x) | < \epsilon$$
$$ |\textrm{grad}(\tilde{d}_p)(x)|<2$$
for $\forall x \in M$ ? I need this result when I'm trying to follow a proof. The existence of such a function seems to be taken for granted in that proof, and is called the ""regularization"" of the distance function. Functions satisfying the first condition can be constructed easily by using the partition of unity and the standard technique of mollifiers. However, I can't see how to control the gradient of the approximate function. Could you please help me? Thanks a lot.","['approximation', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
578425,How to use flatness here?,"Let $X\to S$ be a scheme. Definition: A relative effective Cartier divisor on $X/S$ is a closed subscheme $D\subset X$ such that the ideal sheaf $I$ of $D$ is invertible and $D\to S$ is flat. Let now $T\to S$ be another scheme over $S$ and denote by $X_T$ the fibered product $X\times_S T$. I read on a paper the following: Claim: Let $D$ be a relative effective Cartier divisor on $X_T/T$ and $p:T'\to T$ be an arbitrary $S$-map of schemes. Then the pullback $p^*_{X_T}(I)$ is the ideal sheaf of the $T'$-flat closed subscheme $D_{T'}\subset X_{T'}$. Hence $D_{T'}$ is a relative effective Cartier divisor on $X_{T'}/T'$. Can you please help me proving the claim? In particular, the author says: Since $D$ is $T$-flat, $p^*_{X_T} (I)$ is equal to the ideal of $D_{T'}$ And I don't understand why.","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'abstract-algebra']"
578444,The group of $\mathbb{K}$--rational points for isomorphic elliptic curves,"The Springer text by Tom Apostol on Dirichlet series and modular forms, which I have, defines modular functions and modular forms on page 34 and on page 114 respectively, not to mention the Springer graduate text by N. Koblitz. My questions are numbered below, 1, 2, 3. Let $E_{1}/\mathbb{K}$, $E_{2}/\mathbb{K}$, be two isomorphic elliptic curves over the same field $\mathbb{K}$. Suppose they both are modular. Is it safe to say they have the same group $E(\mathbb{K})$ of $\mathbb{K}$--rational points, up to isomorphism? Do they have the same torsion subgroups, up to isomorphism? Let $\Lambda$ be their Gaussian lattice on the upper complex plane when 
\begin{equation}
\overline{\mathbb{K}} = \mathbb{C}.
\end{equation}
By ""Gaussian lattice"" I mean that lattice on $\mathbb{C}$ for which all the coordinate points ((u, v) = u + vi) are Gaussian integers,
\begin{equation}
u + vi \in \mathbb{Z}[i],
\end{equation}
where the ring $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ has a Euclidean valuation. Consider the two curves $E_{1}/\mathbb{\Lambda}$, $E_{2}/\mathbb{\Lambda}$. $3$. Do the points on the corresponding complex parametrizations on the upper complex plane have the same group transformations from $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$? (Manually incorporating an ""answer"" as an edit.) Thank you [Bruno Joyal] for the response. You're right. I checked. I should have written
\begin{equation}
E_{1}/\mathbb{C}, \: \: E_{2}/\mathbb{C},
\end{equation}
and not
\begin{equation}
E_{1}/\Lambda, \: \: E_{2}/\Lambda,
\end{equation}
which admittedly is a notation that does not make sense. So actually my question (3) should be rewritten as, ""exactly what group acts (up to isomorphism) on the two complex curves
\begin{equation}
E_{1}/\mathbb{C}, E_{2}/\mathbb{C}?
\end{equation}
According to the text by J. H. Silverman (Chapter VI, page 158) it is the notation
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{C}/\Lambda,
\end{equation}
that denotes a complex Lie group, where $\Lambda$ is an integer lattice on the upper part of $\mathbb{C}$. But the Silverman text mentions two complex Lie groups, namely $E(\mathbb{C})$ as well as $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$. So I was wondering \emph{which group} on $\mathbb{C}$ would act on the two correspondingly isomorphic, complex parametrized curves $E_{1}/\mathbb{C}$ and $E_{2}/\mathbb{C}$, which would be the complex parametrizations for $E_{1}/\mathbb{K}$ and $E_{2}/\mathbb{K}$ which are isomorphic in $\mathbb{K}$. Does the modular group act on $E_{1}/\mathbb{C}$ and $E_{2}/\mathbb{C}$? I trust and I hope I am expressing this question clearly enough for experts in this area.

Justify the estimates involved. My first thought was to draw a long strip and integrate over it. By Cauchy's theorem the integral is zero, and I can compare the contributions. I'd like it if, for well-chosen such strips, the contribution on the sides were entirely imaginary and that on the top/bottom were entirely real, or vice-versa.

578487,$f$ is a real function and it is $\alpha$-Holder continuous with $\alpha>1$. Is $f$ constant?,"Maybe this is a well know result, however, I could not find it. Before stating it, let me write here a well know result (at least for me) Assume that $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a open domain and $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$. If there is constants $L>0$ and $\alpha>1$ such that $$|f(x)-f(y)|\leq L |x-y|^\alpha,\ \forall\ x,y\in\Omega$$
  then, $f$ is constant in each connected componente of $\Omega$. The above result can be proved, for example, by showing that $\nabla f=0$ and then we join points in the same connected component by a continuous curve. Now my question is: Assume that $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ and $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$. Suppose that there is constants $L>0$ and $\alpha>1$ such that $$|f(x)-f(y)|\leq L |x-y|^\alpha,\ \forall\ x,y\in\Omega$$
  Can we conclude that $f$ is constant in each connected componente of $\Omega$? Maybe it is necessary to add the hypothesis that each connected component of $\Omega$ is pathwise connected? Remark: Note that in the question, $\Omega$ does not need to be a open set. It is now any set.","['holder-spaces', 'real-analysis']"
578497,Residues computation when we need power series,"I'm trying to compute residues in situation where we need to manipulate power series to get it, but I can't find a good way. Indeed for the sake of example, consider the residue of the following function at $z=0$ which wolfram says it's zero: $$f(z)=\csc z\cot z = \dfrac{1}{\sin z}\dfrac{\cos z}{\sin z},$$ the only thing I could think of was using power series, but a lot of ""problems"" appear. Well, we would have $$f(z)=\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \dfrac{z^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} \right)^{-2}\sum_{m=0}^\infty (-1)^n \dfrac{z^{2n}}{2n!},$$ but it seems like lots of trouble in expanding that. I would first need to invert $1/\sin^2(z)$ and when I tried it was pretty messy to get just 3 terms. The multiplying by the other series would also cause some confusion I think. What I mean is that in general I think that I didn't find a good approach to compute residues with power series yet, in the sense of being efficient. What's a good approach to this kind of problem? How can one compute this residue without messing everything up along the way? Thanks very much in advance.","['complex-analysis', 'problem-solving']"

Show that the vector field $$v=\sum\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}a_{i,j}\right)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_j}$$ is divergence-free. It looks like there's a typo somewhere in this problem. For one thing, it looks like there should be a double summation, one over $i$ and the other one over $j$.  Should it be $$\sum_{j=1}^n\left(\sum_{i=1}^n\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}a_{i,j}\right)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_j}?$$ The definition of a vector field $v$ to be divergence-free is that the divergence $\sum_{j=1}^n\dfrac{\partial v_j}{\partial x_j}=0$.","['matrices', 'vector-fields', 'real-analysis']"

578836,How does the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n \cos(n^2 x)}{n}$ behave?,"The title is the question: I'm trying to understand the behavior of the series $$\star \qquad \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n \cos(n^2 x)}{n},\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad\qquad \qquad $$ where $0\leq x \leq 1$.  All I know for sure about it is that it converges conditionally at $x=0$ to a known value (I think it's $-\ln 2$).  I don't even know how to check its convergence for other values of $x$ (it may be possible to compute it for certain rational multiples of $\pi$).  I plotted the partial sum going up to $n=1000$ using Maple and the partial sum only goes from about $-2.8$ to $0.4$.  It also looks continuous but very jagged.  This suggests that the series may converge at least pointwise to a continuous, nowhere-differntiable function.  The maximum value of the absolute value of the derivative of the 1000th partial sum is about $21249$, according to Maple17's Mamimize command, but I am suspicious because Maple says the maximum occurs at $x=0.2000002655$, suspiciously close to $0.2$.  But if the derivative of the 1000th partial sum really is that big, it suggests that if the series converges to a function, that function might be nowhere-continuous. I did some Googling, looking for information on continuous, nowhere-differentiable functions, hoping to find my series.  There seem to be a huge number of them that are well-known.  The best-known such functions seem to be ""Weierstrass functions"", but for such functions the denominator is something like $2^n$, which grows much faster than $n$.  At http://epubl.luth.se/1402-1617/2003/320/LTU-EX-03320-SE.pdf , there is posted a thesis about continuous, nowhere-differentiable functions.  On p. 23 of the .pdf (not the author's page number, but the page number of the .pdf document), the author discusses ""Riemann's function"", defined by $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}\sin(k^2 x)$.  This is very similar to my series, but again the denominator decays more rapidly than the one I'm considering. So, to make a long story short, this is what I'd like to know: For what values of $x$ does $\star$ converge? For what values of $x$ does $\star$ converge absolutely? If $\star$ converges for all $x$ (EDIT: NO: see accepted answer) , does it converge merely pointwise or uniformly? (see answer) If $\star$ converges at least pointwise (EDIT: NO: see accepted answer), where is the resulting function differentiable?

The vector field $$v=\sum\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}a_{i,j}\right)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_j}$$ is divergence-free . Prove by induction that for every $n\geq 2$ , every $C^\infty$ divergence-free vector field on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is of this form. Consider $n=2$ . Suppose the vector field is $f_1(x_1,x_2)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_1}+f_2(x_1,x_2)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_2}$ . Since the vector field is divergence-free, we have that $\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_1}f_1(x_1,x_2)+\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_2}f_2(x_1,x_2)=0$ . By this result , there exists a function $g(x_1,x_2)$ whose $x_1$ -derivative equals $f_2$ and whose $x_2$ -derivative equals $-f_1$ . The result follows. But how about for $n>2$ ? To use induction, I have to relate a divergence-free vector field of $\mathbb{R}^n$ to a divergence-free vector field of $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ .

I think that a metric space should allowed to be empty, and many authorities, including Rudin, agree with me.  That way, any subset of a metric space is a metric space, you don't have to make an exception for $\varnothing$, and you can ascribe certain properties to $\varnothing$, such as, $\varnothing$ is compact and connected. By definition of diameter of a metric space, the diameter of $\varnothing$ should be $-\infty$, since the $\sup$ of the empty set is $-\infty$.  This ""feels wrong"", since the diameter is a measure of the ""size"" of a metric space or a subset thereof, and its seems like the diameter of $\varnothing$ ought to be zero. I guess I really have two questions: If you allow the diameter of the empty set to be $-\infty$, does it lead to problems?  For example, $-\infty$ plus any real number is $-\infty$, and I could imagine how that might lead to a problem, but I haven't seen an actual situtation where that happens.

I am trying to collect results that convey some information about $G_f$ that only involve the coefficients of $f$ in semialgebraic conditions.  Let me explain what I mean by also giving the few such results that I have found. Example 1 When trying to determine $G_f$, the first thing to check is if $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ since this holds if and only if $G_f$ is transitive.  However, the condition ""$f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$"" is not a semialgebraic condition of the coefficients of $f$.  There are many popular methods to show that a polynomial is irreducible, including Eisenstein's criterion (a special case of Dumas's criterion, which uses Newton diagrams, see Section 2.2.1 in Polynomials ), irreducibility over $\mathbb{F}_p$ for some prime $p$, and Pólya-type criteria (also see Section 2.2.2 in Polynomials).  However, these criteria are still not semialgebraic conditions of the coefficients of $f$. Instead, an irreducibility criterion that only involves the coefficients in a semialgebraic expression is Perron's criterion: Let $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients such that $a_n = 1$ and $a_0 \ne 0$. a) If $|a_{n-1}| > 1 + |a_{n-2}| + \dotsb + a_0$, then f is irreducible. b) If $|a_{n-1}| \ge 1 + |a_{n-2}| + \dotsb + a_0$ and $f(\pm 1) \ne 0$, then f is irreducible. The only other results of this kind that I know of are by Brauer (either Theorem 2.2.6 in Polynomials or results in On the Irreducibility of Polynomials with Large Third Coefficient ). Example 2 The method of resolvents for Galois groups seems quite strong to me.  If I understand it correctly, for each subgroup of $H \le S_n$, there exists a polynomial $\varphi_H$ such that $G_f \le H$ if and only if $\operatorname{Res}(f,\varphi_H)$ contains a rational root.  The simplest example of this is when $H = A_n$ is the alternating group, in which case $\varphi_H = f'$ is the derivative of $f$ and $\operatorname{Res}(f,\varphi_H) = x^2 - \Delta(f)$, where $\Delta(f)$ is the discriminant of $f$.  Once again, the condition that some polynomial does (or doesn't) contain a rational root is not a semialgebraic condition of the roots of $f$. For this simplest case of Galois resolvent, it is easy to obtain the kind of results that I am looking for. If $\Delta(f) < 0$, then $G_f \not\le A_n$. In this case (as well as in the stronger iff condition), there are an odd number of nonreal complex conjugate pairs, so the Galois group contains an odd permutation of order 2, namely complex conjugation. Question To explicitly state my question: What other results are known that convey information about the Galois group of $f$ but only involve the coefficients of $f$ in semialgebraic conditions?","['galois-theory', 'reference-request', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

579460,Can a function have more than one left inverse?,"Given two non-empty sets $A$ and $B$, and given a function $f \colon A \to B$, a function $g \colon B \to A$ is said to be a left inverse of $f$ if the function  $g o f \colon A \to A$ is the identity function $i_A$ on $A$, that is, if $g(f(a)) = a$ for each $a \in A$. Similarly, a function $h \colon B \to A$ is a right inverse of $f$ if the function $f o h  \colon B \to B$ is the identity function $i_B$ on $B$. I know that if $f$ has a left inverse, then $f$ is injective, and if $f$ has a right inverse, then $f$ is surjective; so if $f$ has a left inverse $g$ and a right inverse $h$, then $f$ is bijective and moreover $g = h = f^{-1}$. I also know that a function can have two right inverses; e.g., let $f \colon \mathbf{R} \to [0, +\infty)$ be defined as $f(x) \colon = x^2$ for all $x \in \mathbf{R}$. Then both $g_+ \colon [0, +\infty) \to \mathbf{R}$ and $g_- \colon [0, +\infty) \to \mathbf{R}$ defined as $g_+(x) \colon = \sqrt{x}$ and $g_-(x) \colon = -\sqrt{x}$ for all $x\in [0, +\infty)$ are right inverses for $f$, since $$f(g_{\pm}(x)) = f(\pm \sqrt{x}) = (\pm\sqrt{x})^2 = x$$ for all $x \in [0, +\infty)$.

For example, defining $\phi_n$ as using $n = 5, 6, 7$ ""ones"" respectively, then, $$(1/2)(\phi-\phi_5)(2\phi)^5 = 1.0977\dots$$ $$(1/2)(\phi-\phi_6)(2\phi)^6 = 1.0983\dots$$ $$(1/2)(\phi-\phi_7)(2\phi)^7 = 1.0985\dots$$ which is approaching the Paris constant $R = 1.09864196\dots$. It seems it can be generalized. Define, $$x_n=\sqrt[k]{1+\sqrt[k]{1+\sqrt[k]{1+\sqrt[k]{1_n+\dots}}}}\tag{1}$$ for integer $k>1$ and the equations, $$x^k = x+1\tag{2}$$ $$y = \frac{1}{x}+1\tag{3}$$ where $x$ is the root of $(2)$ such that $x = x_n$ as $n \to \infty$ in $(1)$.

$$\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=\frac{df}{dx}(x)=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f(x)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x)=f'(x)$$ Now, in one of my lectures we wrote
$$g(x):=\frac{\partial \log (f(x))}{\partial x}=\log'f(x)\cdot f'(x)=f'(x)/f(x)$$
The part about differentiating the function  is clear, using the normal chain rule $(h\circ f)=(h'\circ f)\cdot f'$. What  confuses me a bit is the notation since $x$ seems to have more than one meaning. Would it be ""more"" correct to write
$$g(x):=\frac{\partial \log (f(y))}{\partial y}\Bigg|_{y=x}$$
as in we differentiate w.r.t. $y$ and then plug in $x$ for $y$? Also, in this particular case, could we replace $\partial$ by $d$, or would this lead to different implications? And lastly, what does $df$ or $dy$ even mean? I read that the differential of $y=f(x)$ is defined to be $dy=f'(x)dx$. But how can we interpret this formula? This becomes specifically confusing when I look at the differential chain rule

Let $f_n = (1 - e^{\frac{-x^2}{n}})x^{-1/2}$. Step 1: Determining convergence of $f_n$ Fix $x$ to be some constant number. Now, bringing the limit inside the integral, we have $lim_{n \to \infty}(1 - \frac{1}{e^{\frac{k}{n}}})t$ where $k, t$ are constants. As $n \to \infty, \ \frac{1}{e^{\frac{k}{n}}} \to 1$ So we get $(1 - 1)t = 0$ So $f_n$ converges to the zero function $f_0$. Note that it doesn't converge at $x = 0$ as we have a division by zero but on $(0, 1]$ it converges to $f_0$ and the measure of $\{0\}$ 
 is $0$ so we have convergence almost everywhere. Step 2: Determining a dominating function $g$ Now, when $x \in (0, 1)$, for all $n$ we have, $$e^{\frac{1}{n}} > 1$$ $$\implies e^{\frac{x^2}{n}} \ge 1$$ $$\implies 0 < \frac{1}{e^{\frac{x^2}{n}}} \le 1$$ $$\implies -1 \le - \frac{1}{e^{\frac{x^2}{n}}} < 0$$ $$\implies 0 \le 1 - \frac{1}{e^{\frac{x^2}{n}}} < 1$$ $$\implies \mid 1 - \frac{1}{e^{\frac{x^2}{n}}}\mid < 1$$ $$\implies \mid (1 - \frac{1}{e^{\frac{x^2}{n}}})x^{-1/2}\mid < x^{-1/2}$$ Let $g = x^{-1/2}$ $g$ is integrable as $\int_0^\pi x^{-1/2} = 2\sqrt{x} \mid_0^\pi = 2\sqrt\pi$ So we have a sequence of integrable functions $f_n$ that converges a.e. to the function $f_0$. Let $g = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$.

from this we see that since $A$ is symmetric that $\mathcal{D}(A)\subset \mathcal{D}(A^{*})$ so we know that $A$ is closeable since $\mathcal{D}(A^{*})$ is dense.","['operator-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"
579805,Ideal in $C(X)$,"Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space, and $C(X)$ the space of complex-valued continuous functions with maximum-norm. The following problem is driving me little nuts. I want to show that every closed Ideal $J\subset C(X)$ is of the form $J_Y = \{f\in C(X)| Y\subset f^{-1}(0)\}$ where $Y\subset X$ is some closed set. It seems that $Y=\bigcap_{f\in J}f^{-1}(0)$ is the only logical choice. Then $J\subset J_Y$ is obvious, but $J_Y\subset J$ is not so obvious. It seemed logical to me that if $f\in J$ then $J_{f^{-1}(0)} \subset J$, but I can't prove it. If this would be true I thought of finding a $g\in J$ such that $g^{-1}(0)=Y $ would then be sufficient. Maybe constructing a sequence of functions $g_n\in J_n\subset J$ that is 0 on some $Y_n\supset Y$ and using the fact that $J$ is closed to show $g_n\to g\in J$. Does someone have any suggestions? I'm little stuck.","['c-star-algebras', 'functional-analysis']"

  its irreducible components? The definition of the degree I know is quite vague, saying that the degree of a projective variety $X$ is the maximal number of possible finite intersections of $X$ with a linear hyperspace in general position . I'm not comfortable with the concept in general position . The note I'm reading explains it by an example. I guess that in general position just means there isn't multiple intersection.",['algebraic-geometry']

579830,Applying Dominated Convergence Theorem to solve $\lim_{n \to \infty}\int_0^n(1-\frac{x}{n})^ne^{-x}dx$,"$$\lim_{n \to \infty}\int_0^n(1-\frac{x}{n})^ne^{-x}dx$$ I am going to use the Dominated Convergence Theorem to solve this. $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\int_0^{\infty}\chi_{[0, n]}(1-\frac{x}{n})^ne^{-x}dx$$ Step 1 - Find a dominating function $g$ Let $h_n = (1-\frac{x}{n})^n$ $\chi_{[0, n]}$ is telling us that $h_n = 0$ whenever $x > n$. This means that $h_n(0) = 1$ and $h_n(n) = 0$ for all $n$. So $h_n$ is a sequence of measurable functions that is bounded above by $1$. Let $f_n = (1-\frac{x}{n})^n \cdot e^{-x} = h_n \cdot e^{-x}$. This also has a maximum value of $1$. So $f_n$ is dominated by the constant function $g(x) = 1$. Step 2 - Find a function $f$ such that $f_n \to f$ pointwise almost everywhere Now consider $\lim_{n \to \infty}(1-\frac{x}{n})^ne^{-x}$ $e^{-x}\cdot e^{-x} = e^{-2x}$ So we have that $f_n \to f = e^{-2x}$ $f$ is integrable and it's integral is 
\begin{align*}
&= \lim_{k \to \infty}\int_0^{k}e^{-2x}dx\\
&= \lim_{k \to \infty}-\frac{1}{2}e^{-2x}\mid_0^k\\
&= \lim_{k \to \infty}[-\frac{1}{2}e^{-2\cdot k} - (-\frac{1}{2} e^{2\cdot0})]\\
&=-\frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{2}\\
&= \frac{1}{2}
\end{align*} So we have a sequence of functions $f_n$ such that $\mid f_n \mid \le g$ and $f_n \to f$, with $f$ integrable. Hence, by the Dominated Convergence Theorem we have that $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\int_0^{\infty} f_n = \int_0^{\infty} f = \frac{1}{2}$$ Have I made any incorrect assumptions in this solution?","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

579875,Normalizers of Sylow p-subgroups,"My assignment is to prove the following proposition, and I'm unsure if my proof is correct:
Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, and let $H$ be the normalizer of $P$ in $G$.  Prove that the normalizer of $H$ in $G$ is $H$ itself (i.e. normalizers of Sylow $p$-subgroups are self-normalizing). I argued this: $|P|=p^{\alpha}$, and $P$ is normal in $H$, since $P$ is a subgroup of the normalizer of $P$ in $G$.   Since $P$ is a subgroup of $H$, $|H:P|= 1$ (case 1) or $m$ (case 2). $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, so $|H|$ divides $|G|$, therefore we have $|H:P||G:H|= 1$ (following from case 1 from above), or $m$ (following from case 2 from above). Now I analyzed each case: 1)
$1*|G:H|=m \implies |H|=|G|/m \implies |H|=p^{\alpha} \implies H=P$, and we already know that the normalizer of $P$ in $G$ is $H$, so if $H=P$, the normalizer of $H$ in $G$ is $H$. 2)
$m*|G:H|=m \implies |G:H|=1 \implies G=H$, so obviously the normalizer of $H$ in $G$ is the same as the normalizer of $H$ in $H$, which is obviously all of $H$. Is this legitimate?","['sylow-theory', 'group-theory']"

Now my qestions: (1) Is there a nice way to construct such a graph? (2) If yes then what is so special about this specific graph? My ideas:  Grötzsch's theorem states that every triangle-free planar graph may be 3-colored, so we know that we can exclude planar grpahs and focus on non-planar graphs.
