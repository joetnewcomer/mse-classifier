1104906,"Differential Equation $y'=\frac{1}{x^2-1}, y(0)=0$, am I missing something?","I'm encountering a singularity of sorts when working out this D.E. It seems like a very straight forward problem and, assuming I'm going wrong, I'm wondering where. The problem: Solve the initial value problem $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1}{x^2-1}, y(0)=0$ and determine the interval of the independent variable on which the solution is defined. Attempted solution: integrating w.r.t. x we have $\int_{x_0}^xy'dx=\int_{x_0}^x\frac{1}{t^2-1}dt\implies\int_{y_0}^yds=\int_0^x\frac{1}{(t-1)(t+1)}dt$ by change of variable formula. Then, by partial fraction decomposition $$\frac{1}{(t-1)(t+1)}=\frac{A}{t-1}+\frac{B}{t+1}\implies1=(A+B)t+A-B$$Therefore we see that $A=\frac{1}{2}$ and $B=-\frac{1}{2}$. Now our equation is $$y-y(0)=\int_0^x\frac{1}{2(t-1)}-\frac{1}{2(t+1)}dt=\left.\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{ln}\left(\frac{t-1}{t+1}\right)\right|_0^x=\frac{1}{2}\left[\mathrm{ln}\left(\frac{x-1}{x+1}\right)-\mathrm{ln}(-1)\right]$$This is problem since $\mathrm{ln}(-1)\notin\mathbb{R}$ so I'm not really sure where to go from here. Wolfram says I'm doing the integral wrong and that it should be $\mathrm{ln}(1-x)$ instead of $\mathrm{ln}(x-1)$. Anyways, any help would be appreciated!! Thanks!",['ordinary-differential-equations']

1104918,Graphing elliptical curves based on group operation,"I just found this and it blew my mind (he gives an elliptical curve to do multiplication). If I understand correctly (from reading the link and other things) the Abelian group he is using is $\mathbb{R}^*/\{10^n | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ under multiplication of coset representatives. I want to graph these using my computer. I am very willing to do all the programming my self but I don't know how he does this. He says that he used ""a transcendental function related to the Weierstrass P-function"" and he expounds as to the general well known techniques he used to approximate this function. That's all fine and good but he didn't really go much further into this. To be more precise I want to do the following. Given a group operation on the reals $* : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ compute the constants $a, b$ in elliptical curve $y^2 = x^3 + a \cdot x + b$ corresponding to the group $\mathbb{R}^*/\{10^n | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ with group operation $(x H) *' (y H) = (x*y H)$. Now of course approximation will be used but I think that I am familiar enough with numerical methods to be able to approximate about what ever I need (or I can ask a different question if I can't figure that out). What I do not know is the math behind finding those constants So basically what is the math behind finding those constants? edit: As pointed out $\mathbb{R}/10\mathbb{R}$ makes no sense because $\mathbb{R} = 10\mathbb{R}$. I'm sure this is a factor group because I can tell you what the cosets look like $\{x \cdot 10^n\ | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ but I can't seem to figure out a better way to express this. I.E. 10 and 1 are in the same coset so the should be represented by the same point on the elliptical curve. edit2: I think I got it. I just had to specify the coset in an unnatural way.","['elliptic-functions', 'group-theory', 'abelian-groups', 'elliptic-curves']"

1104925,Classifying a singularity,"Suppose that $g(z)$ is an entire function with a zero of order $k$ at $z=0$.  The question is to classify the singularity of the function $\frac{\sin g(z)}{g(z)}$ at $z=0$.  I want to say that, since $$\lim_{z \to 0} \frac{\sin g(z)}{g(z)}=\lim_{z \to 0} \frac{g'(z)\cos g(z)}{g'(z)}=\lim_{z \to 0} \cos g(z)=1,$$ the function $\frac{\cos g(z)}{g(z)}$ is bounded in a neighborhood of $0$, and so the singularity is removable.

1105031,Could someone be so kind as to explain this little summation to me?,"So basically, the wording in this question, to me, is weird.

I applied the Euler's equation $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} - \frac{d}{dx}(\frac{\partial F}{\partial y'}) = 0$ and I got $6x - y'' = 0$ and after solving this I get a solution $y = x^3 +cx + d$. Now applying the condition $y(0) = 0$ gives $d=0$ and thus $y = x^3 +cx$. Again applying the condition $y(1) = 1$, I get  $c=0$ which finally yields the answer $y=x^3$. Is my solution right?

1105160,Evaluate derivative of Lagrange polynomials at construction points,"Assume, that we have points $x_i$ with $i=1,...,N+1$ . We construct the Lagrange basis polynomials as \begin{align}
L_j(x) = \prod_{k\not = j} \frac{x-x_k}{x_j-x_k}
\end{align} Now according to my computation and the results by Yves Daoust here , the derivative of $L_i$ can be computed as \begin{align}
L'_j(x) = L_j(x)\cdot \sum_{k\not = j}\frac{1}{x_k-x_j}
\end{align} I try to reproduce the numerical results of a paper, and for this results the authors use the derivative matrix $D$ with $D_{ij} =L_i'(x_j)$ . The authors use the Legendre Gauss Lobatto quadrature points, plotted below. Now I can easily construct the basis polynomials, also plotted below, together with the quadrature points. Given the concrete choice of basis points, the plots suggest, that $L'_j(x_j)=0$ except for the first and last basis function. Additionally it seems, that $L'_j(x_i)\not =0$ for $i\not = j$ . But using the derived formula from above, we obtain \begin{align}
L'_j(x_i) = L_j(x_i)\cdot \sum_{k\not = j}\frac{1}{x_k-x_j}=0
\end{align} for $i\not = j$ since $L_j(x_i) =\delta_{ij}$ , which contradicts my observation. I used the following Matlab functions, to construct the matrix $D$ . function y=dl(i,x,z)
n = length(x);
y = 0;
for m=1:n
    if not(m==i)
        y = y + 1/(x(m)-x(i));
    end
end
size(y)
y = y*l(i,x,z);

end



function y=l(i,x,z)

n = length(x);
% computes h_i(z)

y = 1;
for m=1:n
    if not(m==i)
        y = y.*(z-x(m))./(x(i)-x(m));

end
end Where dl and l are $L'$ and $L$ . $D$ is then constructed by D = zeros(M+1,M+1);
for i=1:M+1

        D(i,j) =dl(i,X,X(j));

So here are my questions: Did I make an error in the implementation? Is my formula derived under the assumption that $x$ is not a basis point? Can I modify my code to obtain the results that my finite difference code produces? Is my assumption correct, that rather the results of the finite difference computation are ""correct""? EDIT It seems, like the derivation of the formula goes wrong for $x=x_i$ . If I compute the derivative without simplification, I get \begin{align}
L_j'(x) = \sum_{l\not = j} \frac{1}{x_j-x_l}\prod_{m\not = (j,l)} \frac{x-x_m}{x_j-x_m}
\end{align} Or in code function y = alternative_dl(j,x,z)

y = 0;
n = length(x);
for l=1:n
    if not(l==j)
        k = 1/(x(j)-x(l));
        for m=1:n
            if not(m==j) && not(m==l)
                k = k*(z-x(m))/(x(j)-x(m));
            end
        end
        y = y + k;
    end
end

end Which agrees with the finite difference computation. So it seems to me, that simplifying the above formula includes some ""hidden division by zero"" if $x=x_i$ .","['polynomials', 'interpolation', 'numerical-methods', 'matlab', 'derivatives']"
1105169,Is the dual space of all Radon measures the space of signed measures on a $\delta$-ring?,"Consider the Banach space $C_c(\mathbb{R})$ of continuous functions with compact support equipped with the uniform norm $||f||_\infty := \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} |f(x)|$. Then it is known (Riesz representation theorem) that the continuous dual of $C_c$ can be identified the vector space of all finite signed Radon measures on $\mathbb{R}$, that is set-functions $\mu : \mathscr{A} \to \mathbb{R}$ (that are regular) and $\mathscr{A}$ is the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}$ (or a $\sigma$-algebra that contains the Borel sets). Now, if we equip $C_c = \bigcup_{K \text{ compact}} C_c(K)$ with the inductive limit topology where $C_c(K)$ is the space of continuous functions $f \in C_c$ (i.e. $f$ has domain $\mathbb{R}$) with $\text{supp}(f) \subseteq K$ normed by $||f||_K := \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} |f(x)| = \sup_{x \in K} |f(x)|$, then $C_c$ is a locally convex space. The dual space is larger than in the case above and consists of all Radon ""signed measures"" (e.g. the Lebesgue measure $dx$ which is clearly not finite on $\mathbb{R}$ or $\sin(x) dx$ which is not a signed measure on a $\sigma$-algebra). I want to identify this dual space with an object coming from abstract measure theory. I think, the correct object is also a signed measure which is also countably additive BUT is defined on merely the $\delta$-ring generated by bounded intervals in $\mathbb{R}$ instead of a $\sigma$-algebra (the $\delta$-ring does not contain unbounded sets like  the whole space). Is this correct intuition? And if yes, does anyone know a reference for this fact? (Of course one can generalize the ground space to be a more general topological space then $\mathbb{R}$, e.g. a locally compact second-countable Hausdorff space.) EDIT : $C_c$ was primarily equipped with the wrong topology (the compact convergence). It is now correctly equipped with the inductive limit topology from its subspaces $C_c(K)$.","['locally-convex-spaces', 'topological-vector-spaces', 'measure-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

1105211,Exercise on Martingales,"I have been struggling with the following exercise and I was wondering whether my solution is correct or not. I am pretty sure about the second part of the question (the martingale part) but not so sure about the first part of the question. Please tell me what you think. Let $(X_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of i.i.d. r.v. on $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$. Assume that $\mathbb{E}X_1=0$ and $\mathbb{E}X_1^2=1$, consider $\mathcal{F}_n=\sigma (X_1,...,X_n)$, and define $M_n=\sum\limits_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k}X_1\cdot \cdot \cdot X_k$. Calculate $\mathbb{E}(M_n^2)$ and show that $(M_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ is an $(\mathcal{F}_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ martingale. Now my answer is the following: $\mathrm{Var} (X_1)=(\mathbb{E}X_1^2)-(\mathbb{E}(X_1))^2=1$ Now: $\mathrm{Var}(M_n)=\mathrm{Var}(\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k}(X_1\cdot\cdot\cdot X_k))=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k^2}\mathrm{Var}(X_1\cdot\cdot\cdot X_k)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k^2}$, since $\mathrm{Var}(X_1)=1$ and $(X_n)$ is an iid sequence. Also we have that: $\mathbb{E}M_n=\mathbb{E}(\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k}(X_1\cdot\cdot\cdot X_k))=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k}\mathbb{E}(X_1\cdot\cdot\cdot X_k)=0$ since $\mathbb{E}X_1=0$ and $(X_n)$ iid. Now using that: $\mathbb{E}M_n^{2}=\mathrm{Var}(M_n)+(\mathbb{E}M_n)^2$, we get that: $\mathbb{E}M_n^2=0$. Now to prove that $(M_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ is an $(\mathcal{F}_n){n=0}^{\infty}$ martingale, I proceeded as follows: $\mathbb{E}(M_{n+1}|\mathcal{F}_n)=\mathbb{E}(M_n+\frac{1}{n+1}(X_1\cdot\cdot\cdot X_{n+1})|\mathcal{F}_n)=\mathbb{E}(M_n|\mathcal{F}_n)+\frac{1}{n+1}\mathbb{E}(X_1\cdot\cdot\cdot X_n|\mathcal{F}_n)=M_n+\frac{1}{n+1}\mathbb{E}(X_1|\mathcal{F}_n)\cdot\cdot\cdot\mathbb{E}(X_{n+1}|\mathcal{F}_n)=M_n+\frac{1}{n+1}\mathbb{E}X_1\cdot\cdot\cdot \mathbb{E}X_{n+1}=M_n+0=M_n.$","['probability-theory', 'martingales', 'solution-verification', 'expectation']"

Lets say we have a basis $e = {(e_1, e_2, e_3)}$ and another basis $f = {(f_1, f_2, f_3)}$. We have a change of basis matrix from $f$ to $e$ called $B$ that expresses what $f_1, f_2, f_3$ is in the basis $e$. We have defined a linear transformation $R_e$ in the basis $e$ with the matrix $A$. Let's say we have three vectors expressed in the base $f$: $P = \left(
\begin{array}{c}
s\\
t\\
u\\
\end{array}
\right)$ Now we want to apply the linear transformation $R_e = A$ to these vectors: First we have to change the basis of $P$ which gives us: $BP$. $BP$ is now $P$ expressed in the basis $e$. To apply the linear transformation we now only has to multiply $BP$ with $A$: $ABP$. But according to the formula it should be $BAB^{-1}P$. Where is my thinking incorrect?",['linear-algebra']
1105333,Trouble with Vakil's FOAG exercise 11.3.C,"I'm having trouble with the exercise in the title, even with part (a), which asks to prove that if $X$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{P}^n_k$ of dimension at least 1 and $H$ is a non-empty hypersurface, then $X$ and $H$ meet. Following the hint, I've done the following: By assumption, $X$ is given by $V(I)$ for some homogenous prime ideal $I\subset k[x_0,\dots x_n]=:A$ and $H$ by $V(f)$ for some homogenous polynomial $f\in A$. We wish to prove that there is a homogenous prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ (that's not the irrelevant one) containing both $I$ and $f$. Consider the affine cone $\mathrm{Spec}\ A/I$ of $X$ in $\mathrm{Spec}\ A$. Being homogenous, both $I$ and $f$ are contained in the ideal $(x_0,\dots x_n)$. By Krull's principal ideal theorem, every minimal prime ideal containing $f\mod I$ has codimension one. $X$ having dimension at least one implies that there are homogenous prime prime ideals $\mathfrak{q}\supsetneq \mathfrak{r}\supset I$. This implies that $(x_o,\dots x_n)$ has codimension at least two. Thus there are prime ideals containing $f\mod I$ that are contained in $(x_o,\dots x_n)$. However, I'd need to show that there are homogenous such prime ideals, right? I'd rather get hints than full solutions.","['algebraic-geometry', 'problem-solving']"
1105376,Why ternary diagrams work,"I am trying to understand why ternary diagrams work. In order that the altitude criterion be valid, if I correctly understand, given equilateral triangle $ABC$, whose vertices I name as the three phases $A,B,C$, the sum $XL'+XM'+XN'$ (see figure on the left; I use the same notation for sides and their length) of the distances of point $X$, contained inside the triangle, from the sides must equate the height of $ABC$. Why does that holds? Moreover, in order that the intersection method hold and the ratios between the three phases be respected, I would say that, if we respectively call $L,M$ and $N$ the intersection point between straight line $\overline{CX}$ and $AB$, between straight line $\overline{AX}$ and side $BC$ and between straight line $\overline{BX}$ and side $AC$, I would say that the following equality should hold:$$\frac{AN}{CN}=\frac{AL}{BL}\frac{BM}{CM}$$because, if $a,b$ and $c$ respectively are the quantities of phases $A,B$ and $C$, I would say that the equality is equivalent to $\frac{c}{a}=\frac{b}{a}\frac{c}{b}$ (where the factors correspond to each other: $\frac{c}{a}=\frac{AN}{CN}$ etc.). How can it be proved? While ternary diagrams are ubiquitous in several sciences, like geology, I can find nothing explaining the mathematical foundations of such diagrams, why they work.

1105412,Differentiability of a function on a manifold is independent of the coordinate chart,"I am currently working through Nakahara's book, ""Geometry, Topology and Physics"", and have reached the stage at looking at calculus on manifolds. In the book he states that ""The differentiability of a function $f:M\rightarrow N$ is independent of the coordinate chart that we use"". He shows this is true in $M$ and then leaves it as an exercise to show that it is also true in $N$. Here is my attempt, please could someone tell me if what I've done is correct, and if not, what the correct way is? Let $f:M\rightarrow N$ be a map from an $m$-dimensional manifold to an $n$-dimensional manifold $N$. A point $p\in M$ is mapped to a point $f(p)\in N$, namely $f:p\mapsto f(p)$. Take a chart $(U,\phi)$ on $M$ and $(V,\psi)$ on $N$, where $p\in U$ and $f(p)\in V$. Then $f$ has the following coordinate presentation: $$\psi\circ f\circ\phi^{-1}:\mathbb{R}^{m}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$$
If we write $\phi (p)=\lbrace x^{\mu}\rbrace =x$ and $\psi(f(p))=\lbrace y^{\alpha}\rbrace = y$, then $y=\psi\circ f\circ \phi^{-1} (x)$ is a vector-valued function of $m$ variables. The differentiability of $f$ is independent of the coordinate chart in $N$. Indeed, let $(V_{1},\psi_{1})$ and $(V_{2},\psi_{2})$ be two overlapping charts in $N$. Take a point $q=f(p)\in V_{1}\cap V_{2}$, whose coordinates by $\psi_{1}$ are $\lbrace y_{1}^{\mu}\rbrace$, while those $\psi_{2}$ are $\lbrace y_{2}^{\nu}\rbrace$. When expressed in terms of $\lbrace y_{1}^{\mu}\rbrace$, $f$ takes the form $$y_{1} =\psi_{1}\circ f\circ\phi^{-1}$$ while in $\lbrace y_{2}^{\nu}\rbrace$, it takes the form $$y_{2} =\psi_{2}\circ f\circ\phi^{-1} =\psi_{2}\circ\left(\psi^{-1}_{1}\circ\psi_{1}\right)\circ f\circ\phi^{-1}= \left(\psi_{2}\circ\psi^{-1}_{1}\right)\circ\psi_{1}\circ f\circ\phi^{-1}$$ Now, by definition, $\psi_{2}\circ\psi^{-1}_{1}$ is $C^{\infty}$, and therefore if $\psi_{1}\circ f\circ\phi^{-1}$ is $C^{\infty}$ with respect to $y_{1}^{\mu}$ and $\psi_{2}\circ\psi^{-1}_{1}$ is $C^{\infty}$ with respect to $y_{2}^{\nu}$, then $\psi_{2}\circ f\circ\phi^{-1}=\left(\psi_{2}\circ\psi^{-1}_{1}\right)\circ\psi_{1}\circ f\circ\phi^{-1}$ is also $C^{\infty}$ with respect to $y_{2}^{\nu}$.

1105430,Bundle metric and connection on trivial vector bundle,"I read this: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemannian  manifold and let $W$ be a vector bundle (rank $n$) over $M$ with $h_W$ a bundle metric of $W$ and $D$ a bundle connection of $W$. I choose $W$ to be the trivial vector bundle $M \times \mathbb{R}$. Let $V=T^0_0 M \otimes W = W$ be the vector bundle of $W-$valued (0,0)-tensors on $M$. Endow $V$ with the bundle metric
  $$h := (\cdot, \cdot)^0_0 \otimes h_W$$
  where $(\cdot, \cdot)^0_0 := g^{\otimes 0}\otimes g^{*\otimes 0}$ is the bundle metric on $T^0_0M$ induced by $g$. Equip $V$ with the metric connection
  $$\nabla = \nabla(\nabla_g, D)$$
  induced by the Levi-civita connection of $M$ and connection $D$ of $W$. It follows that $\nabla u = Du$ for $u \in \mathcal{T}^0_0(M, W)$. Am I right that in my case $h = h_W$? I am very confused about how the notation should be simplified for my simple trivial bundle case. Now the last sentence seems wrong to me. Don't we need $\nabla u = \nabla_g u$ where $\nabla_g$ is the Levi-Civita connection on $M$, whenever $u \in \mathcal{T}^0_0(M, W)$ (i.e., whenever $u$ is a smooth function on $M$)??? The purpose of all this stuff is to set up Sobolev spaces over vector or tensor bundles. I only need sobolev spaces over $M$, so I thought of taking the trivial vector bundle like I wrote above in order for the theory to simplify, but I have a lot of trouble understanding. My second point for example, I would expect $\nabla$ to be the ordinary gradient for a function on $M$ but it's not. It's a different connection $D$, and I don't know what I should choose $h_W$ and $D$ to be to make it work. Thanks.","['manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

1105531,$N$ perfect logicians wearing hats,"I once came across the following riddle: (assume $N$ to be extremely large) There are $N$ perfect logicians arranged in a vertical row. They are
  allowed to strategize before the game, during the game they are barred
  from communicating. In the game, the lights are switched off, and a
  single hat, either red or blue, is placed on the heads of each of the
  logicians. The lights are turned on; each logician can see the hat
  colours of all the people in front of him, he can't see the colour of
  his own hat, or the people behind him. Start with the person at the
  back, each logician has to call out a colour (heard by all). If his
  own hat is of that colour, he is spared, otherwise, silently killed.
  The same is done by the next person, and so on, right till the first
  person. How many logicians can you guarantee to save, irrespective of
  the initial colours or any probability? The answer was simple. The first logician would sacrifice his life. He would call out red if there are an even number of red hats in front of him, and black if there an odd number of red hats. After him, each logician can correctly tell the colour of his own hat. I decided to give the question a twist. Suppose there is a blind man among the logicians. His life is worth as much as anyone else, and he is placed randomly in the queue. How many logicians can you guarantee to save? The same approach wouldn't work because, if the blind man gave the wrong colour, not only him, but all the people in front of him will give the wrong colour as they depend on his information also. After a lot of thinking, I finally came up with this solution. Find the smallest $n$ such that $3(n+1)+2^n \geq N$. The first $3(n+1)$ people (from the back) will be the ones sacrificing their lives (Group A), and the rest ($2^n$) will try to figure out their own hat colours (Group B). Starting with the back of Group B, assign each logician an ($n+1$)-digit binary number, starting with a string of zeroes, and adding $1$ to get the next logician's ID. Note that the first digit will always be a $0$.The first Group is divided into $n+1$ subgroups of $3$ logicians each. Each subgroup is assigned a normal decimal number $1,2,3,\cdots$ and so on (again starting from the back). Let the subgroup number of a logician be $k$ When the game starts, each Group A logician will look at all the people in Group B, whose $k^{th}$ binary digit is $1$. Of these people, if there are an even number of red hats, he will say red, otherwise he will say blue. The other $2$ logicians in his subgroup will give exactly the same information as the first one. This is necessary to confirm that he is saying the truth, if there is a discrepancy among the $3$ answers, the information given by $2$ is correct, and the third one is the blind one. The same is done by everyone in Group A. The people of Group B only try to figure out their own hat colours. Each logician has $n+1$ ways of figuring out his own hat colour. If all of the given data doesn't lead to the same answer, he knows that the blind man is behind him and has already called out a lie. He can then use the first logician's info (first in Group A and the queue itself) to figure out his own colour, since the blind man has for sure been counted by that person. Is my approach correct and is there a faster one? I hope my question is clear enough. Note:
The blind man knows where is placed, but nobody else knows his position.","['logic', 'puzzle', 'binary', 'combinatorics']"

However, I think this question is more about finding a sequence $(e_j)$ s.t. there exist $x$ for which strict inequality hold then about finding an $x$ for which strict inequality holds. Because finding such $x$ is not always possible, most notably this is (I believe) impossible when the $(e_j)$ form a total basis for $\mathcal{l}^2$. So asking to find such $x$ with no regard to what sequence $(e_j)$ we are working with seems strange?

From the first property we deduce that $\mathcal{H} (E) := \mathcal{L} (E) / \mathcal{K} (E)$ is a Banach space for the norm $\| \tilde{T}\|_{\mathcal{H} (E)} = \inf \{\|T\|_{\mathcal{L} (E)}: \ \pi (T) = \tilde{T}\}$, where $\pi$ is the canonical projection. From the second property we deduce that the composition goes down to the quotient, and gives it a structure of unital Banach algebra. On the other hand, Wikipedia gives a few possible definitions for the essential spectrum $\sigma_{ess}$ of an operator, some of which are mentioned to be invariant under compact perturbations. Let $T \in \mathcal{L} (E)$. Is $\sigma (\pi(T))$ equal to $\sigma_{ess, k} (T)$ (see the Wikipedia page for the definition) for some $1 \leq k \leq 4$? If so, which $k$? Otherwise, do we still have $\rho_{ess} (T) = \rho(\pi(T))$, where $\rho$ (resp. $\rho_{ess}$) is the spctral radius (resp. the essential spectral radius)? Motivation: I've been working with some families of quasi-compact operators for some time now. I've never seen the essential spectrum or essential spectral radius presented this way. If this works, it could make for a pretty nice introduction to the subject if I ever need to teach it. Oh, and unfortunately I don't have the references on the Wikipedia page at hand now, so I can't check them.","['banach-algebras', 'spectral-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

If it does lead to a contradiction, the proposition ~(p) is false, meaning p is true. I am tried to do this by first factoring out a n^2, getting n^2(n+1) = 100.

So, $X\setminus\{x\}$ can't be disconnected. Assume that there are disjoint connected sets $U$ and $V$ of $X\setminus\{x\}$ such that  $$X\setminus\{x\} = U \cup V$$
And $U$ is a compact set. $U$ can't be open on $X\setminus \{x\}$ (or otherwise it'd be a clopen set of $X$). But as $U \cup V =X= \cup_{i\in I} A_i$ with $A_i$ open connected subsets of $X\setminus \{x\}$.

1106387,Understanding transformation as algebraic structure,"I am confused about the following structure, and would be very thankful if somebody could give me a hint. Let $\mathbb{S}$ be a set with n elements $\mathbb{S}=\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}$, and $(x,y) \in \mathbb{S}$. We have a transformation $T: x \mapsto y$, such that the transformation $T$ applied to any element in $\mathbb{S}$ gives a (potentially different) element in $\mathbb{S}$ again. Is $(\mathbb{S}, T)$ a special algebraic structure? Are there other properties that are not obvious? Added later: What I am describing is $T: \mathbb{S} \to \mathbb{S}$, where $T$ is bijective and $\mathbb{S}$ is a finite discrete set. Is there something special about such structures? For example, it seems like $T$ always has to be a permutation-matrix. Anything more?","['transformation', 'discrete-mathematics', 'group-theory']"

$$
[\phi(x),\phi(y)]=c \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3 2 \sqrt{\lvert \vec{k} \rvert^2 + \omega_0^2}}\left ( e^{-i\sqrt{\lvert \vec{k} \rvert^2 + \omega_0^2} \ (x_0-y_0)} - e^{i\sqrt{\lvert \vec{k} \rvert^2 + \omega_0^2} \ (x_0-y_0)} \right )e^{i \vec{k}\cdot (\vec{x}-\vec{y})} \ dk.

1106467,How does a simple elliptic integral solve this monster?,"During some electromagnetics calculation regarding a loop antenna I stumbled across the following integral $$\int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{d\phi}{\big(1+\frac{k}{k-2}\cos(2\phi)\big)^{3/2}}$$ and Mathematica gave me the solution $$\frac{(1-\frac{k}{2})^{3/2}}{k-1} E\left( k \right)$$ where $E(k)$ is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind. Cool so far. Now I am not interested in the full solution process, but the following bothers me: When I write the above slightly differently and use the definition of $E(k)$, I get $$\int_0^{\pi/2} \sqrt{1-k\sin^2(\phi)}d\phi = \frac{k-1}{(1-\frac{k}{2})^{3/2}} \int_0^{\pi/2} \sqrt{\frac{1}{\big(1+\frac{k}{k-2}\cos(2\phi)\big)^3}}d\phi$$ which totally overstrain or even contradicts my calculus intuition. I am wondering how on earth the simple elliptic integral on the LHS is able to account for all the intricacies of the involved, tedious monster with a third-order polynomial of cosines in the denominator of a square root on the RHS. Is there any concise argument that explains how $E(k)$ pulls off such a feat?

1106514,Derivative with respect to another function,"I stumbled on this calculus problem here: Let $f(x) = \ln|\sec x + \tan x|$ and $g(x) = \sec x + \tan x.$ Find the fourth derivative of $g(x)$ taken with respect to $f(x)$ A) $\\$ $f'(x)$ B) $\\$ $f'(x)g(x)$ C) $\\$ $g(x)$ D) $\\$ $g'(x)$ E) $\\$ NOTA The answer to the question was C I understand how to find a function taken with respect with a derivative. For example, if I was trying to find the first derivative: $$\frac{dg(x)}{df(x)} = \frac{dg(x)}{dx}*\frac{dx}{df(x)}$$ I would simply use the chain rule. However, for subsequent derivatives, the two functions tend to get more messy, so I decided to look at the solution provided to see if there was an easier method. Interestingly enough, the solution is: The first derivative simplifies as follows: $$\frac{d(g(x))}{d(f(x))} = \frac{d(g(x))}{dx}*\frac{dx}{d(f(x))} = \frac{\sec^2(x) + \sec(x)\tan(x)}{\sec(x)} = g(x)$$ Thus all higher order derivatives will produce the same result, and the answer is $g(x) =$ C. Is this conclusion true for any function taken with respect with another function? If so, if anyone could point me to a proof that would be also appreciated.","['calculus', 'reference-request', 'derivatives']"

1106522,How to parameterize some emprical data,"I would like to describe a bunch of data that I have collected as a function of two variables.  The data is phytoplankton absorption in my local area that has changed in concentration.  The data looks similar to this image. Phytoplankton will vary in absorption greatly around 440 (nm) and 665 (nm)  [Actually it is more complicated than that but for my purposes it is fine.] The total absorption will increase with concentration.  It will increase non-linearly as their are shading effects and chlorophyll packaging effects. I was thinking that it may be possible to come up with a two component empirical model, possibly? based around a basis vector (or the mean value of lots of measurements) and somehow describing the variance around 440 and 665 nm to scale the total absorption. I don't really know where to start looking. These so called 'bio-optical' models are comon for CDOM and Particle scattering but they are much simpler to describe by fitting curves to their much simpler shapes.
