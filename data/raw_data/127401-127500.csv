1946054,Borel measurability of a set where convergence occurs,"Let $F:\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R$ be a jointly Borel measurable function. I am wondering if the set $$\left\{x\in\mathbb R\,\bigg|\,\lim_{y\to0}F(x,y)=0\right\}$$ is Borel measurable. The main difficulty is that even though the set $$\left\{x\in\mathbb R\,\bigg|\,\lim_{n\to\infty}F(x,y_n)=0\right\}$$ is Borel measurable for a given sequence $(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ converging to $0$, this must hold for all, uncountably many , such sequences. Therefore, taking intersections does not help. Any input would be greatly appreciated.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1946161,$f:X\rightarrow X$ such that $f(f(x))=x$,"Let $X$ be a metric space and $f:X\rightarrow X$ be such that $f(f(x))=x$, for all $x\in X$. Then $f$ is one-one and onto; is one-one but not onto; is onto but not one-one; need not be either. From the given condition I have that $f^2=i$ where $i$ is the identity function. If $f$ itself is the identity function then the conditions are satisfied as well as $f$ is bijection. Is that the only such function or are there other possibilities ? My guess is that it will be bijection i.e. option $1$ will be correct . For see, if $$f(x_1)=y \ \text{and}\ f(x_2)=y \ \text{then} \ f(y)=x_1\ \text{and}\ f(y)=x_2$$ will be possible iff $x_1=x_2$. So this is injective. Now an injection from a set to itself is trivially surjective so it is bijective.   Is my proof correct?","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

Beginning with the former, suppose that $x \in (A \cup B)'$ then $x\notin A \cup B$. This implies that $x\notin A$ or $x\notin B$, which in turn should imply that $x\in A'$ or $x\in B'$.

1946243,Is there a nontrivial analytic function which takes the same values on disjoint circles?,"Given two disjoint circles $C_1$ and $C_2$ in the complex plane, is there a nontrivial analytic function $f(z)$ whose values on $C_1$ are the same as its values on $C_2$ up to rotation and dilation? What little intuition I have about this suggests not. If we had a function $f = u+i~v$ and think of the harmonic functions $u,v$ as potential distributions, we could consider the special case of two nearly osculating circles of very different size. Informally (and far too vaguely) the mutual patterns of influence of the two circles seem qualitatively different, so it seems unreasonable to suppose the functions could be the same. This argument does not work for circles of the same size. As a guess we would have that $f(z)=u(x,y)+i~v(x,y) = f(w(z))$ for some Mobius transformation $w(z)$ and maybe the Cauchy-Riemann equations cannot be satisfied? I was hoping for an obvious geometric argument but maybe it's not possible? Edit: It seems that this may be possible for same-radius circles (I didn't want to rule these out) and I would upvote/accept an answer along these lines, but would add 100 points to an answer that proves it's impossible [ re-edit : and kal v'chomer possible] for different-radius circles.","['complex-analysis', 'analytic-functions', 'harmonic-functions']"

1946295,Is this Galois theory proof of Fundamental Theorem of Algebra correct?,"I am studying Galois theory through Lang's Algebra and Dummit-Foote's Abstract Algebra. While studying the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra's proofs from both books I spent a lot of time to understand and in the process tried to simplify or rewrite the proof. I like to do this several times. For the proof we need two facts or results as follows: (a) There are no non-trivial finite extensions of $\Bbb R$ of odd degree. (b) There are no quadratic extensions of $\Bbb C$ . Fundamental Theorem of Algebra : $\Bbb C$ is algebraically closed. Proof : Since $\Bbb R$ has characteristic $0$ , every finite extension is separable. Hence $\Bbb R(i)/ \Bbb R$ is separable (Because $\Bbb R(i)/ \Bbb R$ is finite extension). $\Bbb R(i)=\Bbb C$ is contained in a finite Galois extension $K$ over $\Bbb R$ . ( By Corollary 23(Dummit-Foote): Let $E/F$ be any finite separable extension. Then $E$ is contained in an extension K which is Galois over $F$ and is minimal in the sense that in a fixed algebraic closure of $K$ any other Galois extension of $F$ containing $E$ contains $K$ . We used $E=\Bbb R(i)$ and $F=\Bbb R$ . ) Let $G$ be the Galois group of $K/ \Bbb R$ . Using fact (a) , since there are no non-trivial finite extensions of $\Bbb R$ of odd degree, we have $|G|$ is even. Therefore $|G|=2^n m$ where $m$ is an odd number and $n \ge 1$ . Let $H$ be a sylow $-2-$ subgroup of $G$ and $F$ be the fixed field of $H$ . Hence $|G:H|=m=|F:\Bbb R|$ . But again by fact (a) , $|G:H|=m=1$ $\Rightarrow G=H$ is a $2-$ group. We know that p-groups have subgroups of all orders and they all are normal subgroups. Also $[K:\Bbb R]=[K: \Bbb R(i)][\Bbb R(i): \Bbb R] \Rightarrow 2^n=[K: \Bbb R(i)](2) \Rightarrow [K: \Bbb R(i)]=2^{n-1}.$ Hence Gal $(K/\Bbb R(i))$ is a $2-$ group of order $2^{n-1}$ where $n \ge 1$ where $n \gt 1$ would mean that this group is non-trivial and $n=1$ would mean that it is trivial. If $n \gt 1$ , Since $2-$ groups have subgroups of all orders (Being p-groups), there exists an extension of $\Bbb R(i)=\Bbb C$ of order $2$ which is contradiction to fact (b) . So we can say that $n=1$ and Gal $(K/ \Bbb R(i))=1.$ Hence $K=\Bbb R(i)=\Bbb C$ . I have ommited proofs of facts (a) and (b) as they are precisely the same as in Dummit and Foote. Also I have mentioned only those things of which I want to be sure whether they are correct or not.","['galois-theory', 'p-groups', 'proof-verification', 'group-theory', 'field-theory']"
1946332,Why are (S)pinor representations *restrictions* of Clifford algebra representations?,"Firstly, just to clarify my notation: Let $Cl(V,q)$ denote the Clifford Algebra of a quadratic vector space $(V,q)$ and denote by $Cl(V,q)_{0\vert 1}$ the even/odd part in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-grading of $Cl(V,q) = Cl(V,q)_0 \oplus Cl(V,q)_1$ of the Clifford-algebra.

  representation of $Cl(V,q)$ onto $Pin(V,q)$. Similary a spinor
  representation is the restriction of an irreducible representation of

1946422,Prove the transitivity of $<$ relation in natural numbers using the classical definition and the associativity of addition,"In the book Notes on Mathematical Analysis the set $\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers was defined using the classical Peano's axioms. Then $<$ was defined as if exist $k\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $b=S^k(a)$ then we say $a<b$ . Then it was asked to prove the transitivity of $<$ relation. I proceed as follows: if $a<b$ then by definition there is a $k$ , $b=S^k(a)$ . Same for $b<c$ , $c=S^l(b)$ . Then it will comes that $c=S^{k+l}(a)$ , which means $a<c$ . I can't find errors in my proof but in the book's hint this transitivity should be proved by the associativity which proved before. I can't find the required proof either. Any help will be greatly appreciated. ps.
Moreover, in the next section another definition of $\mathbb{N}$ appears as: Given a set $N$ and a map $S:N\rightarrow N$ , such that a) $1\notin S(N)$ ; b) $S$ is injective; c) The set $N$ is well-ordered, that is, for any non-empty subset $E$ of $N$ , there exists $m\in E$ , $\forall n\in E(m\le n)$ . The $<$ definition is the same as above. In this case it is also asked to prove the transitivity of $<$ , as well as $N=\mathbb{N}$ . This also confuse me since I can't tell the difference between this two definitions, and I think the prove to things like ""among $a<b, b<a, a=b$ exactly one is correct"" and ""1 is the minimal number in $N$ "" is the same as before.

1946438,Solving $e^{e^z}=1$: am I missing something?,"I solved the equation $e^{e^z}=1$ and it seemed to easy so I suspect I must be missing something. Would someone please check my answer? My original answer: $e^{e^z}=1$ if and only if $e^z = 2\pi i k$ for $k\in \mathbb Z$ if and only if $z=\ln(2\pi i k)$ for $k\in \mathbb Z$. Edit After reading the comments and answers I tried to do it again. Unfortunately, I still do not get the same result as in the answers. My second attempt: We have $$ e^x = 1 \iff x = 2 \pi i k$$ hence $$ e^z = 2 \pi i k$$ for some $k$ in $\mathbb Z$. Letting $e^z = e^x (\cos y + i \sin y)$ we get $$ e^x \cos y + i e^x \sin y = 2 \pi k i$$ which implies that $\cos y = 0$ which happens if and only if $y_j = {\pi \over 2} + \pi j$ where $j\in \mathbb Z$. At $y_j$ we have
$\sin y = \pm 1$ hence if $j$ is even $$ e^x = 2 \pi i k$$ and if $j$ is odd $$ e^x = -2 \pi i k$$ Hence if $j$ is even, $$ x = {\pi \over 2} + \ln(2 \pi k)$$ and if $j$ is odd, $$ x = {3\pi \over 2} + \ln(2 \pi k)$$ So we see that the solutions are $$

 {\pi \over 2} + \ln(2 \pi k) + i ({\pi \over 2} + 2t \pi )\\ 
 {3\pi \over 2} + \ln(2 \pi k) + i({\pi \over 2} + (2 +1)t \pi )

1946734,When is the center manifold attractive and how does this dictate asymptotic behaviour?,"Assuming some knowledge of center manifold theory, I would like more details on the following statement found on the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_manifold . ""The center manifold emergence theorem then says that the neighborhood may be chosen so that all solutions of the system staying in the neighborhood tend exponentially quickly to some solution $y(t)$ on the center manifold. That is, $x(t) = y(t) + O( e^{−\beta t} )$ as  $t \to \infty$ for some rate $\beta$."" I have never seen a statement of the center manifold theorem where the proof of this result is explicit. The attractivity part of the Theorem in Ioos and Adelmeyer (referenced by Wikipedia) is stated without proof. In Kuznetsov's book it states that a necessary condition for a center manifold to be attractive is that the unstable manifold vanishes, but not that this condition is sufficient. Guckenheimer + Holmes only state the Theorem of Henry and Carr that says if the unstable manifold vanishes and the origin is a stable solution of the reduced equation, then it is a stable solution of the whole system. In summary, I am looking for a proof of the intuitive fact that, if the unstable manifold is empty, for large time any trajectory starting in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point (taken w.l.o.g. to be the origin) approaches a solution of the reduced equation on the center manifold, regardless the nature of the origin as an equilibrium of the reduced equation. Motivating example is the system
\begin{equation*} \dot{x} = A x + f(x,y), \quad \dot{y} = By +g(x,y)\end{equation*} 
where $A \in \Bbb R^{2 \times 2}$ has an imaginary pair of eigenvalues and all eigenvalues of $B \in \Bbb R^{n \times n}$ have negative real part. Suppose the origin is a center of the reduced equation $\dot{x}=Ax+f(x,h(x))$ on the center manifold $y= h(x)$. Then my intuition says solutions approach a periodic solution of reduced equation that is realized as a limit cycle of the total system. When is this the case? What happens if the reduced equation admits a family of periodic orbits?","['asymptotics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems']"

1947106,Convexity of the solution of an o.d.e.,"Are there any results on proving the convexity of a function defined implicitly through an ode? More specifically I'm interested in proving convexity of a function
$f(t,u):\mathbb{R}_{+}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{+}$ in $u$ ($0 \leq u  \leq 1$) for
all $t$ given that it satisfies the following ode:
$$
\frac{\partial f(t,u)}{\partial t}=a-\min(u,f(t,u)),
$$
with initial condition $f(0)$. Update 2: Here is a more basic question (which can help answering the original one): can we show that $f(t,u)$ is nonincreasing in $u$ for all $t$? (without solving the ode) This is very intuitive: one can think of $f$ as the content of a buffer/tank at time $t$ with input rate $a$ and output rate $\min(u,f(t,u))$. The output rate is at most $u$ but also cannot exceed the current content level. By increasing $u$ we are basically increasing the potential output rate and hence it must be that $f$ is nonincreasing in $u$. Update 1: Eventually I'm interested in showing convexity when $a$ is also a function of $t$, i.e., $f$ solves
$$
\frac{\partial f(t,u)}{\partial t}=a(t)-\min(u,f(t,u)).
$$
This is why I'm looking for an implicit approach to prove convexity (rather than solving the ode). 
When $a(t)=a$ the ode can be solved (as @daw mentioned) by considering the two cases $u<f(t,u)$ and $u \geq f(t,u)$. This leads to two ode's with solutions given by
$$
f_{1}(t,u)=f_{1}(s)+(t-s)(\lambda-u),\\
f_{2}(t,u)=(f_{2}(s)-a) \exp(-(t-s))+a,
$$
which characterize the solution of the original ode: Given an initial condition $f(0)$ the solution is given by one of the equations above with the possibility of crossing over to the other equation at most once. Here is a plot of the trajectory of $f$ for a fixed $u$: As you see given initial condition $f(0)=1$ the solution is given by the first (linear) equation $f_{1}$ but once it reaches $u=0.9$ it takes the exponential form of $f_{2}$. The solution is also continuous in $u$ and I'm pretty sure convex in $u$ for all $t$ even when $a=a(t)$. Here is a plot of $f(t,u)$ as a function of $u$ for differnet values of $t$: I believe something can be done by differentiating the ode with respect to $u$ and trying to show the monotonicity of the derivative, but I haven't had any luck yet.","['real-analysis', 'dynamical-systems', 'convex-analysis', 'convex-optimization', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

1947421,Proving the continued fraction expansion of $\sqrt2$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Proving the continued fraction representation of $\sqrt{2}$ (3 answers) Closed 7 years ago . I am working on a multi-part problem, which shows that $$\sqrt{2} = 1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+...}}$$ I have shown that given some rational approximation $\frac{m}{n}$ to $\sqrt2$ , we can take $\frac{m'}{n'} = \frac{m+2n}{m+n}$ and get a better approximation. I also know that this iteration goes back and forth between being larger and smaller than $\sqrt2$. Say if we start with $\frac{m}{n}<\sqrt2$, then iterating will give us $$\frac{m}{n}<\frac{m''}{n''} = \frac{3m+4n}{2m+3n}<\sqrt2$$ Finally, I am asked to prove that the sequence obtained by iterating in this fashion, starting with $$1,\frac{3}{2},\frac{7}{5},...$$ which I have shown is given recursively by $$q_1=1, q_{n+1} = 1+\frac{1}{1+q_n} $$ converges to $\sqrt2$. My professor's ""hint"" is to consider the ""odd"" and ""even"" subsequences, and show that they both converge to the same limit. This makes sense to me, since both sequences are clearly monotone and bounded. Most (all?) of my classmates simply wrote that because they are both monotone and bounded by $\sqrt2$, then they must both converge to $\sqrt2$. However, just because they are bounded above and below, respectively by $\sqrt2$, it does not necessarily mean that $\sqrt2$ is the limit for both (or either!) of them. Some classmates have tried to prove by contradiction that if there were some other limit for one of the subsequences, we could iterate again and get closer to $\sqrt2$. I think that this is a faulty argument, because it assumes that we reach the limit. Remember: the sequence is ""fixed"" as soon as we choose to start it at $q_1 = 1$ ! My counterargument towards most of my classmates has been the sequence given my $\frac{1}{n}$. The sequence is bounded below by $-99$, and no matter how many times we ""iterate"" (in this case, just taking the next value of $n$) we can always get closer and closer to $-99$, but that doesn't mean that $-99$ is the limit. If someone could offer me a resolution to this problem I would be hugely appreciative. It's been driving me crazy for the past week.

1947580,Computing differential of a map of affine schemes,"I'm working on an example I made up to try to understand how etale maps work. Let $X = Spec(k[x,y]/(y-x^2))$ be the parabola over an algebraically closed field. Consider the projection map to $\mathbb{A}^1 = Spec(k[t])$ down to the $x$-coordinate, i.e. $\pi: X \to \mathbb{A}^1$ is the map induced by $t \mapsto x$. For this map to be etale it has to be a local diffeomorphism, i.e. it induces an isomorphism on tangent spaces. But I'm having a little trouble working out the computation explicitly. Here's what I have on my own. We know $T_{X,p}$ for $p = (\alpha, \alpha^2)$ (i.e. corresponding to the ideal $(x-\alpha, y-\alpha^2)$ is equal to the kernel of the Jacobian map (writing $f$ for $y-x^2$) $( \partial{f}/\partial x(\alpha) \text{  |    } \partial{f}/\partial y(\alpha)) = (-2\alpha \text{ | } 1)$. This is the line given by $y = 2\alpha x$. Now how do I explicitly compute $d\pi: \{(x,2\alpha x)\} \to T_{\mathbb{A}^1, \pi(p)}$? As $\pi(p) = (t-\alpha)$ corresponds to just the point $(\alpha, 0)$, my guess is the induced map is also projection to the first coordinate (hence an isomorphism), but perhaps I'm missing a good enough definition to see why it should be that (I'm trying to do this by piecing together a few things I've heard about Zariski tangent spaces). If there's a good source to do these types of explicit computations, especially anything related to explicit etale maps I'd appreciate seeing it. This example is far too simple to be the end of the story, so I'd like to try a harder one after I get this down.

Exponentiation is just multiplying a number $N$ times by a number. 3) Would it be possible to invent your own function to solve $x^2 = 2^x$, or rather, $x^y = y^x$?

An integrand of differential equation gives plot of the curve with B.C. $ r(0) =2, r^{\prime }(0) = 0 $ with plot: The condition $ a=b$ implies hyperbolic geodesics on Beltrami pseudosphere. When $ a\ne b$ typically meridian resembles a hypo pseudosphere containing the curious metric. $ \phi =\psi$ (slope and inclination to meridian) for the former and $ \phi +\psi = \pi/2  $ for meridian shown. I expected in a not too wild and off-tangent imagination to mirror a skewed Pythagorean relation ( hyperbolic?) $ c^2 = (a^2-b^2) $ of equation tagged (0) geometrical relation being valid and should show up somewhere, but I cannot recognize it anywhere. Sorry for the subjective nature of query, I am posting it despite whatever vagueness that is going with it ... and I do appreciate not down-voting as stimulus to such research inquiries..","['hyperbolic-geometry', 'calculus-of-variations', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
1947917,How can I know whether the point is a maximum or minimum without much calculation?,"Find the maximum and minimum of this function and state whether they
  are local or global: $$f: \mathbb{R} \ni x \mapsto \frac{x}{x^{2}+x+1} \in \mathbb{R}$$ \begin{align*} 
f'(x)&= \frac{-x^{2}+x}{\left(x^{2}+x+1\right)^{2}}\\
f'(x)&=0 \iff \frac{-x^{2}+x}{\left(x^{2}+x+1\right)^{2}}=0 \iff -x^2+x=0 \iff x(1-x)=0, \end{align*}
which gives $x_{1}=0, x_{2}=1$. Here comes the disturbing part, we need to know if these are maximum or minimum and for this we usually used the second derivative. But this would be soo exhausting, I don't even  want think of doing it. There must be an easier way and I remember someone here has even recommended me using monotony somehow. But how can we do this here? Please do tell me, at home I got enough time to use second derivative but surely not in the exam : /","['derivatives', 'curves', 'functions', 'calculus', 'analysis']"
1947963,Proof that uniform convergence implies convergence in norm of function space,"In an arbitrary normed space $X$ consider a sequence of functions $f_n:X\to \mathbb{R}$ which converges uniformly to some function $f: X\to \mathbb{R}$. Now consider an arbitrary function space $Y$ (over $\mathbb{R}$) consisting of functions from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$ with arbitrary norm $\|\cdot\|_Y$, which contains $f_n$ for each natural $n$ and contains $f$. Now intuitively I feel that uniform convergence should imply that $\|f-f_n\|_Y \xrightarrow[\infty]{n}0$. It is easy enough to prove this in any concrete function space like the $L^p$ spaces, but I'm struggling to find a proof for the general case, which is frustrating because it seems intuitively so obvious. I feel the proof should go along the lines of, because for any $\varepsilon>0$ we can find a natural $N$ such that for all $n>N$
$$|f(x)-f_n(x)|<\varepsilon \quad \forall x\in X,$$
then in some sense $f-f_n$ is in some sense within an $\varepsilon$ ""distance"" of $0$. I'm struggling to make this argument concrete using only the ideas of general normed spaces. I now believe that there exists a strange norm which makes this untrue. Translated to metric spaces obviously the discrete metric would give us a suitable counterexample. I can't find a suitable analogue in a normed space because of scalar multiplication. If anyone can give a proof or provide a counterexample as to whether uniform convergence implies convergence in the norm, or can direct me to a reference on the topic I'd be very appreciative. EDIT: I'd like to rephrase the question to deal exclusively with the kind of spaces I had in mind, which Daniel Fischer uncannily knew. As he pointed out a counter example will be any space $L^P(X)$ where $\mu(X)=\infty$. So let us rephrase the question and deal with a compact subspace of $X$, say $Z$. Then if we consider a sequence $f_n:Z\to \mathbb{R}$ converging to $f:Z\to \mathbb{R}$, and redefine $Y$ to be a function space consisting of functions from $Z$ to $\mathbb{R}$ with some arbitrary norm, does uniform convergence then imply convergence in the norm? As my measure theory course was rather disappointing I'm not entirely sure that the measure of a compact subset is finite. If not then obviously the answer stays the same. Are there any conditions that force the statement to be true?","['functional-analysis', 'general-topology', 'convergence-divergence', 'uniform-convergence']"

1948097,Choice needed in equiv. of two definitions of well-founded set,"(old question: the usual proof of Well-founded induction uses Dependent choice. Is it necessary?
I've heard that Well-founded induction is equivalent to dependent choice - I highly doubt that, but I couldn't find any references.) EDIT : Hagen's answer suggests, that I have a different definition of well-founded set and my question is - at the end of the day - about their equivalence. I should've been more precise in my original question, let me correct that. We work with a set with a binary relation $(X, R)$, let's assume $R$ is irreflexive for it makes things technically smoother. (Hagen's) $(X, R)$ is well-founded, when every nonempty subset $S\subseteq X$ has a minimal element, meaning an element $m$ such that there's no $s\in S$ satisfying $sRm$. (Mine) $(X, R)$ is well-founded, when there's no infinite sequence $(a_i)_{i=0}^{\infty}$ such that $$\dots Ra_1Ra_0.$$ To get from the first to the second is obvious, the first take on the other direction uses dependent choice. This really should be the question: How much choice do we need to make these definitions equivalent? Is the full dependent choice necessary? Just for the completeness, the well-founded induction: Let $P$ be a property on elements of  a well-founded set $(X,R)$, then $$\forall x.(\forall y.(yRx\implies P(y))\implies P(x)) \implies \forall x.P(x).$$

A labeling $f: B_n \to \mathbb{R}_+$ is called allowed if it satisfies: $f(\emptyset) = 1$ $a \subset b \Rightarrow f(a) < f(b)$ $  f(a)f(b) \le f(a \cup b)f(a \cap b)$, $\forall a,b \in B_n$ Let $\varphi(f) := (-1)^n\sum_{a \in B_n} (-1)^{|a|} f(a)$ be the Euler totient of the labeling $f$. Remark : For $n=1$, we see directly that $\varphi(f)>0$, and for $n=2$ it is proved in this answer . Our system admits a solution iff there is an allowed labeling of $B_3$ with a negative Euler totient. To understand that take $f(\{1,2,3\})=x_1$, $ f(\{1,2\})=x_2 $, $f(\{1,3\})=x_3$, $f(\{2,3\})=x_4$, $f(\{1\})=x_5$, $f(\{2\})=x_6$, $f(\{3\})=x_7$ and $f(\emptyset)=1=x_8$. $ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \  \ $ Remark : If $f$ maps to $\mathbb{N}$ and $x_1 < 100$ then $\varphi(f) > 0$ (checked by SAGE). If moreover $a \subset b \Rightarrow f(a) \mid f(b)$, then we get the same for $x_1 < 10^5$. If $  f(a)f(b) = f(a \cup b)f(a \cap b)$ then $\varphi(f) = (x_5-1)(x_6-1)(x_7-1)>0$. Bonus question : What's the lowest $\varphi(f)$ for $f$ an allowed labeling of $B_3$? Lemma : $\varphi(f)>-1$. Proof : First $(x_1-x_2)(x_1-x_3)(x_1-x_4)>0$, so $x_1^3 + x_1(x_2x_3+x_2x_4+x_3x_4) > x_1^2(x_2+x_3+x_4)+x_2x_3x_4$, then $x_1 + \frac{x_2x_3}{x_1}+\frac{x_2x_4}{x_1}+\frac{x_3x_4}{x_1} > x_2+x_3+x_4+\frac{x_2x_3x_4}{x_1^2}$, but $x_5 \ge \frac{x_2x_3}{x_1}, x_6 \ge \frac{x_2x_4}{x_1}, x_7 \ge \frac{x_3x_4}{x_1}$. It follows that $\varphi(f) > \frac{x_2x_3x_4}{x_1^2}-1>-1$. $\square$ The following shows that $\frac{x_2x_3x_4}{x_1^2} \le 1$, so that we can't get a better lower bound for $\varphi(f)$ by this method. Lemma : $x_2x_3x_4 \le  x_1^2$. Proof : First $(x_2x_3)(x_2x_4)(x_3x_4) \le (x_1x_5)(x_1x_6)(x_1x_7)$, so $(x_2x_3x_4)^2 \le x_1^3x_5x_6x_7$, Then, $(x_2x_3x_4)^4 \le x_1^6(x_5x_6)(x_5x_7)(x_6x_7) \le x_1^6(x_2x_3x_4)$. It follows that  $(x_2x_3x_4)^3 \le  x_1^6$, so $x_2x_3x_4 \le  x_1^2$. $\square$","['inequality', 'systems-of-equations', 'lattice-orders', 'computer-algebra-systems', 'combinatorics']"
