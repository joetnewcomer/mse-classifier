2639340,Is the Perturbed Laplacian Matrix positive Definite?,"Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the Laplacian matrix of a connected, undirected and unweighted graph $\mathcal{G}$ with $n$ vertices, and let $\Delta \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ be a diagonal matrix with at least one nonzero entry (for instance $\Delta=\mbox{diag}\{1,0,\cdots,0\}$). Numerically, I can see that $$x^T(L+\Delta)x>0$$ But I cannot prove it since both matrices, $\mathcal{L}$ and $\Delta$ are positive semidefinite.

2639342,How to take the conjugate of a number with more than 2 square roots,"I was doing some abstract algebra and I came across the problem of figuring out if $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})=\{a+b\sqrt{2}+c\sqrt{3}+d\sqrt{6} : a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Q}\}$ is a ring and further if it is a field. Part of this is proving that every element is invertible for a field which I believe to be the case in this example. My question is, is there a general way to take a conjugate of a number of this form and more generally numbers of the form, $$x=a_{0}+ \sum_{n \neq k^2} a_{i}\sqrt{n}$$

2639472,Is there a coordinate free proof for this result?,"Let $(M,g)$ be a smooth manifold with metric tensor $g$. For this problem, the signature of $g$ seems to be of no importance. Consider a vector bundle $\pi : E\to M$ and a smooth embedding $\phi : N\to M$. We can form the pullback bundle $\phi^\ast E$ and introduce on it the induced connexion, characterized by $$(\phi^\ast\nabla)_X (\phi^\ast f)=\phi^\ast(\nabla_{\phi_\ast X}f).$$ First of all it is worth to remark that if $f : N\to \phi^\ast E$ is a section, we know it to be of the form $f(x)=(x,\bar{f}(x))$ where $\bar{f} : N\to E$ with $\pi\circ \bar{f}=\phi$. In other words, we extract $\bar{f}$ from $f$ by composing with the projection on the second factor $\operatorname{pr}_2: N\times E\to E$. If $f : N\to \phi^\ast E$ is a section, we shall denote $$(\phi^\ast \nabla)_{X}\bar{f}=\operatorname{pr}_2\circ (\phi^\ast\nabla)_X f.$$ I have first of all shown the following result: Let $\{e_a\}$ be a local frame of $E$ so that $f = f^a \phi^\ast e_a$. Suppose further that $(y,V)$ is a coordinate system on $N$ and $(x,U)$ a coordinate system on the image of $\phi$ inside $M$. Define $\Gamma_{\kappa a}^b$ by $$\nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\kappa}}e_a=\Gamma_{\kappa a}^b e_b$$
  then we have $$(\phi^\ast \nabla)_X \bar{f}=\left[X(f^b)+f^a(\phi_\ast \circ X)^\kappa \Gamma_{\kappa a}^b\circ \phi\right]e_b\circ \phi.$$ With this we can prove the following result: let $E=TM$ be the tangent bundle and $\nabla$ some connexion on it (not necessarily the Levi-Civita). Let $N=(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\times [a,b]$ equiped with the natural coordinate functions $(s,u)$ which are just the components of the identity. Let $\gamma : N\to M$ be a one-parameter family of geodesics. Introduce the tangent and deviation vector fields on $\gamma^\ast(TM)$ by $$\bar{T}=\gamma_\ast \circ \dfrac{\partial}{\partial u},\quad \bar{S}=\gamma_\ast \circ \dfrac{\partial}{\partial s}.$$ It is clear that the components of these vector fields over $\gamma$ are just $$\bar{T}^\beta = \dfrac{\partial \gamma^\beta}{\partial u},\quad \bar{S}^\beta=\dfrac{\partial \gamma^\beta}{\partial s}.$$ In that case I have shown in local coordinates on the image of $\gamma$ the following \begin{align}(\gamma^\ast\nabla)_{\frac{\partial}{\partial s}}\bar{T}^\beta&=\dfrac{\partial T^\beta}{\partial s}+T^\alpha S^\kappa \Gamma_{\kappa \alpha}^\beta\circ \gamma\\ &= \dfrac{\partial^2 \gamma^\beta}{\partial u\partial s}+T^\alpha S^\kappa \Gamma_{\kappa \alpha}^\beta\circ \gamma\\&=\dfrac{\partial^2 \gamma^\beta}{\partial s\partial u}+T^\alpha S^\kappa \Gamma_{\kappa \alpha}^\beta\circ \gamma\\&=\dfrac{\partial S^\beta}{\partial u}+T^\alpha S^\kappa \Gamma_{\kappa \alpha}^\beta\circ \gamma\\&=\dfrac{\partial S^\beta}{\partial u}+T^\alpha S^\kappa \Gamma_{\alpha\kappa }^\beta\circ \gamma+2 S^\kappa T^\alpha \Gamma_{[\kappa\alpha]}^\beta\circ\gamma\\&=(\gamma^\ast\nabla)_{\frac{\partial}{\partial u}}S^\beta+2S^\kappa T^\alpha\Gamma_{[\kappa\alpha]}^\beta\circ\gamma.\end{align} In particular if the connexion is torsion-free (the Levi-Civita for example) we get the nice-looking result: \begin{align}(\gamma^\ast\nabla)_{\frac{\partial}{\partial s}}\bar{T}^\beta&=(\gamma^\ast\nabla)_{\frac{\partial}{\partial u}}S^\beta.\end{align} This proof seems fine to me (of course I could have made some mistake and not noticed), but I'm wondering: is there some coordinate free proof of this result? The only way I've found to prove this result was going through the coordinate expression of the pullback connexion, but I believe some quicker and cleaner way without coordinates there should be.","['semi-riemannian-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'alternative-proof', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

2639621,Closed-form analytical solutions to Optimal Transport/Wasserstein distance,"Kuang and Tabak (2017) mentions that: ""closed-form solutions of the multidimensional optimal transport problems are relatively rare, a number of numerical algorithms have been proposed."" I'm wondering if there are some resources (lecture notes, papers, etc.) that collect/contain known solutions to optimal transport and/or Wasserstein distance between two distributions in dimensions greater than 1. For example, let $ \mathcal{N_1}(\mu_1, \Sigma_1) $ and $ \mathcal{N_2}(\mu_2, \Sigma_2) $ denote two Gaussian distributions with different means and covariances matrices. Then the optimal transport map between them is: $$ x \longrightarrow \mu_2 + A( x - \mu_1 ) $$ where $ A = \Sigma_1^{- 1/2} (\Sigma_1^{1/2} \Sigma_2 \Sigma_1^{1/2})^{1/2} \Sigma_1^{- 1/2}$ . And so the Wasserstein 2 distance is $$ W_2 ( \mathcal{N_1}(\mu_1, \Sigma_1), \mathcal{N_2}(\mu_2, \Sigma_2) ) = || \mu_1 - \mu_2 ||^2_2 + \mathrm{Tr}( \Sigma_1 + \Sigma_2 - 2( \Sigma_1^{1/2} \Sigma_2 \Sigma_1^{1/2} )^{1/2} ) $$ where $\mathrm{Tr}$ is the trace operator. It will be nice to know more worked out examples of optimal transport, such as uniform distributions between different geometric objects, e.g. concentric and overlapping balls, between rectangles, etc.","['normal-distribution', 'optimal-transport', 'closed-form', 'statistics', 'probability']"
2639741,What path should train tracks follow to appear parallel all the way to the horizon?,"Imagine standing between the rails on a train track and looking out towards the horizon. The rails are parallel, but they appear to converge as they recede into the distance. Is there any curve that the two rails could follow such that they appear parallel out to the horizon instead of appearing to converge? My best guess would be that to appear parallel the apparent distance between the curves must remain constant. For that to be the case, it seems like two diverging lines would suffice since the length of the horizon ought to grow linearly with distance from the observer - meaning the space between the lines ought to grow linearly as well to maintain a constant proportion of the horizon. I suppose that this should be a fairly simple problem in projective geometry, but I don't know the first thing about that subject and couldn't find any discussions of this problem elsewhere online.","['projective-geometry', 'geometry']"
2639757,"Consider $f\big(xy + f(y)\big) = y\,f(x)$ then find the value of $f(y)$.

My friend showed me that $ \ (*) \ \ f(y) = 1 - y$. Proof : By setting $x = 1$, we obtain $$f\big(y + f(y)\big) = y\,f(1).\tag1$$ Now, by setting $y=1$, we obtain $$\begin{align} f\big(x + f(1)\big) &= f(x) \\ \Leftrightarrow x &= x + f(1) \\ \Leftrightarrow f(1) &= 0.\end{align}$$ Consequently, equation $(1)$ becomes $$\begin{align} f\big(y + f(y)\big) &= 0 = f(1) \\ \Leftrightarrow 1 &= y + f(y) \\ \Leftrightarrow f(y) &= 1 - y \\ \\ \therefore \ f(xy + 1 - y) &= y\,f(x).\tag*{$\Box$}\end{align}$$ I found this solution to the problem very elegant, but I wondered to myself, How do you know what method to use in problems like this ?

Then there's always a bijection $G \rightarrow (G/N) \times N$, owing to the fact that $G$ and $(G/N) \times N$ have the same cardinality. However, these groups usually aren't isomorphic.

2640130,Applicability of gradient theorem in the calculation of flux.,"I have a small confusion with the applicability of the fundamental theorem of line integral. 
The theorem states that if $F=P\vec{i}+Q\vec{j}\;$  is a gradient field ($\nabla g$)  of some function $g$ ,then line integrals over any curve from $P$ to $Q$ under the influence of  $\vec{F}$ is just $g(Q)- g(P)$. Am I allowed to use this to calculate flux . In calculating flux in a planar   vector field, we are evaluating line integral . So I think we can use this theorem to calculate flux. But prof. Denis in his lecture says that we can't use this theorem to calculate flux. Refer the following lecture: 45:00 - 46:30 min https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnPIqh7Frlw&list=PL4C4C8A7D06566F38&index=24 Transcript: So, important: this is only for work. There is no statement like that for flux, ok, so don't try to apply this in a problem about flux. More precisely ,
suppose I have a force field $\vec{F}=y\vec{i}-x\vec{j}$. I want to calculate the flux across the curve $C$ which is a straight line from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$. My approach: $\int _{\scriptsize C}\vec{F}\cdot \vec{n}\;dS$=$\int_{\scriptsize C} xdx+ydy=\int_{\scriptsize C} d(\frac{1}{2}x^2+\frac{1}{2}y^2)=[\frac{1}{2}x^2+\frac{1}{2}y^2]_{(0,0)}^{(1,1)}=1  $ I think I can use the gradient theorem here because  the proof of gradient theorem is independent of work and flux. So My questions: Whether my approach is correct or not? If correct, What does Prof. Denis try to say in that clip.( see the frames from 45:00-46:30 in the above video.)

2640139,Moment maps unitary group acting on matrices,"I am reading the fifth chapter of ""An introduction to extremal Kaehler metrics"" by Gabor Szekelyhidi. At the very beginning of that chapter, the author describes moment maps and Hamiltonian action. Here is a short description:
Suppose that a connected Lie group $G$ acts on a Kaehler manifold $M$ preserving the Kaehler form $\omega.$ The derivative of the action gives rise to a Lie algebra map $$ \rho: \mathfrak{g} \rightarrow \mathfrak{X}(M)$$ Where $\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $G$ and $\mathfrak{X}$ is the algebra of vector fields on $M.$ Then the action of $G$ on $M$ is said to be Hamiltonian if there exists a $G-$ equivariant map $$ \mu: M \rightarrow \mathfrak{g}^{*} $$ such that for any $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$ the function $\langle\mu, \xi\rangle$ is a hamiltonian function for the vector field $\rho(\xi):$ $$ d\langle\mu, \xi\rangle = -\iota_{\rho(\xi)} \omega. $$ I got stuck with the following exercise:
Let $M_n$ be the set of $n \times n$ complex matrices equipped with the Euclidean metric under the identification $M_n=\mathbb{C}^{n^2}.$ The unitary matrices $U(n)$ act on $M_n$ by conjugation, preserving this metric. I.e. $A \in U(n)$ acts by $M \mapsto A^{-1}MA.$ Find a moment map $\mu: M_n \rightarrow \mathfrak{u}(n)^{*}.$ So far, I've just noticed that if $n=1$ then the action of $U(1)$ by conjugation on complex number is the trivial action, what will be then the moment map? I am trying to see what happens also in dimension 2. I know that $\mathfrak{u}(2)$ is generated by skew-Hermitian matrices, so every skew-hermitian matrix can be diagonalized and the eigenvalues must be pure imaginary.

2640187,Polynomials: gaining irreducibility by adding a constant,"EDITED: Let $f\in\mathbb{Q}[X]$. I'm interested in the factoring properties of the family $F:=\{f+c\}_{c\in\mathbb{Q}}$ of rational polynomials that differ from $f$ only by a constant. Specifically: 1) I think there must be at least one irreducible polynomial in $F$. How can we prove it? 2) If $f$ is reducible, can we effectively determine an specific $c$ such that $f+c$ is irreducible? 3) How are the asymptotic growth and the density of those $c$ such that $f+c$ is irreducible? Are there at least an infinite number of them? How does this depend on the coefficients of the polynomial? E.g, if $f(X):=X^2$ then any $c>0$ makes $f(X)+c$ irreducible, but it looks like $X^3+3X$ can be made reducible by infinite (ever sparser) values of $c$. 4) If $f\in\mathbb{Z}[X]$, can something be said about the residue distribution of the $c\in\mathbb{Z}$ modulo any prime? 5) How do the results generalize to other fields?

2640335,Derive the probability that Tom W is a computer scientist.,"I'm reading Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman and I came across the following text: The following is a personality sketch of Tom W written during Tom's senior year in high school by a psychologist, on the basis of psychological tests of uncertain validity: Tom W is of high intelligence, although lacking in true creativity. He has a need for order and clarity, and for neat and tidy systems in which every detail finds its appropriate place. His writing is rather dull and mechanical, occasionally enlivened by somewhat corny puns and flashes of imagination of the sci-fi type. He has a strong drive for competence. He seems to have little feel and little sympathy for other people, and does not enjoy interacting with others. Self-centered, he nonetheless has a deep moral sense. The book then goes on to show that most people, when asked to estimate the probability that Tom W is enrolled in computer science and not some other field, only consider the above description in their judgment, and completely ignore the fact that there are far less students in computer science than there are in social studies. In order to give arrive at a better estimate, Kahneman proposes the use of Bayesian statistics: The relevant ""rules"" for cases such as the Tom W problem are provided by Bayesian statistics. This influential modern approach to statistics is named after an English minister of the eighteenth century, the Reverend Thomas Bayes, who is credited with the first major contribution to a large problem: the logic of how people should change their mind in the light of evidence. Bayes' rule specifies how prior beliefs (in the examples of this chapter, base rates) should be combined with the diagnosticity of the evidence, the degree to which it favors the hypothesis over the alternative. For example, if you believe that $3\%$ of graduate students are enrolled in computer science (the base rate), and you also believe that the description of Tom W is $4$ times more likely for a graduate student in that field than in other fields, then Bayes' rule says you must believe that the probability that Tom W is a computer scientist is now $11\%$ . Question: Why would the posterior probability equal $11\%$ ? If $A$ is the event that Tom is a computer scientist, and $B$ is the event that a CS student has a description like Tom, Bayes' theorem says that $$P(A\mid B) = \dfrac{P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$ If we assume that the base rate is $0.03$ we have that $P(A) = 0.03$ , and if we assume that the given description is four times as likely for a student enrolled in computer science than a student enrolled in any other field, we have that $$\dfrac{P(B\mid A)}{P(B)} = \dfrac{4P(B\mid C)}{5P(B\mid C)} = \dfrac{4}{5}$$ where $C$ is the event that Tom  is not enrolled in computer science and using the fact that $P(B) = P(B\mid A) + P(B\mid C)$ . Combining the prior and the likelihood we get that $$P(A\mid B) = \dfrac{4}{5}*0.03 = 0.024$$ What am I doing wrong? EDIT: I know what I did wrong. It was incorrect for me to say that $P(B) = P(B\mid A) + P(B\mid C)$ . It's supposed to be: $P(B) = P(B\mid A)P(A) + P(B\mid C)P(C),$ and this solves the problem. What should I do now?

2640384,"Given a set of polynomials that correspond to weak compositions of an integer, are all possible products of d such polynomials linearly independent?","Fix two positive integers $k$ and $N$. Let $a = (a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{N})$ be a weak composition of $k$ into $N$ parts. In other words, $a$ is an $N$ dimensional vector of nonnegative integers such that $\sum_{\ell=1}^N a_{\ell} = k$. For any weak composition $a$, define $$P_{a}(\{X_{i,\ell}\}) = \prod_{i=1}^k\sum_{\ell=1}^N a_{\ell}X_{i,\ell},$$
which is a polynomial with integer coefficients over the set of formal variables $\{X_{i,\ell}\}_{i \in [k],\ell \in [N]}$. There are $\binom{N+k-1}{k}$ different polynomials $P_a(\{X_{i,\ell}\})$, one for every possible weak composition $a$. Let $d \leq k$ be some fixed positive integer. Consider all distinct products of exactly $d$ of these polynomials, allowing for repetition. More precisely, for any size $d$ multiset $\{a^{(1)},a^{(2)},\dots,a^{(d)}\}$ where each $a^{(j)}$ is a weak composition, the corresponding product is 
$$Q_{a^{(1)},a^{(2)},\dots,a^{(d)}}(\{X_{i,\ell}\}) = P_{a^{(1)}}(\{X_{i,\ell}\})P_{a^{(2)}}(\{X_{i,\ell}\})\cdots P_{a^{(d)}}(\{X_{i,\ell}\}).$$ Note that there are $$\binom{\binom{N+k-1}{k}+d-1}{d}$$ possible polynomials $Q_{a^{(1)},a^{(2)},\dots,a^{(d)}}(\{X_{i,\ell}\})$, corresponding to all possible size $d$ multisets over the $\binom{N+k-1}{k}$ weak compositions. My question is: When $d \leq k$, are all the $Q_{a^{(1)},a^{(2)},\dots,a^{(d)}}(\{X_{i,\ell}\})$ polynomials linearly independent? There are no other restrictions on $N,d,k$ except that they are all positive integers. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Some notes: The motivation is to justify Assumption 1 in https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/946.pdf , a paper which attempts to build secure cryptographic multilinear maps. In that paper, the $X_{i,\ell}$'s actually correspond to matrices (with dimensions chosen so that the above products still evaluate to a scalar). A proof of the above would show that there are no degree $d\leq k$ polynomials that ""annihilate"" the $P_a$ polynomials over the $\{X_{i,\ell}\}$ formal variables. If we attempt to count the number of possible monomials that can have distinct coefficients, I believe we get $\binom{\binom{N+d-1}{d}+k-1}{k}$. This should give an upper bound on the number of linearly independent $Q$ polynomials. When $d > k$, the number of polynomials exceeds this value, which is why I think $d \leq k$ is required. I believe the $d=1$ case is implied by this result: http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S0895479800369141 (they show that when $X_{i,\ell}$ is replaced by $X_{\ell}$, that the resulting $Q$ polynomials are linearly independent). Edit: I've checked all small cases in Mathematica that my computer can handle and this claim seems to hold true. For example, when $k=3,N=3,d=3$ this produces 220 linearly independent polynomials, and when $k=4,N=3,d=3$ it produces 680 linearly independent polynomials.","['combinatorics', 'symmetric-polynomials', 'linear-algebra', 'vector-spaces']"

2640470,A group $G$ is abelian if and only if a certain subset of the direct product is a subgroup,"Let $(G, +)$ be a group and let $K = \{ (x_1, ..., x_n) \ | \ x_1 + .... + x_n = e\} \subseteq G^n$ where $e$ is the identity of $G$. Show that $(G, +)$ is abelian if and only if $K$ is a subgroup of $G^n$. My attempted proof: Suppose that $(G, +)$ is abelian, we show that $K$ is a subgroup of $G^n$. Pick $a, b \in K$, we show that $a +_{G^n} b^{-1} \in K$ (where $+_{G^n}$ refers to the group theoretic operation on $G^n$). Observe that the identity of $G^n$ is $e_{G^n} = (e_1, ..., e_n)$ where $e_i = e$ for $i \in \{1, ..., n\}$. Note that $b^{-1}$ is an element in $G^n$ (since $G^n$ is a group) such that $b^{-1} +_{G^n} b = e_{G^n}$ that is $(b_1^{-1} + b_1, ..., b_n^{-1} + b_n) = (e_1, ..., e_n)$ where $e_i =e$ for $i \in \{1, ..., n\}$. Since $e_{G^n} \in K$ trivially (because $e+ ... + e = e$) we have then $b^{-1} +_{G^n} b \in K$ hence $b_1^{-1} + b_1 + b_2^{-1} + b_2 + ... + b_n^{-1} + b_n = e$ and by abelianness of $G$ we have $b_1^{-1} +b_2^{-1} + ... + b_n^{-1} + b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_n = e$ which implies that $b_1^{-1} + b_2^{-1} + ... + b_n^{-1} +e=e$ which implies that $b_1^{-1} + b_2^{-1} + ... + b_n^{-1} = e$ hence $b^{-1} \in K$. Now note that $a +_{G^n} b^{-1} = (a_1 + b_1^{-1}, ..., a_n + b_n^{-1})$ and observe that since $a, b^{-1} \in K$ we have $a_1 + ... + a_n = e$ and $b_1^{-1} + ... + b_n^{-1} = e$. Hence \begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
a_1 + b_1^{-1} + ... + a_n + b_n^{-1}  &= (a_1 + ... + a_n) + (b_1^{-1} + ...+ b_n^{-1})  \ \ \ \ \text{by abelianness of $(G, +)$}\\
 & = e + e  \ \ \ \ \ \text{since} \ \ a, b^{-1} \in K\\
&= e
\end{split}
\end{equation} therefore we have $a +_{G^n} b^{-1} \in K$ and $K < G^n$ by the subgroup test. Conversely assume $(G, +)$ is not abelian and that $K$ is a subgroup. We show that this results in a contradiction. Pick $a, b \in K$. Now consider $a +_{G^n} b^{-1} = (a_1 + b_1^{-1}, ..., a_n + b_n^{-1})$. Now without abelianness of $(G, +)$ we can't commute elements in the summation $a_1 + b_1^{-1} + ... + a_n + b_n^{-1}$ and thus we can't conclude that $a_1 + b_1^{-1} + ... + a_n + b_n^{-1} = e$ and therefore $a +_{G^n} b^{-1} \not\in K$. But since $K$ is a subgroup we reach a contradiction since $a +_{G^n} b^{-1} \in K$. $\square$ Is the above proof correct and rigorous?

$E[X^2] = \sum_{x\in \mathbb R}x^2p_x(x)$. How can such a sum be $0$ if $X$ is not almost surely equal to $0$?

The concept seems straight forward.  The first person that sits down has $1$ choice, the second person has $(n-2)$ choices, but if the second person sits in the $n$th seat, the third person will have $(n-2)$ choices, but if he doesn't sit in the $n$th seat the third person has $(n-3)$ choices.

Then $i$ would take the total possible combinations $(n-1)!$ and subtract it from the set $A_i$ but I'm not entirely sure how to do that.

2641144,Does the condition $E[X]=E[X^2]=E[X^3]$ determine the distribution of $X$?,"This is a question out of pure curiosity, motivated by this posting . Here I checked that if a $\mathbb{R}$-valued random variable $X$ has finite $4$-th moment and $E[X^2]=E[X^3]=E[X^4]$ then $X$ is a Bernoulli random variable. Indeed, this follows by noticing that $$ E[X^2(1-X)^2] = E[X^4] - 2E[X^3] + E[X^2] = 0 $$ and hence $X(1-X) = 0$ a.s., i.e. $P(X \in \{0, 1\}) = 1$. So we may ask whether the requirement can be relaxed, by asking the following question. Question. If a $\mathbb{R}$-valued random variable $X$ satisfies $E[X] = E[X^2] = E[X^3]$, then does it follow that $X$ has a Bernoulli random variable? I.e,. $P(X = 0 \text{ or } 1) = 1$? Notice that there are examples of $X$ where $E[X] = E[X^2]$ but $X$ does not have a Bernoulli distribution. (For instance, Let $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and set $X = \frac{1}{2}(1+Z)$.) So the 3rd moment condition cannot be dropped. If $X$ satisfies the given condition, so does $1-X$. If we assume $X \geq 0$, then the answer is yes, since $X(X-1)^2 \geq 0$ and $E[X(X-1)^2] = 0$. I tried creating a discrete random variable (other than Bernoulli r.v.s) that satisfy the condition, but this approach have not been successful so far.

I believe I have shown the forward implication $(\Rightarrow)$. However, I'm struggling to show the backward implication. For clarity, a set $E$ is said to be relatively compact if its closure $\overline{E}$ is compact. Attempt at a proof: Assume $E$ is totally bounded. Then by a corollary, we know that every sequence in $E$ has a Cauchy subsequence. Since $\overline{E}$ contains all limits points of $E$, we know that every Cauchy subsequence converges to some point in $\overline{E}$. Then $\overline{E}$ is sequentially compact (every sequence has a convergent subsequence). This implies that $\overline{E}$ is compact, and therefore $E$ is relatively compact. My issue arises from the fact that I'm not considering what happens to sequences living inside of $\overline{E}\backslash E = \partial E$. I don't know if those converge or have Cauchy subsequences or anything. I only know things about sequences in $E$. Maybe I'm missing something obvious, or perhaps this entire proof is offbase.

I'd like to prove a more general fact: a finite sum of such sequences, with distinct bases $b_1, \dots, b_r$, not equal to $1$, has a limit if and only if $|b_1|, \dots, |b_r|<1$. More precisely: if
$$x_n = c_1 b_1^n + c_2 b_2^n + \dots + c_r b_r^n$$
where $r$ is a fixed integer, $c_k$ are fixed nonzero complex numbers, and $b_k$ are fixed distinct complex numbers not equal to $1$, then $\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n$ exists if and only if $\max_k |b_k|<1$. Progress . Sufficiency is obvious, the question is necessity. The terms with larger modulus dominate the rest, thus we may assume $|b_1|=\dots = |b_r|$.  Also, it suffices to consider the case $|b_1|=\dots = |b_r| = 1$ because if the common modulus is $M>1$ and the limit exists, then multiplying the sequence by $M^{-n}$ will result in another convergent sequence. So, $b_k = \exp(2\pi i \theta_k)$ for some $\theta_k\in (0, 1)$. If all $\theta_k$ are rational, the sequence $x_n$ is periodic (and nonconstant), so there is no limit.

I came across a method to computing $$\int_{\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin^2(x)}{x^2} \, dx$$ by shifting the poles up by a factor $i \epsilon$ and continuing the calculation as normal. I want to employ the same idea with the sinc integral, noting that
$$\int_{\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \, dx = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}\int_{\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(x)}{x-i\epsilon} \, dx$$ We consider the integral 
$$\int_{\Gamma} \frac{e^{iz}}{z-i \epsilon}\, dz$$ Where $\Gamma$ is the upper semi-circular arc, $[-R, R] \cup Re^{i[0, \pi]}$. Then we have \begin{align*}
\int_{\Gamma} \frac{e^{iz}}{z-i \epsilon}\, dz &= \int_{-R}^{R} \frac{e^{it}}{t-i \epsilon} \, dt + iR\int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{e^{it}e^{iRe^{it}}}{Re^{it}-i \epsilon}\, dt \\
&= 2 \pi i e^{-\epsilon}
\end{align*} by Residue theorem since there is one pole inside the contour. The integral along the arc vanishes(and is pretty easy to see) as $R \rightarrow \infty$. Letting $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, we have $$\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{it}}{t-i \epsilon} \, dt = 2 \pi i$$ This is where it gets murky for me. Expanding the integrand, we've $$\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}\left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x \cos (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2}-\frac{\epsilon  \sin (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2}  \, dx + i \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x \sin (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2}+\frac{\epsilon  \cos (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2} \, dx \right)= 2 \pi i$$ Using the linearity of the limit on the left hand side and equating real and imaginary parts, we have $$\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0 } \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x \sin (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2}+\frac{\epsilon  \cos (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2} \, dx = 2 \pi$$ and yet, at the same time, $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0 }\left(\frac{x \sin (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2}+\frac{\epsilon  \cos (x)}{x^2+\epsilon ^2}\right) \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} \, dx =  \pi$$ I'd like to know why the exchange of limit and integral is making the difference here, is there something to do with the convergence of these integrals that is making this technique not work, or is there something I've plainly missed?

I have made my attempt at the question, but I didn't think I went down the right path. This course is following Introduction To Time Series and Forecasting by Brockwell and Davis. I am using 3rd Edition. here is the question: Find the autocovariance function of the AR(3) process: $(1 - 0.5B)(1 - 0.4B)(1 - 0.1B)X_{t} = Z_{t},   Z_{t} \sim  WN{\lbrace0,\sigma^{2} \rbrace}$ I could think of 2 ways of doing this: I could solve the autoregressive polynomial and prove the roots are greater than 1 in absolute value, which then prove the AR(3) is causal (in book 3.1.5); once this is done, I could then calculate the coefficients for $Z_{t}$, according to $X_{t}=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\psi_{j}Z_{t-j}$ for all t, where $\psi_{j} = \theta_{j} + \sum_{j=0}^{p}\phi_{k}\psi_{j-k}, j=0,1,.....$, $(1)$ I normally rewrite it as $\psi_{j} = (\theta_{k}+\phi_{k})\phi^{j-1}, \psi^{0} = 1$ $k=1,2,....p$ $j=1,2,.....,$ in the context of the problem, we could think of it as ARMA process where moving average polynomial $\theta(z) \equiv 1$ To do this I wrote the l.h.s in its expanded form so the backward operators are removed and this gives me: $X_{t}-X_{t-1}+0.29X_{t-2}-0.02X_{t-3}=Z_{t}$ $(2)$ and solve: $ 1 - z + 0.29z^{2} - 0.02z^{3} = 0$ we could go ahead solve this cubic equation but I don't really think that is the way of solving this problem, it requires way too much calculation. Another way I thought about was to use recursion where I rewrite $X_{t-1}$ and probably also $X_{t-2}$ in formula and plug them back into $(2)$, expecting the limit of the sum of all X_{t} terms to be zero and leaving us with only the $Z_{t}$ terms. this way we could also get all the coefficients of $Z_{t}$ and then solve it using $(1)$. But what I've got wasn't what I expected, I can't seem to get the limit of $x_{t}$ terms.

If $\hat{p^*} = \frac{Y}{n}, Y \sim Bin(n,p)$, then
$\frac{\hat{p^*}-p}{\sqrt{\hat{p^*}(1-\hat{p^*})/n}} \rightarrow^d N(0,1) $ (i.e. $\frac{\hat{p^*}-p}{\sqrt{\hat{p^*}(1-\hat{p^*})/n}}$ converges in distribution to $N(0,1)$ ). But here, $\hat{p^*}$ is a random variable that can take on the value of $0$ with probability greater than $0$, which means that the probability that $\sqrt{\hat{p^*}(1-\hat{p^*})/n}$ is equal to $0$ is also greater than $0$. so I am not sure whether it is indeed mathematically okay to write an expression like $\frac{\hat{p^*}-p}{\sqrt{\hat{p^*}(1-\hat{p^*})/n}}$ , because we are not supposed to have $0$ in denominator of a fraction.

2641947,Expected global clustering coefficient for Erdős–Rényi graph,"What is the expected global clustering coefficient $\mathbb{E}[C_{GC}]$ for the Erdős–Rényi random graph (ER-graph) $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$ (expectation is over the ensemble of all ER-graphs) as $n \rightarrow \infty$ and $p$ fixed? The global clustering coefficient $C_{GC}$ is defined as $C_{GC}={\frac  {3\times {\mbox{number of triangles}}}{{\mbox{number of connected triplets of vertices}}}}={\frac  {{\mbox{number of closed triplets}}}{{\mbox{number of connected triplets of vertices}}}}$. A connected triplet is defined to be a connected subgraph consisting of three vertices and two edges. A closed triplet is a connected triplet that induces a triangle. While it is easy to see that the expected mean local clustering coefficient is $p$ (see next section), the expected global clustering coefficient is not identically $p$ for any $n$. For example, for $n=3$, $C_{GC} = 1$ only when all edges are present (with probability $p^3$) and is otherwise zero (with probability $1-p^3$).
Hence the $\mathbb{E}[E_{GC}] = p^3$ when $n=3$. Computationally, I have found that $\mathbb{E}[C_{GC}]\approx p$ for large $n$. Is there a way to prove that $\mathbb{E}[C_{GC}]= p$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$? My current theory is to use Chebyshev's inequality on this, but I haven't tried it out yet. Expected local clustering coefficient = p In contrast, it is easy to see that the expected local clustering coefficient $\mathbb{E}[C_i]$ for any node $i$ is $p$. The local clustering coefficient $C_i$ of node $i$ (for an undirected network) is defined as $C_i = \frac{\text{number of triangles that contain $i$}}{k_i (k_i-1)/2}$,
where $k_i$ is the degree of $i$. In other words, it is the proportion of links between the vertices within its neighbourhood divided by the number of links that could possibly exist between them. We have $\mathbb{E}[C_i]=p$ in an ER-graph because the probability for an edge between any neighbours of the node is $p$, independent for any other edge. (For an alternative answer involving more algebra, see here ). Hence the expected mean local clustering coefficient $\mathbb{E}[\sum_i C_i]$ is $p$ for any $n$.","['graph-theory', 'random-graphs', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"

2642065,Trying to understand discontinuities and domains,"I am really struggling with this concept and I feel like no math book clarifies it sufficiently. First off: I assume that if a one-sided limit exists then it is a real value and not $\pm \infty$. And a two-sided limit exists if both one-sided limits exist (i.e. both limits are real values) and are also equal to each other in value. My understanding of continuity falls into three cases / mental notes: A function $f$ is considered continuous (i.e. continuous everywhere) iff it is continuous at every point in its domain. For a real endpoint $a$ of a domain interval: The function is continuous at $a$ if the one-sided limit $L$ exists and $L = f(a)$ (if the endpoint is on the left side of the interval, we refer to the one-sided limit from the right, and if the endpoint is on the right side of the interval, we refer to the one-sided limit from the left). Moreover $a$ as well as the infinitely-close $x$ value to $a$ must also be in the domain. For a real point $a$ within a domain interval, i.e. not the endpoints. The function is continuous at $a$ if the two-sided limit $L$ exists and $L = f(a)$. Moreover $a$ as well as the infinitely-close $x$ values on both sides of $a$ must also be in the domain. If this is true so far then: Removable Singularities: An undefined (not in the domain) or vertically-shifted (in the domain) single point $a$ where the two-sided limit at $x=a$ nevertheless exists. This would be considered a discontinuity in the function either way due to definition 3 above. The two-sided limit $L$ exists, but $L \neq f(a)$ (although I am unsure if it makes sense to use $\neq$ if we're talking about $f(a)$ when undefined at $a$). Jump Discontinuities This is any value of $x=a$ in the domain where the left-sided limit and right-sided limit exist, but they approach different real values ($f(a)$ itself may or may not be defined). Now here's where I start to get fuzzy. If $f(a)$ is defined, the function is discontinuous by definition 3 since the two-sided limit does not exist. However, if $f(a)$ were undefined, then this would weirdly enough be continuous since we move into definition 2 for two intervals. Since $a$ is not part of the domain, we've just split things into two separate intervals, both of which would be considered continuous on their own based on endpoint continuity definition. Is this right? Infinite/Essential Discontinuities (are these also Nonremovable Singularities?) This is where I am even fuzzier. I believe these exist only when $f(a)$ is undefined, i.e. not in the domain, when at least one of the one-sided limits on either side does not exist (either because it approaches $\pm \infty$ or because it's oscillating forever and never settles down anywhere). I'm even less certain about functions that are only defined in one direction but still have an asymptote. For example if we defined $f(x) = 1/x$ for $x>0$ only, would the asymptote at $x=0$ be considered an infinite discontinuity? But let's say we had $f(x) = 1/x$ where $x \neq 0$. Would we say there is an infinite discontinuity at $x=0$ since we approach infinity in at least one direction, and yet this would not affect the overall continuity of $f$ since $0$ is not part of the domain? I'm really unclear on how all of this works.","['limits', 'calculus', 'continuity', 'terminology', 'definition']"

I have been able to prove, using basic facts about the functional calculus that $\frac{d}{dt}e^{tT}=Te^{tT}$, and that the family forms a group under multiplication. What I am now trying to prove is that if $\sigma(T)\subset\{z:Rez<0\}$, then $\sup_{t\geq 0} \|e^{tT}\|\leq M$ for some positive $M$. In the finite dimensional case, I know we can decompose into Jordan's normal form to get the result, but I do not know how to pursue that avenue for an arbitrary bounded operator. My idea is to somehow use the spectral mapping theorem. This gives us that the spectral radius $\rho (e^{tT})\to 0$ as $t\to \infty$, and that this convergence is exponential. Unfortunately, as $X$ need not be a Hilbert space and $T$ need not be normal we do not know that $\rho(e^{tT})=\|e^{tT}\|$. What I am hoping is that there is some way we can extend the estimation lemma to the holomorphic functional calculus, at least in certain cases of which this is one, which would then give the result, but I have not been able to find such a thing. From scouring the net I know that this is an archetypal problem of continuous semi-group theory, but I encountered this while studying Rudin's Functional Analysis , specifically in relation to his chapter on Banach algebras and the holomorphic functional calculus, which makes me believe that there is a simpler solution using basic theory from these areas.

Any hints? As you can see in the comments, there is a solution for natural numbers, the problem is when the set is extended to integers solutions. *This is a problem for a national olympiad in my country, this olympiad usually puts all the solutions but i didn't found a solution for this problem in the page, i don't know why. Possible answer: Property: Be $A,B,C$ $\in \Bbb R$ $\ne 0$ such that $A+B=C$. Then exist $U,V \in {A,B,C}$ such that:  $$2|U| \gt 2|V| \ge |U|$$ Proof: Write $C'=-C$, then $A+B+C'=0$. The numbers $A,B,C \ne 0$ by hypothesis, and they can't be the three of the same sign because then they can't add $0$, so there are two of the numbers $A, B, C'$ that have the same sign and the other has a different sign. Amplifying the equality $A+B+C'= 0$ $\,$ by $-1$ if its necessary, we can assume that there are two of them (which we will call $X,Y$) that are positive and the third negative (we will call it $-Z$, with $Z\gt 0$). Then we have $Z=X+Y$ with $X,Y,Z \gt 0$ and that $X,Y,Z$ are equal to $|A|, |B| , |C|$ in some order. WLOG we can assume that $X\le Y$ , then: $$Z=X+Y\le 2Y \lt 2Y+2X = 2Z$$ Obtaining $2Z \gt 2Y \ge Z$ as we wanted. Solution: Assume that  $$(1): \; x^x+y^y=z^z$$ has integer solutions $\ne 0$, let $(x,y,z) = (a,b,c)$. According to the property, there exists integers $\ne 0$ $(u,v) \in (a,b,c)$ such that $2|u^u| \gt 2|v^v| \ge |u^u|$. Dividing by 2 and taking $\log$ we see that there are non-zero integers $(u,v)$ such that: $$u\log |u| \gt v\log |v| \ge u\log |u| - \log 2$$
That can be written as: $$(2): \;0 \lt u\log |u| - v\log |v| \le \log 2$$ The inequality (2) says that $u\log|u| \gt 0$ or $v\log|v| \lt 0$, but if $v \log |v| \lt 0$ then: $$u \log |u| - v \log |v| = (-v)\log|-v|\;-\;(-u)\log |-u|$$ with $(-v)\log|-v| \gt 0$, so unless we make a substitution, we can assume that $u \log |u| \gt 0$. In this case, necessarily $u \ge 2$, so 
 the second inequality of (2) says that: $$v \log |v| \ge u \log |u| - \log 2 \ge 2 \log 2 - \log 2 \gt 0$$ Matching this with the first equality of (2) we get: $$ log 2 \ge u \log |u| - v \log |v| \gt (v+1)\log |v| - v\log|v| = \log|v| \ge \log2$$ a contradiction. Thus $x^x+y^y=z^z$ doesn't have any integers solution.","['proof-verification', 'number-theory', 'integers', 'contest-math', 'exponentiation']"
2642282,Multivariable chain rule and the behaviour of derivatives,"Suppose we have a function f (x , y) where x and y are functions of u and v i.e. x (u,v) and y (u,v). Then, from the chain rule, the following relationship holds $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial u}$$ However, on the RHS of the equation, can the two $\partial x$ and $\partial y$ not cancel like a fraction, which would then give $\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}$, which is a contradiction? In fact , when is it that the derivatives can be cancelled out like in a fraction, and when can they not? Thank you for your help.","['multivariable-calculus', 'partial-derivative', 'chain-rule']"
2642289,Find the Differential Equation (Integrating Factor Problem),"This is #11 of Section 1.5 of the book DEALA , 3E. So, we have only learned how to solve by using the integrating factor. BUT, there is a factor of 'y' on the right-hand side. What is going on? Find the differential: $x\frac{dy}{dx} + y = 3xy$ , y(1) = 0 Add: The solution I looked at after reviewing comments: $x\frac{dy}{dx} = 3xy - y$ $x\frac{dy}{dx} = (3x - 1)y$ $\frac{x}{3x-1}\frac{1}{dx} = \frac{y}{dy}$ $\int\frac{3x-1}{x}dx = \int\frac{1}{y}dy$ $\int3dx - \int\frac{1}{x}dx = \int\frac{1}{y}dy$ $ln|y| = 3x - ln|x| + C$ But, the solution in the back is y is parallel to 0. I think it's a misprint.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

2642360,How do I prove this identity involving polar coordinates and $\nabla$? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : How to obtain the gradient in polar coordinates (2 answers) Closed 6 years ago . Given that
$$\begin{aligned}
&x=r\cos(\theta),\\
&y=r\sin(\theta),\\
& \qquad \text{and}\\
&x^2+y^2=r^2
\end{aligned}$$
Use the chain rule to show that $\nabla=\mathbf{\hat{r}}\frac\partial{\partial r}+\mathbf{\hat{\theta}}\frac1r\frac\partial{\partial\theta}.$ I derived that $\,\mathbf{\hat{r}}=\cos(\theta)\mathbf{\hat{\text{i}}}+\sin(\theta)\mathbf{\hat{\text{j}}}\,$ and that  $\,\mathbf{\hat{\theta}}=-\sin(\theta)\mathbf{\hat{\text{i}}}+\cos(\theta)\mathbf{\hat{\text{j}}}.$ But I can't seem to gro from here.","['multivariable-calculus', 'chain-rule', 'polar-coordinates', 'derivatives']"
