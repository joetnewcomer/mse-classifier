113416,How to justify small angle approximation for cosine,"Everyone knows the picture that explains instantly the small angle approximation to the sine function (as defined by the parametrisation of the unit circle): ""what's the length of that arc?"" ""See how for small angles, it forms the opposite side of a triangle...?"" Cosine is more problematic; the corresponding annotation on Wikipedia to the diagram mentioned above reads: H and A are almost the same length, meaning $\cos(\theta)$ is close to $1$ and $\frac{\theta^2}{2}$ [?!] helps to trim the red away [?!]. For the syllabus I teach, students must be able to differentiate sine and cosine from first principles using the above approximations. And certainly they don't need to understand the approximations; but it would be nice, wouldn't it... Now everyone also knows that the small angle approximation for $\cos$ is just the truncated ($O(\theta^3)$) Taylor series, and it's fairly easy to see that for small $\theta$: $$\cos(\theta)= \sqrt{1-\sin^2(\theta)} \approx \sqrt{1- \theta^2}$$ which $\approx 1- \frac{\theta^2}{2}$ by the binomial expansion for $\sqrt{1-x}$ ...But my students don't know Taylor series or binomial expansions.

113463,Local normalization of algebraic curves,"I am currently reading about the normalization theorem: Suppose $C$ is an irreducible plane algebraic curve, and let S be the set of singular points. Then there exists a compact Riemann surface $\hat C$ and a holomorphic map from the surface to $C$ such that the image of $\hat C$ is $C$, it's injective on the set of singular points, and the inverse image of the singular points is finite. To prove this, we locally normalize each singular point by factoring it into irreducible local analytic curve components (using Weierstrass polynomials). Then for every curve component, we get can get a holomorphic, injective map from a disk at the origin of the complex plane onto the component, that is biholomorphic if we remove the origin from the disk and the origin from the curve component (where we have placed the singular point at the origin). Gluing all of these disks to the curve gives the normalization. My question is: why do these curve components correspond exactly to the structure of the curve? The theorem just says that it factors and that a normalization is possible. Specifically: 1) If we have an ordinary double point, intuitively, it should factor into two analytic curve components. Why is this? 2) Why does the curve factor into a single irreducible component at smooth points? The precise details can be found in ""Introduction to Algebraic Curves"" by Griffiths.","['riemann-surfaces', 'manifolds', 'complex-analysis']"
113464,Trying to parse a definition in Silverman's EC book,"Let $C_1\subset \mathbb{P}^{N_1}$ and $C_2\subset \mathbb{P}^{N_2}$ be two curves. Then a map $\phi:C_1\to C_2$ can be defined as $$\phi=[f_0,\ldots,f_{N_2}],$$ where each $f_i$ is a homogeneous polynomial. Such a map induces a map $\phi^*:K(C_2)\to K(C_1)$ given by $g\mapsto g\circ \phi$. What confuses me here is that the rings $K(C_i)$ are defined by Silverman to be the rings $K(C_i\cap \mathbb{A}^{N_i})$, so e.g. $K(C_2)$ is of the form $K[X_1,\ldots,X_{N_2}]/I$ and I have trouble seeing what $g\circ \phi$ should be for some $g\in K[X_1,\ldots,X_{N_2}]/I$, since $\phi$ has sort of ""one component too much"". Is the idea here that we should essentially write $\phi$ in the form $$\phi = [f_0/f_i,\ldots,1,\ldots,f_{N_2}/f_i]$$ where $i$ corresponds to our chosen embedding $\mathbb{A}^{N_2}\hookrightarrow U_i=\{X_i\neq 0\}\subset \mathbb{P}^{N_2}$? Now given some $g(X_1,\ldots,X_{N_2})\in K(C_2)$, we get $$\phi^*g=g\circ \phi =?$$ How is this map supposed to be concretely represented? I know Hartshorne uses the representation where $K(C_2)$ is just quotients of homogeneous polynomials of the same degree, so the composition is pretty obvious. I'm trying to understand how to work with Silverman's definition. EDIT: I think the idea here is to think of $K(C_2)$ as the ring generated by $X_0/X_i,\ldots,X_{N_2}/X_i$ and $K(C_1)$ as the ring generated by $Y_0/Y_j,\ldots,Y_{N_1}/Y_j$, so the polynomial $g$ is actually $g(X_0/X_i,\ldots,X_{N_2}/X_i)$. Then the map would be given by $$\phi^*g = g\left(\frac{f_0(Y_0/Y_j,\ldots,Y_{N_1}/Y_j)}{f_i(Y_0/Y_j,\ldots,Y_{N_1}/Y_j)},\ldots,\frac{f_{N_1}(Y_0/Y_j,\ldots,Y_{N_1}/Y_j)}{f_i(Y_0/Y_j,\ldots,Y_{N_1}/Y_j)}\right).$$ Can anyone confirm this?

113530,Maximum principle for one point on boundary,"Suppose $f$ is bounded and analytic on the open unit disk $\mathbb{D}$. Say that $f$ extends continuously to one point $z_0$ on $\partial \mathbb{D}$, the boundary of $\mathbb{D}$. Now does the maximum principle apply here, i.e. , is it true that $|f(z_0)| \le M$ implies $|f(z)| \le M$ for $z \in \mathbb{D}$? (Equivalently, $|f(z)| \le |f(z_0)|$.) I know it sounds strange to talk about continuous extensions to just one point on the boundary. This question is derived from Gamelin's Complex Analysis, p. 89, #7. In that problem, there are finitely many points on the boundary such that $f$ extends continuously to the arcs between them. I'm wondering if this is true when there's only one such point.

113563,A question of Hirzebruch surface $ \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}(1) \bigoplus \mathcal{O})$,"My question comes from my professor. I try my best to understand what the question means, but  it doesn’t work! I even cannot understand the question meaning!   I think I need some hints to answer the question. We can find the definition of Hirzebruch surface  in [Fulton ” Introduction Toric varieties” page 8]. Which introduce the construction of  Hirzebruch surface $ \mathbb{F}_a $ with $ a \in \mathbb{N}$. And we know that, in fact, $ \mathbb{F}_a $ is a projective bundle $ \pi:  \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(a) \bigoplus \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}) \to \mathbb{P}^1$. Now, let us consider the case of $a = 1. \  i.e. \ \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(1) \bigoplus \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1})$. In [Fulton], we construct $ \mathbb{F}_1 $ from the toric variety point of view. My main Question: But if we just regard $ \mathbb{F}_1$ $\cong$
  $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(1) \bigoplus$
  $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1})$ as a scheme, how do I write down all
  affine open pieces and identifications between any two affine open
  piece which is ""compatible"" with the toric construction ) What is the meaning of “Compatible”? I have no sense about this important key word. I follow the definition of $\mathbb{P} (\mathcal{E})$ in [Hartshorne]: Let $\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(1) \bigoplus \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}$ be a locally free sheaf on $\mathbb{P}^1$.Recall that in  $\mathbb{P}^1$, there are two standard affine open subsets $D_{+}(x_0) \cong  Spec \ \mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)}$ and $D_{+}(x_1) \cong  Spec\ \mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_1)}$ So we have   $\mathcal{E} | _ {D_{+}(x_0)}$   =  $(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(1) \bigoplus \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1})|_{D_{+}(x_0)}$  $\cong$ $\widetilde{S(1)_{(x_0)}}\bigoplus \widetilde{S_{(x_0)}}$, where $S =  \mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]$. We have $\mathcal{E} | _ {D_{+}(x_0)}( D_{+}(x_0)) = x_0 \mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)} \bigoplus  \mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)}$ Let $ M := x_0 \mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)} \bigoplus  \mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)}$, then $ M $ is a free $\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)}-module$ of rank 2. Consider the symmetric algebra of $M$, $Sym(M) \cong   \mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)}[y_0,y_1] $, which is clearly an graded ring over $\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)}$. Therefore, we can consider the projective scheme $Proj(\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)}[y_0,y_1])$. $\implies

$ $Proj(\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)}[y_0,y_1])$ $ \ \ \ \cong Spec\ \mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)}\ \times_{Spec\ \mathbb{C}} Proj(\mathbb{C}[ y_0,y_1])$ $ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  \ \   = Spec\ \mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)}\ \times Proj(\mathbb{C}[ y_0,y_1]) $ $ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  \ \   = Spec\ \mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)}\ \times \mathbb{P}^1$ So, we also have four affine open pieces of the scheme of $\mathbb{P} (\mathcal{E})$. Now, we need to gluing such four affine pieces “compatible” with the structure in [Fulton,page8].(the meaning of “compatible” really confuses me ).
Recall that $D_{+}(x_0) \bigcap D_{+}(x_1)$  $\cong  D_{+}(x_0x_1)$ $\cong  Spec \ \mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0x_1)}$ $ Spec\ \mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)}\ \times_{Spec\ \mathbb{C}} D_{+}(y_0) $ $\cong$ $ Spec\ (\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0)} \bigotimes_{\mathbb{C}}\mathbb{C}[y_0,y_1]_{(y_0)})$ What shall I do ?  Should I need to construct ring isomorphisms between rings? For example, an isomorphism $\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0x_1)}$  $\cong$  $\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1]_{(x_0x_1)}$, obviously, we can find a trivial isomorphism, but is such isomorphism satisfies the “compatibility” requirement?

113624,Ramification of a prime in a Dedekind ring and curves,"Let $\phi:C_1\to C_2$ be a nonconstant map of two smooth curves over some algebraically closed field $K$ and let $P\in C_1$. $\phi$ gives us an induced map of fields $\phi^*:K(C_2)\to K(C_1)$, $\phi^*:f \mapsto f\circ \phi$. Silverman defines in his book on elliptic curves that the ramification degree of this map is defined as $$e_\phi(P)=\textrm{ord}_P(\phi^*t_{\phi(P)}),$$ where the order is just the normalized valuation of the DVR $K[C_1]_P$ and $t_{\phi(P)}$ denotes a uniformizer of $K[C_2]_Q$, where $Q=\phi(P)$. I'm trying to explicitly write down the connection between this and the corresponding ramification degree in the Dedekind domains, since Silverman seems to hint that they agree. Let $\mathfrak{m}_Q$ denote the maximal ideal of $A=\phi^*K[C_2]_Q$ and let $B$ be the integral closure of $A$ in $K(C_1)$. Since, $A$ is a DVR, we know that $B$ is Dedekind and we have a factorization $$\mathfrak{m}_QB = \mathfrak{P}_1^{e_1}\cdots \mathfrak{P}_n^{e_n}.$$ To get a nice description of the ramification degree in the setting of these Dedekind rings, I would need to show that: There's a bijection between the primes $\mathfrak{P}_i$ and the points $P\in \phi^{-1}(Q)$. If $P$ corresponds to some $\mathfrak{P}_i$, then $e_\phi(P)=e_i$. Does anyone know how this is done? My guess is that both should be simple applications of the Nullstellensatz. I'm getting stuck here with the issue I had in a question I asked yesterday: Trying to parse a definition in Silverman's EC book The problem being that I don't know how to concretely compute the map $\phi^*$ and I also have trouble figuring out what $\mathfrak{m}_Q$ should look like. By the Nullstellensatz, we know that it's of the form: $$(X_1-a_1,\ldots,X_n-a_n),$$ I take it that in projective space $Q=[a_1,\ldots,1,\ldots,a_n]$, where the $1$ is in position $i$ corresponding to the embedding of $\mathbb{A}^n$ into $\mathbb{P}^n$? But then one would have to express $\phi^*\mathfrak{m}_Q$ explicitly and here one is again left with the problem of concretely writing down what $\phi^*$ is in order to use the Nullstellensatz in $B$.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

This is to say $$f(x) >0 \Leftrightarrow x \in \bigcup_{k=0}^{\infty}(2k\pi,(2k+1)\pi)$$ $$f(x) <0 \Leftrightarrow x \in \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}((2k-1)\pi,2k\pi)$$ If we prove that $$\tag{2} |f(x)| > |f(x+\pi)|$$ for every $x$ then we prove $(1)$. But, $|f(x)| =\left| \dfrac{\sin x}{x+1} \right|$ $|f(x+\pi)| =\left| \dfrac{\sin (x+\pi)}{x+\pi+1} \right|=\left| \dfrac{\sin x}{x+\pi+1} \right|$ Thus $(2)$ is proven, and we then have that in general, $$ |f(x+n \pi)| > |f(x+(n+1) \pi)|$$, thus $$\int\limits_{\left( {2k} \right)\pi }^{\left( {2k + 1} \right)\pi } {\frac{{\sin t}}{{t + 1}}dt}  + \int\limits_{\left( {2k + 1} \right)\pi }^{\left( {2k + 2} \right)\pi } {\frac{{\sin t}}{{t + 1}}dt}  > 0$$ and then $$ \int_0^x \frac{\sin t}{t+1}dt > 0 \text{ ; } \forall x >0$$ Is it right?

113674,"Proof of a simple property of real, constant functions.","I recently came across the following theorem: $$

$$ I've been trying for some time, but the proof of $\mathbf{(1)}$ remains as elusive as ever. I've made two major attempts, the second of which I'll outline here. Though, I would be glad to detail the first as well if requested, I won't now since I think it's mostly wrong. But for the second, this is what I have so far: If, $\forall x_1,\ x_2,\ |f(x_1) - f(x_2)| \leq (x_1-x_2)^2$, then $f$ is continuous. This is so as $f$ is defined for all reals, $(\forall x \in \mathbb{R})\ f$ has finite limits, and each of those limits equals $f(x)$. Assume $f$ wasn't constant, then $\exists x_1,\ x_2 \ni x_1 \neq x_2 \implies |f(x_1)- f(x_2)| > 0$. Since $f$ is continuous, there exist an infinity of such pairs, $x_1$ and  $x_2$.  For all such $x_1$ and $x_2$, we may construct a set, $S$, consitsting of $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ (not as pairs); since f is defined for all $x,\ S$ is ""absolutely"" bounded and as such has a least upper bound and and greatest lower bound, which we will denote as $\alpha_1\ = f(a_1)$ and $\alpha_2 = f(a_2)$ respectively. To show $f$ is constant, it will suffice to show that $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$. Does anyone see how the proof could be completed? Or even, do you think there might be a better approach?

113689,"Proving that $\left(\mathbb Q[\sqrt p_1,\dots,\sqrt p_n]:\mathbb Q\right)=2^n$ for distinct primes $p_i$.","I have read the following theorem: If $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$ are distinct prime numbers, then$$\left(\mathbb Q\left[\sqrt p_1,\dots,\sqrt p_n\right]:\mathbb Q\right)=2^n.$$ I have tried to prove a more general statement but I have a problem at one point. (I still don't know how to prove the theorem above, too, because I don't know how not to use linear independence, which I do in the more general statement below.)  Could you please help me overcome the obstacle I've encountered? I will post the intended proof and make it clear where I'm having trouble. I want to prove the following statement: Let $n\geq 1$. The set $B_n:=\left\{\sqrt {p_1^{\epsilon_1}}\sqrt {p_2^{\epsilon_2}}\cdots\sqrt {p_n^{\epsilon_n}}\,|\,(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2,\cdots,\epsilon_n)\in\{0,1\}^n\right\}$ has $2^n$ elements and is a $\mathbb Q-$basis of $\mathbb Q\left[\sqrt p_1,\sqrt p_2,\cdots,\sqrt p_n\right].$ The proof will be by induction. For $n=1,$ we have $B_n=\left\{1,\sqrt {p_1}\right\}.$ It is clear that $\sqrt{p_1}\neq 1,$ so the set has $2=2^1$ elements. It is the basis of $\mathbb Q[\sqrt{p_1}]$ because the minimal polynomial of $\sqrt {p_1}$ over $\mathbb Q$ has degree $2,$ and there is a theorem that $K[a]$ has $a^0,\cdots,a^{d-1}$ as a basis, where $d$ is the degree of the minimal polynomial of $a$ over $K$. Suppose the statement is true for $n-1$, where $n\geq 2.$ We have $$
\left(B_n=B_{n-1}\cup\sqrt{p_n}B_{n-1}\right)\text { and } \left(B_{n-1}\cap\sqrt{p_n}B_{n-1}=\emptyset\right),
$$ which is easy to see. It is also easy to see that $\operatorname{card}(B_{n-1})=\operatorname{card}(\sqrt{p_n}B_{n-1}),$ and therefore $$
\operatorname{card}B_{n}=2^n.
$$ Let $$
\sum_{x\in B_{n}}q_xx=0
$$ for some $\{q_x\}_{x\in B_n}\subset\mathbb Q.$ Let $p(x):=\sqrt{p_n}x$ for all $x\in B_{n-1}.$ We have $$
\sum_{x\in B_{n}}q_xx=\sum_{x\in B_{n-1}} q_xx+\sum_{x\in \sqrt{p_n}B_{n-1}} q_xx=\sum_{x\in B_{n-1}} q_xx+\sum_{x\in B_{n-1}} q_{p(x)}\sqrt{p_n}x.
$$ Therefore $$
\sum_{x\in B_{n-1}} q_xx=-\sqrt{p_n}\sum_{x\in B_{n-1}} q_{p(x)}x,\tag1
$$ and we can make the following division iff $q_{p(x)}\neq 0$ for all $x\in B_{n-1}$ (because $B_{n-1}$ is linearly indepentent over $\mathbb Q$): $$
\sqrt{p_n}=-\frac{\sum_{x\in B_{n-1}} q_xx}{\sum_{x\in B_{n-1}} q_{p(x)}x},
$$ The right-hand side belongs to $\mathbb Q\left[\sqrt p_1,\sqrt p_2,\cdots,\sqrt p_{n-1}\right],$ so we have $$
\sqrt{p_n}\in \mathbb Q\left[\sqrt p_1,\sqrt p_2,\cdots,\sqrt p_{n-1}\right].
$$ Therefore we can write $\sqrt{p_n}$ uniquely in the basis $B_{n-1}$. $$
\sqrt{p_n}=\sum_{y\in B_{n-1}}c_yy
$$ for some $\{c_y\}_{y\in B_{n-1}}\subset \mathbb Q.$ After squaring this equation we will obtain $$
p_n=\sum_{y\in B_{n-1}}c_y^2y^2+2\sum_{y,z\in B_{n-1}}c_yc_zyz.
$$ The last sum must be zero because it is not in $\mathbb Q$ and because after reducing it, we obtain a representation of $p_n$ in the basis $B_{n-1},$ which is unique. Thus $$p_n=\sum_{y\in B_{n-1}}c_y^2y^2.$$ Unfortunately, I can't prove that $c_yc_z$ is always zero. This was my first thought, but clearly there's trouble with the possibility of reductions in
$$
\sum_{y,z\in B_{n-1}}c_yc_zyz.
$$ Different pairs $y,z$ may yield the same element of $B_{n-1}$ in the product $yz.$ This happens for example when $y=\sqrt 5\sqrt 3,$ $z=\sqrt 5\sqrt 2,$ and $y'= \sqrt 11\sqrt 2,$ $z'=\sqrt 11\sqrt 3$. If it were true that $c_yc_z$ is always zero, I would be able to continue my proof as follows. We would have only one $y_0$ such that $c_{y_0}\neq 0$ and we'd get $$p_n=c_{y_0}^2y_0^2.$$ Let $c_{y_0}=\frac kl$. We can write
$$l^2p_n=k^2y_0^2.$$ But $y_0^2$ is the product of some primes different from $p_n$. Therefore the greatest  power of $p_n$ that divides the right-hand side is even. However, the greatest power of $p_n$ that divides the left-hand side is odd. A contradiction. The contradiction proves that $q_{p(x)}=0$ for all $x\in B_{n-1}.$ Hence $(1)$ gives us that $$
\sum_{x\in B_{n-1}} q_xx=0
$$ and linear independence of $B_{n-1}$ gives us that $q_x=0$ for all $x\in B_{n-1}.$ This gives us that $B_n$ is linearly independent. It generates the whole $\mathbb Q\left[\sqrt p_1,\sqrt p_2,\cdots,\sqrt p_n\right]$ because $$
\mathbb Q\left[\sqrt p_1,\sqrt p_2,\cdots,\sqrt p_n\right]=\left(\mathbb Q\left[\sqrt p_1,\sqrt p_2,\cdots,\sqrt p_{n-1}\right]\right)\left[\sqrt{p_n}\right].
$$ This would end the proof.","['extension-field', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

$$
I_t(C)=\int_0^t C_s \; dW_s$$
is a martingale, but I don't see $X_t$ as an Ito's integral. In order to show it is a martingale but not a Markov process, I want to show that 
$$
E(X_t\mid\mathcal{F}_{t-1})=X_{t-1}\neq E(X_t\mid\sigma(X_{t-1})).
$$
I don't know how to take the expecation in this case. Other counterexamples available online might be wrong. (Or, I could
be wrong.) 2. Invalid counterexample: Let $e(t)$ be a random variable which is not independent of
$y(0)$ and 
$$
y(t)=y(t-1)+e(t)-E{[}e(t)|F(t-1){]}.
$$ 
Then y(t) is a martingale but it is not a Markov process. I will show that it is both a martingale and a Markov process. Define $X_{t}$ as 
$$
X_{t}=X_{t-1}+e_{t}-E\left(e_{t}|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\right)
$$ Then, $\{X_{t}\}$ is a martingale because
$$
E(X_{t}|\mathcal{F}_{t-1})  =  E\left(X_{t-1}+e_{t}-E\left(e_{t}|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\right)\bigg|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\right)
  =  E(X_{t-1}|\mathcal{F}_{t-1})+E\left(e_{t}|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\right)-E\left(e_{t}|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\right)
 = E(X_{t-1}|\mathcal{F}_{t-1})
  =  X_{t-1}
$$ However, it is also a Markov process.
$$
E(X_{t}|\sigma(X_{t-1})) =  E\left(X_{t-1}+e_{t}-E\left(e_{t}|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\right)\bigg|\sigma(X_{t-1})\right)
  =  E(X_{t-1}|\sigma(X_{t-1}))+E\left(e_{t}|\sigma(X_{t-1})\right)-E\left(E\left(e_{t}|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\right)\bigg|\sigma(X_{t-1})\right)
$$ Since $\sigma(X_{t-1})\subset\mathcal{F}_{t-1}$, by the towering property,
$$
E\left(\left(e_{t}|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\right)\bigg|\sigma(X_{t-1})\right)=E\left(e_{t}|\sigma(X_{t-1})\right).
$$ Thus
$$E(X_{t}|\sigma(X_{t-1}))  =  E(X_{t-1}|\sigma(X_{t-1}))+E\left(e_{t}|\sigma(X_{t-1})\right)-E\left(e_{t}|\sigma(X_{t-1})\right)
  =  E(X_{t-1}|\sigma(X_{t-1})
$$ Since $X_{t-1}$ is $\sigma(X_{t-1})$-measurable, $E(X_{t-1}|\sigma(X_{t-1}))=X_{t-1}$. Thus $$
E(X_{t}|\sigma(X_{t-1}))=X_{t-1}=E(X_{t}|\mathcal{F}_{t-1})
$$
Hence $\{X_{t}\}$ is also a Markov process. 3. Invalid counterexample from the textbook answer key. Alison Etheridge's textbook gives an example: 
$$
S_{n+1}=S_{n}+\xi_{n+1}
$$ 
where $\xi_{n}\in\{-1,1\}$ and $\{\xi_{n}\}_{n\geq0}$ are iid. Then, $$
P\left(S_{n+1}=k+1\bigg|S_{n}=k\right)=p \text{and }P\left(S_{n+1}=k-1\bigg|S_{n}=k\right)=1-p.
$$
The author claims that $\left\{ S_{n}\right\} $ is a Markov process. Then in the homework answer key, someone gives $\left\{ Z_{n}\right\}$ as a counterexample of a martingale not being a Markov process:
$
\displaystyle{Z_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\xi_{i}}
$ 
where $P(\xi_{i}=1)=\frac{1}{2}=P(\xi_{i}=-1)$. Obviously, $Z_{n+1}=Z_{n}+\xi_{n+1}.$ So what's the difference between this counterexample and the example? Moreover, given $P(\xi_{i}=1)=\frac{1}{2}=P(\xi_{i}=-1)$, I think
is both $\left\{ Z_{n}\right\}$ is both a martingale and a Markov process.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes']"

So, if $I$ is a radical ideal then each of $I_{j}$ is a prime ideal minimal over $I$ , and the primary decomposition give us the decomposition of $Z(I)$ as the union of irreducible variety $Z(I_{j})$ . My thinking is follows: If $I=\cap_{j}I_{j}$ is a primary decomposition of $I$ then each $I_j$ is a primary ideal then its radical $radI_{j}$ is a prime ideal $p_j$ . Then $Z(I_{j})=Z(p_{i})$ and because $p_j$ are prime ideals, $Z(p_{j})$ are irreducible varieties. Thus, $Z(I)=\cup_{j}Z(I_{j})$ is a decomposition of $Z(I)$ into irreducible components. So, what is the role of the radical property of $I$ that Eisenbud mentioned ? Could anybody point out the geometric meaning of primary decomposition in a very concrete way? Thanks. Update : MattE has answered my second question(thank you for that), but I still have trouble in my first question. Eisenbud's argument have used the radical property of ideal $I$ , and he conclude that $Z(I)$ can be decompose into union of irreducible component. However in my argument above, I have not used it and still get the same conclusion. So was I wrong in anywhere or we can ignore the radical properties of $I$ in Eisenbud's argument? Please point it out for me. Thank you very much!","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
113867,A sufficient condition for a domain to be Dedekind?,"We know that in a Dedekind domain, every nonzero ideal admits a unique factorization into a product of prime ideals. I was wondering if this condition is sufficient for a domain to be Dedekind, i.e., if in a domain $D$ every non-zero ideal admits a unique factorization into a product of prime ideals, then is the domain Dedekind? It seems that ""Noetherianness"" of $D$ follows (via the ascending chain condition) if we can show that every non-zero prime ideal of $D$ is maximal. But, I don't know how to prove the latter assertion. Perhaps, one needs Noetherianness of $D$ to prove that $D$ is a dimension $1$ domain.

113876,Why is there no continuous square root function on $\mathbb{C}$?,"I know that what taking square roots for reals, we can choose the standard square root in such a way that the square root function is continuous, with respect to the metric. Why is that not the case over $\mathbb{C}$, with respect the the $\mathbb{R}^2$ metric? I suppose what I'm trying to ask is why is there not continuous function $f$ on $\mathbb{C}$ such that $f(z)^2=z$ for all $z$? This is what I was reading, but didn't get: Suppose there exists some $f$, and restrict attention to $S^1$. Given $t\in[0,2\pi)$, we can write
$$
f(\cos t+i\sin t)=\cos(\psi (t))+i\sin(\psi (t))
$$
for unique $\psi(t)\in\{t/2,t/2+\pi\}$. (I don't understand this assertion of why the displayed equality works, and why $\psi$ only takes those two possible values.) If $f$ is continuous, then $\psi:[0,2\pi)\to[0,2\pi)$ is continuous. Then $t\mapsto \psi(t)-t/2$ is continuous, and takes values in $\{0,\pi\}$ and is thus constant. This constant must equal $\psi(0)$, so $\psi(t)=\psi(0)+t/2$. Thus $\lim_{t\to 2\pi}\psi(t)=\psi(0)+\pi$. Then 
$$
\lim_{t\to 2\pi} f(\cos t+i\sin t)=-f(1).
$$
(How is $-f(1)$ found on the RHS?) Since $f$ is continuous, $f(1)=-f(1)$, impossible since $f(1)\neq 0$. I hope someone can clear up the two problems I have understanding the proof. Thanks.","['functions', 'complex-analysis']"

Therefore, $\theta = \operatorname{sgn}(b)\arccos(a/r) = -1 * 1.1881482... = -1.1881482...$ $|d|$ is $0.31209$, which is less than $r$, so $\alpha$ can just be computed as $\alpha = \arccos(d/r) - \theta = 2.271361...$ Rotating the original point by this, to $(d, g, h)$, gives $(0.31209, 0.588529, 0.078229)$ - this is good, since $d$ is correct and the length of this is also $0.670735...$, so it's on the sphere.

If $M$ is not bounded it's enough to take the distance from a fixed point as we can always find a sequence which ""exits"" every compact and pushes the distance at infinity. But what if $M$ is bounded?","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

114165,On a certain morphism of schemes from affine space to projective space.,"I'm currently reading Ravi vakil's notes on algebraic geometry, and I'm completly stuck on a question and I would love for you all to shed some light on it. The question is:
""Make sense of the following sentence: '' $$\mathbb{A}^{n+1}_k \setminus \{0\} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_k$$ given by $$(x_0,x_1,..x_n) \rightarrow [x_0,x_1,..,x_n]$$ is a morphism of schemes.Caution: you can’t just say where points go; you have
to say where functions go. So you may have to divide these up into affines, and
describe the maps, and check that they glue""
OK, so I've tried to divide this up into affines, but I'm not sure exactly what this map is on these affina schemes to be honest.

114168,Estimating a probability of head of a biased coin,"The question is: We assume a uniform (0,1)  prior for the (unknown) probability of a head. A coin is tossed 100 times with 65 of the tosses turning out heads. What is the probability that the next toss will be head? Well, the most obvious answer is of course prob = 0.65, but I am afraid this is too simple. However, I really don't know what is wrong with this answer? I think I need to use the fact that we assume a uniform [0,1] before we begin tossing the coin, but I am not sure how to proceed.","['statistics', 'probability']"

Let $B$ be an $n$ by $n$ matrix that commutes with A. Prove that $B$ and $\sqrt{A}$ commute. I started to solve the problem like this:
Since $A$ is a Hermitian positive semi-definite matrix, then there exits a unitary matrix $J$ such that: $$J^{-1}AJ=D=diag(\lambda _{1},\lambda _{2},...,\lambda _{n})$$
where: $\lambda _{i}\geq 0$ and $\lambda _{i}$ are eigenvalues of $A$, and since $A$ is Hermitian, then the eigenvalues are real. Let $$F=\sqrt{A}=JCJ^{-1}$$ where $C=\sqrt{D}=diag\left ( \sqrt{\lambda _{1}},\sqrt{\lambda _{2}},...,\sqrt{\lambda _{n}} \right )$, and $\sqrt{\lambda _{i}}$ are eigenvalues of $F=\sqrt{A}$. $AB=BA\Rightarrow JDJ^{-1}B=BJDJ^{-1}$ So, I need to use the above equality to prove this one:
$$FB=BF\Rightarrow JCJ^{-1}B=BJCJ^{-1}\Rightarrow ...$$ Please let me know how I should finish my proof. Also, if anyone has a different solution, please share. Thanks","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'inner-products', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"
114175,Definition of convergence in distribution,"My question is convergence in distribution seems to be defined differently in Wikipedia and in Kai Lai Chung's book.  My view is that the one by Wikipedia is a standard definition of convergence in distribution, and the one by Chung is actually vague convergence not convergence in distribution. I wonder if the two definitions are equivalent, and why? Following are relevant quotes from the two sources: From Wikipedia A sequence $\{X_1, X_2, …\}$ of random variables is said to converge
  in distribution to a random
  variable $X$ if $$ \lim_{n\to \infty} F_n(x) = F(x)$$ for every number
  $x ∈ \mathbb{R}$ at which $F$ is continuous. Here $F_n$ and $F$ are
  the cumulative distribution functions of random variables $X_n$ and
  $X$ correspondingly. From Kai Lai Chung's A course in probability theory , consider
(sub)probability measures (s.p.m.'s or p.m.'s) on $\mathbb{R}$. definition of convergence ""in distribution"" (in dist.) - A sequence of r.v.'s $\{X_n\}$ is said to converge in distribution to
  d.f. $F$
  iff the sequence $\{F_n\}$ of corresponding d.f.'s converges vaguely
  to the d.f. $F$. My rephrase of vague convergence of a sequence of distribution functions (d.f.'s) based on the same
book is We say that $F_n$ converges vaguely to $F$, if their s.p.m.'s are
  $\mu_n$ and $\mu$, and $\mu_n$ converges to $\mu$ vaguely. On p85 of Chung's book, vague convergence of a sequence of s.p.m.'s is defined as a sequence of subprobability measures (s.p.m.'s) $\{ \mu_n, n\geq 1  \}$ is said vaguely converge to another subprobablity measure
  $\mu$ on
  $\mathbb{R}$, if there exists a dense subset $D$ of the real line
  $\mathbb{R}$  so that $ \forall a \text{ and } b \in D \text{ with } a  <b, \mu_n((a,b]) \rightarrow \mu((a,b])$. Thanks and regards!","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"
114218,Geometric reason for 3/4-power growth rate?,"It seems pretty well established that organisms grow

Niklas and Enquist, in their paper
""Invariant scaling relationships for interspecific plant biomass production rates and body size,"" PNAS 2001, 98(5):2922
-2927 , say: Annualized rates of growth $G$ scale as the 3/4-power of body mass $M$ 
  over 20 orders of magnitude of $M$ (i.e., $G \propto M^{\frac{3}{4}}$). Does anyone know if there is some geometric reason to expect such
a growth-rate law? $$\frac{d M}{d t} \sim M^{\frac{3}{4}}$$ Apparently attempts to derive this growth-rate law from Kleiber's Law , which 
claims that metabolic rate scales
as $M^{\frac{3}{4}}$, are controversial.
So I was wondering if there might be some geometric viewpoint
that makes growth proportional to $M^{\frac{3}{4}}$ not unexpected.","['geometry', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'biology', 'applications']"

I suppose part of my confusion comes from not completely understanding the structure of the function $\left|\zeta{(\sigma + it)}\right|^2$. Am I right to say that this function is holomorphic everywhere except at 1, where it has a pole of order 2 and no simple pole (by squaring the laurent expansion of $\zeta$ at 1)?

I managed to figure out the first two, and for the second one I got bounds of something like $1-\mbox{const}\times e^{-c^2/n}$ by considering $P(|B_t|\geq c)$ and using the reflection principle for $\tau=\inf_{t\leq m}\{t: \ |B_t|\geq c)\}$. The problem is, the same trick doesn't quite work when figuring out the $P(\sup_{1\leq i\leq m}|Z_i|\leq c)$. In fact, the best I could do was write $Z_{n+1}=Z_n+B_{n+1}$ where $B$ is a standard Brownian motion. Maybe this can become a stochastic differential equation? But, it feels intractable unless I'm missing something. I was wondering how one might get good upper and lower bounds for the supremum over $Z_i$?
