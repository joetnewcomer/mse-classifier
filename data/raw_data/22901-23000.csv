197675,Specific homotopy between complex conjugation and the identity.,"Consider the set $\mathcal{C} = C^{\infty}(\mathbb{C}^*, \mathbb{C}^*)$, where $\mathbb{C}^* = \mathbb{C}\backslash\{0\}$. Both $f(z) = z$ and $g(z) = \bar{z}$ can be seen as elements in $\mathcal{C}$. Question : Is there a (smooth, not necessarily analytic) homotopy $H : [0, 1] \times \mathbb{C}^* \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^*$ between $f$ and $g$? I tried what seemed to me like natural choices, such as deforming the imaginary part, but the problem is to avoid producing some function which maps a non-zero complex number to zero. Motivation : In case anyone is wondering, this problem arises in showing that two complex line bundles over the $2$-sphere are (smoothly) isomorphic. The bundles are $L_g^*$ and $L_{1/g}$, where $g : \mathbb{C}^* \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^*$ is the gluing cocycle (there is only one, since the $2$-sphere is covered by two stereographic projections).

197686,Outer Automorphisms of $S_n$,"There are a lots of questions (and several good explanations) on understanding the non-trivial outer automorphism of $S_6$. What I haven't seen, though, is a good explanation of why there are no such outer automorphisms for $n\neq 6$. Wikipedia makes a passing mention of this fact here . In particular, they have this cryptic claim: For every symmetric group other than $S_6$, there is no other conjugacy class of elements of order 2 with the same number of elements as the class of transpositions. This seems like the natural thing to prove, given the knowledge that you can construct an outer automorphism of $S_6$ which takes transpositions to products of three transpositions (i.e. things like $(12)\mapsto (12)(34)(56)$.) Also, the second reason Wikipedia gives doesn't feel very intuitive to me. My question, then, is how does one justify the original (quoted) statement above? Here is the naive computation of sizes of conjugacy classes: We need to show that when $n, k\neq 6,3$
$$\frac{n!}{2^k k! (n-2k)!}\neq\frac{n!}{2(n-2)!},$$which is equivalent to $$2^k k!(n-2k)!\neq 2(n-2)!$$ What I want to say is something like, if $n{-}2$ is bigger than $k$, then there is always some factor on the RHS that doesn't appear in the LHS (except when it is a power of two). Will this type of analysis get me anywhere, or is there a better way to think about this?","['symmetric-groups', 'abstract-algebra']"

197699,Notation used to define a probability space,"""Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P})$ be a probability space..."" is a typical phrase found in scientific publications. There are a couple of questions regarding this notation. First, about the probability measure $\mathcal{P}: \Omega \to [0, 1]$. My confusion comes from the fact that, after such an introduction, authors typically start operating on different random variables, which have some particular distribution functions, say $X_i(\omega) \sim \Phi_{X_i}(x)$. $\Phi_{X_i}(x)$, $\forall i$, seem (to me) to be related to different probability measures, which cannot be covered by a signle one, $\mathcal{P}$. Therefore, for each $X_i(\omega)$ I would expect one to define a separate probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P}_i)$ such that $F_{X_i}(x) = \mathcal{P}_i(X_i(\omega) \leq x)$. However, I do not see anything like this. There is, probabily, some misunderstanding from my side. Second, about the corresponding space of square-integrable random variables. Usually, it is denoted by $L^2(\dots)$ with different variations of what is in the brackets. I suppose ""square-integrable"" makes little sense without a measure; therefore, it should be at least $L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{P})$, but quite often one can find just $L^2(\Omega)$. Can anyone please comment on this? Thank you. Regards,

197788,Proving Thomae's function is nowhere differentiable.,"I am given the function $$f(x)=\begin{cases} 0 \text{ ; when } x \text{ is irrational} \\\frac 1 q \text{ ; for } x=\frac p q \text{ irreducible fraction}\end{cases}$$ Spivak proved that for $a\in (0,1)$, we have $$\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=0$$ That is, this function is only continuous at the irrationals. I assume we consider $f$ for $x\geq 0$, since for negative $x$ it wouldn't be defined: If $x=-\dfrac p q=\dfrac {-p }q=\dfrac {p }{-q}$ should we take $f(x)=-\dfrac 1 q $ or $f(x)=\dfrac 1q$? Also, this function is periodic with period $1$, so we can just prove this on $(0,1)$ (as in the first case when proving continuity). Now, Spivak wants me to prove this function is not differentiable at $a$, for any $a$. It is clear that, since it isn't continuous at the rationals, it is not differentiable there. Thus we need to prove the claim for $a$ irrational. He gives the following hint. Suppose $a=n,a_1a_2a_3\dots$. Consider the expression $$\frac{{f\left( {a + h} \right) - f\left( a \right)}}{h}$$ for $h$ rational, and also for $h=-0,0\dots0a_{n+1}a_{n+2}\dots$ I have been trying to work this out for a while, but I can't. I am not sure, also, if he meant to have the $n$ in the subindices match the $n$ of $a$, or if it is only a typo. The book has $$\frac{{f\left( {a + h} \right) - f\left( h \right)}}{h}$$ instead of $$\frac{{f\left( {a + h} \right) - f\left( a \right)}}{h}$$ which is (I guess) a typo, too. For $h$ rational, one gets $$\frac{{f\left( {a + h} \right) - f\left( a \right)}}{h} = 0$$ and for $h=-0,0\dots0a_{n+1}a_{n+2}\dots$, you get,assuming $a+h=m/u$ $$\frac{{f\left( {a + h} \right) - f\left( a \right)}}{h} = \frac{{f\left( {a + h} \right)}}{h} = f\left( {\frac{m}{u}} \right)\frac{1}{h}$$ but I really don't know what to do with this. I know I have to show the limit $$\mathop {\lim }\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{{f\left( {a + h} \right) - f\left( a \right)}}{h} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{{f\left( {a + h} \right)}}{h}$$ doesn't exist for any $a$, but I can't see how.

197916,Additivity of the matrix exponential of infinite matrices,"It is well known that the matrix exponential of finite dimensional matrices is additive if the exponents commute: $AB=BA\implies e^Ae^B=e^{A+B}$ (cf. e.g. Bernstein , Corollary 11.1.6). Under what circumstances does it carry over to the infinite dimensional case? I am particularly interested in the case when the matrices are stochastic. Definitions Let $A=(A_{i,j})_{i,j\in\mathbb{N}_0}$, $B=(B_{i,j})_{i,j\in\mathbb{N}_0}$ be real valued infinite dimensional matrices.
Scalar product, sum and product of infinite matrices are again infinite matrices that are defined component-wise as follows
$$\begin{align}rA&:=(rA_{i,j})_{i,j\in\mathbb{N}_0}\\A+B&:=(A_{i,j}+B_{i,j})_{i,j\in\mathbb{N}_0}\\AB&:=(\sum_{k=0}^\infty A_{i,k}B_{k,j})_{i,j\in\mathbb{N}_0}\end{align}$$
Unlike the scalar product and the sum, the product may not be defined for some matrices. It is defined provided all the infinite series on the right hand side converge to a real number. The limit of an infinite sequence of infinite, real-valued matrices $(C^{(n)})_{n\in\mathbb{N}_0}$ as well as the sum thereof are again infinite matrices that are defined component-wise as follows
$$\begin{align}\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}C^{(n)}&:=(\lim_{n\rightarrow}C_{i,j}^{(n)})_{i,j\in\mathbb{N}_0}\\\sum_{n=0}^\infty C^{(n)}&:=(\sum_{n=0}^\infty C_{i,j}^{(n)})_{i,j\in\mathbb{N}_0}\end{align}$$
provided all the limits/sums on the right hand side converge to real numbers. We define
$$\begin{align}0&:=(0)_{i,j\in\mathbb{N}_0}\\I&:=(\delta_{i,j})_{i,j\in\mathbb{N}_0}\end{align}$$
where $\delta_{i,j}$ is Kronecker's Delta. The powers of $A$ are defined recursively thus (for $n\in\mathbb{N}_0$)
$$\begin{align}A^0&:=I\space\space\mathrm{(even\, if\, }A=0\mathrm{\, )}\\A^{n+1}&:=AA^n\end{align}$$
Not all powers of all infinite matrices may be defined for the same reason the product of some pairs of infinite matrices may not be defined. The exponential of $A$ is defined as
$$e^A:=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} A^n$$
provided all the powers on the right hand side are defined and that the sum converges. Question Suppose $e^A$, $e^B$ converge and their product is well-defined. Under what circumstances does $e^{A+B}$ converge and

So far, my attempts have been as follows.  If $\psi$ is nonzero, then for it to be an extreme point, it's clear $\psi$ must have norm 1.  So I just need to see it's pure now.  Assume that $0 \leq \phi \leq \psi$, from which it follows that $||\phi|| \leq ||\psi||$ and $||\psi-\phi|| \leq ||\psi||$.  Then $1/2\psi=1/2\phi+1/2(\psi-\phi)$.

I know that the sum of QC functions is not generally QC, but my numerical simulations seem to suggest that $ψ(a_1,a_0)$ is. I have tried using the definition (i.e. trying to show that it has convex upper contour sets by plugging $ψ\big(\lambda a + (1-\lambda)b\big)\geq$... etc), but I can not prove the inequality. I also tried using the border Hessian, but i cannot sign the determinant.

Of course we can also talk about an arbitrary measure space having a continuous measure as well. I'm curious if we can actually make Lebesgue measure continuous in a meaningful way. What I mean by this is if we can find a Hausdorff topology on $\mathcal L$, the Lebesgue measurable subsets of $\mathbb R$, so that $m: \mathcal L \rightarrow [0,\infty]$ is continuous and for $A_n \in \mathcal L$ we have that $U_n=\bigcup_{k=1}^n A_k$ converges in the topology to 
the union of the $A_k$. Ideally I'd like to see an example or such a topology or if it's impossible a proof that it isn't possible. A couple of things to note. It's not hard to get any two of the three conditions. For instance we could put the discrete topology to get Hausdorff and continuous or we could put the pullback topology of $[0,\infty]$ under $m$

I've seen the proof of this theorem in other textbooks, but difference definitions and constructions were used. In this text, they give the definition of a compactification, and then the Stone–Čech compactification of a completely regular space $X$ is defined as the compactification which is maximal in the $\leq$ ordering. The $\leq$ ordering on the family of compactifications on $X$ is defined as: $cX \leq dX$ if and only if there is a continuous and onto $f:dX \rightarrow cX$ which fixes all points in $X$. Theorem: The Stone–Čech compactification exists for every completely regular space $X$. They provide a sketch of the proof, but I am having trouble filling in the gaps. Sketch of Proof: Let $\mathcal{C}_{X}$ be the set of all compactifications on $X$, then $\prod \mathcal{C}_{X}$ is a compact space. Embed $X$ into $\prod \mathcal{C}_{X}$ by $\phi$: $x \mapsto \{ c(x) : cX \in \mathcal{C}_X \}$. Then, the closure of this image of $X$ is as required.

198421,Constant tensors and covariant derivatives,"I seem to have trouble with an elementary computation, and figure it may help others if faced with a similar situation.  The basic question is as follows: if I have a tensor field $T$ on some Riemannian manifold $(M,h)$, and I know that $T$ is constant for some choice of local orthonormal frame, does it hold that
$$
DT \equiv 0\,,
$$
where $D$ is the covariant derivative along a smooth isometrically immersed submanifold of $M$? I think it is only polite to explain the precise situation I am considering, so let me do so here. Let $(N,h)$ be a Riemannian 3-manifold and consider an immersion $f:\Sigma\rightarrow N$ of the surface $\Sigma$.  Equip $\Sigma$ with the pullback of the metric $h$ so that $(\Sigma, f^*h) = (\Sigma, g)$ is a Riemannian 2-manifold.  Let us denote by $\nabla$ the connection on $N$ compatible with $h$ and by $D$ the connection on $\Sigma$ compatible with $g$.  The Christoffel symbols of $\nabla$ we denote by $\Gamma$ and those of $D$ we denote by $\Lambda$. Now assume $\Sigma$ is orientable and let $\nu:\Sigma\rightarrow (T\Sigma)^\perp$ be a choice of unit normal.  Further let us assume that the curvature of $N$ is constant; since $N$ is a 3-manifold, this is the same as assuming that the Ricci curvature tensor $\text{Ric}$ of $N$ is constant. Let us perform our computations in an orthonormal frame $\{\nu,e_1,e_2\}$ which is adapted to the submanifold $\Sigma$.
By definition
$$
\nabla_{e_k} \text{Ric}(e_i,e_j)
 = \partial_k\text{Ric}(e_i,e_j)
 - \Gamma_{ki}^l\text{Ric}(e_l,e_j)
 - \Gamma_{kj}^l\text{Ric}(e_i,e_l)\,.
$$
As far as I can tell, there is no reason that $\Gamma \equiv 0$ in the orthonormal frame we have.  So it seems to me that although the Ricci curvature of $N$ is constant, it's covariant derivative does not vanish in general.  This seems bizarre to me, and is certainly confusing, but not my main question. Restricting the tensor $\text{Ric}$ to $\Sigma$, we can consider $D\text{Ric}$.  In particular, my main question is:
$$
\text{Does it hold that $D_{X}\text{Ric}(\nu,\nu) = 0$ for $X\in\{\nu,e_1,e_2\}$}?

Let's define two events T (first test positive) and S (second test positive). When you use Bayes' rule, you are going to need to figure out how to compute the total probability $\Pr(T \cap S)$. To do this, you should assume that these two tests are independent, and therefore you will get: $\Pr(T \cap S | D) = P(T | D) * P(S | D) \quad$ and $\quad \Pr(T \cap S | D^c) = P(T | D^c) * P(S | D^c)$. A point to remember here is that the rules of probability stay the same for conditional probability if the event on the right of the ""|"" stays constant.

More precisely I would like to know if the correct DE to solve this problem is $$E(x) = 1-x^2 + \int_0^x 2y+2yE(\frac{x-y}{1-y}) dy$$ or $$E(x) = 1-x^2 + \int_0^x 1+2yE(\frac{x-y}{1-y}) dy$$ As you see my problem is that I don't know whether the first term of the integrand should be 1 or 2y. Some additional info to make it easier to understand the DE's: $1-x^2$ = probability 1 step is enough to make disappear more than x $E(\frac{x-y}{1-y})$ = expected number of times the process should be repeated such that a fraction x  has disappeared, starting from length y < x $2y$ = probability distribution function for the maximum of x_1 and x_2 with 0<=y<=1","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'probability']"
198744,Exactly one nontrivial proper subgroup,"Question: Determine all the finite groups that have exactly one nontrivial proper subgroup. MY attempt is that the order of group G has to be a positive nonprime integer n which has only one divisor since any divisor a of n will form a proper subgroup of order a. Since 4 is the only nonprime number that has only 1 divisor which is 2, All groups of order 4 has only 1 nontrivial proper subgroups (Z4 and D4)","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
198748,$C^\infty$ version of Urysohn Lemma in $\Bbb R^n$,"I'm trying to solve an exercise which its conclusion seems to be the title of this post. The exercise is: Show that the function $h:\Bbb R\to [0,1[$ given by
  $$h(t)=\begin{cases}
e^{-1/t^2} &\text{if } t\neq 0\\
0          &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
  is $C^\infty$. Show that the functions
  $$h_+(t)=\begin{cases}
e^{-1/t^2} &\text{if } t\gt 0\\
0          &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\quad\text{and}\quad
h_{-}(t)=\begin{cases}
e^{-1/t^2} &\text{if } t\lt 0\\
0          &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
  are $C^\infty$. Show that the function $k:\Bbb R\to [0,1[$ given by $k(t)=h_-(t-b)h_+(t-a)$ is $C^\infty$ and positive for $t\in ]a,b[$. Let $R$ the rentangle $]a_1,b_1[\times\cdots\times]a_n,b_n[$. Show that there is a $C^\infty$ function $g:\Bbb R^n\to [0,1[$ strictly positive on $R$. Conclude that if $K$ is a compact subset of $\Bbb R^n$ and $U$ is an open neighborhood of $K$, there is a $C^\infty$ function $f:\Bbb R^n\to [0,1]$ such that $f_{|K}\equiv 1$ and its support is contained in $U$. From 1.-4. I can prove that for any open and bounded set $O\subset \Bbb R^n$, there is a $C^\infty$ function with its support contained in $O$. So my first attempt was apply this to the open $U\setminus K$. Then I get a $C^\infty$ function $f$ that is $0$ (in particular) over $K$. If I just consider $\chi_K+f$ that function can fail to be $C^\infty$. In a discussion on the chat, robjohn suggest this . It works fine, but then my question is: Can 5. be proved by using 1.-4.? If yes, how?",['analysis']
