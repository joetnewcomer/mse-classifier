2959045,Approximately inverting functions with Monte Carlo methods,"I have the following problem: Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ with $n>m$ be a smooth function. I want to find input vectors $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ which yield a given output $y\in \mathbb{R}^m$ , so $f(x)=y$ . My idea was to start at a random vector $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and try to iteratively decrease the $L^2$ -norm of the differences, so that for any $n$ we have $||f(x_{n+1})-y)||_2<||f(x_n)-y)||_2$ . Would this be possible with some kind of Monte Carlo approach? Or are there any existing approaches that could be used for tackling this problem?

clearly this is a case of conditional probability without replacement, in the first case, i take 2 balls simultaneously out of 7 and compute probability of both being red, that is same as drawing 2 balls without replacement! 
is this the correct way to approach a problem? in the approach 3 , i tried calculating the sample space where 2 balls are drawn without replacement, where there are four cases: Red in first and Red in second draw Red in first and Black in second draw Black in first and Red in second draw Black in first and Black in second draw I am quite unsure about the validity of approach 3!

However, my reasoning was that since it is given that there can be an equivalence between $cx^n$ and our function, i.e. the limit is finite and goes to $1$ as $x \to 0$ , then it also must be true that if we invert the fraction, then the limit is still finite and is $1/1=1$ as $x \to 0$ . So, next step: $$c \lim_{x \to 0} \left(x^n + x^{n-4}\cos x + 3x^{n-4} \right)$$ $$c \lim_{x \to 0} (x^{n-4}(\cos x -1))=1$$ $$-c \lim_{x \to 0} \left(x^{n-4} \frac{x^2}{2}\right) = 1$$ We need $x^{n-4} = x^{-2}$ $\implies n=2$ $$-c \frac{1}{2} =1 \implies c=-2$$","['limits', 'functions']"
2959243,Can the computer be able to design a non-periodic tiling?,"Non-periodic tiling is an interesting topics in geometry and beyond. PT (Penrose Tiling) is a famous example of non-periodic tiling. Rogers Penrose once said that the computer will stumble when trying to solve the  problem whether PT can tile the entire plane. 
This is because for the computer to solve this problem, either it has to make up a pattern that is periodic or to run forever to prove computationally the plane is covered by PT. And in both cases, this will be impossible. Does it mean there is no way for the computer to design a non-periodic tiling, in particularly, using one shape? Non-periodic tiling using one shape is known as einstein problem. If the computer can make it, it means it may fall into contradiction, given the Penrose argument above. This means only human is able to design a non-periodic pattern, or isn`t?","['geometry', 'tiling', 'computability']"

2959820,Causal Inference A Primer Study Question,"I am reading Pearl's Causal Inference book and attempted at solving study question 1.2.4. Here is the entire problem: In an attempt to estimate the effectiveness of a new drug, a randomized experiment is conducted. In all, 50% of the patients are assigned to receive the new drug and 50% to receive a placebo. A day before the actual experiment, a nurse hands out lollipops to some patients who show signs of depression, mostly among those who have been assigned to treatment the next day (i.e., the nurse’s round happened to take her through the treatment-bound ward). Strangely, the experimental data revealed a Simpson’s reversal: Although the drug proved beneficial to the population as a whole, drug takers were less likely to recover than nontakers, among both lollipop receivers and lollipop nonreceivers. Assuming that lollipop sucking in itself has no effect whatsoever on recovery, answer the following questions: 1. Is the drug beneficial to the population as a whole or harmful? 2. Does your answer contradict our gender example, where sex-specific data was deemed more appropriate? 3. Draw a graph (informally) that more or less captures the story. 4. How would you explain the emergence of Simpson’s reversal in this story? 5. Would your answer change if the lollipops were handed out (by the same criterion) a day after the study? [Hint: Use the fact that receiving a lollipop indicates a greater likelihood of being assigned to drug treatment, as well as depression, which is a symptom of risk factors that lower the likelihood of recovery.] Given the hint, Here is my attempt at forming some assumptions that might have produced the observed data: Lollipop receivers consist of depressed patients (majority) and patients without depression. So depression affects lollipop receipt. Lollipop receivers consist of treated patients (majority) and untreated patients. So treatment affects lollipop receipt. However, depression and treatment assignment cannot be related because treatment assignment was randomized. This means that the number of depressed patients in the treatment group should be similar to the number of depressed patients in the placebo group. Treatment affects recovery. Depression affects recovery. I tried to come up with a concrete extreme case that would be consistent with the problem's description and my assumptions. One extreme scenario for the simpson's reversal to happen is by the following: Within the lollipop group, most treated patients are depressed, and all the untreated patients aren't depressed. Since untreated patients have better health than treated patients, depending on the severeness of depression for the treated patients, placebo group can have a higher recover rate than treatment group within the lollipop group. If 1 is established, within the non-lollipop group, it must be that all the treated patients are not depressed, and the majority of the untreated patients are depressed. In this case, untreated patients should have a lower recovery rate since they are both untreated and are in a worse health condition, contradicting simpson's reversal. I have been trying different scenarios and creating contingency tables but still can't find a satisfying concrete example.

So my question: does there some estimates on number of $1$ ( $-1$ ) to get 1 matrix ( -1 matrix). I've thought that it should be $O(n^{2})$ (actually I thought that $n(n-1)$ is enough for $n>3$ ).

2959978,Reformulating the definition of compactness,"Consider the following alternative definition of a topological space. Definition: A topological space is an ordered pair $(X, \lessdot)$ consisting of a set $X$ and a binary relation $\lessdot$ between the members of $X$ and the subsets of $X$ . (We read $x \lessdot A$ as "" $x$ touches $A$ "".) The touch relation $\lessdot$ must satisfy the following axioms: No element of $X$ touches the empty set. If $x \in A$ , then $x \lessdot A$ . If $x \lessdot (A \cup B)$ , then $x \lessdot A$ or $x \lessdot B$ . If $x \lessdot A$ and every element of $A$ touches $B$ , then $x \lessdot B$ . This definition is equivalent to the usual definition via open sets and better captures the intuition that a topology on a set specifies which points are ""infinitesimally close"" to each other. It also makes a lot of definitions conceptually easier: for example, $f: X \to Y$ is continuous iff $x \lessdot A \implies f(x) \lessdot f(A)$ . Question: Can the definitions of compact spaces and proper maps be reformulated in terms of a touch relation in a simple way, similar in spirit to the definition of continuity above? Of course, it's possible to define open sets in terms of a touch relation ( $A \subseteq X$ is open iff no point of $A$ touches $X \setminus A$ ) and then restate the usual definition of compactness, but I have a suspicion that something simpler ought to be possible. The definition of continuity above is a lot shorter than ""the inverse image under $f$ of every set whose points do not touch its complement is itself a set whose points do not touch its complement."" Proper maps, in particular, have a nice intuitive characterization (faraway points are sent to faraway points) that seems compatible with the structure of a touch relation. (Note that $x \not\lessdot A \implies f(x) \not\lessdot f(A)$ doesn't work. Sigmoid functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ have this property but are not proper.) Aside: I believe this axiomatization of point-set topology first appeared in a 1977 article by David B. Gauld called ""Nearness - A Better Approach To Topology"" . In this article, Gauld mentions that ""...one can formulate a definition of compactness involving nearness spaces, but it is rather unwieldy."" Unfortunately, Gauld does not state his definition, and I can't find any reference to it elsewhere. I caution readers that Gauld's terminology did not catch on, and ""nearness space"" typically refers to a different mathematical structure elsewhere in the literature.","['alternative-proof', 'general-topology', 'definition', 'education']"

2960256,Is there a bijective seacucumber?,"A friend defined a seacucumber as a continuous function $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ such that $f(z+1)+f(z+i)+f(z-1)+f(z-i)=0$ for all $z\in\mathbb{C}$ .
He wanted to know if there exists a bijective seacucumber. An example of a non-trivial seacucumber is $f(x+yi):=e^{i\pi(x+y)/2}$ . Assume there exists a bijective seacucumber $f$ .
If we observe $f^{-1}(D)$ for some large enough disc $D$ , then this is bounded, so it is contained in a large enough disk $E$ .
Then in any direction we can get outside $E$ and find $4$ points very close together where the function values add up to $0$ .
As $f$ is continuous and bijective, any path through these $4$ points must go all the way around $D$ in order for this sum to be $0$ .
If you draw some of these paths, you quickly notice that $f$ must have some very spirally properties.
You see what we described as tentacles if you let a path pass through multiple such sets of $4$ points all the way around $E$ .
Also, if you go further from the origin, you can find more of these sets of $4$ points, which means the amount of tentacles should keep increasing. This is all very heuristic unfortunately, and we could not come to a contradiction or come up with an example.
We also tried to look whether a function from $\mathbb{Z}+i\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{C}$ satisfying the seacucumber equation can even be injective, but we expect this is possible. I would love to see how far we can come with this problem.

UPDATE 1 : My problem is a sub-problem from my main task where I need to show that $$y_{MP} = \int t\,p(t) \,dt,$$ where $$p(t)\propto\int
 \exp\left(-\frac{\beta}{2}\{t-y_{MP}-\textbf{g}^T\textbf{v}\}^2-\frac{1}{2}\textbf{v}^TA\textbf{v}\right)\,d\textbf{v}.$$ $\beta, y_{MP}$ (MP stands for maximum posteriori) are constant scalars, $\textbf{g}$ is a constant vector and $A$ is a real symmetric $W\times W$ matrix. The variable $t\in\mathbb{R}$ is a real number. I'm supposed to use the following facts to help me: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left(-\frac{\lambda}{2}x^2\right)\, dx = \left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\right)^{1/2}$$ $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\textbf{v}^TA\textbf{v}\right)\, d\textbf{v} = (2\pi)^{W/2}|A|^{-1/2}$$ $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\textbf{v}^TA\textbf{v}+\textbf{h}^T\textbf{v}\right)\, d\textbf{v} = (2\pi)^{W/2}|A|^{-1/2}\exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\textbf{h}^TA^{-1}\textbf{h}\right)$$ According to the hint, I should first integrate w.r.t $t$ and then w.r.t $\textbf{v}$ . If you can help me solve my main problem, then that would be perfect answer to my question also . Thank you. Hints from my book (page 433, tasks 10.1 and 10.2): integrate over $t$ first, and then evaluate the integral over $\textbf{v}$ using the above three integral equations. Do the integral
  by expanding the square in the exponent and collect together the terms
  which are quadratic in $\textbf{v}$ . UPDATE 2: Here is my own attempt and the point I'm stuck at the moment $$\begin{aligned}
\int t \, p(t)\; dt &\propto \int t \, \int \exp{\left(-\frac{\beta}{2}\left\{t-y_{MP}-\textbf{g}^T \textbf{v}\right\}^2-\frac{1}{2}\textbf{v}^T \textbf{A}\textbf{v}\right)}\; d\textbf{v}\; dt\\
&=\int \exp{\left(-\frac{1}{2}\textbf{v}^T \textbf{A}\textbf{v}\right)} \int t \exp{\left(-\frac{\beta}{2}\left\{t-y_{MP}-\textbf{g}^T \textbf{v}\right\}^2\right)}\; dt\; d\textbf{v}\\
&=\int \exp{\left(-\frac{1}{2}\textbf{v}^T \textbf{A}\textbf{v}\right)} \left[\left(y_{MP}+\textbf{g}^T \textbf{v}\right)\left(\frac{2\pi}{\beta}\right)^{1/2}\right]\; d\textbf{v} \\
&=\left(\frac{2\pi}{\beta}\right)^{1/2}\int \exp{\left(-\frac{1}{2}\textbf{v}^T \textbf{A}\textbf{v}\right)} \left(y_{MP}+\textbf{g}^T \textbf{v}\right)\; d\textbf{v} \\

\end{aligned}$$ In the second line I simply used substitution. My biggest problem seems to be that no matter how I try to integrate w.r.t $t$ first, I always get the factor $\textbf{g}^T\textbf{v}$ , which I would like to get rid of. UPDATE 3: I decided to post more information here from my book, maybe it can help: In order to evaluate $p(t)$ we shall make use of the Gaussian
  approximation for the posterior distribution of weights (weights of a
  neural network), together with the distribution of network outputs.
  This gives: $$p(t)\propto\int

  of $t$ . $y(\textbf{v})$ is a neural network function with network
  weights $\textbf{v}$ . In addition, we shall assume that the width of
  the posterior distribution (determined by the Hessian matrix $\textbf{A}$ of the error function) is sufficiently narrow that we may
  approximate the network function $y(\textbf{v})$ by its linear
  expansion around $\textbf{v}_{MP}$ $$y(\textbf{v}) = y(\textbf{v}_{MP}) + \textbf{g}^T\textbf{v},$$ where $\textbf{g} \equiv \nabla

The number of edges is then $|V|-m$ , where $|V|$ is the number of vertices and $m$ is the number of subtrees in the forest G. As far as I've read, we can then consider the number of edges in a fully connected graph, which is $|E|+\bar{|E|}=2|V|-2m$ and this is smaller or equals $2|V|-1$ . Now I'm not sure how to continue. In other proves I've seen that they say that a fully connected graph must have $\frac{|V|(|V|-1)}{2}$ edges and therefore one of the graphs must have a cycle. But I don't understand this conclusion as $2|V|-2m$ is smaller than $\frac{|V|(|V|-1)}{2}$ . So if we have less edges than a fully connected graph has, where should be the problem?

2961141,Fatou's Lemma proof from Royden 4th,"I'm having a hard time understanding the proof presented by Royden, Fitzpatrick in Real Analysis 4th edition. The proof is described as follows... Fatou's Lemma Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of nonnegative measurable functions on $E$ . \begin{equation}
\textit{If}~\{f_n\}\rightarrow f~\textit{pointwise a.e. on}~E,~\textit{then}~\int_E{f}\leq \liminf\int_E{f_n}.
\end{equation} Proof In view of addititivity over domains of integration , by possibly excising from $E$ a set of measure zero, we assume the pointwise convergence is on all of $E$ . The function $f$ is nonnegative and measurable since it is the pointwise limit of a sequence of such functions. To verify the inequality in Fatou's Lemma it is necessary and sufficient to show that if $h$ is any bounded measurable function of finite support for which $0\leq h \leq f$ on $E$ , then \begin{equation}
\int_E h \leq \liminf \int_E f_n.
\end{equation} Let $h$ be such a function. Choose $M\geq 0$ for which $\lvert h \rvert\leq M$ on $E$ . Define $E_0 = \left\{x \in E~\middle|~h(x)\neq 0 \right\}$ . Then $m(E_0) < \infty$ . Let $n$ be a natural number. Define a function $h_n$ on $E$ by \begin{equation}
h_n = \min\left\{h,f_n\right\}~\text{on}~E.
\end{equation} Observe that the function $h_n$ is measurable, that \begin{equation}
0\leq h_n \leq M~\text{on}~E_0~\text{and}~h_n \equiv 0~\text{on}~E\sim E_0.
\end{equation} Furthermore, for each $x$ in $E$ , since $h(x) \leq f(x)$ and $\left\{f_n(x)\right\} \rightarrow f(x)$ , $\left\{h_n(x)\right\} \rightarrow h(x)$ . We infer from the Bounded Convergence Theorem applied to the uniformly bounded sequence of restrictions to $h_n$ to the set of finite measure $E_0$ , and the vanishing of each $h_n$ on $E \sim E_0$ , that \begin{equation}
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int_E{h_n} = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int_{E_0}{h_n} = \int_{E_0}{h} = \int_{E}{h}.
\end{equation} However, for each $n$ , $h_n \leq f_n$ on $E$ and therefore, by the definition of the integral of $f_n$ over $E$ , $\int_E{h_n} \leq \int_E{f_n}$ . Thus, \begin{equation}
\int_E{h} = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int_{E}{h_n} \leq \liminf \int_E f_n.
\end{equation} So I understand everything up until the final conclusion. It seems that the conclusion I reach from the inequality $\int_E h_n \leq \int_E f_n$ is that \begin{equation}
    \int_E{h} = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int_{E}{h_n} \leq \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int_E f_n.

2961230,Empty relation on non-empty set - is it reflexive?,"I have here a relation defined by a conjunction of contradictory conditions, i.e. $R = \{ \langle x,y \rangle \in \mathbb N ^2  |  x = y^2 \land y = -x \}$ So, at least as I understand my undergrad course so far, this produces an empty relation, since there are no pairs of natural numbers such that one is the negative of the other. I can see why such a relation would be symmetrical and transitive, since both of these properties involve an implication. However, I am trying to determine if this relation is reflexive or irreflexive. My professor suggested that this would be computable for any relation, but in my mind, reflexivity is defined based on the presence of at least one element in the relation's domain. And if there are no elements in the relation, then how can they be in relation with themselves? Some help, any help, would be appreciated!! P.S. If anybody can recommend a modern manual for this subject, I'd really appreciate it. There is no recommended reading in this course, and the classes aren't very enlightening.

2961323,Asymptotic behavior of the Coulomb logarithm,"In transport theory in plasma physics, there's an important integral called the Coulomb logarithm, which relates to the scattering cross section off the Yukawa potential. It can be written as $$
\ell(\Lambda) = \int_0^\infty \cos^2\left(\int_0^{u^*}\left[1 - 2\frac{u}{\xi}\exp\left(-\frac{\xi}{\Lambda u}\right) - u^2\right]^{-1/2}du\right) \xi d\xi,
$$ where $u^*$ is the turning point--the positive solution to $1 - 2u/\xi\exp[-\xi/(\Lambda u)] - u^2=0.$ Now, for a plasma, we usually have $\Lambda \gg 1$ . So being the lazy mathematicians that we are, we instead use the Coulomb potential (the limit $\Lambda \rightarrow \infty$ ), which is exactly solvable but the $\xi$ integral diverges, then cut off the $\xi$ integral at $\Lambda$ and say ""close enough"". This gives $\ell(\Lambda)\approx \ln \Lambda$ . Calculating the above integral numerically indeed gives $\ell(\Lambda) \sim \ln \Lambda$ as $\Lambda\rightarrow\infty$ . But I'd like to be able to show this through analytically, and through a somewhat less handwave-y method. Unfortunately, I'm not really sure where to start--that integral is kind of a hot mess.

I believe I have a proof, but my proof relies on $G$ being Abelian.  In the context I encountered this, every group under consideration was Abelian, but this statement was given without specifying that either group was Abelian.  My question is whether the Abelian condition is necessary.  If not, can someone provide a proof of this more general fact, and if so, can someone provide a counter-example?  If I'm correct that $G$ being Abelian is necessary, then does anyone have a cleaner proof than the nastiness I've provided below? A quick sketch of my proof is included below.  Note that I'm a little loose with notation using $+$ for both the operations in $G$ and $H$ and I haven't written out all the details.  I hope this is still clear enough to get the idea: Consider the map $f :  H \oplus \ker \psi \rightarrow G$ defined by $f(\left<h, k\right>) = \phi(h) + k$ .  I claim $f$ is an isomorphism.  First, if $\left<h_1, k_1\right>$ and $\left< h_2, k_2 \right>$ are elements of $H \oplus \ker \psi$ , then $f(\left<h_1, k_1\right> + \left< h_2, k_2 \right>) = f(\left< h_1 + h_2, k_1 + k_2\right>) = \phi(h_1 + h_2) + k_1 + k_2 = \phi(h_1) + \phi(h_2) + k_1 + k_2$ .  If $G$ is Abelian, we can continue: $\phi(h_1) + \phi(h_2) + k_1 + k_2 = \phi(h_1) + k_1 + \phi(h_2) + k_2 = f(\left<h_1, k_1\right>) + f(\left<h_2, k_2\right>)$ , so $f$ is a homomorphism.  Further, $f$ is injective since $\phi(h) + k = 0$ implies $\phi(h) = -k$ , so $\psi(\phi(h)) = \psi(-k) = 0 = h$ using that $\psi \circ \phi = Id_{h}$ and $k \in \ker \psi$ .  Finally, $f$ is surjective by the First Isomorphism Theorem (without writing out the details, the FIT tells us that there is one-to-one correspondence between cosets of $\ker \psi$ and elements of $\psi(G) = H$ .  Using this we can show that $\phi(H)$ contains one representative from each coset of $\ker \psi$ in $G$ and the result follows).

p_{\gamma} (x) = \frac{1}{ \pi \gamma ( 1 + x^2 / \gamma^2 ) },
$$ then their arithmetic mean $ ( X + Y ) / 2 $ again follows the Cauchy distribution of scale $\gamma$ . This is a property of stable distribution and can be generalized to $n$ i.i.d. random variables. The converse is true if we are allowed to vary $n$ in the condition, as pointed out in this post , since Cauchy distribution is the unique strict stable distribution for index $ \alpha = 1 $ . I'm wondering whether the converse with only $ n = 2 $ is true. To be exact, let $\mathcal{P}$ be a probability distribution and $X$ , $Y$ i.i.d. random variable following $\mathcal{P}$ . We further assume the characteristic function of $\mathcal{P}$ to be symmetric, i.e. $ f (\xi) = f (-\xi) $ , in order to rule out non-strict stable distributions. (This means the principle value of expectation $ \mathop{\mathbb{E}} x $ vanishses.) Given $ ( X + Y ) / 2 $ again follows $\mathcal{P}$ , can we deduce that $\mathcal{P}$ is indeed the Cauchy distribution or a Dirac delta? What I have tried so far:
We have $ f (\xi) > 0 $ . Take $ g (\xi) = \log f (\xi) $ and the equation is $$
g (\xi) = 2 g \left( \frac{\xi}{2} \right).
$$ However, this equation is not sufficient to determine $f$ since it may not be smooth (the characteristic function of Cauchy distribution of scale $\gamma$ $$
f_{\gamma} (\xi) = \exp ( -\gamma |\xi| )
$$ is indeed not differentiable at the origin). The positive definiteness of $f$ may provide additional constraint but it is difficult to make use of.","['functional-equations', 'probability-theory', 'characteristic-functions']"

We show that $A \cap B^c$ and $\emptyset$ are both subsets of each other to prove equality. Note that $\emptyset \subseteq A \cap B^c$ is (vacously) true so now we have to show that $ A \cap B^c\subseteq \emptyset$ . Suppose that $x \in A \cap B^c$ . Then $x \in A$ and $x \in B^c \Leftrightarrow x \notin B$ . But this contradicts with the assumption $A\subseteq B$ since we have $x \in A \rightarrow x \in B$ false. Thus $x \notin A \cap B^c$ for all $x$ and it follows that $A \cap B^c \subseteq \emptyset $ as $x\in A \cap B^c \rightarrow x \in \emptyset$ is (vacously) true. Therefore, $A \cap B^c = \emptyset$ .

Thus our problem is to find period for $$f'(x)=\sqrt{a^2-f^2(x)}$$ If we derivative both side , we can get that $$f''(x)=-\frac{f'(x)f(x)}{\sqrt{a^2-f^2(x)}}=-f(x)$$ $$f'''(x)=-f'(x)$$ $$f^{(4)}(x)=-f''(x)=f(x)$$ $$f^{(5)}(x)=f'(x)$$ .

Apply derivative both side , so we can get that $$f''(x)=mP^{m-1}(f(x))P'(f(x))f'(x)$$ $$f''(x)=mP^{2m-1}(f(x))P'(f(x))=m (f'(x))^{(2m-1)/m}P'(f(x))$$ We can see that if $m=1/2$ then it simplifies to $$f''(x)=\frac{P'(f(x))}{2}$$ $$f'''(x)=f'(x)\frac{P''(f(x))}{2}$$ $$f^{(4)}(x)=\frac{P'(f(x))P''(f(x))}{4}+f'(x)^2\frac{P'''(f(x))}{2}$$ $$f^{(4)}(x)=\frac{P'(f(x))P''(f(x))}{4}+(P^{1/2}(f(x))^2\frac{P'''(f(x))}{2}$$ $$f^{(4)}(x)=\frac{P'(f(x))P''(f(x))}{4}+\frac{P(f(x))P'''(f(x))}{2}$$ But this approach does not help so much like my examples.

2961781,Using variation of parameters to solve $y''-25y=x$,"I keep trying to solve this but I end up needing to do integration by parts like 3 or 4 times. My only question is, is that going to be the only way to do this? If so it will literally take me hours. I don't need a solution, just a confirmation that if the requirement is to use variation of parameters, then will I need to take integrals that need to be done by IBP? Thank you and sorry if this is not a good question.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
2961783,Is a convex function always continuous?,"It is well known that a convex function defined on $\mathbb{R}$ is continuous (it is even left and right differentiable. We can define a convex function for any normed vector space $E$ : a function $f : E\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is said to be  convex iff $$f\big(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y\big) \le \lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda)f(y)$$ I know that such a function is not necessarily continuous if $E$ has infinite dimension: $f$ can be a discontinuous linear form. For instance, if $E = \ell^2(\mathbb{N})$ the space of square summable sequences (endowed with the supremum norm $||\cdot||_{\infty}$ instead of its natural norm), and $f(u) = \sum \limits_{i \ge 1} \frac{u_i}{i}$ , then $f$ is linear, thus convex, yet it is known that $f$ is not continuous. Now my question is: what about finite dimensions? Does there exist a convex function $f : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ which is not continuous? I know that there are discontinuous functions from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}$ that have derivatives in every direction (that's a good start since this is a necessary condition !) but I don't know any that is convex.","['convex-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"
2961855,Determine if this two-variable piecewise function is continuous,"I have this piecewise function and I have to determine if it is continuous in $(0,0)$ $$f(x)=\begin{cases}\dfrac{\sqrt[]{|x|}\sin^2y}{x^2+y^2}&\text{if }(x,y)\neq (0,0)\\0&\text{if }(x,y)=(0,0)\end{cases}$$ So I have to prove if $$\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\dfrac{\sqrt[]{|x|}\sin^2y}{x^2+y^2}=0$$ Thus I used polar coordinates and got $$\lim_{\rho\to0}\dfrac{\sqrt[]{\rho|\cos\theta|}\sin^2(\rho\sin\theta)}{\rho^2}$$ I know that $\cos x\leq1, \sin x\leq1$ , then $$\frac{\sqrt[]{\rho|\cos\theta|}\sin^2(\rho\sin\theta)}{\rho^2}<\frac{\sqrt\rho\sin^2\rho}{\rho^2}=g(\rho)$$ $$\lim_{\rho\to0}g(\rho)=0\implies \lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\dfrac{\sqrt[]{|x|}\sin^2y}{x^2+y^2}=0$$ However Wolfram Alpha says the limit does not exist. Why? I thought that this procedure of polar coordinates yields the final result. Could Wolfram Alpha also consider  complex $x,y$ ?","['limits', 'multivariable-calculus']"
2961866,"When are $a+b$ and $ab$ palindromic for integers $a,b$?","This question came up when I was discussing Ex 1.23 of An Introduction to Analytic Number Theory (Apostol) with a user. For positive integers $a,b$ , when are the values of $a+b$ and $ab$ palindromic? A simple example to demonstrate this is when $a=3$ and $b=24$ . The integers $27$ and $72$ are palindromic. Moreover, the pair $(2,2)$ is trivial. Is it possible to find all the solutions $(a,b)$ ? UPDATE: The case $a=2$ has now been proven by myself and @Holo. The only solutions are indeed $(2, 5\cdot10^k-3)$ for a non-negative integer $k$ . The case $a=3$ has also been shown that the only solution is $(3,24)$ . The following is a technical way to approach it for the general case. In general, if $a+b=c_{m-1}c_{m-2}\cdots c_1c_0$ has $m$ digits and $ab=c_0c_1\cdots c_{m-2}c_{m-1}$ has $n$ digits then $$a+b=\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}10^ic_i\quad\text{and}\quad ab=\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}10^ic_{m-i-1}$$ so we wish to solve the quadratic $$a^2-a\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}10^ic_i+\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}10^ic_{m-i-1}=0$$ or $$2a=\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}10^ic_i\pm\sqrt{\left(\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}10^ic_i\right)^2-4\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}10^ic_{m-i-1}}.$$ What is important about this is that we want $$\left(\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}10^ic_i\right)^2-4\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}10^ic_{m-i-1}=k^2\implies \left(\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}10^ic_i\right)^2-k^2=4\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}10^ic_{m-i-1}$$ for some integer $k$ , which kind of resembles this post .","['number-theory', 'palindrome', 'elementary-number-theory']"
