2143952,"What's about functions $f:[0,\infty)\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $\int_0^\infty f(x)(\log x)dx=1$?","I've deduced and I know how justify an example of a function $f:[0,\infty)\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $$\int_0^\infty f(x)\log xdx=1.$$ Now I state question, and after I write hints to get my example. Question. Imagine that a friend ask me about functions $$f:[0,\infty)\to\mathbb{R}$$ and its more relevant properties, that satisfy $$\int_0^\infty f(x)\log xdx=1.$$ Because it seems too broad, that is I believe that is difficut to determine all functions, impossible to state all relevant statements related to this kind of functions, I am asking here: What should be the first step/s to investigate this question, that is what are examples of functions that satisfies our condition, and what is the obvious property that satisfy as consequence of it? Many thanks. You are able to combine with techniques of real and complex analysis, integration methods ... to show me what should be the strategy and/or hints to study this problem. The example was to combine the closed-form for $\int_0^\infty\frac{\log x}{e^{nx}}dx$ , the Prime Number Theorem, and $(11)$ of this MathWorld's article for the Möbius function to deduce $$f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{e^{nx}}$$ is a function that satisfies it, because is a consequence of Fubini's theorem: $$\int_0^{\infty}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|f_n(x)\right|dx\leq\int_0^\infty\frac{x}{e^x-1}dx=\zeta(2)<\infty,$$ with $f_n(x)=\mu(n)\log(x)e^{-nx}$ .","['real-analysis', 'reference-request', 'complex-analysis', 'improper-integrals', 'integration']"
2143974,Evaluating limit $\lim_{k\to \infty}\prod_{r=1}^k\cos{\left(\frac {x}{2^r}\right)}$,"I stumbled across the following question which asked to evaluate... $$\lim_{k\to \infty}\prod_{r=1}^k\cos{\left(\frac {x}{2^r}\right)}$$
I at first tried writing few terms
$$\cos{\left(\frac {x}{2}\right)}\cos{\left(\frac {x}{4}\right)}\cos{\left(\frac {x}{8}\right)}...$$
I used the Half-angle formula to write$$\cos{\left(\frac {x}{2}\right)}=\pm\sqrt{\frac{1+\cos(x)}{2}}$$
Therefore,
$$\sqrt{\frac{1+\cos(x)}{2}}\sqrt{\frac{1+\sqrt{\frac{1+\cos(x)}{2}}}{2}}...$$ 
As there are infinitely many two's in the denominator, the denominator goes to $\infty$ which means $$\lim_{k\to \infty}\prod_{r=1}^k\cos{\left(\frac {x}{2^r}\right)}=0$$ So..My question is ...Am I correct?... If not, Could you please give me some hint to how should I proceed ?",['limits']
2144007,Continuity at a point in topological spaces [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Functions between topological spaces being continuous at a point? (1 answer) Closed 1 year ago . I was trying to prove the equivalence between the epsilon delta definition and open ball definition of continuity, and there have already been quite a few discussions such as here already. I realised that in proving that ""epsilon delta $\Rightarrow$ open ball"" we try to show that every point in the preimage of an open ball in the domain is an interior point, which requires the global $\epsilon-\delta$ continuity of a function. This seems to suggest to me that open ball continuity is stronger, as in these two examples: 1) $f(x) :=\begin{cases} 
      0 & x \text{ is rational}\\
      x & x\text{ is irrational} 
   \end{cases}$ Here f(x) is continuous only at $x = 0$. However, the preimage of any open ball containing zero is never open. 2) $ f(x):=\begin{cases} 
      1 & x<-1 \\
      0 & -1\leq x \leq 1 \\
      1 & x>1 
   \end{cases}
$ Here $f(x)$ is continuous at zero, yet there exist an open ball $(-1/2,1/2)$ whose preimage is not open. If continuity on functions only 'makes sense' for global continuity, why do we then still talk about continuity at a point in a topological space (i.e. a function is continuous at $x$ if every neighbourhood of $x$ pulls back to open sets) ?","['general-topology', 'analysis']"
2144022,Homogeneity or heterogeneity of variance,"The international comparative school performance study PIRLS raised in 2011 the reading competences of the fourth graders in more than $40$ countries, among others in Germany. They would now like to investigate how the cultural capital of the parents affects the reading competencies of the children in the fourth class.
They operationalize the cultural capital as the volume of the books in the parents' house. They want to find out if there is a significant difference between children whose parents have over $100$ books, and children whose parents have a maximum of one hundred books. A table of statistic is given: where Mittelwert=mean value, Standardabweichung=standard deviation, Standardfehler des Mittelswertes=standard error of mean value. We have to compute a T-Test to find out, if we can confirm out hypothesis and to get a statistic significant relation. 
First we have to prove with a F-Test, if we have to apply a double T-Test  or a Test of Welch. 
At the F-Test and the T-Test we have a significance level of $5 \%$. $$$$ How can we check what T-Test we have to apply? The null hypothesis is that when the parents have more than $100$ books then the children are better in reading than others, or not? Do we get from that that we don't need a double T-Test? Also using the F-Test how can we check if there is an homogeneity or a heterogeneity of variance? Do  we have to use this formula ?","['statistics', 'variance', 'hypothesis-testing']"

My question is more so how would I set up a linear system of equations for the question at hand? I could throw in several more vectors and multiply them all by $0$ as well to have $\langle 0,7,3 \rangle$ in a variety of cones, but that is rather trivial (just multiplying other vectors by $0$). How would I set up the original question here as an augmented matrix so I could row reduce it effectively?

2144165,Why do you have to define that a specific value in a function is undefined?,"While teaching us about limits, my math teacher showed us how to define a function with a ""hole"" in it: $$f(x)=\begin{cases}x^2, & x \neq 2 \\ \text{undefined}, & x=2\end{cases}$$ This is really confusing me, why do I have to define that a value is undefined? I asked her, and her reasoning is that if you don't write that for $x=2$ there is no value, then it could be any value possible, like $7$ or $42$ as the function has only be written partially. She added that it is only I who thinks that it is undefined, for everyone else, it could be anything, and thus, I have to explicitly write that the function has no value for $2$, or else it wouldn't be mathematically correct. I don't understand the reasoning for the following reason: If I write $$f(x)=x^2, \text{ for } x\neq 2$$ then the function is already undefined for the value is $2$, as the function has no formula if $x=2$. And thus, the value is undefined, I don't have to write it again that it is in fact undefined. After a while, she dismissed me by saying that it is only a formality, and as a result not important. But I really want to know, so where is my flaw? Or rather, why do I have specify that the function is undefined for $2$ explicitly?",['functions']
2144324,"New, elegant proofs for $\varphi(p^{k})=p^{k}-p^{k-1}$","Are there any short, elegant proofs known for the identity $\varphi(p^{k})=p^{k}-p^{k-1}$
? (Here $\varphi$ is Euler's totient function and $p$ is a prime.) The standard combinatorial proof goes like this: In the set $\left\{ 1,2\ldots,p^{k}\right\} $ there in total $p^{k}$
  number. Split this set into $p$ subsets $\left\{ 1,\ldots,p\right\} $,
  $\left\{ p+1,\ldots,2p\right\} \ldots$ Then in each of these sets
  there is only one number -- namely the one of the form $m\cdot p$ for
  some suitable $m$, that divides $p^{k}$. There are in total
  $\frac{p^{k}}{p}=p^{k-1}$ such sets, so in total $p^{k-1}$-many number from
  $\left\{ 1,2\ldots,p^{k}\right\} $ divide $p^{k}$. Thus
  $(p^{k}-p^{k-1})$-many numbers are coprime to $p^k$, which proves the identity. $\square$ (A different proof that is often encountered assumes that we know that
 $\varphi(n)=n\prod_{p\mid n}(1-\frac{1}{p})$, from which our identity
 follows immediately.
 But this is actually a longer proof, since proving
the auxiliary identity is longer.) Surprisingly, I would have imagined that there are tons of wildly different proofs of such a basic fact out there, but a preliminary internet seach as well as book skimming returned only (minor variations of) these two proofs. EDIT The present proofs are more or less reformulations (very polished with details hidden as good as possible - but still reformulations) of my first proofs.

I was wondering if there's more to it than just inverting the $=$ sign, and perhaps you'd distribute the negation like $$\neg 0 \neq \neg1$$ but logically that doesn't make sense to me.

My answer is : (1) red and blue colored eggs are in the first box, and (2) red and green colored eggs are in the second box, and (3) blue and green colored eggs are in the third box. So we have $3$ boxes. Any one or two of these  boxes can be empty, because we can put all eggs in one box (that is color every egg with same combination of colors, so all are in one box). Boxes are labeled and objects (eggs) are not. So the answer is $$n+k-1 \choose k-1  $$ so $$ 15 + 3 -1 \choose 15-1$$

The angles $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ and $\delta=2\pi-\alpha-\beta-\gamma$ completely define such a hexahedron (up to scale). Since the hexahedron is convex, we can get that $\alpha < \frac{2\pi}{3}$.

Then the only way Adam can win is if the head appears at an ""odd"" trial ($2n-1$). For the head to occur at the $2n - 1$ trial the first $(2n-1) - 1$ tosses must be equal to tails, so I expressed this as $$p\sum_{n=1}^\infty (1-p)^{2n - 2}$$ I then realized that this is a geometric series, which converges to the following value

$$a_{1}x^{3} + a_{2}\sin(x) + a_{3}\cos(x) = 0. $$
So, we'll do this in 3 cases: Case 1: $x = 0$ In this case, $x^{3} = 0$, $\sin(x) = 0$ but $\cos(x) = 1$.
So, we have 
$$0\times a_{1} + 0\times a_{2} + 1\times a_{3} = 0.$$
So, $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ could be anything but $a_{3}$ must be 0. Case 2: $x \in (0,1)$ In this case, $x^{3} \neq 0$, $\sin(x) \neq 0$ and $\cos(x) \neq 0$.
So, for this to be true, $a_{1}$, $a_{2}$ and $a_{3}$ all must be $0$. Case 3: $x = 1$ In this case, $x^{3} = 1$, $\sin(x) = .8...$ and $\cos(x) = .5...$.
So, we have 
$$1\times a_{1} +.8\times a_{2} + .5\times a_{3} = 0.$$ So, $a_{3}$ could be any value, while $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ must be $0$. So, if $a_{1} \neq 0$ then we have a problem in Case 3. If $a_{2} \neq 0$ we have a problem in Case 3. If $a_{3} \neq 0$ we have a problem in Case 1. So, we know that all of the $a$ values must be $0$ and we complete the proof.","['abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'proof-verification']"

2145255,"What is the affine connection, and what is the intuition behind/for affine connection?","Here is the definition of affine connection, as appears in Milnor's book Morse Theory . DEFINITION. An affine connection at a point $p \in \text{M}$ is a function which assigns to each tangent vector $\text{X}_p \in \text{TM}_p$ and to each vector field $\text{Y}$ a new tangent vector $$\text{X}_p \vdash \text{Y} \in \text{TM}_p$$ called the covariant derivative of $\text{Y}$ in the direction $\text{X}_p$ . (Note that our $\text{X} \vdash \text{Y}$ coincides with Nomizu's $\nabla_\text{X} \text{Y}$ . The notation is intended to suggest that the differential operator $\text{X}$ acts on the vector field $\text{Y}$ .) This is required to be bilinear as a function of $\text{X}_p$ and $\text{Y}$ . Furthermore, if $$f: \text{M} \to \mathbb{R}$$ is a real valued function, and if $f\text{Y}$ denotes the vector field $$(f\text{Y})_q = f(q)\text{Y}_q$$ then $\vdash$ is required to satisfy the identity $$\text{X}_p \vdash (f\text{Y}) = (\text{X}_p f)\text{Y}_p + f(p) \text{X}_p \vdash \text{Y}.$$ (As usual, $\text{X}_p$ denotes the directional derivative of $f$ in the direction of $\text{X}_p$ .) I have two questions. This definition of affine connection is quite terse here—I'm just seeing text on a page and not really understanding what is going on here. Is it possible somebody could help me parse through/explain what is really being said here with regards to affine connection? Could somebody supply their intuitions behind/for affine connections?

2145924,A curious sequence (Ascending and descending a staircase),"The following story is true, not just to make it sound mysterious or coincidental. I found a very curious sequence of integers, and searching it gave no result. I am trying to learn more about it, just for fun. We were taking a break with two friends, and came up with the following game in the staircase: Assume there are $n$ stairs (so $n+1$ places to stand); Starting from the bottom, go up 1 stair at a time, until you reach the top; Then turn around and go down 2 stairs at a time, until you can't go further; Then turn around and go up 3 stairs at a time, until you can't go further; .. Then 4, 5, 6, etc. stairs at a time, until you can't even make one step. Whatever the step size is when you stop (the one you cannot achieve), is characteristic of the number of stairs in the staircase, and we call it the Mona number (after my friend Mona). For Example: For $n=5$ we go up to the top, then down in sets of $2$ until we reach $1$, then up $3$ to $4$, then down $4$ to $0$, then up $5$ to $5$, and then we are stuck because there aren't $6$ stairs to go down from our current position. Therefore $M(5)=6$. From there, we wondered if we could find a formula for that number. Obviously it has to be at least 2 (going up the stairs one stair at a time should always be possible), but it is not monotonic with the number of stairs. The ""mirroring"" operation of ""turning around"" makes it quite difficult; in particular the system clearly has a memory, but the state of that memory does not only depend on the previous step size. So instead, we wrote a program for it (Matlab code): function k = mona(n)

    assert( n >= 1 );    
    h = n;
    k = 2;

    while h >= k
        h = mod(h,k);
        h = n-h;
        k = k+1;
    end

end where n is the number of stairs, k is the step size, and h is the ""horizon"" -- aka the number of stairs remaining until the end of the staircase for a given step size. Plotting it for the first 1000 integers looks like this: I have thought about it for a while, but it is much more complicated to analyse than it seems, and the analytic formulation of the sequence is ugly so I'm not sure it can help. I would be curious to know whether this relates to any known integer process? And if not, whether you have a clever idea of how to analyse the Mona sequence? About the envelope As can be seen on the plot, there seems to be a bounding cone to the progression of this sequence. This ""envelope"" corresponds to the following cases (found programmatically): \begin{align}

See Main Edit 1&2 for clarification on why it is in this form The following steps are INCORRECT, as this is not how the chain rule works. But there is something in my head grinding such that I feel that it can be solved in a way invoking the chain rule but I can't get my thoughts wrapped around it properly. ( I have left this part in 'prime' notation because this displays my erroneous thought process of misunderstanding differentials which probably led me to the wrong answer. ) $$ 2u\, f'(u) = \left(u'\right)^2 +\frac{u^2}{\left(u'\right)^2}$$ Clearly $ f'(u^2) \ne 2u\, f'(u)$ , however continuing with this incorrect thought.. $$ f'(u) = \frac{1}{2} \left[\frac{\left(u'\right)^2}{u}+\frac{u}{u'}\right]$$ $$ f(u) = \int\frac{1}{2} \left[\frac{\left(u'\right)^2}{u}+\frac{u}{u'}\right] $$ Is there anyway I can actually correctly use the chain rule starting from $(*)$ to reach this point and then integrate, or solve it through some method for differential equations? I've never experienced a question with the square of a derivative so I was wondering if someone could give me insight on this. Main Edit 1: As @JJacquelin noted, the notation with 'prime' causes quite problem with what the question being asked is: Using the fact that $u = \sin x\,\, \text{is a function of}\, x$ The line: $$ f'(u^2) = \left(\frac{du}{dx}\right)^2 + \frac{u^2}{\left(\frac{du}{dx}\right)^2} \qquad$$ can be written as such: $$ \frac{df(u^2)}{d(u^2)} = \left(\frac{du}{dx}\right)^2 + \frac{u^2}{\left(\frac{du}{dx}\right)^2} \quad ,u = u(x) \qquad(*)$$ And as so, I have replaced all appropriate parts of this post with Leibniz notation to suggest clarity. Now can I find an $f(x)$ which satisfies this equation? I have left my previous work as is, so that I may reference it one day in case I come across a problem of pinpointing what my prime notation means. Please do let me know if there are any further clarifications that need to be made before this can be solved properly. Edit 2: Proof of why [ incorrectly ] believed it is $\frac{d}{dx}$ : Thank you to @JJacquelin once again for helping me clarify the differentials in the question. I have edited the general question with reflection to their analysis, and hope to recieve the answer I was looking for now that the notion of differentials is cleared up. I was incorrect in my reasoning before and it is actually $\frac{df(X)}{dX}$ for any dummy variable $X$ , contrary to what I had thought as you can see below.: If we start from the solution of Part 1: $$f(x) = -\frac{1}{2}x^2-\ln|1-x|$$ $$\frac{df(x)}{dx} = -x+\frac{1}{1-x}$$ $$\frac{df(x)}{dx} = -x+\frac{1-x+x}{1-x}$$ $$\frac{df(x)}{dx} = -x+\frac{1-x}{1-x}+\frac{x}{1-x}$$ $$\frac{df(x)}{dx} = -x + 1 + \frac{x}{1-x}$$ $$\frac{df(x)}{dx} = 1 - x +\frac{x}{1-x}$$ Now $x \mapsto \sin^2x$ : $$\frac{df(\sin^2x)}{dx} = 1 -\sin^2x+\frac{\sin^2x}{1-\sin^2x}$$ $$\frac{df(\sin^2x)}{dx} = \cos^2x + \tan^2x$$ But this turns out to be wrong, when $x\mapsto \sin^2 x$ it becomes : $$\frac{df(\sin^2x)}{d(\sin^2x)} = \cos^2x + \tan^2x$$ $$f'(\sin^2x)=\cos^2x + \tan^2x$$ Which is what we started with. Now I am beginning to doubt my self, because I am not sure if the $dx$ changes to $d(\sin^2x)$ when $x\mapsto\sin^2x$ . I would appreciate it if someone could help me realize which one it is, because then I can't begin to even grasp the main question without formulating the correct statement. Thank you for @JJacquelin clearing this up . Remarks :
On another note, I looked back to some of my differential work from university and came across a homework problem we proved which shows that: $$\frac{d^2x}{dy^2}= -\frac{\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}}{\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^3}$$ Which leads me to wonder, can the terms $\left(\frac{du}{dx}\right)^2$ be transformed into some $n$ -th derivative? More generally, are there possible transformations to convert powers of derivatives to $n$ -th derivatives in order to simplify this problem into a differential equation which can be solved using usual methods? Also something @JJacquelin helped me realize about use of the chain rule, which may be of some help to progress: $$\frac{df(u^2)}{d(u^2)}= \frac{df(u^2)}{2udu}$$ which may simplify the original question to: $$\frac{df(u^2)}{du} = 2u\left[\left(\frac{du}{dx}\right)^2 + \frac{u^2}{\left(\frac{du}{dx}\right)^2}\right] \quad ,u = u(x) \qquad (**)$$ These two identities might be of some help...possibly.","['derivatives', 'integration', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus']"

Chapter 5 of Commutative Algebra: with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry by Eisenbud.
To paraphrase, if $X$ is an affine variety, set $A(X) = A/I$ to be its coordinate ring and $I$ its defining ideal. Recall that the tangent cone at $p$, denoted by $TC_p(X)$ is an algebraic set that is given by the zero set of the initial ideal, $Z(\text{in}(I))$, where $\text{in}(I) = ( \text{in}(f) \, | \, f \in I)$, and $\text{in}(f)$ is the first non-zero homogeneous component of $f$. Geometrically, this is the cone composed of limiting positions of secants to $X$ passing through $p$. Now if $m_p$ is the maximal ideal in $A(X)$ corresponding to the point $p$, Eisenbud's claim is that $$\text{gr}_{m_p} A(X) = \bigoplus_{i=0}^{\infty} m_p^i / m_p^{i+1}$$ is isomorphic to the coordinate ring of the tangent cone at $p$. It is clear to me that $\text{gr}_{m_p} A(X)$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra, and if $a_i$ are the generators of $m_p$, then $\xi_i = a_i \text{ mod } m_p^2$ generate $\text{gr}_{m_p} A(X)$. However I'm struggling to show that the kernel of this (homogeneous of degree zero) homomorphism, which sends $a_i$ to $\xi_i$ is given by $\text{in}(I)$.","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

where $v_{n+1}$ is the last coordinate of $v$ in $(v,w)$ . Then I am supposed to prove that $$S_{+} \approx S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^{n-1}$$ where $S_{\text{north}}^+ = \{v \in S^n \mid v_{n+1} \ge 0 \}$ . However, doing so has been driving me absolutely crazy . When examining the fiber bundle $p:T \rightarrow S^n$ s.t. $p(x,w) = x$ , I know we have the local trivializations $$h_x: p^{-1}(U_x) \rightarrow U_x \times p^{-1}(x) \approx U_x \times S^{n-1}$$ where $U_x$ is the open hemisphere of $S^n$ that contains $x$ and is bounded by the tangent ""plane"" $P_x$ to $S^n$ at $x$ translated to intersect the origin of $R^{n+1}.$ In particular, $h_x(v,w) = (v, \pi_x(w))$ where $\pi_x$ is the projection onto $P_x$ . This almost seems to work since local trivializations are isomorphisms. So by picking $x$ to be $e_1$ , $P_x$ is the subspace $\{(v_1,...,v_n,0) \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}\}$ and so $U_x$ is $\{v \in S^n \mid v_{n+1} > 0 \}$ , which is close to $S_{\text{north}}^+$ but doesn't allow $v_{n+1} = 0$ . Similarly, $p^{-1}(U_x) = \{(v,w) \in T \mid v_{n+1} > 0\}$ which is almost $S_+$ except for it excludes the case $v_{n+1} = 0$ . Trying to just add on these points doesn't work since $h_x$ is not injective when $v_{n+1} = 0$ (or involves the projection of a vector being zero). How could I show $S_{+} \approx S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^{n-1}$ ? I don't even feel that this statement is true. UPDATE: (2/23) With help from the answer provided & comments, here is what I have (using the idea that a fiber bundle with contractible base is trivial). Method (1): Define $U_+ = S^n \setminus \{-e_1\}$ and $U_- = S^n \setminus \{e_1\}$ so that $S^n = U_+ \cup U_-$ with $U_+, U_-$ open and contractible. Let $\tilde{T} = \{(v,w) \in U_+ \times S^n \mid v \cdot w = 0\},$ meaning (given the definitions in the problem statement) that $$ S_+ \subseteq \tilde{T} \subseteq T.$$ Let $p: \tilde{T} \rightarrow U_+$ be a fiber bundle. (We know at least one such fiber bundle exists since there is the trivial bundle sending $(v,w) \mapsto v$ ). Since $U_+$ is contractible , this fiber bundle is trivial; that is, $\tilde{T} \approx U_+ \times F$ where $F$ is the fiber. Specifically, for $v$ fixed $$F = p^{-1}(v) = \{(v,w) \mid v\cdot w = 0\} \approx \{v\} \times S^{n-1} \approx S^{n-1}.$$ So $\tilde{T} \cong U_+ \times S^{n-1}.$ Since restrictions of homeomorphisms are still homeomorphisms, we can restrict this homeomorphism to the closed subspace $S_{\text{north}}^+$ of $U_+$ , so $$ S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^{n-1} \approx \{(v,w) \in S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^n \mid v \cdot w = 0\} = \{(v,w) \in S^n \times S^n \mid v \cdot w = 0, v_{n+1} \ge 0\} = S_+$$ by definition of hemisphere $S_{\text{north}}^+$ Thus, we have shown that $S_{+} \approxeq S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^{n-1}.$ Is this argument correct? Is there some technical point I am missing? Method (2): (This uses the stereographic projection suggestion.) Let $p: S(S^n \setminus \{x\}) \rightarrow S^n \setminus \{x\}$ be the unit sphere bundle of $S^n \setminus \{x\}$ . Using the diffeomorphism $\Pi_x: S^n \setminus \{x\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ , we then have $$S(S^n \setminus \{x\}) \overset{p}\rightarrow S^n \setminus \{x\} \overset{\Pi_x}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$$ is also a fiber bundle since $\Pi_x$ is a diffeomorphism. Since $\mathbb{R}^n$ is contractile, the bundle is trivial. Thus, $S(S^n \setminus \{x\}) \approx \mathbb{R}^n \times F$ where $F$ is $p^{-1}(\Pi_x^{-1}(v)) = S^{n-1}$ for any $v \in \mathbb{R}^n.$ So $$S(S^n \setminus \{x\}) \approx \mathbb{R}^n \times S^{n-1}$$ and by restricting $S^n \setminus \{x\}$ to its closed subspace $S_{\text{north}}^+$ (choosing $x \not \in S_{\text{north}}^+$ ), we have the homeomorphism $$S(S^+) \approx  S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^{n-1}.$$ However, $S(S^+) = S_+$ ( right? ) so $S_+ \approx S_{\text{north}}^+ \times S^{n-1}.$ Are there any technical points or general ideas that are wrong here?

          \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}e^{\pi i n^2 \tau}e^{2\pi i n z}.
\end{align}
We can also write it as
\begin{align}
          \Theta(z|\tau)=
          \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}q^{n^2}\eta^n,
        \end{align}
where $\eta=e^{2\pi i z}$ and $q=e^{2\pi i \tau}.$ In wiki, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan_theta_function ,
he says ""…… the Ramanujan theta function generalizes the form of the Jacobi theta functions……"". I cannot understand why it can be regarded as a generalization.
In my opinion，
Jacobi triple product have the following two expression
\begin{align}
\Theta(z|\tau)=\prod_{m=1}^{\infty}(1-e^{2\pi m i\tau})\left[1+e^{(2m-1)\pi i \tau+2\pi i z}\right]\left[1+e^{(2m-1)\pi i \tau-2\pi i z}\right].

we have
\begin{align}
          f(a,b)=(-a;ab)_\infty(-b;ab)(ab;ab)_\infty.

I still don't know what's the relation between the two kinds of ""Theta function"".

[duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Order of cyclic subgroup equal to order of generator (1 answer) Closed 2 years ago . Let $G$ be a group and $g \in G$. Define $\langle g\rangle$ to be the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $g$. Define $o(g)$ to the the order of the element $g$. That is the smallest natural number $d$ such that $a^d=1$ the identity. Is it true for all groups that $o(g)|G$? I know by Lagrange's theorem we get $\langle g \rangle$|G so if we can show that  $o(g)=\langle g \rangle$ then we are done but I don't know how to show this. Is it just because $\langle g \rangle=\{g^0,g^1,...,g^{d-1}\}$? Thanks.",['group-theory']
