994884,Is the limit of a sequence of random variables unique?,"If $Y$ and $Z$ are two distinct random variables with the same distribution (for example maybe $Y$ is constant equal to $1$ and $Z$ is equal to $1$ almost everywhere), then surely any sequence $X_n$ which converges in distribution to $Y$ also converges to $Z$. This seems to conflict with the fact that convergence in distribution is metrizable, and therefore limits should be unique. What about convergence in probability, or almost sure convergence?","['probability-theory', 'convergence-divergence']"

Then let $B>A>0$.  The question is to prove the following identity for a integration over a $p$ dimensional  simplex.
\begin{eqnarray}
&&J^{(A,B)}_{\vec{q},p} := \int\limits_{A\le \xi_0 \le \xi_ \le \cdots \le \xi_{p-1} \le B} 
\prod\limits_{j=0}^p \left(\xi_{j-1} - \xi_j\right)^{q_j} \cdot 
\prod\limits_{j=0}^{p-1} \frac{d \xi_j}{\xi_j^{q_{j+1} 2 \beta}}=\\
&&
(-1)^{Q_P} A^{q_0} \cdot
\sum\limits_{m=0}^p \sum\limits_{l=0}^{q_m}  \frac{(-1)^{l+q_m} \binom{q_m}{l} }{ \prod\limits_{\stackrel{\eta=0}{\eta\neq m}}^p\left[(q_\eta+1) \binom{l+\eta-m-(1-2\beta)(Q_m-Q_\eta)}{q_\eta+1}\right]} \cdot
A^{(1-2\beta)(Q_m-Q_0)+m-l} B^{(1-2\beta)(Q_p-Q_m)+p-m+l}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\xi_{-1}=A$ and $\xi_{p}=B$ and $Q_j := q_0+q_1+\cdots+q_j$. 
The number of terms on the right hand side equals $q_0+q_1+\cdots+q_p+(p+1)$. Note 1: In the case $q_0=q_1=\cdots=q_p=q$  and $\beta :> \beta/q$ we retrieve the result given in Another mutivariable integral over a simplex . Note 2: Setting $\beta = 0$ we get 
\begin{equation}
rhs = -\left(A-B\right)^{p + \sum\limits_{\eta=0}^p q_\eta} \cdot
\frac{\prod\limits_{\eta=0}^p q_\eta!}{\left(p + \sum\limits_{\eta=0}^p q_\eta\right)!}
\end{equation}
as it should be. We also provide a similar integral below where the values of exponents in the denominator are all arbitrary. Let $(q_1,\cdots,q_{p+1})$ be positive integers and let $(\beta_1,\cdots,\beta_p)$ be positive reals numbers. Then we have:
\begin{eqnarray}
&&I^{(A,B)}_{\vec{q},p} := \int\limits_{A\le \xi_0 \le \xi_ \le \cdots \le \xi_{p-1} \le B} 
\prod\limits_{j=0}^p \left(\xi_{j-1} - \xi_j\right)^{q_{j+1}} \cdot

}
 A^{Q_m-B_{m-1}+m-1-l} B^{Q_{p+1}-Q_m-B_p+ B_{m-1}+p-m+1+l} 
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\xi_{-1}=A$ and $\xi_{p}=B$ and $Q_j := q_1+q_2+\cdots+q_j$ and $B_j := \beta_1+\beta_2+\cdots+\beta_j$.
Now we check particular cases of the formula above. Note 1: Let $q_1=q_2=\cdots=q_{p+1}=0$ and $\beta_j = \beta$ for $j=1,\cdots,p$. Then:
\begin{equation}
rhs = \frac{\left(A^{1-\beta} - B^{1-\beta}\right)^p}{p! (-1+\beta)^p}
\end{equation}
as it should be. Note 2: Now, let $q_1=q_2=\cdots=q_{p+1}=0$ and all the beta values be arbitrary. Then:
\begin{equation}
rhs = \sum\limits_{m=0}^p
\frac{(-1)^m  A^{-B_m+m} B^{-(B_p-B_m)+p-m} }{\prod\limits_{j=1}^m (j+ B_{m-j}-B_m) \prod\limits_{j=1}^{p-m}(j+B_m - B_{m+j})}
\end{equation} Note 3: Finally, let  $q_1=q_2=\cdots=q_{p+1}=1$ and all the beta values be arbitrary. Then we have:
\begin{eqnarray}
rhs = (-1)^{p+1}\sum\limits_{l=0}^1 (-1)^{l+1}
\sum\limits_{m=0}^p 
\frac{ A^{-B_m+2 m + 1-l} B^{-(B_p-B_m)+2(p-m)+l} }{\prod\limits_{j=1}^m (2j - l + B_{m-j}-B_m)_{(2)} \prod\limits_{j=1}^{p-m}(2j + l +B_m - B_{m+j})_{(2)}}

Now I visualise this as taking two copies of the complex plane both with a slit in them (negative real axis say) and then I put them on top of each other, flip the top one and then sort of join them up along the slit and that's fine and I can see that that will form some surface where the local coordinates are given by projection onto the z or w axis.

My difficulty is when I think of the analogous situation with say $\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : y^2 = x\}$ this ""surface"" is just a line and I can see how given a point on this ""line"" we have an associated pair $(x,y)$.

995589,A conjecture concerning primes and algebra,"A monoid morphism $\psi:\mathbb Z_+\!\!\rightarrow\mathbb Z_+$ is defined by an arbitrary function $f:\mathbb Z_+\!\!\rightarrow\mathbb Z_+$ and defines a group homomorphism $\varphi:\mathbb Q_+\!\!\rightarrow\mathbb Q_+$: $\psi(a\cdot b)=\psi(a)\cdot\psi(b)\Rightarrow\psi(\prod p_i^{n_i})=\prod\psi(p_i)^{n_i}$, so any function $i\mapsto \psi(p_i)$ defines $\psi$. Further, since 
$\varphi(\frac{1}{n})=\frac{1}{\varphi(n)}$ a function $f$ uniquely defines the group homomorphism $\varphi$. For fun I intend to study the group homomorphism generated by the identity function 
$i\mapsto\omega(p_i)=i$. Then $\omega:\mathbb Z_+\!\!\rightarrow\mathbb Z_+$ seems to be an algebraic analogue to the analytic approach with $\pi(N)$ since also $\omega$ is a left inverse to the prime number function $p_n$. In the diagram $\omega$ is the blue curve and $\pi$ the red and one can see (especially if the picture is loaded and viewed in a larger scale) that $\omega(1)>\pi(1),\; \omega(35)>\pi(35)$ and $\omega(49)>\pi(49)$. Of course $\omega$ and $\pi$ coincide for all primes, but also for other values as $91,\;95$ and $133$. However, I have tested all values less than $2^{16}$ and $\omega(N)\leq\pi(N)$ for $N>49$ in this interval. I have no idea how to prove the conjecture (if possible) but I will try to construct a program that (in principle) can test any interval of integers. Edit: I realize now that it is virtually impossible to make such a program, but with help of arrays of primes my program have tested all values $< 1\,000\,000$ and the only numbers for which $\omega(N)\geq\pi(N)$ (italic numbers stands for '$>$') are: $\mathit{1},\,9,\,15,\,21,\,25,\,\mathit{35},\,39,\,\mathit{49},\,57,\,65,\,91,\,95,\,133$. Conjecture: For $N=\prod p_k^{n_k}>49$ it holds that $\prod k^{n_k}\leq\pi(N)$.

Show that these
sheaves can be glued together into a sheaf $\mathscr F$ on $X$ (unique up to unique isomorphism), such that $\mathscr F|_{U_i} \cong \mathscr F_i$ , and the isomorphisms over $U_i \cap U_j$ are the obvious ones. The set of all open sets contained in $U_i$ for all $i \in I$ , i.e., $\mathcal B=\{B \subset U_i\mid B \text{ is open}\}$ , gives me a base for the topology on $X$ .

F(V) = F_i(V).

996013,What is the correct statistical language to conclude using type II error?,"Update: This question arises when I read a neuroscience paper. In the natural science community, people are generally less careful about the correctness of statistical language. I am clearly aware of the definitions of Type I error and Type II error. In statistics classes, we were taught that we should say either ""reject the null"" or ""fail to reject the null"" at a given significance level regarding Type I error rate. But we were rarely taught about the language used to describe Type II error. The author hypothesized that two samples are from the same distribution. The statistical test was performed using the following hypotheses. The null hypothesis: the two samples are from the same distribution. The alternative hypothesis: the two samples are from different distributions. The author got a p-value=0.83. Here the p-value is the same as the type I error rate. At significance level=0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is, there is 83% chance that they are from different distributions when we say they are not. When the neuroscientists see something like this, they are more or less convinced that the two samples are from the same distribution. Of course, as a mathematician, this is far from rigorous. I am wondering if calculating the Type II error will strengthen the argument.  If my type II error rate is very small, say 0.03. What would be the correct statistical language to draw conclusion? Basically, I want to know the implication of the null/alternative given a high type I error and a low type II error and the rigorous statistical language to describe it .","['statistics', 'hypothesis-testing']"

Indeed, if the domain $A$ is compact set, then the $\cal F$ is uniformly equicontinuous. But I'm not sure if the compactness assumption drops. Here is my thinking about constructing a counterexample: (but not sure...) Suppose $A:=(0,1]$, I want to say $\cal F$ is NOT uniformly equicontinuous; i.e., there exists $\varepsilon>0$ s.t. $\forall \delta>0$, there exists $x,y \in A$, $f \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $|x-y| < \delta$ but $|f(x) - f(y)| \ge \varepsilon$ Take $\varepsilon=1$, and choose $x=1/n, y=2/n$ (then $x,y \in A$); define a function $f_n(x):= 2n x$ ($f_n \in \mathcal{F} \subset C(A)$ ), then I have

$$ E[B_t B_s] = \min\{s,t \}, $$
which can be expanded as $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \lambda_k \phi_k(s) \phi_k(t)$ where the $\lambda_k = \pi^2 (k - 1/2)^2$ are eigenvalues corresponding to $\phi_k (t) = \sqrt{2} \sin(\pi(k - 1/2)t)$.  From this one may show that 
$$B_t = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \xi_k \lambda_k^{-1/2} \phi_k(t)$$
where $\xi_k$ are independent standard normal variables, and $t$ is between $0$ and $1$. For functions on $[0,1]$, many alternatives to Fourier expansions have been put forward, often with higher order of convergence.  A key example is the Lanczos representation of $f(x)$, given by 
$$ f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{p-1} [f^{(k)}(1) - f^{(k)}(0)]{B_{k+1}(x)\over k!} + \int_0^1 f(t) dt + 2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} [c_k(\cos(2\pi kx) + s_k\sin(2\pi kx)] $$

The convergence here is of order $\lambda_k^p$, but the higher convergence rate is gained at the cost of calculating the relevant Bernoulli polynomials up to order $p+1$.  An obvious question is whether a similar expansion is possible for the expansion of a random function, such as the Brownian motion $B_t$.

996561,Deriving the analytical properties of the logarithm from an algebraic definition.,"Definition: The base $a$ logarithm ($a\in]0,1[\cup]1,+\infty[$) is the continuous function defined by: $\log_a(xy)=\log_a(x)+\log_a(y)~~\forall x,y>0$ and $\log_a(a)=1$ If I used this definition of the logarithm how can deduce the derivative of $\log_a(x)$ and $\lim\limits_{x\to +\infty} \log_a(x)$? Is the continuity necessary in the definition or should I replace it with another property (weaker or stronger) like uniform continuity, differentiability, Holder-continuity, etc.","['logarithms', 'real-analysis', 'definition']"
996580,How to prove $\sum_{k=1}^{N} \frac{\sin n\theta}{2^N}=\frac{2^{N+1}\sin \theta + \sin N\theta -2\sin(N+1)\theta}{2^N(5-4\cos \theta)}$,"Prove This using De Moivre Theorem $$\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\sin n\theta}{2^n}=\frac{2^{N+1}\sin\theta+\sin N\theta-2\sin(N+1)\theta}{2^N(5-4\cos\theta)}$$ Please help me find my mistake, because I am not getting this result. What I did: $$\frac{sin n\theta} {2^N} = \Im \frac{e^{n\theta i}}{2^N}$$ Applied the G.P sum formula : $$\frac{\frac{e^{\theta i}}{2} (1-\frac{e^{N\theta i}}{2^N})}{1-\frac{e^{\theta i}}{2}}$$ $$\Im\frac{e^{\theta i} (\frac{2^N-e^{N\theta i}}{2^N})}{2-{e^{\theta i}}}$$ $$\Im\frac{e^{\theta i} (\frac{2^N-e^{N\theta i}}{2^N})}{2-{e^{\theta i}}}$$ $$\Im\frac{e^{\theta i} ({2^N-e^{N\theta i}})}{2^{N+1}-{2^N e^{\theta i}}}$$ $$\Im\frac{e^{\theta i} ({2^N-e^{N\theta i}})}{2^{N}(2-{e^{\theta i}})}$$ $$\Im\frac{e^{\theta i} ({2^N-e^{N\theta i}})}{2^{N}(2-{e^{\theta i}})} \cdot \frac{2+e^{\theta i}}{2+e^{\theta i}}$$ I got : $$\frac{2^{N+1} \sin \theta + 2^N \sin 2\theta - 2\sin (N+1)\theta- sin (N+2)\theta}{2^N(4-\sin 2\theta)}$$ I have no idea how to brings it to the desired result. They don't look very similar either. What is wrong , or what can I do next ? I also noticed the denominator needs to be in terms of $\cos \theta$ so I also used $sin2\theta=2\sin\theta \cos\theta$ but then I don't know how to get rid of the $\sin\theta$ : $$\frac{2^{N+1} \sin \theta + 2^N \sin 2\theta - 2\sin (N+1)\theta- sin (N+2)\theta}{2^N(4-2\sin\theta\cos \theta)}$$","['complex-numbers', 'summation', 'complex-analysis']"

996597,Integration of $x^a$ and Summation of first $n$ $a$th powers,"There are some convenient formulas for the summation of the first $n$ integers which are the $a$th powers of other integers, e.g. $$ \sum_{i=0}^n i = \frac {n(n+1)}2$$
$$ \sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac {n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}6 $$ Similarly, there are formulae for integration of monomials ($ x^n $), such as $$ \int x^2\,dx = \frac {x^3}3 , \int x\,dx = \frac {x^2}2 $$ On replacing $n + 1$ by $n$, $2n + 1$ by $2n$, and $a_n + b $ by $a_n$ for n'th term in the summation formulas, we get the integration formulas, e.g Replace $n + 1$ by $n$, we get $ n^2/2 $ for $n(n+1)/2$
Replace $n+1$, $2n+1$, by $n, 2n$, then for $n(2n+1)(n+1)$, we get
$$ \frac {n(n)(2n)}6 = \frac {2n^3}6 = \frac {n^3}3  $$ This also works for $x^3$, and $x^4$. Why does this happen? Does it work for higher powers? (I've checked that it works up to $n=8$ so far.)

996625,An Injective binary function,"So I work with theoretical chemistry and time and again we end up walking into what is, for us, uncharted mathematical territories in our search for the patterns and symmetries of nature and its atomic arrays (crystals, molecules and whatnot). Recently I've been struggling to find what I've learned to call a ""binary injective function"", which is, as I understand, a function of two arguments which returns a unique value for each unique pair of arguments. I've seen this problem treated in a number of forms, for example here and here . This last one even has an entry in the Math.Stackexchange itself right here . None of these links however, show that this or that function is injective, and the more I look it up on the internet, the more convinced I get that this is actually an open problem in mathematics. Is that so? Well maybe the ones around here with knowledge of mathematical scientific frontiers can give us a clue as to what is known about these little beasts. And just so I don't end up asking too vague a question, here is the overall description of what I understand as an injective function, the kind I need specifically. So my problem is about a function with two arguments $f(x,y)$ such that $ f:\mathbb{V} \times \mathbb{V} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, for $\mathbb{V} = \{ x | x \in [-\frac{\tau}{2},\frac{\tau}{2}]\}$. As stated above, the function needs to be injective which means that there must be a single value associated with a particular set of arguments. I think that means that the equation $f(x,y)=c$ has, at most, only one solution for any $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Which reminds me that the function doesn't have to be bijective in the reals, there can be real numbers that will never be assigned to any particular set of arguments, it just have to be injective. It also doesn't have to have any analytical or algebraic form, it can be thought of as procedure, a computational sequence of steps that will generate unique outputs for every unique pair of inputs. Anyways, I wandered a lot about the internet trying to find a function that would fit these criteria. I even tried other types of domains which also represented the same space of angles, like $\mathbb{W} = \{x | x \in [0,\tau]\}$. So I looked for: $f:\mathbb{V} \times \mathbb{V} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ $f:\mathbb{W} \times \mathbb{V} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ $f:\mathbb{V} \times \mathbb{W} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ $f:\mathbb{W} \times \mathbb{W} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ Hoping that domain definition would give me some insight, but to no avail. The injective binary functions still elude me. So my question is: Does any of you know of a 2-variable function that is injective for any of the domain options shown?",['functions']
