284767,Is the circle a rational curve and what is its function field?,"It does seem like the circle ($S^1=\{X^2+Y^2=1\}\subseteq k^2$ for $k$ a field) is a rational curve: it has parameterization $X=2T/(T^2+1)$ and $Y=(T^2-1)/(T^2+1)$. On the other hand, we have a theorem that a variety is rational iff its function field is pure transcendental (eg Miles Reid, Ugrad Alg. Geo. 5.9). I think the function field of the circle is $k(X,\sqrt{1-X^2}),$ which is an algebraic extension of $k(X)$, so not purely transcendental.

284835,$f$ is continuous at $c$ $\implies$ $f$ has a limit at $c$. True?,"Further to Another simple/conceptual limit question where I was questioning David Brannan's assertion in his A First Course in Mathematical Analysis that $f(x)=\sqrt x,x\geq 0$ has no limit at $0$ (Example 2c if you type in page 184 in the box on http://www.scribd.com/doc/74564079/Mathematical-Analysis ), I just noticed that in an earlier section he asserted that the same function is continuous on its domain i.e. including at $0$ (Example 3 if you type in page 148 in the box). Does this not violate the well-known theorem (Thm 2 if you type in page 185 in the box) implying that if $f$ is continuous at $c$, then $f$ has a limit at $c$ ? Is David Brannan contradicting himself (by setting up his definition of limits badly)? EDIT:  Thanks, Wisefool. It turns out that there is no contradiction in Brannan's assertions (that the square root function is continuous at 0 yet has no limit at 0) after all, but only because of his peculiar definition of ""limit"" and his analogously peculiar statement of the theorem relating continuity at a point to the limit at that point.","['functions', 'continuity', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

284874,"Why do people simulate with Brownian motion instead of ""Intuitive Brownian Motion""?","I have just recently begun studying Brownian motion and stochastic calculus at the level of an undergraduate or beginning graduate student of applied mathematics.  (Textbooks I've looked at are by Mikosch, Gardiner, Kloeden and Platen.) Back when I first started thinking about stochastic dynamics, I was a cognitive science student who was simulating neural decision making circuits.   We had a differential equation to model our system, and my advisor suggested that I try ""adding in some noise."" Intuitively, I would have written a discretized equation to model the evolution of some state variable $X$ like this:
$$\Delta X = [ a(t,X)+ R ] \Delta t $$
where a is a coefficient that depends upon the state variable $x$ and time $t$, and where $R$ denotes a random variable  (probably taken to be normal and centered at zero with variance $\sigma^2$) In other words, at some level, I would have expected an ""intuitive stochastic differential equation"" to be expressed in the general form
$$ \Delta X =  [a(t,X,R)] \Delta t $$
where a is now any function of a random variable. However, crucially for the theory of stochastic differential equations and the models I see (at least the ones that come up in modeling neural decisions -- e.g. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck), the discretized equation has the stochastic part scaled with $\sqrt{\Delta t}$, rather than just $\Delta t$.  For instance, Brownian motion is discretized as
$$\Delta X = R \sqrt{ \Delta t}$$
where R denotes a standard normal. Finally my question: Why is it so desirable, for modeling stochastic dynamics generally speaking, to have the stochastic part of a stochastic difference equation scale with the square root of the change in time rather than simply linearly with the change in time?","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-calculus', 'stochastic-integrals']"

Using this method, one can prove that if $\beta=e^{-1}$, then $e^{-t}$ and $te^{-t}$ satisfy $u'(t)=-\beta u(t-1)$. These solutions don't take into account the initial function $\phi$. Another way of obtaining a solution is to start with the function $\phi$ and integrate the equation in every interval of length $1$. This method is called method of steps.

It is as follows Suppose $X_i$, $i=1,2,...,n$ are i.i.d random variables, each distributed $N$($19,9$). Define $\bar{X}$ to be the mean value of the $n$ random variables. Find $Pr(19.5 \leq \bar{X} \leq 20)$ for $n=25$, $n=100$, $n=500$, and $n=1000$. What do you expect the value of $Pr(19.5 \leq \bar{X} \leq 20)$ would approach if $n$ were to approach infinity? How is this result related to the Law of Large Numbers? We are to use the normal() function in Stata to compute the probability. I want to check to see if my approach is correct. I believe that I use $$Z= \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma /\sqrt{n}} $$ to standardize, with $\mu = 19$ and $\sigma = \sqrt{9}=3$. So, for the question, with $n=25$, I would use $$Pr(\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma /\sqrt{n}} \leq \bar{X} \leq \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma /\sqrt{n}})$$ $$Pr(\frac{19.5 - 19}{3 /\sqrt{25}} \leq \bar{X} \leq \frac{20 - 19}{3 /\sqrt{25}})$$ I would then repeat for the other values of $n$. Then I simply use the standardized values to find the probabilities with Stata's normal() function. This just involves putting a value in the brackets, for instance normal(1), which returns a value $.84134475$.

285201,Path to Basics in Algebraic Geometry from HS Algebra and Calculus?,"In this question, Why study Algebraic Geometry? , Javier Álvarez, develops a succint but encompassing description of algebraic geometry and its spread across different areas of mathematics. Indeed, it is this very answer that generates this new question: Initial Question: Is there a coherent path from high school algebra and beginning calculus to the beginning of algebraic geometry? In other words, can one self-study towards algebraic geometry, only assuming a very modest mathematics background? I understand that what I am asking is highly non-trivial, because it assumes a certain subject mastery and expository command, that I think many mathematicians simply don't possess. (In particular, Reid's book(s) are good, but could be better Consider that much of high school mathematics rests on calculational arithmetic and algebra, and related analytic and geometric methods that are fairly straightforward. Indeed, it is arguably what supports the calculational, plug and chug with minimal theory that is most college calculus courses. On the other hand there is the more careful and, light but rich, theoretical treatment found with Spivak or Apostol. Thus, not assuming that it would be trivial or wholly straightforward, there should be a way of developing a foray into some of the more interesting problems, and then just developing a plan to concurrently back fill any theory. Indeed, a strong foundation for algebraic geometry, for example, and its problems might lend motivation and coherence to the latter end of pre-college through undegraduate mathematics, instead of the current scatter of, typically, unmotivated degree requirements. Revised Question: What set or sets of problems in mathematics can serve as a motivational basis for study towards the more sophisticated and abstract results in algebraic geometry?","['education', 'algebraic-geometry', 'self-learning', 'soft-question']"

That means that I have $7/20$ odds of matching (or going over) the DC (and $13/20$ for the opposite). If I only had to match the DC once the math would be easy: $(13/20)^5$ is the probability of failing, so $1-(13/20)^5$ is the probability of succeeding. * d20 = 20 sided die, numbered 1-20.","['dice', 'probability']"

I know what is critical points like say $f:N\rightarrow M$ be a smoothh map, a point $p\in N$ is said to be a critical point of $f$ if the differential $$f_{*,p}:T_p\rightarrow T_{f(p)}M$$ fails to be surjective and I also know one result for a real valued funtion $f:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, a pt. $p\in M$ is critical iff relative to some chart $(U,x_1,\dots,x_n)$ containing $p$ all the partial derivatives $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(p)=0$$ there is also some special kind of group and its action is mentioned here, I could not understand that also.

285620,Points at Integer Distances in 3-space,"With the restriction no three points in a line, no four points on a circle, there is a 7 point configuration of points on the plane such that all pairs of points are at integer distances. 1 For 3-space, add the restriction of no 4 points in a plane. One way to get 5 points at integral distances is to first find a set of 5 Soddy spheres that have integral curvature (curvature=1/radius).  For example: $\{1, 3, 4, 9, 16\}$. This set satisfies $3(1^2+3^2+4^2+9^2+16^2)=(1+3+4+9+16)^2$, so it's a set of Soddy spheres. That corresponds to five touching spheres with radii $\{144, 48, 36, 16, 9\}$. The ten distances between points are all integer values. Is there a set of 5 points with smaller distances? Are there solutions for 6 points or more? Change the restrictions, and demand only that the convex hull of points has a volume>0.

Note that the first two conditions are insufficient for the conclusion to hold. (For a clear example, see the first comment in Is there a better counter-example? (problem involving limit of composition of functions) ) But if all three conditions are satisfied, the conclusion may be drawn. This is because the 3rd condition ensures that near $c$ , $gf$ won't be forced to take the value of $g$ at $l$ . I.e. $\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow c}gf(x)$ will be equal to $\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow l}g(x)$ instead of necessarily being equal to $g(l)$ . (Note that $\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow l}g(x)=g(l)$ iff. $g$ is continuous at $l$ .) So that's my informal explanation for the theorem. But I'm having difficulty writing down a proper proof.

285686,Minimal Connected Set containing a Closed Connected Set in a Compact Space,"This question came from Dugundji's $\textit{Topology}$: Given a compact, connected space $X$, let $A \subset X$ be closed. Prove that there exists a closed, connected set $B \subset X$ such that $A \subset B$ and any proper subset of $B$ is either not connected, not closed, or does not contain $A$. The text has an annoying habit of not stating whether the space is assumed to be Hausdorff. My attempt at a proof seems to work for Hausdorff spaces, but it doesn't rely fundamentally on a lot of the hypotheses and feels rather inelegant. If such a $B$ does not exist, then for any $B$ which is connected, closed, and contains $A$, there exists a $B' \subset B$ which also satisfies those conditions. Clearly $X$ is an example of a set which does satisfy the conditions, so at least one such set exists. Order subsets of $X$ which are closed, connected, and contain $A$ by reverse inclusion (i.e. $U > V$ if $U \subset V$ and $U \neq V$). Each chain of subsets has an upper bound: let $B_i$ satisfy the hypotheses and let $B_{n+1} \subset B_n$. Then $B_N = \cap_1^\infty B_i$ is clearly closed and contains $A$. By the result mentioned here: Arbitrary intersection of closed, connected subsets of a compact space connected? , $B_N$ is connected if $X$ is Hausdorff. Thus $B_N$ is an upper bound for the chain $\{B_i\}$. By Zorn's Lemma, this collection has a maximal element, which would have to be the set $B$ needed. I could not find an counterexample among non-Hausdorff spaces, so I would love to see one or a proof of the general case. In addition, the hypothesis that $A$ is closed isn't used anywhere here. I'd love to see anyone's attempts at this problem!","['general-topology', 'connectedness', 'compactness', 'elementary-set-theory']"

That is, if $G$ is finitely generated, then $G$ has only finitely many subgroups of index $n$ (for all $n$). Here's an argument for normal subgroups that you can also make work in the general case. To give a normal subgroup of index $n$ of $G$ is to give a finite group $H$ of cardinality $n$ and a surjection $G\to H$. There are only finitely many groups of cardinality $n$ and for each finite group $H$ there are only finitely many $G\to H$ (because it suffices to designate the image of each generator of $G$ in $H$).

Does this also hold if $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ is bounded but continuous only on $(a,b)$? The first part seems intuitive to me because the $\frac{1}{b-a}\int\limits_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$ (let's call this value $\alpha$) loosely represents the area per unit length, and since $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ it must either always be equal to $\alpha$, or at one point lower and at one point higher. Therefore by the intermediate value theorem there exists a $c\in[a,b]$ such that $f(c)=\alpha$. For the second part I think the conclusion still holds because integral are not concerned with what happens at single discontinuous points as long as the function is bounded.

One property that is preserved under a continuous mapping is for example convergence of a filter/net/sequence, as Arturo Magidin noted in a comment In order to view topological maps (i.e., continuous maps) as
  ""preserving a structure"", you really need to think of them in terms
  of preserving the notion of ""closeness"", not the notion of ""open
  sets"" (by the ""inverse"" of the mapping). It just so happens that the right way to say ""f sends points
  that are close-to-one-another to points that are close-to-one-another""

  terms of direct images, you consider instead the filter of
  neighborhoods of a point. – Arturo Magidin In the category of measurable spaces with measurable mappings being the morphisms, I was wondering what properties are preserved by a measurable mapping? Quickly browsing through Wikipedia and some other sources doesn't provide me the answer.

Hence by the main theorem (in any textbook), $H^n(\mathbb{Z}, M) = 0$ Second approach (for $n=2$) was to use arguments on the level of group extensions $0 \to M \to E \to \mathbb{Z} \to 1$. For this I used the (well-known) theorem that says there is a bijection $H^2(G,M) \leftrightarrow \{\text{equivalence classes of extensions of G by M}\}$ Next I noticed that we can find, for all $m$ some extension $0 \to Z/m \to \mathbb{Z}/m \oplus \mathbb{Z} \to  \mathbb{Z} \to 0$ This makes me believe that $H^2(\mathbb{Z}, M) \neq 0$.
