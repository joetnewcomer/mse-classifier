651076,$\sigma$-algebra generated by $\pi$-system,"Here is a problem from probability with martingales. I want to a better way of writing this than my waffle: Let $Y$ be a random variable and $\pi (\mathbb{R})$ is a $\pi$-system generating the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of $\mathbb{R}$, show that $Y^{-1}(\pi (\mathbb{R}))$ is $\pi$-system generating $\sigma(Y)$. I want to say something like this: Showing it is a $\pi$ system is easy. inverse operations are preserved under taking a finite unions. Take a $B\in \sigma(Y)$ then $B=f^{-1}(B')$, for some $B'\in\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ here comes the waffle: $B'$ is generated by some arbitrary unions/intersections of open sets and taking pre-image preserves taking unions/intersections. so $B$ is the unions and intersections of pre-image of sets in $\pi(\mathbb{R})$ what is a neat way of saying this?",['probability-theory']
651077,Is Standard Deviation the same as Entropy?,"We know that standard deviation (SD) represents the level of dispersion of a distribution. Thus a distribution with only one value (e.g., 1,1,1,1) has SD equals to zero. Similarly, such a distribution requires little information to be defined. On the other hand, a distribution with high SD requires many bits of information to be defined, therefore we can say its entropy level is high. So my question: is SD the same as entropy? If not, which relationship exist between these two measurements?","['statistics', 'information-theory', 'entropy', 'standard-deviation']"

651260,More approximately orthogonal vectors than the dimension of the space,"It is impossible to find $n+1$ mutually orthogonal unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$. However, a simple geometric argument shows that the central angle between any two legs of a simplex goes as $\theta = \mathrm{arccos}(-1/n)$. This approaches $90$ degrees as $n \rightarrow \infty$, so since there are $n+1$ vertices of a simplex in $n$-dimensional space, we can conclude Given $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $n$ such that we can find $n+1~$ approximately mutually orthogonal vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, up to tolerance $\epsilon$. (Unit vectors $u$ and $v$ are said to be approximately orthogonal to tolerance $\epsilon$ if their inner product satisfies $\langle u,v \rangle < \epsilon$) My question is a natural generalization of this - if we can squeeze $n+1$ approximately mutually orthogonal vectors into $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n$ sufficiently large, how many more vectors can we squeeze in? $n+2$? $n+m$ for any $m$? $2n$? $e^n$? Edit: I think one can squeeze at least $n+m$ for any $m$, via the following construction. Given $\epsilon$, one finds the $k$ such that you can have $k+1$ $\epsilon$-approximate mutually orthogonal unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^k$. Call these vectors $v_1, v_2, ..., v_k$. Then you could squeeze $mk+m$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{mk}$, by using the vectors

651281,"Studying the differential form $w(x,y)=xy^ndx+x^mydy$","Let $w$ be a differential form defined by $w(x,y)=xy^ndx+x^mydy$ where $m$ and $n$ are non negative integers. 1) For which values of  $m$ and $n$ the differential form $w$ is closed? 2) For these values, is $w$ exact ? if yes then determine all of its primitives? My try: 1) $w$ is defined for all couples $(x,y)$ such that $x>0$ and $y>0$. Moreover if $w$ is closed then necessarely $\dfrac{\partial (xy^n)}{\partial y}=  \dfrac{\partial (x^my)}{\partial x}$ which means $nxy^{n-1}=mx^{m-1}y$ for all $x>0$ and $y>0$. In particular this identity must hold for $x=y=1$, in which case we must have $n=m$. Now this criterion gives that $nxy^{n-1}=nx^{n-1}y$ for all $x>0$ and $y>0$. If $n=m=0$, $w(x,y)=xdx+ydy$ is clearly closed. If $n=m\not = 0$, we have that $xy^{n-1}=x^{n-1}y$ for all $x>0$ and $y>0$, hence $ x^{n-2}=y^{n-2}$ for all $x>0$ and $y>0$, which can not be true. Hence the only value is $n=0$. 2)Since $w$ is defined on the subset $U$ of the plane consisting of couples $(x,y)$ such that $x>0$ and $y>0$ it is clear that $U$ is convex hence star convex and by Poincaré theorem, for $n=0$, $w$ is exact. to find the primitives $f$ of $w$ we solve the equation 
$\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}=xy^0=x$ which gives that $f(x,y)=x^2/2+c_1(y)$ and the equation $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}=x^0y=y$ which gives that $f(x,y)=y^2/2+c_2(x)$
Hence $f(x,y)=x^2/2+y^2/2+constant$. Is my try correct? thank you for your help!",['multivariable-calculus']

651290,Finding all morphism from a variety to itself,"Let
  $$C:=X^2+Y^2-Z^2$$
  be a projective variety in $\Bbb P^2$. What are all the morphisms $C\to C$ ? More generally, how does one find all morphisms from a given variety to itself? Related: I would also like to know if any software can compute this. Alternatively, I would also accept an answer that gives a complete reference that I can follow. Definitions : Let the field be $K=\Bbb Q$. The coordinate ring of $C$ is $$K[C]=K[X,Y,Z]/(X^2+Y^2-Z^2)$$ with function field $K(C)=\text{Quot}(K[C])$. A rational map $\phi\in K(C)$ is regular at $P\in C$ if $\phi(P)$ is defined. $\phi$ is a morphism if it is regular at every $P\in C$. i.e. $\phi(C)\subseteq C$. In particular, $\phi=F/G$ where $F,G\in K[C]$ are homogeneous polynomials of the same degree. Some workings : $C$ is just the group of rational points in the circle. They form an abelian group with the group law
$$(x_1,y_1,z_1)\oplus(x_2,y_2,z_2)=(x_1x_2-y_1y_2,x_1y_2+x_2y_1,z_1z_2)$$
so that $N=(1,0,1)$ is the identity. So similar to elliptic curves, we can define $\phi=[m]$ to be the multiplication by $m$ map and $\phi$ is a morphism by the definitions above. For example, let $m=3$:
$$\require{enclose}
     \enclose{horizontalstrike}{[3](x,y,z)=(x^2-y^2,2xy,z^2)\oplus(x,y,z)=(x^4-6 x^2 y^2+y^4,4 x y (x^2-y^2),z^4)}$$ Edit_1 : $$[3](x,y,z)=(x^2-y^2,2xy,z^2)\oplus(x,y,z)=(x^3-3 x y^2,3 x^2 y-y^3,z^3)$$
and it is easy to check that $\phi$ is defined for all $P\in C$. Clearly we can also compose any two morphisms, so it suffices to find the ""different types"". Another morphism can be a translation. Fix a $Q\in C$, then define
\begin{align*}
\phi: C &\to C\\
P &\mapsto P\oplus Q
\end{align*}
It is clear that $\phi(P)\in C$ and is defined, so this seems to work. The main question is: are there other kind of morphisms and how do I find all of them? The only fact known to me would be that any morphism $\phi:C\to C$ is either constant or surjective. Some thoughts : In the case of an elliptic curve, if we want to set $\phi(\mathcal O)=\mathcal O$, then $\phi$ is an isogeny. It is known that this forces $\phi$ to be endomorphisms and  the endomorphism ring contains $\Bbb Z$ due to the scalar multiplications $[m]$. But there can also be complex multiplication when the endomorphism ring is larger than $\Bbb Z$. Can something similar happen here? I do note that if I consider $\Bbb Q(i)$, then
\begin{align*}
\phi: C &\to C\\
(x,y,z) &\mapsto (x,iz,y)
\end{align*}
gives me something similar. Note that
$$x^2+(iz)^2+y^2=x^2-z^2+y^2=0$$

Item (b) is easy: the only possibility for $u$ is $u=a(a^{-1})(a^*)^{-1}|a|=(a^*)^{-1}|a|$, which is readily verified to be unitary.

For example if you have a point $p$ represented by a vector, how do you rotate it by multiplying it with a matrix $A$ so $p = Ap$ . From Wikipedia : A basic rotation (also called elemental rotation) is a rotation about one of the axes of a coordinate system. The following three basic rotation matrices rotate vectors by an angle $\theta$ about the $x$ , $y$ , or $z$ axis, in three dimensions: $$R_{x}(\theta)=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\ 0 & \sin \theta & \cos \theta\end{array}\right]$$ $$R_{y}(\theta)=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}\cos \theta & 0 & \sin \theta \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -\sin \theta & 0 & \cos \theta\end{array}\right]$$ $$R_{z}(\theta)=\left[\begin{array}{cc}\cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 \\ \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right]$$ I'm a little unclear. So you need a different rotation matrix for each one of the axis? Is there a way just to get one rotation matrix that covers the rotations done to each axis?

I could do the existence portion. $r = -\frac{b}{a}$ I would like some clarification on proving the uniqueness part. Suppose that $s$ is a real number such that $as + b = 0$. Then $ar + b = as + b$, where $r = -\frac{b}{a}$. You subtract $b$ from both sides and divide both sides by $a$ to get $r = s$. Then it says that this means if $s ≠ r$ then $as + b ≠ 0 $and that this establishes uniqueness. I guess my issue is how exactly does this prove uniqueness? When would placing some random variable in the same spot as the previous not end with the two variables being the same?

651556,Is Reflexivity Necessary for the Weak and Weak* Topologies to Coincide?,"Let $X$ be a normed vector space, not necessarily Banach .

My question is: in this case, is the weak* topology on $X^*$ necessarily strictly weaker than the weak topology on $X^*$? Another thread answers this question in the affirmative for Banach spaces. That is, if $X$ is Banach and the weak and weak* topologies on $X^*$ coincide, then $X$ must be reflexive; or, equivalently, if $X$ is Banach but not reflexive, then the weak* topology on $X^*$ must be strictly weaker than the weak topology on $X^*$. That proof relies on the fact that if $X$ is Banach and $X^*$ reflexive, then $X$ is reflexive. However, this latter result can be shown to fail if $X$ is not Banach. My strategy was to take the $\varphi\in X^{**}$ specified above and try constructing such an open set based on it in the weak topology on $X^*$ that is not open in the weak* topology, but I'm stuck with this approach. Any ideas or hints would appreciated. UPDATE: I got it. The claim is true even without assuming that $X$ is Banach. That is, if the weak and weak* topologies on $X^*$ coincide, then $X$ is necessarily reflexive (and, consequently, also Banach, but the point of my question was not assuming completeness in the proof of reflexivity).

The idea is based on lemma 4 and proposition 5 of these notes , in case anyone else is interested.

651823,Is there a mathematical reason why chocolate chip cookies have 37% (1/e) chocolate in them?,"Someone once briefly explained to me why it is that chocolate chip cookies have 37% chocolate in them. To the best of my memory it has to do with the way trying to place dots in a circle in a random and scattered way behave, which turns out to be $1/e$ or $\approx37%$ . There are 2 levels of validating this: The first is the theoretical side: Can you find a suitable definition for ""random and scattered"" in a circle that fits the use case and the $1/e$ behavior? The second level is the practical. How does the size of the dots and volume impact this phenomenon? Are there real-life constraints that force it to be $1/e$ ? Edit http://sarcasticresonance.wordpress.com/2012/03/11/1e-do-not-lie/ This blogger validated the fact these do have 37% chocolate, and after contacting him he provided me with the following partial explanation, yet for this to become a full answer some conversion of the problem is needed and practical considerations to be taken. Let us assume the following: In the factory the manufacturing process start with a chunk of chocolate the size of a cookie, which is made up from a million chocolate particles.
After that there are a million robotic arms.
Each arm chooses a chocolate particle randomly and replaces it with cookie dough, unfortunately there is no synchronization between the arms, and its possible for few arm to switch the same chocolate particle.
Its obvious that not all million of the particles will be switched but less, and therefore we will have some mix, the question is what will the ratio be. Let us look on a specific particle, what is the probability of it being switched?
hard to calculate directly since it may be chosen by some or all arms, but can be calculated throw elimination: an arm doesn't choose it if it happens to choose another particle. That means: $(N-1)/N = 1 - 1/N$ Is sum of all articles so the probability of no arm choosing it is N when: $(1-1/N)^N$ And that makes the probability of an arm to do choose any particle: $1 - (1-1/N)^N$ Well approach n to infinity, well use the know fact: $(1-1/N)^N ----> 1/e$ We will get that in average: $1-1/e = 0.63$ Which means 0.63 of the chocolate is being switch and there for 37% chocolate is left. The question remains on the following points: Can this be converted to scattering things in a circle? [this will make the next part easier] Does this fit to real life constraints? or is it not? edit 2 As requested and in reponse to the claim that 37% refers to the chocolate itself, iv'e added a picture of the back with the ingridients",['statistics']

Maybe my morning coffee didn't kick in yet, but I'd still appreciate your help! So, using spherical coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$, we can write the Cartesian position vector $$\vec{r} = x \hat{i} + y \hat{j} + z \hat{k}$$ as $$\vec{r} = (r \sin{\theta} \cos{\phi}) \hat{i} + (r \sin{\theta} \sin{\phi}) \hat{j} + (r \cos{\theta}) \hat{k}$$
In the next step, I substitute for Cartesian unit vectors expressed in spherical unit vectors, i.e. $$\hat{i} = (\sin{\theta} \cos{\phi} )\hat{r} + (\cos{\theta} \cos{\phi} )\hat{\theta} - (\sin{\theta})\hat{\phi}$$
$$\hat{j} = (\sin{\theta} \sin{\phi} )\hat{r} + (\cos{\theta} \sin{\phi} )\hat{\theta} + (\cos{\theta})\hat{\phi}$$
$$\hat{k} = (\cos{\theta}) \hat{r} - (\sin{\theta})\hat{\theta}$$ So, when I do that, you can see that my $\hat{\phi}$ terms don't cancel out and I don't get $$ \vec{r} = r\hat{r},$$

651943,Pointwise convergence to a constant function on a compact space,"I would like to show that there is no sequence of homeomorphisms of a compact metric space which converges pointwise to some constant function. However, I'm not sure this result is true; in the case there exists such a sequence I would like to see an example... To be more precise, we have a compact metric space $K$ (which is not a single point) and I would like to know if there exists some sequence $(f_n)_n$ where $f_n : K \to K$ is a homeomorphism for each $n$, such that $f_n \to f$ pointwise where $f : K \to K$ is some constant function. I had an idea to prove that there is no such sequence, but it doesn't seem to work perfectly... Here is my idea (perhaps it could help) : Suppose $(f_n)_n$ is such a sequence, converging pointwise to $f : K \to K : x \mapsto y \quad \forall x \in K$ (where $y$ is some fixed point of $K$). Let $\epsilon > 0$ be such that $B(y, \epsilon)$ (the open ball centered at $y$ of radius $\epsilon$) is a proper subset of $K$. For each $n$, $f_n^{-1}(B(y, \epsilon))$ is an open subset of $K$. So $\left\{f_n^{-1}(B(y, \epsilon)) \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\right\}$ is an open cover of $K$ since for each $x \in K$ there is some $n$ such that $f_n(x) \in B(y, \epsilon)$. By compacity of K, there is some $N$ for which $\left\{f_n^{-1}(B(y, \epsilon)) \mid n \leq N\right\}$ covers K. This $N$ is such that for each $x \in K$, there is some $n \leq N$ for which $f_n(x) \in B(y, \epsilon)$. This somewhat looks like uniform convergence of $(f_n)_n$, but this is trivial that $f_n$ can't converge uniformly to $f$. I would like to find some contradiction here but I can't find a way to conclude... As I already said, I'm not totally convinced there is no such sequence. However, when I try to construct an example of such a $(f_n)_n$, I can't imagine some sequence which is not such that if $f_n(x) \in B(y, \epsilon)$ for some $n$, $x$, $\epsilon$, then $f_m(x) \in B(y, \epsilon)$ for each $m \geq n$. There is no way such a sequence could do the trick, by the reasoning explained above. Could you please help me?

And prove that $G:=F\circ \sin$ is differentiable at $x$ using: It is clear that $\sin(x)$ is differentiable at $x$ . So I need to proof that $F$ is differentiable at $y:=\sin(x)$ . I was trying to prove that using: 34.3 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus II. Let $f$ be an integrable function on $[a, b] .$ For $x$ in $[a, b],$ let $$
F(x)=\int_{a}^{x} f(t) d t
$$ Then $F$ is continuous on $[a, b] .$ If $f$ is continuous at $x_{0}$ in $(a, b),$ then $F$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$ and $$
F^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)=f\left(x_{0}\right)
$$ I'm not sure if I can use this theorem. Obviously, $f$ sattisfies the conditions. But as $y=\sin(x) \in [-1,1]$ , I dont see how I could choose $a,b$ in theorem 34.3, such that it fits this case. It seems clear that I should choose $a:=0$ , and if $y>0$ I could choose $b:=1$ , but if $y<0$ , I can't find any $b$ such that $y\in[a,b]$ . I wanted to know if I'm heading in the right direction, so I looked at the official solution manual. What they are doing there seems complete nonsense to me: I don't see why they are doing what they are doing. They end the proof with $G$ is continuous. Why is that result needed ? And isn't $f$ confused for (some undefined) $F$ in the beginning? As this proof didn't satisfy me, I looked further, and I found this proof: This proof seems completely solid to me. But it is much less intuitive (for me). I wouldn't have come with this proof myself. My question are: Was I heading in the right direction with my first idea ? Or is it not possible to apply theorem 34.3 in this kind of way ? Am I right that the official solution manual is complete nonsense, or am I missing something ?

Since we are told that $Y_1, \ldots, Y_n$ are i.i.d. R.V.s then we also know that $\bar{Y}$ also has the same distribution but is i.i.d correct? Would that not imply that the co-variance is zero between $\bar{Y}$ and $Y_i - \bar{Y}$ since this is simply a linear combination of R.V.s that are already independent? I am confused about how to mathematically show this however and help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks :) EDIT: While doing the problem, another question arose. It appears that $E(\bar{Y})$ = $\bar{Y}$ but how can that be if $\bar{Y}$ = $ (1\div n)$ $\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$ ? If we take the expectation of this second value don't we get $\mu$? But how could $\mu$ = $\bar{Y}$ ? EDIT #2: So I have been solving the problem with various updates and here is where I am stuck now: We start here: $$\text{cov} (\bar{Y}, Y_i - \bar{Y})$ = $E[(\bar{Y}-E(\bar{Y})) * (Y_i-\bar{Y}-E(Y_i-\bar{Y}))]$$ so simplifying this expression according to the fact that $E(\bar{Y})$ = $\mu$ gives the following:
$$\bar{Y}\mu - \bar{Y^2} - \mu^2 + \mu\bar{Y}$$ 
I am confused whether or not this equals zero. I would also greatly appreciate an explanation of how $\mu$ and $\bar{Y}$ relate in practical purposes. Thanks so much!","['statistics', 'statistical-inference']"

652326,"Please clarify what is meant by ""arbitrarily large""","My classmate and I are debating about a logic exercise. The exercise goes like this: Let $T$ be an incomplete countable theory. Prove or disprove: If $T$ has finite models and a denumerable model, then $T$ has arbitrarily large finite models. My friend thinks that a theory with the sentence $\exists x, y (x\ne y)$ should be a counterexample, as it has a finite model (of say size two), a denumerable model, but no ""arbitrarily finite model"" since he considers $1$ to be arbitrarily large, and there is no model of cardinality $1$ that models his theory. I disagree since I think that it is not enough that he chooses some number and says it is arbitrarily large; I think that for a given arbitarily large number, his theory should not have that model, if his theory is to suffice as a counterexample. Can someone clarify why and how either of us is wrong? Note that I do not need help with the problem itself (already solved it my way), just to settle this discussion.",['elementary-set-theory']
652334,Finding the volume inside an elyptical cylinder and a sphere,"I'm trying to find the volume bounded by a sphere and an elyptical cylinder. The sphere is given by $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$ and the elyptical cylinder by $2x^2+y^2-2x=0$. My first attempt with spherical coordinates didn't go  well, now I did some work with cylindrical coordinates but I'm not sure if I have the right answer. Playing with the equation for the cylinder I found the canonical form of the ellipse: $\displaystyle\frac{\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}+ \displaystyle\frac{y^2}{\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2}=1$. And this can be se clearer setting $z=0$ and looking the ellipse drawn on the $xy$-plane Which seems to involve some kind of ugly looking function if I were to describe the ellipse in polar coordinates, which in some way I have to. Now to find the volume I changed to cylindrical coordinates
$$x=\rho\cos\theta, y=\rho\sin\theta,z=z$$ The equation for the ellipse states $x^2+y^2-2x=0$ then $2\rho^2\cos^2\theta+\rho^2\sin^2\theta-\rho\cos\theta$ from which I have $\rho^2(2\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta)-\rho\cos\theta\implies \rho(\theta)=\displaystyle\frac{\cos\theta}{2\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta} = \displaystyle\frac{\cos\theta}{1+\cos^2\theta}$ with $0\leq\theta\leq\pi$. Now, for $z$ considering the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$ follows $\rho^2+z^2=1\implies -\sqrt{1-\rho^2}\leq z \leq \sqrt{1-\rho^2}$. The volume seems to be given by $\displaystyle\int_0^{\pi}\displaystyle\int_0^{\frac{\cos\theta}{1+\cos^2\theta}}\rho\displaystyle\int_{-\sqrt{1-\rho^2}}^{\sqrt{1-\rho^2}}\;dzd\rho d\theta$. For me here is when this become tricky, I'm going to calculate this integrals one at a time. (1)$\displaystyle\int_{-\sqrt{1-\rho^2}}^{\sqrt{1-\rho^2}}\;dz = 2\sqrt{1-\rho^2}$ (2)$\displaystyle\int_0^{\frac{\cos\theta}{1+\cos^2\theta}}\rho (2\sqrt{1-\rho^2})d\rho = \displaystyle\int_0^{\frac{\cos\theta}{1+\cos^2\theta}}2\rho\sqrt{1-\rho^2} d\rho = -\displaystyle\frac{2}{3}(1-\rho^2)^{3/2}|_{\rho=0}^{\rho=\frac{\cos\theta}{1+\cos^2\theta}} = \left[1-\left(\displaystyle\frac{\cos\theta}{1+\cos^2\theta}\right)^2\right]^{3/2} + \displaystyle\frac{2}{3}$
$=\left[\displaystyle\frac{\cos^2\theta}{1+2\cos^2\theta+\cos^2\theta}\right]^{3/2} + \displaystyle\frac{2}{3}$ (3) Stuck. I don't know what could I do to integrate $\left[1-\left(\displaystyle\frac{\cos\theta}{1+\cos^2\theta}\right)^2\right]^{3/2}$ For the term $\left[1-\left(\displaystyle\frac{\cos\theta}{1+\cos^2\theta}\right)^2\right]$ I considered using partial fractions as follows: 
$\left(\displaystyle\frac{\cos\theta}{1+\cos^2\theta}\right)^2
=\displaystyle\frac{1+\cos^2\theta+\cos^4\theta}{(1+\cos^2\theta)^2} = 1 + \displaystyle\frac{1}{(1+\cos^2\theta)^2} + \displaystyle\frac{1}{1+\cos^2\theta}$ But this would make the last integral harder because I'd have to integrate $\displaystyle\int_0^{\pi} \left[1 + \displaystyle\frac{1}{(1+\cos^2\theta)^2} + \displaystyle\frac{1}{1+\cos^2\theta}\right]^{3/2}\;d\theta$ Any ideas?.","['definite-integrals', 'multivariable-calculus', 'volume', 'integration']"

652385,Selecting a book for a reading course in Algebraic Geometry,"I'm not sure if this is an appropriate question in this forum, but here is the situation. I must begin by saying that I know basically nothing about Algebraic Geometry, but this semester I will be doing a reading course in Algebraic Geometry. Of course, I will be discussing the choice of a book with my instructor, however, I wanted to have a better idea when it comes to selecting a book. So far, I have thought of the following books: Basic Algebraic Geometry, volume 1, by Shafarevich; Algebraic Geometry, by Hartshorne; Algebraic Geometry, a first course, by Joe Harris; A Royal Road to Algebraic Geometry, Holme etc. So, I guess my first question is, since there are a few branches of Algebraic Geometry, why would a person select one of these books over the others?
Second, which of these books(or others that I don't know about),in your opinion, is the best book for someone who is just beginning to learn about Algebraic Geometry. My background goes up to a course in Commutative Algebra (Atiyah MacDonald). My goal is eventually to do a PhD thesis in Algebraic Geometry (I am a first year graduate student).

652439,Solve $\cos(z)=\frac{3}{4}+\frac{i}{4}$,"I tried solving this using the definition of $cos(z)=\frac{e^{iz}+e^{-iz}}{2}$ and equating it to $\frac{3}{4}+\frac{i}{4}$ and converting it to a complex quadratic equation through a substitution $t=e^{iz}$ and finding roots via the complex quadratic formula but it didn't seem to work. I would prefer solutions via elementary methods. Here is my attempt: By definition we have $\frac{e^{iz}+e^{-iz}}{2}=\frac{3}{4}+\frac{i}{4} \implies e^{iz}+e^{-iz}=\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2}$. Let $t=e^{iz}$ so then we have $t+\frac{1}{t}=\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2}$ and if we multiply both sides by $t$ we have $t^2+1=(\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2})t$ and hence $t^2+(\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2})t+1=0$ By the quadratic formula for complex numbers we have, $a=1, b=\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2}, c=1 \implies z=\frac{-(\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2}) \pm \sqrt{(\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2})^2-4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}$. Simplyifing we have $z=\frac{-\frac{3}{2}-(\frac{1}{2})i \pm \sqrt{-2+(\frac{3}{2})i}}{2}$ We wish to express $-2+(\frac{3}{3})i$ in polar form so we have $|-2+(\frac{3}{2})i|=\frac{5}{2}$. Now equating the real and imaginary parts we have $\frac{5}{2}\cos(\theta)=-2 \implies \cos(\theta)=-\frac{4}{5}$ and $\frac{5}{2}\sin(\theta)=\frac{3}{2} \implies \sin(\theta)=\frac{3}{5}$. From this we have $\tan(\theta)=-\frac{3}{4} \implies \theta=\arctan(-\frac{3}{4}) \approx -.6435$ rad. So we have $w=-2+(\frac{3}{2})i=\frac{5}{4}(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))=\frac{5}{4}e^{i\theta}$. By Proposition 1.3.12 we have $\sqrt{w}=\sqrt{\frac{5}{4}}e^{\frac{i\theta}{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}e^{\frac{i\theta}{2}}$. Similarily for $-\frac{3}{2}-(\frac{1}{2})=\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}e^{i\varphi}$ Where $\varphi=\arctan(\frac{1}{3})$.  So finally we have $z=\frac{-(\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2}) \pm \sqrt{(\frac{3}{2}+\frac{i}{2})^2-4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}=\frac{\sqrt{10}e^{i\varphi} \pm \sqrt{5}e^{\frac{i\theta}{2}}}{4}$ as solutions to $\cos(z)=\frac{3}{4}+\frac{i}{4}$.","['complex-numbers', 'complex-analysis']"
