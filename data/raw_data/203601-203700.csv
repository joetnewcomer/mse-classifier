4023172,Prove that $f(x)>f(y)$ if $x>y$,"I am working on Spivaks calculus book and have the following question: We have a function with properties (Chapter 3, Ex. 17, (d)): $$f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$$ $$f(xy)=f(x)f(y)$$ and we are trying to prove that $f(x)=x$ for $x$ a real number.
In this step (d) we want to prove that $f(x)>f(y)$ if $x>y$ and here I am struggling. My attempt was to do the following: $x>y$ is the same as $x-y>0$ .
Then $$f(x-y) = f(x)+f(-y) = f(x)+f(-1)f(y)=f(x)+f(y)$$ because from (a) we know that $$f(1)=1=f((-1)(-1))=f(-1)^2$$ therefore $$f(-1)=1$$ From (c) we know that $f(x)>0 $ if $x>0$ so $$f(x-y)=f(x)+f(y)>0$$ but i want $f(x)-f(y)>0$ .
The solution manual says instantly $f(x-y)=f(x)-f(y)$ , but why is that? And what is wrong in my reasoning?",['functions']

4023287,Does this differential equation have a unique solution?,"Consider the Initial Value Problem $\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \sqrt{y+a}$ where $a > 0$ and $y(0) = 0$ Does this have a unique solution ?

4023352,Confusion about simple probability,"This Question stems from Ronald Fishers Tea problem in how to design experiments which I have reworded. Anyway, suppose you have 2 different items in front of you, 5 of each which we can just call red and blue. So you have 10 items total,

4023484,"Are there ""close"" solutions to Hilbert's third problem?","Hilbert's third problem (or a modern formulation thereof) asks whether two polyhedra $P,Q$ of equal volume are equidecomposable by cutting $P$ into finitely many polyhedral pieces and rearranging them to obtain $Q$ . (In the two-dimensional case, this can always be done with polygons of equal area.) With the use of Dehn invariants , one can show that this is impossible; however, the proof focuses on specific equivalence classes of dihedral angles, and does not seem to rule out ""approximate"" solutions. To be more precise: Given polyhedra $P,Q$ of identical volume, here are some notions of a ""close"" solution to Hilbert's third problem: For all $\epsilon>0$ , $P$ may be cut into finitely many polyhedra which can be reassembled to form a polyhedron which contains a copy of $Q$ scaled down by $1-\epsilon$ and is contained in a copy of $Q$ scaled up by $1+\epsilon$ . For all $\epsilon>0$ , $P$ may be cut into finitely many polyhedra which can be reassembled to form a polyhedron whose boundary differs from that of $Q$ over a region of surface area less than $\epsilon$ . For all $\epsilon>0$ and points $x$ on the boundary of $Q$ , $P$ may be cut into finitely many polyhedra which can be reassembled to form a polyhedron which is identical to $Q$ except within a ball of radius $\epsilon$ centered at $x$ . The first condition is easily satisfied by chopping up $P$ into very very small cubes; I do not see how to show the latter two conditions, though I expect they are probably true. Is it known whether dissections meeting the latter two conditions can always be performed?","['dissection', 'polyhedra', 'geometry', 'reference-request']"
4023501,Does this weighted sum of Gaussians converge to $1/x^2$?,"By coincidence I discovered that a weighted sum of several Gaussians seems to converge to $1/x^2$ . Now I wonder whether that's a well-known property, just a coincidence or if this could be proven. This is a normal Gaussian with an additional weight factor $1/\sigma$ : $$
f(x, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma} \cdot \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi} } e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x}{\sigma}\right)^2}

4023528,How do I compute the number of intersection points of these three surfaces in $\mathbb A^3$,"The setting (ambient space) for this question is the projective space $\mathbb P^3$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ , with homogeneous coordinates $x,y,z,w$ . We choose $w = 0$ as the plane at infinity. Let $P, Q, R$ be surfaces of degree $d+1$ in $\mathbb P^3$ , whose set-theoretic intersection is the union of a finite number of points in $\mathbb A^3$ and a curve $C$ of degree $d$ on the plane at infinity. Assume none of $P, Q, R$ contains the plane at infinity. My goal is to find the number of intersection points in $\mathbb A^3$ , counted with multiplicity. I expect this number to be exactly $$d^3 + d^2 + d + 1 = (d^2 + 1)(d + 1),$$ and this can be proven to be the case when $k = \mathbb C$ , using complex analytic methods. We shall identify $P, Q, R$ with their defining polynomials in $k[x,y,z,w]$ . Similarly, we shall identify $C$ with its defining polynomial in $k[x,y,z]$ . Then we may write $$P = xC - wF, \qquad Q = yC - wG, \qquad R = zC - wH,$$ where $F, G, H$ are homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ . FAILED ATTEMPT: My original strategy was to proceed as follows: Replace $R$ with a sufficiently general surface $S$ , also of degree $d+1$ . Assume $P \cap Q \cap R$ and $P \cap Q \cap S$ have the same number of points in $\mathbb A^3$ . Count how many points $P \cap Q \cap S$ has on the plane at infinity (i.e., on $C$ ), and subtract them from $(d + 1)^3$ . Unfortunately, this does not work. Using numerical experiments, I have found that $P \cap Q \cap S$ might have up to $d^3 + 2d^2 + 2d + 1 = (d^2 + d + 1) (d + 1)$ points in $\mathbb A^3$ , violating assumption 2. CURRENT STRATEGY: From now on, consider $A = k[x,y,z,w]$ , the homogeneous coordinate ring of $\mathbb P^3$ . $\mathfrak a = (P)$ , the ideal of the first surface. $\mathfrak b = (P, Q)$ , the ideal of the intersection of the first two surfaces. $\mathfrak c = (P, Q, R)$ , the ideal of the intersection of all three surfaces. First we show that $P, Q, R$ are pairwise coprime. By assumption, none of them is a multiple of $w$ . Now suppose two of them, say $P$ and $Q$ , had a common prime factor. This factor would be an irreducible component of $P \cap Q$ that is mostly contained in $\mathbb A^3$ . Hence $P \cap Q \cap R$ would contain a curve mostly contained in $\mathbb A^3$ , which we have assumed is not the case. Since $A/\mathfrak a$ and $A/\mathfrak b$ are complete intersections, we have the exact sequences $$
0 \longrightarrow A(-d-1)
  \longrightarrow A
  \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak a
  \longrightarrow 0
$$ and $$
0 \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak a(-d-1)
  \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak a
  \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak b
  \longrightarrow 0.
$$ On the other hand, $A/\mathfrak c$ is not a complete intersection, so $R$ must be a zero divisor in $A/\mathfrak b$ . Then we have a short exact sequence of the form $$
0 \longrightarrow K
  \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak b(-d-1)
  \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak b
  \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak c
  \longrightarrow 0,
\DeclareMathOperator \Hilb {Hilb}
$$ where $K$ is not trivial. Taking Hilbert polynomials, we have $\Hilb_A(n) = \binom {n+3} 3$ $\Hilb_{A/\mathfrak a}(n) = \Hilb_A(n) - \Hilb_A(n-d-1)$ $\Hilb_{A/\mathfrak b}(n) = \Hilb_{A/\mathfrak a}(n) - \Hilb_{A/\mathfrak a}(n-d-1)$ $\Hilb_{A/\mathfrak c}(n) = \Hilb_{A/\mathfrak b}(n) - \Hilb_{A/\mathfrak b}(n-d-1) + \Hilb_K(n) = (d + 1)^3 + \Hilb_K(n)$ Now consider a prime filtration of the form $$0 = M_0 \subset M_1 \subset \dots \subset M_r = A/\mathfrak c,$$ and let $\mathfrak p_i$ be the prime ideals such that $M_i/M_{i-1} = A/\mathfrak p_i(d_i)$ . Each $\mathfrak p_i$ is one of the following: The prime ideal of the curve $C$ , i.e., $\mathfrak p$ . The prime ideal of an embedded point on $C$ . The prime ideal of an isolated intersection point in $\mathbb A^3$ . The irrelevant ideal $\mathfrak m = (x,y,z)$ . We may ignore any occurrences of $\mathfrak m$ , because they do not contribute to $\Hilb_{A/\mathfrak c}(n)$ . So we need to compute The $A$ -module $K$ , or at least enough information to recover $\Hilb_K(n)$ . The number of embedded points in $C$ , counted with multiplicity. The degree of the Serre twist applied to $A/\mathfrak p$ , wherever it might occur in the prime filtration. How do I even begin to do this? BAD NEWS: Using even more numerical experiments, I have found that I was careless when stating the problem. The actual problem that I am trying to solve is the following. I have an algebraic foliation of $\mathbb P^3$ by curves, defined in $\mathbb A^3$ by the polynomial vector field $$\mathcal F : P^\flat \frac \partial {\partial x} + Q^\flat \frac \partial {\partial y} + R^\flat \frac \partial {\partial z},$$ where $P^\flat, Q^\flat, R^\flat$ denote the dehomogenizations (i.e., setting $w = 1$ ) of the polynomials $P, Q, R$ at the beginning of this post. We further assume that $\mathcal F$ contains only isolated singularities. If the plane at infinity is chosen generically, then all the singularities are in $\mathbb A^3$ , and the curve $C$ mentioned above is the set of points on the plane at infinity where $\mathcal F$ is tangent to this plane. It follows from these assumptions that $P, Q, R$ have the form stated above: $$P = xC - wF, \qquad Q = yC - wG, \qquad R = zC - wH.$$ However, the implication is strict. It does not follow from these three equations that $\mathcal F$ does not have singularities on the plane at infinity! Could someone help me find an algebraically precise way to state, in terms of $P, Q, R, C, F, G, H$ , that $\mathcal F$ does not have singularities on the plane at infinity?","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

4023717,Are there general procedures to find group isomorphisms?,"This question is actually a series of related questions that have been bothering me while studying group theory.

4023760,Kernel of Quadratic Field Norm,"Let $D > 0$ be squarefree and consider the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$ . Then the field norm $N : \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D}) \to \mathbb{Q}^\times$ is given by $N(a + b\sqrt{D}) = a^2 - D b^2$ . Let $K$ be the kernel of this map, consisting of elements of norm $+1$ . I'm looking for an example where $K$ is not isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \bigoplus_{i = 0}^\infty \mathbb{Z}$ as abelian groups. The motivation is the Pell conic group $C$ defined on the curve $x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$ . If $D$ is a square of a rational number, then $x \mapsto (\frac{x+x^{-1}}{2},\frac{x-x^{-1}}{2\sqrt{D}})$ gives an isomorphism $\mathbb{Q}^{\times} \cong C$ , but otherwise we have the isomorphism $K \cong C$ where $K$ is the kernel of the norm map. I am wondering whether the group structure of $C$ alone can detect the irrationality of a square root of a natural number. Below I've included my current thoughts on this question. Let's consider $D = 2$ . Then the group of units of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ is generated by powers of $\pm(1 + \sqrt{2})$ , so it is isomorphic $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ . Since $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ is a UFD, we have that any element of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})^\times$ can be written as a unique product of primes and units of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ , so $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})^\times \cong (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}) \times \bigoplus_{p \text{ prime}} \mathbb{Z}$ . Now consider the map $h : \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})^\times \to K$ given by $h(a) = \frac{a^*}{a}$ where $a^*$ denotes the conjugate. My understanding is that Hilbert's Theorem 90 implies this map is surjective. Its kernel is $\mathbb{Q}^\times$ , so $K$ should be something like $K \cong (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}) \times \bigoplus_{p \text{ prime, } \notin \mathbb{Q}} \mathbb{Z}$ . This paper uses a similar map to obtain the analogous result for $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ . It seems like similar reasoning should apply to any UFD. Now consider a non-UFD, say $D = 10$ . Here we have $2 \cdot 5 = \sqrt{10} \cdot \sqrt{10}$ which at first seems like it might change the structure of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})^\times$ compared to $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})^\times$ . However, I think you can throw out $5$ as a generator because you can get it from the other irreducibles as as $(\sqrt{10})^2/2$ . It seems like $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})^\times$ has a chance of being isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \bigoplus_{i = 0}^\infty \mathbb{Z}$ despite not being a UFD. Then applying $h$ should then just kill the factors corresponding to primes in $\mathbb{Q}$ , so you might get the same thing for $K$ as with $D = 2$ .","['algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'field-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

For any $\varepsilon>0$ , there is a closed vector space $A\subset L^2(D,\mathcal{O})$ , of finite codimension, with $$ \lVert f\rVert_{L^2(D')}\leq \varepsilon \lVert f\rVert_{L^2(D)}$$ He has already shown that $L^2(D,\mathcal{O})$ , the space of holomorphic functions on $D$ , forms a Hilbert space under the inner product $\iint f\overline{g}dxdy$ thus the ""closed"" comment.

4023801,Intuition for meagre sets,"So I'm putting together a presentation in topology on BCT and I have the following theorems: Let $D$ be the set of somewhere differentiable functions $[0,1] \to \mathbb R$ . Then $D$ is meagre in $C[0,1]$ . Let $f \colon [0,1] \to \mathbb R$ be a differentiable function with derivative $f'$ . Let $X$ be the set of points for which $f'$ is discontinuous. Then $X$ is meagre in $[0,1]$ . My temptation to rationalise these intuitively (as a taster in the introduction) as follows: Most continuous functions are nowhere differentiable. Derivatives are continuous at most points. This is based off my understanding that a set $A$ is meagre in $B$ if it is small relative to $B$ in a precise sense. But there are instances where a meagre set can be quite large (even of full measure), and I've been told that it's not really correct to say ""most"" in this context. However, I've seen quite a lot of posts on here giving similar intuitive restatements. I thought I'd ask here for clarification - is it proper/well-understood to say ""most"" here? I could say ""many"" but that doesn't really feel as punchy. If it's not proper to say most here, is there any better way to put it? My topological intuition is still fairly weak.","['general-topology', 'derivatives', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

4023906,I can't wrap my head around Peano's 5'th axiom,"I'm currently reading about Peano's axiom and the construction of the natural numbers. The fifth Axiom of Peano does not make sense to me: If a subset $T$ contains $0$ as an element and for all $n \in T$ , $s(n)$ is also in $T$ , then $T$ is the set of Natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ . I know that this axiom exists in order to exclude elements which could have the following property: $$s(a) = b$$ $$s(b) = a$$ These elements would not violate axioms $1$ to $4$ however they don't have the desired ""natural number"" properties hence axiom $5$ has been created to allegedly clean these elements up. I also know that axiom $5$ is supposed to work as follows: If $0$ is in our set $T$ then $s(0)$ is also in $T$ but if $s(0)$ is in $T$ then $s(s(0))$ is also in $T$ and so on. Thus we declare this set to be the natural numbers. Now to my actual question: suppose we throw in $a$ and $b$ and $0$ into $T$ . Since we do not yet know what the natural numbers are, we can't exclude $a,b$ either (if my thinking is correct). Then for all $n$ in $T$ the succesor $s(n)$ is also in $T$ . As previously stated $s(0), s(s(0)), ...$ are all in in $T$ (the actual natural numbers) but if such elements $a$ and $b$ are also in T then their successor $s(a)$ and $s(b)$ are also in $T$ which is  a true statement since $s(a) = b$ and $s(b) =a$ .

It says that at any point on any surface, the variation of normal curvature as a function of angle is given by an absurdly simple little formula.

But what if we replace âirreducible closed setsâ with âconnected compact (c.c.) submanifolds (without boundary)â? It seems that c.c. manifolds are somewhat similar to irreducible closed sets in that they cannot be written as finite unions of other c.c. (proper)submanifolds not equal to themselves (I think). Does this idea lead anywhere interesting / is there a source that discusses dimension from this perspective (or can the validity thereof be disproven)? The obvious follow up is: given a smooth manifold X, does the ideal of smooth, real valued functions on X which vanish on a given c.c. submanifold Y have any âniceâ properties analogous to prime ideals (of course in the ring of smooth functions on X, this ideal itself is unfortunately not actually prime... but maybe something comparable but weaker?

4024158,How did Gauss come up with this function?,"I have been studying statistics lately, and after having my first brush with normal distributions, I was curious to know more about it. I have researched about the history of normal distributions and found the following information: When gauss published his monograph, Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientium , he discussed among other things the normal distribution (interestingly, the book was on how celestial objects have orbits that are conic sections). According to Wikipedia , he did the following to arrive at the distribution: There is an unknown quantity $V$ . $M, M',M"",\dots$ are the measurements of $V$ . $\varphi$ is the function that governs the law of probability. The aim was to  find $\varphi$ . It says on Wikipedia that the most likely estimator of $V$ would be the one that maximizes: $$\varphi(M-V)\varphi(M'-V)\varphi(M""-V)\dots\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;-(1)$$ Gauss guessed that the answer to the $V$ maximizing the above equation must be the mean of the measured values. Then gauss demonstrated that the only function $\varphi$ that gives the mean as the answer was: $$\varphi\Delta=\frac{h}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-h^2{\Delta}^2}$$ where, $\Delta$ is the measurement of errors. $h$ is the measure of precision of the observation A number of questions pop up in my head. Why should the most likely estimate be the one that maximizes equation 1? How did Gauss' derive $\varphi$ using the assumed solution to be the mean? What does $\Delta$ actually mean? MY ANSWERS/ATTEMPTS I actually feel that it should not be the maximum. It should rather be the minimum as when the expression is minimized it means that $V$ is closer to each of the values $M,M',M""\dots$ which are the actual measurements. Therefore such a value should be the most likely estimate. From my knowledge of statistical inference, in the procedure of maximum likelihood estimator, we maximize the probability density function of the distribution. The value of random variable at the maxima is the estimate. I do not know the answer to this one. I tried looking up Gauss' original work but it would take me too off topic as Gauss' has treated these ideas with respect to orbits of celestial objects being conic sections. I do not wish to look into the applications right now (But I do understand that reading the book right from the start will be wonderful learning experience). I once again do not fully understand what $\Delta$ means here. According to me, $\varphi$ should have been a function of $V$ and not $\Delta$ . It would be really helpful if someone could answer my questions and also provide an explanation of what actually is being done here as I am getting confused with so many ideas in my head!!","['statistical-inference', 'statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'normal-distribution', 'gaussian']"

But if this is true, then I have another confusion: There's a line from the book that says, A finite linearly ordered set has a (unique) largest element.

Problem 1: Is there a function ( $f:$ $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}$ ) whose limit at every point is $ \infty $ ? Problem 2: Can a function ( $f:$ $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}$ ) have continuum many local min/max values ?
(We are looking for local extrema values not points, so the constant function only has 1 in this regard) So both problems ask questions about some properties maximum cardinality. Obviously countably finite is achieveable for both questions ( $\tan{x}$ and $x\sin{(1/x)}$ ). I think the answer is negative for both questions. For Problem 1 I think all values have to be 'large' for this to happen, namely $\infty$ but could not exactly prove this. I also tried to make a bijection with rational numbers on how many points can have a limit at infinity, but also could not finish. For problem 2 I tried bijection with rationals but I could not make it so that for every rational I pair it with one Local min/max.

4024521,"Is $\inf \{P(|X| > \varepsilon) : E[X] = 0, \operatorname{Var}(X) = 1\} = 0$ for all $\varepsilon > 0$?","If $\varepsilon > 0$ , is it true that the infimum of $\{P(|X| > \varepsilon) : E[X] = 0, \operatorname{Var} (X) = 1\}$ is zero? That is, for every $a > 0$ , can we always find a random variable $X$ with zero mean and unit variance that satisfies $P(|X| > \varepsilon) < a$ ? My first attempt to prove this statement was by using the Chebyshev's inequality: if $E[X] = 0$ and $\operatorname{Var} (X) = 1$ , then $E[X^2] = \operatorname{Var} (X) + E[X]^2 = 1$ , so we have $$P(|X| > \varepsilon) \leq \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}.$$ However, this inequality seems to be unhelpful, especially if $\varepsilon \leq 1$ . Moreover, the right hand side does not even depend on $X$ or any other variable, so I cannot make the upper bound of $P(|X| > \varepsilon)$ to approach zero in this inequality. Next, I tried to construct a sequence $\{X_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of random variables based on the uniform and U quadratic distributions. The idea is to reduce the support of $X_n$ to be less than $[-\varepsilon, \varepsilon]$ as $n \to \infty$ , so that $P(|X_n| > \varepsilon) = 0$ eventually. More precisely, each $X_n$ has a probability density function defined by $$f_{X_n} = \frac{2n+1}{2a_n^{2n+1}}x^{2n} \quad (x \in [-a_n,a_n]),$$ where $a_n = \sqrt{1+\frac{2}{2n+1}}$ , and zero otherwise (this formulation ensures that $E[X_n] = 0$ and $\operatorname{Var}(X_n) = 1$ for all $n$ ). Unfortunately, $a_n$ converges to $1$ in this case, and $P(|X_n| > \varepsilon) \neq 0$ for $\varepsilon < 1$ . After these attempts, I began to doubt the validity of this proposition. After all, wouldn't a random variable with variance of $1$ surely ""spread over"" to the value of $1$ if it is centered at $0$ ? This is only my intuition and I have yet to prove this. But if that's the case, then $P(|X| > \varepsilon)$ surely can't approach $0$ for $0 < \varepsilon < 1$ . Any help on proving or disproving the statement in my question is appreciated.","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'probability', 'random-variables']"

But, following this logic, how comes the state space for the binomial distribution isn't $\Bbb N$ , where for all $N>n,$ the probability that the RV is equal to that value is zero?

My attempt is to show that $(x_n)$ is Cauchy so i would like to have a feedback on my proof,please. First of all we show by induction that $2>x_n\ge0$ . The previous inequality is true for $n=0$ so we can suppose that it works up to a certain $n$ . We want to proof right now that it holds fot $n+1$ and so show that $2>x_{n+1}\ge0$ : $2>x_{n+1}\ge0 \iff 2>\frac{1}{1+x_n}\ge0$ . It is trivial that $x_{n+1}\ge0$ by induction hypothesis (because $x_n\ge0$ ). Moreover, as $2>x_n\ge0$ , we have that $x_{n+1}=\frac{1}{1+x_n}\le1<2$ . So we can conclude that $2>x_n\ge0 \ \forall n\ge0$ Then, $\forall p\ge2$ we have: $|x_p-x_{p-1}|=\Big|\frac{x_{p-2}-x_{p-1}}{(1+x_{p-1})(1+x_{p-2})}\Big|\le 1 \cdot|x_{p-2}-x_{p-1}|=...=1^{p-1}|x_0-x_1|=1^{p-1}$ We show now that $(x_n)$ is Cauchy.

What I've tried My first approach: $f^{-1}$ is continuous if $f$ maps open sets to open sets. Since $f$ is increasing it is a one-to-one mapping and it suffices to show that $f$ maps open intervals to open intervals. Let $V \subset [0,1]$ so that $f^{-1}(V)$ is open (since $f$ is continuous) and $f(f^{-1}(V))=V$ which is also open. All that remains to show is that every open interval $U = f^{-1}(V)$ for some open interval $V$ . This is true since $f$ is a one-to-one mapping. My second approach: $f^{-1}$ is continuous if there exists a $\delta$ such that when: $$|\alpha - \alpha'| < \delta$$ we have: $$|f^{-1}(\alpha) - f^{-1}(\alpha')| < \epsilon$$ Call the first event $A$ and the second event $B$ . To show $A \implies B$ it is sufficient to show that $B^c \implies A^c$ . Let $\alpha = f(x),\, \alpha' = f(x')$ for some $x,x'$ so that we need to show for each $\epsilon$ : $|x-x'| \geq \epsilon \implies |f(x) - f(x')| \geq \delta$ for some $\delta$ . But this is clear since $f$ is strictly increasing. I could use some feedback on my reasoning for both approaches.","['real-analysis', 'continuity', 'functions', 'solution-verification', 'inverse']"
4024641,Do repeated roots (and Real Jordan form) for ODE's come up in real world applications of ODE's,"An equation like $y^{\prime \prime} + 2 y^{\prime} + y = 0$ has repeated roots: The characteristic polynomial is $r^2 + 2r + 1$ which has repeated roots $(-1,-1)$ .

More general examples exist with systems of ODE's and involve real Jordan form (aka real cannonical form) as explained in the textbook by Hirsch and Smale. My question is whether this has real applications. In order to get repeated roots, the ""true"" ODE would have to be exactly a certain way and any slight deviation would destroy the repeated roots. I suppose people call non-repeated roots ""generic"". So this would seem very rare. Does this come up real applications?

4024678,Can the idea of a 'function of a variable' be made rigorous?,"Suppose that $y=x^2$ . Very often people describe this relationship by saying that ' $y$ is a function of $x$ '. It seems that there are several logical problems with this statement: A function is simply a set of ordered pairs of numbers. It does not matter how you denote the input of a function, and there is no doubt that $x \mapsto x^2$ and $y \mapsto y^2$ are the same function. Indeed, in both cases $y$ and $x$ are simply dummy variables used to illustrate what happens when you plug in an arbitrary number into the function. $x$ and $y$ are often described as variables that are related in some way; in this case, with $y$ being the square of $x$ . However, in this Math Overflow post  Mike Shulman states that the idea of a variable is 'not a standard part of modern formalizations of mathematics'. Strangely, the idea of a dummy variable makes much more sense to me. For instance, when we say 'consider the function $f$ defined by $f(x)=x^2$ for all $x$ ', it is clear that the only purpose of the letter $x$ is to declare that the second entry of the ordered pair is the square of the first. If $y=x^2$ and $x \geq 0$ , then we just as well might write $x=\sqrt{y}$ . This flexibility is not really allowed when speaking of functions: $x \mapsto x^2$ and $x \mapsto \sqrt{x}$ are certainly not the same function. Perhaps it is possible evade this by treating $x$ as the independent variable and $y$ as the dependent variable. Some authors get around this ambiguity by saying that 'the function $y=x^2$ ' is just a shorthand for 'the function $y(x)=x^2$ ', which in turn is just a shorthand for 'the function $y$ defined by $y(x)=x^2$ for all x'. However, this doesn't seem to align with how people treat the relationship between $y$ and $x$ in practice. Even if we accept that $y=x^2$ is simply a shorthand for $y(x)=x^2$ , it still seems that there is a tendency towards treating $x$ as an independent variable representing the input of $y$ , as opposed to simply a dummy variable that can be replaced by any other letter. So I ask, in formal mathematics, is it possible to interpret $y=f(x)$ in such a way that $x$ and $y$ are variables representing the inputs and outputs of a function? And if so, how should the statement ' $y$ is a function of $x$ ' be understood?","['notation', 'functions', 'real-analysis']"
4024737,"If a two variable smooth function has two global minima, will it necessarily have a third critical point?","Assume that $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ a $C^{\infty}$ function that has exactly two minimum global points. Is it true that $f$ has always another critical point? A standard visualization trick is to imagine a terrain of height $f(x,y)$ at the point $(x,y)$ , and then imagine an endless rain pouring with water level rising steadily on the entire plane. Because there are only two global minima, they must both be isolated local minima also. Therefore, initially the water will collect into two small lakes around the minima. Those two points are connected by a compact line segment $K$ . As a continuous function, $f$ attains a maximum value $M$ on the set $K$ . This means that when the water level has reached $M$ , the two lakes will have been merged. The set $S$ of water levels $z$ such that two lakes are connected is thus non-empty and bounded from below. Therefore it has an infimum $m$ . It is natural to think that at water height $m$ there should be a critical point. A saddle point is easy to visualize. For example the function (originally suggested in a deleted answer) $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2(1-y)^2$ has a saddle point at the midway point between the two local minima at $(0,0)$ and $(0,1)$ . But, can we prove that one always exists? Follow-ups: Does the answer change, if we replace $\Bbb{R}^2$ with a compact domain? What if $f$ is a $C^\infty$ function on a torus ( $S^1\times S^1$ ) or the surface of a sphere ( $S^2$ ). Ok, on a compact domain the function will have a maximum, but if we assume only isolated critical points, what else is implied by the presence of two global minima? Similarly, what if we have local minima instead of global? If it makes a difference you are also welcome to introduce an extra condition (like when the domain is not compact you could still assume the derivatives to be bounded - not sure that would be at all relevant, but who knows).","['morse-theory', 'multivariable-calculus', 'differential-topology', 'real-analysis']"

4025058,Envelope of a real function consisting of a complex function and its conjugate,"For a real function $f(x)=A(x)e^{ix}+\overline{A}(x)e^{-ix}$ , where $\overline{A}$ represents complex conjugate of $A$ . Note that $A(x)$ itself is a complex function $A(x)=A_r(x)+i A_i(x)$ . It seems that the envelope of $f(x)$ should be $\pm 2\vert A \vert$ , where $\vert \cdot \vert$ repersents the modulus of a complex number. That is, the envelope of $f(x)$ is double amplitude of $A$ if $f$ can be written as $A(x)e^{ix}+c.c.$ Now, I am confusing with the envelope of the real function $g=ff_x$ since it cannot be written in a similar form.
Substituting $f(x)$ into $g=ff_x$ , one obtains $g=A(A_x+iA)e^{2ix}+A\overline{A}_x+c.c.$ , where c.c. repersents the complex conjugate of the preceding terms.
How can I express the amplitude of the envelope of $g$ with $A$ , $\overline{A}$ and their derivatives? For the 1st term and its conjugate, the envelope should be $\pm 2 \vert A(A_x+iA)\vert$ . But I do not know how to include the 2nd term and its c.c. Can anyone please give me some suggestions?

For any sets $X$ and $Y$ , either $\mathrm{card}(X)\leq\mathrm{card}(Y)$ or $\mathrm{card}(Y)\leq\mathrm{card}(X)$ . Proof. Consider the set $\mathcal{J}$ of all injections from subsets of $X$ to $Y$ . The members of $\mathcal{J}$ can be regarded as subsets of $X\times Y$ , so $\mathcal{J}$ is partially ordered by inclusion. It is easily verified that Zorn's lemma applies, so $\mathcal{J}$ has a maximal element $f$ , with (say) domain $A$ and range $B$ . If $x_0\in X\setminus A$ and $y_0\in Y\setminus B$ , then $f$ can be extended to an injection from $A\cup\{x_0\}$ to $Y\cup\{y_0\}$ by setting $f(x_0)=y_0$ , contradicting maximality. Hence either $A=X$ , in which case $\mathrm{card}(X)\leq\mathrm{card}(Y)$ , or $B=Y$ , in which case $f^{-1}$ is an injection from $Y$ to $X$ and $\mathrm{card}(Y)\leq\mathrm{card}(X)$ . $\qquad\square$ I know that Zorn's lemma is as follows: Zorn's lemma: Suppose a partially ordered set P has the property that every chain in P has an upper bound in P. Then the set P contains at least one maximal element. However, I am having difficulty in seeing how that quickly one can see that Zorn's lemma applies there as the textbook mentions. How can I show that any chain of $X\times Y$ has an upper bound? Could I say $X \times Y$ is itself the upper bound?

Here i wil try to prove that $(x_n)$ converges considering all details. So. i would like to have a critical feedback on my proof and would like to know if i missed something or did much more than it should be.. Here $\mathbf{R}^*$ will denote $\mathbf{R}\ \ \not \ \{0\}$ . Consider a function $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ . First, we show that it's defined on $\mathbf{R}$ and then we will show that $f(x)$ is an increasing function on $\mathbf{R}$ . We remark that $f(x)$ is differntiable on $\mathbf{R}^*$ . Let $a \in \mathbf{R}^*$ . By definition of differentiable function the $\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$ msut exist: $\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}=\frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{a^2}}$ and so it exists $\forall a \in \mathbf{R}^*$ as we chose an arbitrary $a$ . So $f(x)$ is differentiable on $\mathbf{R}^*$ and so is continious on $\mathbf{R}^*$ . We show now that $f(x)$ is continious on $0$ . To show that we pass by the definition : $\forall \varepsilon>0 \ \exists \delta>0 \ \forall x \in \mathbf{R}$ : $|x|<\delta \implies |f(x)|=|\sqrt[3]{x}|<\varepsilon$ To satisfy the definition, one can take $\delta=\varepsilon^3$ , so it holds and we can conclude that $f(x)$ is continious on $\mathbf{R}$ . Let $a,b \in \mathbf{R}$ such that $a<b$ . As $f(x)$ is continious on $\mathbf{R}$ we can write: $a<b \iff \sqrt[3]{a}<\sqrt[3]{b} \iff f(a)<f(b)$ As $a,b$ are arbitrary numbers (satisfying $a<b$ ), we can conclude that $f(x)$ is strictly incrasing function. Now, as all preliminary results are proven, we can show that $(x_n)$ is a convergent sequence. For that, we show that $(x_n)$ is monotonic and bounded. $\bullet$ $(x_n)$ is decreasing: Suppose $x_{n+1}<x_n$ . The previous inequality holds for $n=1$ so we can suppose that it works up to a certain $n\in \mathbf{N}^*$ . We show nowthat it holds for $n+1$ : $x_{n+2}<x_{n+1} \iff \sqrt[3]{x_{n+1}+x_n}<\sqrt[3]{x_n+x_{n-1}}$ . But, as $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ is strictly increasing function and by induction hypothesis $x_{n+1}<x_n$ , we can conclude that $x_{n+2}<x_{n+1}$ and so $x_{n+1}<x_n$ holds $\forall n\in\mathbf{N}^*$ . So $(x_n)$ is decreasing. $\bullet$ $(x_n)$ is bounded below: Suppose $x_n>1$ . It holds for $n=1$ so we can suppose that it works up to a certain $n\in \mathbf{N}^*$ . We want to show now that t holds for $n+1$ : $x_{n+1}>1 \iff \underbrace{x_{n}}_{>1}+\underbrace{x_{n-1}}_{>1}>1$ which is true, because $(x_n)$ is decreasing. So we conclude that $x_n>1 \ \forall n\in \mathbf{N}^*$ . So, we have shown that $(x_n)$ converges.","['limits', 'convergence-divergence', 'proof-writing', 'sequences-and-series']"

Descriptive Version Given an iterative piecewise linear function, $f$ , with domain $\mathbb{Z}$ and range $\mathbb{Z}$ : under iteration by $f$ , if the trajectories/iterates of the first integers in all the subdomains converge to a cycle; then, the trajectories of all integers in the domain of $f$ will converge to a cycle, that is, no trajectory diverges.
- Special Conditions: (1) Zero can be included or excluded from $f$ . (2) It is assumed that the subdomains and subranges are in arithmetic progression containing non-negative or non-positive integers but not a mix. (3) It is also assumed that if $f$ has only two subfunctions then the cycle must be of length 1 and, of course, $f(x)\neq x$ unless $x$ is the element to which all the trajectories of the first elements converge. (4) Importantly, if one element in a subdomain is greater than its corresponding element in the subrange, then all elements in that subdomain must be greater than  their corresponding elements in the subrange. The same is true if one element in a subdomain is less than its corresponding element in the subrange. $\color{black}{\text{Example 1}}$ $$f(x) =
\begin{cases}
x+1,  & \text{subdoman: 1, 3, 5, 7,...Subrange: 2, 4, 6, 8,...} \\
-x+2, & \text{subdoman: 2, 4, 6, 8,...Subrange: 0,-2,-4,-6...}\\

0, & \text{subdoman: 0 $\hspace{1.6cm}$ Subrange: 0}
\end{cases}$$ Note that the trajectories of the first elements $(1, 2, -1$ and $-2)$ of the subdomains all converge to $0$ implying that no trajectory will diverge.
For example, the trajectory of $6$ under $f$ is: $6\to-4 \to-3\to3\to4\to-2\to-1\to1\to2\to0.$ $\color{black}{\text{Example 2}}$ Here is a second example in which the first elements of the subdomains converge to the cycle $-1, 1$ and $0$ is excluded: $$g(x) =

The Minkowski bound is $\frac{4}{\pi}\cdot\frac{6}{27}\cdot \sqrt{3^5}<5$ . Thus we need to check ideals of norm less than $5$ . Set $a=\sqrt[3]{3}$ to facilitate notation. The only ideal of norm 1 is $\mathcal{O}_K$ Every ideal contains its norm, thus ideals of norm $2$ are prime factors of $(2). \quad $ $ (2)=(a-1)(a^2+a+1) \ $ , since $2=3-1=a^3-1=(a-1)(a^2+a+1). N(a-1)=2, N(a^2+a+1)=4 $ . $(3)=(a)^3$ and $(a)$ is principal. Since $(2)=(a-1)(a^2+a+1),$ ideals of norm 4 are: $(a-1)^2, \ (a^2+a+1).$ All of the ideals above are principal, thus the ideal class group is trivial and $\mathcal O_K$ is a PID.","['number-theory', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

We also know the solution is constant along the characteristic curve. We can see the wave being constant at $x>1$ but moving to the right when $x<1$ . This leads me to the following: $$

We say that $f$ is of class $C^r$ on $S$ if $f$ may be extended to a function $g:U\rightarrow\Bbb R^n$ that is of class $C^r$ on an open set $U$ of $\Bbb R^k$ containing $S$ . Lemma Let $U$ be open in $H^k$ but not in $\Bbb R^k$ ; let $\alpha:U\rightarrow\Bbb R^k$ be of class $C^r$ . Let $\beta:U'\rightarrow\Bbb R^n$ and $\gamma:U''\rightarrow\Bbb R^n$ be two $C^r$ extensions of $\alpha$ defined on an open subsets $U'$ and $U''$ of $\Bbb R^k$ . Then the derivatives of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are equal in $U$ and in $\overset{\circ} U$ are equal to the derivative of $\alpha$ . Definition Given $x\in\Bbb R^n$ we define a tangent vector to $\Bbb R^n$ at $x$ to be a pair $(x;\vec v)$ where $\vec v\in\Bbb R^n$ . The set of all tangent vectors to $\Bbb R^n$ at $x$ forms a vector space if we define $$
(x;\vec v)+(x;\vec w):=(x;\vec v+\vec w)\\
c(x;\vec v):=(x;c\vec v)
$$ It is called the tangent space to $\Bbb R^n$ at $x$ and it is denoted $\mathcal T_x(\Bbb R^n)$ . Definition Let be $A$ open in $\Bbb R^k$ or in $H^k$ ; let $\alpha: A\rightarrow\Bbb R^n$ be of class $C^r$ . Let $x\in A$ , and let $p=\alpha(x)$ . We define a linear transformation $$
\alpha_*\mathcal T_x(\Bbb R^k)\rightarrow\mathcal T_p(\Bbb R^n)
$$ by the equation $$
\alpha_*(x;\vec v):=\big(p;D\alpha(x)\cdot\vec v\big)
$$ and we call it pushforward of $\alpha$ . Definition Let $M$ be a $k$ -manifold of class $C^r$ in $\Bbb R^n$ . If $p\in M$ chose a coordinate patch $\alpha:U\rightarrow V$ about $p$ , where $U$ is open in $\Bbb R^k$ or $H^k$ . Let $x$ be the point of $U$ such that $\alpha(x)=p$ . The set of all vectors of the form $\alpha_*(x;\vec v)$ where $\vec v$ is a vector in $\Bbb R^k$ is called the tangent space to $M$ at $p$ and it is denoted $\mathcal T_p(M)$ . Said differently $$
\mathcal T_p(M):=\alpha_*\big(\mathcal T_x(\Bbb R^k)\big)
$$ Definition Let $A$ be an open set $\Bbb R^n$ . A $k$ -tensor field in $A$ is a function $\omega$ assigning to each $x\in A$ a $k$ -tensor defined on the vector space $\mathcal T_x(\Bbb R^n)$ . That is, $$
\omega(x)\in\mathcal L^k\big(\mathcal T_x(\Bbb R^n)\big)
$$ for each $x\in A$ . Thus $\omega(x)$ is a function mapping $k$ -tuples of tangent vectors to $\Bbb R^n$ at $x$ into $\Bbb R$ ; as such, its value on a given $k$ -tuple can be written in the form $$
\big[\omega(x)\big]\big((x;\vec v_1),...,(x;\vec v_k)\big)
$$ We require this function to be continuous as a function of $(x,v_1,..,v_k)$ ; if it is of class $C^r$ we say that $\omega$ is a tensor field of class $C^r$ . If it happens that $\omega(x)$ is an alternanting $k$ -tensor for each $x$ , then $\omega$ is called a differential form of order $k$ on $A$ . More generally, if $M$ is an $m$ -manifold in $\Bbb R^n$ then we define a $k$ -tensor field on $M$ to be a function $\omega$ assigning to each $p\in M$ an element of $\mathcal L^k\big(\mathcal T_p(M)\big)$ . If in fact $\omega(p)$ is alternanting for each $p$ then $\omega$ is called a differential form on $M$ . In particular any tensor field on $M$ can be extended to a tensor field defined on an open set of $\Bbb R^n$ containing $M$ but the proof is decidedly non-trivial. Definition Let $A$ be open in $\Bbb R^k$ ; let $\alpha:A\rightarrow\Bbb R^n$ be of class $C^\infty$ ; let $B$ be an open set of $\Bbb R^n$ containing $\alpha[A]$ . We define the pull-back $\alpha^*$ of $\alpha$ to be a linear transformation $$
\alpha^*:\Omega^l(B)\rightarrow\Omega^l(A)
$$ such that if $f$ is a zero form on $B$ then $$
[\alpha^*f](x):=f\big(\alpha(x)\big)
$$ for each $x\in A$ and if $\omega$ is a $l$ -formon $B$ with $l>0$ then $$
\big[(\alpha^*\omega)(x)\big]\big((x;\vec v_1),...,(x;\vec v_l)\big):=\big[\omega\big(\alpha(x)\big)\big]\big(\alpha_*(x;\vec v_1),...,\alpha_*(x;\vec v_l)\big)
$$ for each $x\in A$ and for each $\vec v_1,..,\vec v_k\in\Bbb R^k$ . Now having defined the differential operator $d$ for forms defined over an open set let's go to define it for forms defined over a manifold. So previously we observe that the pushforward of a coordinate patch is a injective function and thus if $\omega$ is a $l$ -form defined over a $k$ -manifold we define a $(l+1)$ -form $d\omega$ by letting that $$
\big[d\omega(y)\big]\big((y;\vec v_1),...,(y;\vec v_l),(y;\vec v_{l+1})\big):=\Big[d(\alpha^*\omega)\big(\alpha^{-1}(y)\big)\Big]\big((\alpha_*)^{-1}(y;\vec v_1),...,(\alpha_*)^{-1}(y;\vec v_l),(\alpha_*)^{-1}(y;\vec v_{l+1})\big)
$$ for any $y\in M$ and for any $\vec v_1,..,\vec v_k,\vec v_{l+1}\in\Bbb R^n$ such that $(y;\vec v_1),...,(y;\vec v_l),(y;\vec v_{l+1})\in\mathcal T_y(M)$ . So since the domain of a coordinate patch of an interior point is a open subset of $\Bbb R^k$ the above position is consistent with what is above defined; anyway if $y$ is a boundary poin of $M$ then the domain of any coordinate patch about $y$ is not open in $\Bbb R^k$ so that the pull-back of this cordinate system is not defined and moreover if it was defined apparently it would carry a differential forms defined over a manifold to differetial forms defined over an open subset in $H^k$ that is not open in $\Bbb R^k$ so that the form $d(\alpha^*\omega)$ would not be defined.

Let $E$ be an open subset of $\mathbf{R}^{n}$ , and let $f: E \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{m}$ be a twice continuously differentiable function on
E.

In his proof, he proves for the case $\fbox{m=1}$ and $x_0 = 0$ . The beginning of the proof is easily to understood: screenshot 2 Let $a$ be the number $a:=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}(0),$ and $a^{\prime}$ denote the quantity $a^{\prime}:=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{j}}(0) .$ Our task is to show that $a^{\prime}=a$ .
Let $\varepsilon>0$ . Because the double derivatives of $f$ are continuous, we can find a $\delta>0$ such that $$
\left|\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}(x)-a\right| \leq \varepsilon
$$ and $$
\left|\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{j}}(x)-a^{\prime}\right| \leq \varepsilon
$$ whenever $|x| \leq 2 \delta$ . Then comes the difficult part that I can't understand his notation: screenshot 3 Now we consider the quantity $$
X:=f\left(\delta e_{i}+\delta e_{j}\right)-f\left(\delta e_{i}\right)-f\left(\delta e_{j}\right)+f(0)
$$ From the fundamental theorem of calculus in the $e_{i}$ variable, we have $$
f\left(\delta e_{i}+\delta e_{j}\right)-f\left(\delta e_{j}\right)=\int_{0}^{\delta} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}\left(x_{i} e_{i}+\delta e_{j}\right) d x_{i}
\qquad\color{red}{(*)}$$ and $$
f\left(\delta e_{i}\right)-f(0)=\int_{0}^{\delta} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}\left(x_{i} e_{i}\right) d x_{i}
$$ and hence $$
X=\int_{0}^{\delta}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}\left(x_{i} e_{i}+\delta e_{j}\right)-\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}\left(x_{i} e_{i}\right)\right) d x_{i}.

( $i.e$ In my opinion, we consider $b = \delta \, . e_i + \delta \, .e_j$ and $a= \delta \, .e_j$ , so the limit of the integration should be from $a$ to $b$ which is different from what is written in the text: $0$ $\to$ $\delta$ ) Why the ""main"" function to integrate is $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}$ ? Why is it evaluated at the point ( $x_i*e_i + \delta * e_j$ )? Why the differential part in the integral is $dx_i$ ? Could you please suggest to me a $\fbox{document}$ or some $\fbox{keywords}$ so that I can read more to further understand the things related to the $\color{red}{(*)}$ equation? In the case where $m > 1$ , does the equation $\color{red}{(*)}$ still hold ? Is there any definition of integration of a vector-valued function? ( $i.e.$ $\int f dx$ where $f : \mathbb{R^n} \to \mathbb{R}^m$ with $m > 1$ and $x$ is a single variable. In other words, does an integration always take scalar- value or it can be a vector) ?
