1118183,How to adapt proof by contradiction showing that a sqrt(2) is irrational for sqrt(20)?,"This example is from Discrete Math and its Applications I understand the steps the author is taking. First he assumes sqrt(2) is rational meaning that there exists integers a, and b such that sqrt(2) = a/b, b!= 0, and that a and b have no common factors other than 1(lowest term). He takes algebraic steps to show that if sqrt(2) = a/b, a will be even and b will be even, meaning that this is a contradiction of the lowest term idea. By proof by contradiction, therefore the author has shown that sqrt(2) is irrational, or rational. I am trying to apply the the same proof to show that sqrt(20) is irrational. 
Here is my work so far I took the same steps as the author but I arrived at 10b^2 = 2c^2 while the author arrived at b^2 = 2c^2. The author was able to conclude that b must be even because the square of an odd must be an odd and the square of an even. I am not so sure I can conclude the same thing. What I can say is that 10b^2 will be even but b could be odd or even because even(10) * ood and even(10) * even is both even. What step should I take instead to show that sqrt(20) is irrational with a proof by contradiction?","['logic', 'proof-writing', 'discrete-mathematics', 'proof-verification']"

1118263,Expected outcome for repeated dice rolls with dice fixing,"Here is another dice roll question. The rules You start with $n$ dice, and roll all of them. You select one or more dice and fix them, i.e. their value will not change any more. You re-roll the other dice. Repeat that until all dice are fixed (after at most $n$ rounds). The final score is the sum of the values of all $n$ dice. Assume you want to maximize the expected score. The questions What is the expected score? Can the re-rolling strategy be easily phrased? Are there situations (possibly for slightly larger $n$ ) where you would re-roll a 6? Thoughts It seems to be counter-intuitive to re-roll a 6, but it would give you one extra roll for all other dice, so maybe it is worth it? Or is there an argument disproving this hypothesis, even without answering the first two questions?

1118286,"Is a ""network topology'"" a topological space?","Is there any connection between the computer science phrase "" network topology "" and the mathematical notion of a topological space (or, is there any other way to connect ""network topologies"" with formal definitions from the field of topology)? Example: I suppose that if one said ""there are two nodes A and B, and they are each connected to a third node C, and C is connected to a fourth node D, and D is node E and D is also connected to node F, and the names of A and B are ""A"" and ""B"", and the name of C is 'LAN router' and the name of D is 'ISP AP' and the name of E is 'Website 1' and the name of F is 'Website 2'"", then the mathematical name for that sort of structure would be a ""graph with labeled nodes"". In addition, if one assigned a directionality to each link, eg ""F > D, E > D, D > C, C > A, C > B"", then this would make it a ""directed graph with labeled nodes"". And if some nodes had multiple ports, and each node gave locally unique names to each port, that would induce a unique naming on edges (the name of an edge is the 4-tuple (source node's name, source node's port, destination node's name, destination node's port)), and you could call it a ""directed graph with labeled nodes and edges"". All of these appear to me to fit within the computer science term ""network topology"", and all of the mathematical terms given above which appear to be from ""graph theory"". I am just unclear if these have anything to do with the mathematical area of ""topology"". Also, does the phrase ""network topology"" have anything to do with ""topological graph theory"" or with abstract simplicial complexes? Possibly related: Etymology of ""topological sorting"" suggests that sometimes the word 'topology' is used in computer science in a sense unrelated (except historically) to the modern conception of topology. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory#History mentions various historical connections between topology and graph theory, but it is too general for me to tell specifically which topological definitions apply to graphs Near the top, Wikipedia:Network topology claims ""Essentially, it (network topology) is the topological structure of a network"". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_graph_theory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_simplicial_complex In a graph, connectedness in graph sense and in topological sense and Follow-up: Topology on graphs appear to connect graph theory and topology, but only for the purpose of results about connectedness, not more generally to justify a graph as being definitionally equivalent to a 'network topology'. i don't see how a graph can be usefully considered equivalent to a topological space because if one took nodes to be points and the open sets to be the neighbors of each point, then because the union of open sets is open, then by taking any two points which are disconnected from each other on the graph, one can take the union of their open sets and call it an open set.","['general-topology', 'graph-theory', 'computer-science']"
1118299,Existence of regular conditional distribution of random variable given the value of another variable,"Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathbf{P})$ be a probability space with a measurable function $Y: (\Omega, \mathcal{A}) \rightarrow (E, \mathcal{E})$ and another measurable function $X: (\Omega, \mathcal{A}) \rightarrow (E', \mathcal{E'})$. Let $\kappa_{Y\mid\sigma(X)}$ be a regular conditional distribution of $Y$ given $\sigma(X)$, i.e. a stochastic kernel from $(\Omega, \sigma(X))$ to $(E, \mathcal{E})$ such that $\kappa_{Y\mid\sigma(X)}(\omega, B)=\mathbf{P}[{Y \in B}\mid \sigma(X)](\omega)$ for $\mathbf{P}$-almost all $\omega\in\Omega$ and $B\in\mathcal{E}$. Can we infer from the existence of $\kappa_{Y\mid\sigma(X)}$ the existence of a regular conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$, i.e. a stochastic kernel $\kappa_{Y\mid X}$ from $(E', \mathcal{E}')$ to $(E, \mathcal{E})$, such that $\kappa_{Y\mid X}(x, B)=\mathbf{P}[{Y \in B}\mid X = x]$ for $P^X$-almost all $x$ and all $B\in\mathcal{E}$ ?

In the book Probability theory Klenke seems to suggest in definition 8.28 that a $\kappa_{Y\mid X}$ can be constructed from $\kappa_{Y\mid \sigma(X)}$ by applying the factorization lemma and defining $\kappa_{Y\mid X}(x, \centerdot)$ to an arbitrary probability measure for $x\notin X(\Omega)$. Dembo seems to argue similarly in the solution to exercise 4.4.5 in his lecture notes . However, the factorization lemma only seems applicable for a fixed $B\in \mathcal{E}$, i.e. for each $B$ we can obtain an $f_B: E' \rightarrow E$ such that $\kappa_{Y\mid \sigma(X)}(\centerdot, B) = f_B \circ X(\centerdot)$, and I don't see how a definition like $\kappa_{Y\mid X}(x, B):= f_B(x)$ ensures that $\kappa_{Y\mid X}(x, \centerdot)$ is a probability measure for a fixed $x$.

$$ [x,i,a] \mapsto [f(x),j,\partial(\theta_jf\psi^{-1}_i)(\psi_i(x))a] $$
Since this is independent of $i,j$, there is a well-defined map $\mathscr{T}f: \mathscr{T}\mathcal{M} \to \mathscr{T}\mathcal{N}$, so that if $f(x) = y$, $\mathscr{T}_xf: \mathscr{T}_x\mathcal{M} \to \mathscr{T}_y\mathcal{N}$. Now my two questions are, why must we require that $f(U_i) \subset V_j$ for our open coverings? Also, why is the map $(\mathscr{T}f)_{ij}$ independent of $i,j$?

1118365,Order of any element divides the largest order.,"Let $A$ be a finite Abelian group and let $k$ be the largest order of elements in A. Prove that the order of every element divides $k$. This is my attempt, I sense there is something wrong\incorrect in it, but I can't figure out what....Also I didn't use that fact that $A$ is abelian... I would appreciate you reply. $Attempt$: $|G|=n$. Suppose there is an element $a\in A$ of order $m$ that does not divide $k$. $k$ is the largest order of elements in $A$, therefore there exist $g\in A$ such that $o(g)=k$. $(ag)^m=g^m\ne 1$ and $(ag)^k=a^k\ne 1$ (that follows from the commutativity of A). The order of $ag$ has to be some $p$, where $p$| lcm$(m,k)$. If $lcm(m,k)=p$ then $(ag)^p=(ag)^{mt}=1$ where $mt=p,p\in \Bbb{N}$. But $(ag)^{mt}=((ag)^m)^t=(g^m)^t=g^{mt}=1$, but since $t$ is the smallest natural number that fulfills it, $mt=k$, i.e, $m$ divides $k$.

For example randomly converting an ode to S-L form . It looks to me that GF & S-L theory very naturally arise when you convert the ode to a Fredholm integral equation, as in it looks so obvious these methods are the only thing to use. Further there are some Fredholm theorems that apparently justify what you're doing. My question, is it 'correct' to view S-L (homogeneous) & GF (inhomogeneous) theory as actually being part of the theory of integral equations, not differential equations, and to view the Fredholm theorems as the real source of justification for things like Fourier, Legendre polynomials being orthogonal and complete, the spectral theorem being an integral equation theorem?

Show that if $x_1, x_2, ... , x_n$ are $n$ real numbers such that $-1 \le x_i \le 0$ for each $1 \le i \le n$, then $$(1 + x_1)(1 + x_2)...(1 + x_n) \ge 1 + x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n$$ I am using a proof by induction, but I am unable to complete it. I would appreciate any tips on how I could finish the proof. Incomplete Proof Let $P(n)$ be the proposition that $(1 + x_1)(1 + x_2)...(1 + x_n) \ge 1 + \sum_{i = 1} ^ n x_i$. When $n = 1$, LHS = RHS = $1 + x_i$. Clearly $1 + x_i \ge 1 + x_i$ and so $P(1)$ is true. Assume that $P(k)$ is true, i.e. $(1 + x_1)(1 + x_2)...(1 + x_k) \ge 1 + \sum_{i=1}^k x_i$. Case 1 Suppose $x_{k + 1}  = -1$. Then $1 + x_{k + 1} = 0$, hence LHS = $(1 + x_1)(1 + x_2)...(1 + x_k)(1 + x_{k+1}) = 0$. RHS = $1 + x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k - 1 = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k$ which is always nonpositive since each $x_i$ is nonpositive. Hence RHS $\le 0$ and so LHS $\ge$ RHS. Case 2 Suppose $x_{k+1} = 0$. Then $1 + x_{k+1} = 1$, hence multiplying it to LHS does not change anything. Also, adding $x_{k+1}$ to RHS does not change anything. Therefore, LHS $\ge$ RHS still holds.

I can construct a function from the rational unit interval into rationals easily. So, If I can find a $1-1$ correspondence from real unit interval into reals that transform irrationals into irrationals, I can construct the required function easily. Now I assume that I can find a function $g$ mapping rationals into rationals. Now For irrationals:
I can transform irrationals of $\mathbb{R}-(0,1)$ into $(0.1,1)$ as follows, suppose $a_ma_{m-1}..a_1.b_1b_2...$ is an irrational real number whose integer part is $a_ma_{m-1}..a_1$. Now consider $0.a_ma_{m-1}a_{m-2}...a_2a_1b_1b_2......$ as its image under the transformation. It seems that this is another irrational which lies between $0.1 $and $1$, notice that $a_m\ne 0$, So we still have $(0.0.1)$ to be used. Now for $x\in (0,1)$, we can  embed them into $(0,0.1)$. Suppose $0.c_1c_2c_3...$ is an irrational between zero and $1$. its image is $0.0c_1c_2c_3...$. So we can transform all irrationals of reals into irrationals of the open unit interval. we call this transformation $h$. Now consider $f:(0,1)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $f(x)=h(x)$ if $x$ is irrational, $f(x)=g(x)$ otherwise. My main question: Is my construction valid? If not, why?

\end{align} My knowledge is that we can construct a product space by considering $X_i$ independents. The new measure is then the product measure : 
\begin{align}
\lambda = P_{X_1} \otimes P_{X_2}
\end{align} I also know that if we have the space $(\mathbb{R}^2, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^2), P)$, the existence of regular conditional probability tells us that :
\begin{align}
P(A\times B) = \int_B p(A|\omega)dP_1 = \int_A p(B|\omega)dP_2
\end{align}
Where $P_i\; i = 1,2$ are the marginal measure of $P$. So if the space is the product space generated by $\lambda = P_{X_1} \otimes P_{X_2}$ we have : 
\begin{align}
P(A\times B) =& \int_B p(A|\omega)dP_{X_1} = \\
=& \int_B P_{X_2}(A)dP_{X_1} \\
=& P_{X_2}(A)\int_B dP_{X_1} \\
=& P_{X_2}(A)P_{X_1}(B)
\end{align} My questions are : 1) if $P_{X_i}$ are not independent, how goes the construction of the product measure ? 2) Can we construct a probability space where $P_{X_i}$ are marginals of a special measure retaining the fact that they are dependent ? 3) More specifically, I want to know how to construct a product probability space starting from some measures in a general way. Without knowing if the measure are independent or not.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"
1119869,Every countably generated sigma algebra is generated by a random variable,"Suppose I have a sigma algebra which is countably generated. I want to find a random variable such that it is generated by that random variable. If the countable class is just a single set then my random variable is indicator function. But, how to do in this case ? If we sum up all the indicators to define our random variable then the sum may diverge. How to make sure it converge ?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'probability', 'real-analysis']"

Let $Y_n = \sup_{k \geq n} E(X_k | F_n)$. Show that (1) $Y_n$ is a martingale (2) $X_n \leq Y_n$ for all $n$ a.s.

(2) seems quite obvious because we can take $k = n$. I'm not sure how to do (3) and (4). Does anyone have idea how to solve (1),(3),(4) ?

1119872,"On average, how many times must I roll a dice until I get a $6$?","On average, how many times must I roll a dice until I get a $6$? I got this question from a book called Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability. The answer is $6$, and I understand the solution the book has given me. However, I want to know why the following logic does not work: The chance that we do not get a $6$ is $5/6$. In order to find the number of dice rolls needed, I want the probability of there being a $6$ in $n$ rolls being $1/2$ in order to find the average. So I solve the equation $(5/6)^n=1/2$, which gives me $n=3.8$-ish. That number makes sense to me intuitively, where the number $6$ does not make sense intuitively. I feel like on average, I would need to roll about $3$-$4$ times to get a $6$. Sometimes, I will have to roll less than $3$-$4$ times, and sometimes I will have to roll more than $3$-$4$ times. Please note that I am not asking how to solve this question, but what is wrong with my logic above. Thank you!","['dice', 'probability', 'expectation']"
1119894,Name of isometric invariant in Gauss-Bonnet,"Does the tangential rotation term $ \int k_g ds $ of Gauss-Bonnet theorem ( for continuous or discontinuous lines on a surface) have a name or symbol in differential geometry ? The second term $ \int K dA $ integral curvature and the topological invariant  Euler characteristic have identifiable names. EDIT1: $ \int k_g ds $, the 'Boundary Rotation' if you will, is defined here for tangent developable Frills with zero Gauss curvature. They are  $ 2 \pi $ for flat disc rim, 4 EllipticE(-1/2) for the Viviani Frill and favorite 'Twisted Frill1' of mine, 8 EllipticE(-1/4).They are tangential to the North-South Polar axis. Can be made by cutting and pasting flexible rings of Boundary Rotation $ >2 \pi.$ Appreciate anyone coming up with paper/thin plastic models to post it here.",['differential-geometry']
