986964,how to related a weakly convergent random variable with its k-th moment,"Let $\{X_n\}$ be independent random sequence with zero mean and unit variance.
  Suppose $$S_n:=\sum_{m=1}^n \frac{X_m}{\sqrt{n}} \Rightarrow X\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$$ holds. (Here ""$\Rightarrow$"" means weakly convergence); Is it true that for given $k>0$, its kth moment
  $$
E[S_n^k] \rightarrow E[X^k] ?
$$ [Approach 1]
This seems very related to the Central Limit Theorem flavor. I first try to using the definition $S_n \Rightarrow X$, then I can say for any bounded and continuous function $g$, I have
$$E[g(S_n)] \to E[g(X)]$$
but if I pick $g(x):=x^k$ which is NOT bounded... [Approach 2] 
On the other hand, I also try another approach like this: I exploit the fact that ""if $S_n \Rightarrow X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$, then the characteristic function $\phi_{S_n}(t) \rightarrow \phi_X(t)$ for all $t$"". So if I observe 
$$\begin{array}{l}
{\phi _{{S_n}}}\left( t \right) = E\left[ {{e^{it{S_n}}}} \right] \to E\left[ {{e^{itX}}} \right] = {\phi _X}\left( t \right)\\
 \Rightarrow {\phi _{{S_n}^k}}\left( t \right) = E\left[ {{e^{ikt{S_n}}}} \right] \to E\left[ {{e^{iktX}}} \right] = {\phi _{{X^k}}}\left( t \right)
\end{array}$$
Hence, I get for all $t$
$$E\left[ {{e^{ikt{S_n}}}} \right] \to E\left[ {{e^{iktX}}} \right]$$
but I still stuck to conclude further to get the following desired result
$$
E[S_n^k] \rightarrow E[X^k] ?

987219,Mean Value Theorem Confusion.,"In H. Cartan 's Differential Calculus , Theorem 3.1.1 is called the Mean Value Theorem and is stated as: Theorem: Let $f:[a,b]\to\mathbf R^n$ and $g:[a,b]\to\mathbf R$ be two functions which are continuous on $[a,b]$  and differentiable on $(a,b)$.
  Assume that $\|f'(x)\|\leq g'(x)$ for all $x\in(a,b)$.
  Then $\|f(b)-f(a)\|\leq g(b)-g(a)$. On the other hand, the universally known (Lagrange's) Mean Value Theorem states that Theorem: Let $f:[a,b]\to\mathbf R$ be a function which is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$.
  Then there exists $c\in(a,b)$ such that $(f(b)-f(a))/(b-a)=f'(c)$. Since they are both being called Mean Value Theorems, I think may be one follows easily from the other. But I fail to see the connection. Can somebody please shed some light on this. Thanks.","['derivatives', 'real-analysis']"

As expected most walks can be found in the area around the expected absolute distance curve up to 2 standard deviations from it.

From what little I understand of statistics very few random walks should be found above this line - 95% rule (and indeed my graphs confirm this).

For example, prepending $1^n0$ to a number of string length $n$ is one such scheme that requires $2 * n + 1$ characters to represent a number of length $n$. A better solution is the following: $f(x) = 1^{string\_length(g(x))}0g(x)00x$, where $g(x)$ is an encoding of the length of $x$ that avoids the number pattern $00$. Such a $g$ can be constructed as a bitset encoding of set of Fibonacci numbers that is not missing more than one consecutive Fibonacci number where the sum of the numbers in the set is equal to the string length of $x$. With this definition, $g(x)$ will have at most $log_\phi(string\_length(x))$ characters, so the total encoding of a number of length $n$ will require no more than $n + 2 * \log_\phi n + 3$ characters. This process can be iterated one or more times to achieve a bound of $n + \log_\phi n + o(\log_\phi n)$. As a further optimization, we can avoid the intervening zeros and increase the base of the $\log$ by deducing the length of the prepended padding. Consider the following scheme, which has two iterations of ""length-prepending"" compared to just one iteration above and uses $|x|$ to represent $string\_length(x)$ (ceiling operations omitted): $f(x) = 1^{\lg \lg |x|} 0 (\lg \lg |x|) (\lg |x|) x.$ Again the process can be iterated to shrink coefficient for the low order iterated log term (and we can remove one character by omitting the most-significant bit of the $\lg \lg |x|$ portion). How close is this to optimal? Is there a better solution that requires significantly less overhead?

988379,Concrete and elementary applications of modular forms to elliptic curves,"What are some useful facts/algorithms for elliptic curves that can be obtained (proved completely) using the theory of modular forms without heavy machinery? It's often been asked what elementary applications of modular forms are (partition congruences, counting solutions to quadratic forms...) and while these are all interesting, to me they don't capture the most compelling number theoretic reason we study modular forms, which is to apply them to elliptic curves (and Galois representations, but that's a different question). Modular forms are essential to the theory of elliptic curves, but the typical applications rely on very deep theorems (Fermat's last theorem, modularity theorem, Birch-and-Swinnerton Dyer Conjecture, Sato-Tate...). Can we obtain some concrete number theoretic information about elliptic curves without relying on these deep theorems? Here is an example of what I am looking for. The theory of elliptic functions is useful for elliptic curves because, for instance, they describe all isogenies between elliptic curves over subfields of $\mathbb C$, and can also be used to compute the isogenies explicitly, by writing $\wp (\alpha z)$ as a rational function of $\wp (z)$. This gives us very concrete information. Treat the word ""elementary"" relatively--probably nothing here is going to be easy. In particular, we can't say anything about all elliptic curves; we can only say things about particular elliptic curves. One first has to find an elliptic curve associated to a modular form before one can get information, and so probably has to invoke Eichler-Shimura in some form. There are, however, examples where one can compute the elliptic curve associated to a modular form relatively easily. For example, in Knapp's Elliptic Curves he computes that the elliptic curve associated with the eigenform $f\in S_2(\Gamma_0(11))$ is $E: y^2+y=x^3-x^2-10x-20$, and there is a map $X_0(11)\to E(\mathbb C)$. (This is easy because $S_2(\Gamma_0(11))$ is 1-dimensional with genus 1.)

988409,How do I find a constant for a polynomial so its roots are reflective around a linear function?,"How can I find all complex numbers $w$ so that the roots of the following polynomial are reflected around a linear function $f(x)$ $$p(q) = q^2-4q+w = 0$$ If I want to find all the complex numbers $w$ , for which the roots of the polynomials are reflective around, say $f(x) = -x+2$ , how would I go about doing that? Mark my words! The text below is a bit confusing, just showing my work if it lights any spark in someone's mind, hopefully it does! I really want to solve this problem, seems like something that would be very useful to know how to solve. I have been playing around and noticed some few things. If we have a function $g(x)$ which is perpendicular to $f(x)$ then all roots in a polynomial must either come in pair as points on $g(x)$ line OR a root will be sitting on the $f(x)$ line [double root?] ; this is the requirement for the condition in the title of this question This means in my case that all roots will be in the form of $\alpha=r\cdot e^{i\cdot(\pi/4+k\pi)}+ z$ where $z$ is the point at which $f(x) = g(x)$ . And $r=\sqrt{(\alpha_1-\Re z)^2+(\alpha_1-\Im z)^2}$ , where $\alpha_1$ is a root. The reason behind this is that the perpendicular function $g$ would have a negated slope from $f$ which in my case had the slope of $-1\cdot x\implies g(x) = x + m$ where $m$ would be chosen according to a root found. Drawing this, one easily sees the roots must be found at $\theta=\pi/4\ or\ -3\pi/4$ with mid-point in $z$ , and a radius of $r$ . I have also tried using Vietas formulas with no luck as Vietas formulas requires all coefficients to be known for a full solution. (Obviously) Edit 1. I might add! I'm still looking for a complete solution for all possible $w$ where the roots of $p$ are reflective around $f(x) = -x+2$","['algebra-precalculus', 'polynomials', 'linear-algebra', 'complex-numbers', 'complex-analysis']"

  be a sequence of square integrable random variables on the probability space $\left(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P\right)$

  such that, for every $t\geq1$
 , $X_{n_{k}}\left(t\right)\longrightarrow X\left(t\right)$
  almost surely? I worked out a proof that seems to be sound, but I'm not sure of a couple of passage I did. The proof is as follows. I indicate inside parenthesis the passage I am not sure about. First I claim that $$\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}E\left(\left(X_{n}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right)^{2}\right)\rightarrow0\Rightarrow P\left[\sup_{t}\left|X_{n}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right|>\epsilon\right]\rightarrow0
 $$ for every $\epsilon>0
 $. Proof of the claim. I prove the counterpositive. Suppose that there exist $\epsilon,\delta>0$ such that, for every $\bar{n}$, there exists an $n\left(\bar{n}\right)\geq\bar{n}$ such that $$P\left[\sup_{t}\left|X_{n\left(\bar{n}\right)}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right|>\epsilon\right]\geq\delta.$$
Then it must be true that (this the passage I am not sure about) $$P\left[\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\left(X_{n\left(\bar{n}\right)}\left(t\right)-X_{n\left(\bar{n}\right)}\left(t\right)\right)^{2}\geq\epsilon^{2}\right]\geq\delta.$$
Call $E=\left[\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\left(X_{n\left(\bar{n}\right)}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right)^{2}\geq\epsilon^{2}\right]\in\mathcal{F}$. We have: $$\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}E\left(\left(X_{n\left(\bar{n}\right)}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right)^{2}\right)	=	E\left(\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\left(X_{n\left(\bar{n}\right)}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right)^{2}\right)
\geq\int_{E}\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\left(X_{n\left(\bar{n}\right)}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}P	\geq	\epsilon^{2}\delta.$$ Then, for every $\bar{n}$, there exists an $n\left(\bar{n}\right)\geq\bar{n}$ such that $$\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}E\left(\left(X_{n\left(\bar{n}\right)}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right)^{2}\right)\geq\epsilon^{2}\delta$$ and this completes the proof of the claim. $\square$ Now I show that if $P\left[\sup_{t}\left|X_{n}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right|>\epsilon\right]\rightarrow0$
  then there exists a subsequence $\left(\left(X_{n_{k}}\left(t\right)\right)_{t\in\mathbb{N}}\right)_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\subseteq\left(\left(X_{n}\left(t\right)\right)_{t\in\mathbb{N}}\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$
  such that $$\sup_{t}\left|X_{n_{k}}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right|\longrightarrow0\qquad\mbox{a.s.}$$
 First observe that, for every $k>0$
, there exists an integer $n_{k}$
 such that$$P\left[\sup_{t}\left|X_{n_{k}}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right|>\frac{1}{k}\right]\leq\frac{1}{2^{k}}.$$
 This implies that$$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P\left[\sup_{t}\left|X_{n_{k}}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right|>\frac{1}{k}\right]<\infty.$$
 Finally, observe that, for every $\epsilon>0$
, $$\left[\sup_{t}\left|X_{n_{k}}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right|>\epsilon\,\mbox{i.o.}\right]\subseteq\left[\sup_{t}\left|X_{n_{k}}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right|>\frac{1}{k}\,\mbox{i.o.}\right],$$
 so that$$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P\left[\sup_{t}\left|X_{n_{k}}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right|>\frac{1}{k}\right]<\infty		
\Rightarrow P\left[\sup_{t}\left|X_{n_{k}}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right|>\frac{1}{k}\,\mbox{i.o.}\right]=0		
\Rightarrow P\left[\sup_{t}\left|X_{n_{k}}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right|>\epsilon\,\mbox{i.o.}\right]=0		\forall\epsilon>0
\Rightarrow\sup_{t}\left|X_{n_{k}}\left(t\right)-X\left(t\right)\right|\rightarrow0		\mbox{a.s.}$$

988489,"What happens when you drop ""étale"" from the construction of étale fundamental groups","Haven't thought about this deeply; it just came up at lunch and I wondered if anyone knew the answer. To define the étale fundamental group of a scheme $X$, we fix a point $x_0 \in X$, look at the category $\mathcal{C}$ of finite étale morphisms to $X$, take the functor $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathsf{Set}$ which takes a element $Y \xrightarrow{f} X \in \operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ to the fiber $f^{-1}(x_0)$.  $F$ is pro-representable, and taking automorphisms gives us $\pi^{ét}_1(X, x_0)$. Suppose we drop the étale condition in the definition of $\mathcal{C}$, so that we're looking at branched covers instead of unramified ones.  Presumably we'll need to define $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathsf{Sch}$ as taking scheme-theoretic fibers.
