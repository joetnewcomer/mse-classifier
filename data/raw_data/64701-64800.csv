753867,"Proving that if $n\times n$ Hadamard matrix exists, then 4 divides $n$","Im looking for an explanation of the following: a standard way to prove that, if there exists Hadamard matrix of dimension $n > 2$, then $4|n$, is to suppose that without loss of generality every column of the matrix starts with +. (Otherwise, one can multiply the column by -1, which doesn't change the Hadamard property). Then there are only 4 possibilities of how the first three entries of each column look like: +++, ++-, +-+ and +--. Let's say there's $a$ columns of the first type, $b$ of the second, $c$ and $d$ of third and fourth respectively. Obviously, since the matrix is $n\times n$, we obtain $a+b+c+d=n$. But here comes the point of confusion: the final step says that because of the orthogonality relations we also obtain 3 more relations:
$$ a + b - c - d = 0 $$
$$ a + c - b - d = 0 $$
$$ a - b - c + d = 0 $$ which all put together yields $4a=n$. Im not sure, how can ""number of columns of some type"" be mixed with the fact that every two columns are orthogonal? How do we obtain these 3 relations? This might be a stupid question, but I can't really see something that might be obvious. (How come the orthogonal property of the columns can yield something like ""number of type 1 columns + number of type 2 columns - number of type 3 columns - number of type 4 columns"" = 0 ??)","['matrices', 'proof-explanation', 'abstract-algebra', 'combinatorics']"

753875,Is my conjecture correct? Any advice on how to solve this conjecture?,"I was doing problem 6.3 from here . To make this less programming and more math oriented: GCDMany is equivalent to using Euclid's method (using mods and NOT subtraction) on an arbitrary number of elements. The problem essentially wants me to calculate how many times I have to recursively call GCDMany given numbers that are $n$ bits long (i.e. 3 (11) is 2 bits long, 1 (1) is 1 bit long 0 (0) is 1 bit long and so on). The GCDMany upper bound ultimately given was $2n$ as you can see in the answer. I believe I came up with a tighter upper bound. I did a bit of experimenting with this program I made to test values: from itertools import combinations
for i in range(1, 25+1): #1 to 200 bits
    j = range(i)
    best = 0
    for c in combs:
        count = gcd_many(list(c))[1] if count > best:
    best = count
print best First off, I realized after experimenting the worst case scenario always seemed to be when GCDMany was passed only two numbers, making my testing essentially concerned with only the standard GCD function. My logic was: Given there is a longest recursive call, any addition of numbers would result in a path less than or equal to the current path, hence 2 numbers would be the worse case. My program came up with the following: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 ... Using OEIS.org I found a series of closed forms for it. Most notably this one seemed legit: $$a(n) = \frac{6n - 1 + (-1)^n}{4}$$ Can anyone confirm or deny my upper bound, and possibly help me figure out what I can do to prove my conjecture if it is correct?","['discrete-mathematics', 'number-theory']"

  establish the convergence of this series. Dirichlet's test cannot be used because the partial sums generated by (1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, ...) are not bounded.

Now, i have another way to introduce multiplication of cosets and i want to relate to this one. 2 - We can introduce multiplication of cosets of K, based on the product of group subsets ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_of_group_subsets ) , which gives us some results like KK=K and from that we can easily prove that if K is normal then the multiplication of two cosets of K yields another coset of K : (xK)(vK) = xKvK = x(Kv)K = x(vK)K = xvK. Now, my main doubt. Here, did we only proved closure of the function ( in the Quotient Group )and do we still have to prove it's well-defined ? Or in this approach, we don't need to prove the function is well-defined, because this is already embedded in the definition ? Help me clarify :   In the first introduction, we assumed multiplication of cosets was closed in the Quotient Group, and had to prove it was also well-defined in case K is normal.

754449,"Is there any distinction between these products: scalar, dot, inner?","I hope you will forgive a math question that comes up in physics contexts where language is loose.  This question migrated from Physics SE. I'm finding that I sometimes don't know what kind of product a physics author means. There is a product which can be defined on a vector space that takes two vectors and returns a scalar.  There is a product that takes a vector and a covector and returns a scalar. Is there an agreed-upon language for distinctions between the three words ""scalar product"", ""dot product"", and ""inner product""? I can mostly gloss over the language as it's usually clear from context.  But not always. Addition: I think we can all agree what a scalar product is:  a map taking two vectors and returning a scalar.  A vector space does not have to have a scalar product.  To have a scalar product, a vector space needs a metric. And we can all agree that there is a "" contraction "" taking one member of a vector space, and one member of it dual, and retuning a scalar, where the dual can be considered to be a scalar-valued linear function on the vector space.  Does this ""product"" have a name? What I would like to know: what are the definitions of ""dot product"" and ""inner product""? Addition #2: A commenter (@Hunter) cited a link that points out that physics authors do not all agree on what an inner product is.   The following quotation is cited:  ""If the inner product is taken of two vectors, one must be a contravariant vector and the other a covariant vector. The inner product of two covariant or two contravariant vectors is not defined."" [Spherical Astronomy, Robin Michael Green page 495.]  Some say the inner product takes $V^*\times V$ into scalars, others say $V \times V$.  (Consensus among physicists here is that ""inner"" = ""scalar"", i.e. the domain for both is $V \times V$., and ""dot"" = ""scalar"", usually reserved for Euclidean geometry.) Furthermore, most quantum mechanics texts call $\langle\psi\mid\chi\rangle$ an inner product, whereas by my understanding this is a mapping of one bra and one ket to scalars:  a contraction of a vector with its dual.  I understand that there is an isomorphism in this case, so there is no ambiguity, but the terminology adds to confusion. One thing is certain: some authors don't tell us which definition they are using, and it's sometimes not clear from context.

Additionally, since the curvature is constant on the whole of $S$, every direction is a principle direction (of sorts; this might be the flaw in my argument), so any curve is a line of curvature.  But, $C$ is not a segment of a great circle on $S$, so it is not a geodesic.) Prove that a curve $C ⊂ S$ is both an asymptotic curve and a geodesic if and only if $C$ is a (segment of a) straight line. Can I have some hints?  I am not very good at covariant derivatives yet, so hand-holding with detailed examples there would be nice.",['differential-geometry']

754512,Slice of a coordinate system in a manifold,"In the book - Foundations of differentiable manifolds and Lie groups by Frank Warner, the definition of a slice is as under. Suppose that $(U,\phi)$ is a coordinate system on $M$ (dimension $d$) with coordinate functions $x_1,...,x_d$, and that $c$ is an integer such that $0\leq c\leq d$. Let $a=(a_1,...,a_d)\in\phi(U)$, and let $S=\{q\in U\ :\ x_i(q)=a_i,i=c+1,...d\}$. Then the subspace $S$ of $M$ together with the coordinate system $\{x_j|_S:j=1,...,c\}$ forms a manifold which is a submanifold of $M$ called a slice of the coordinate system $(U,\phi)$. Now, it seems to me that, even though in the definition we are fixing the last few coordinates, we could do the same to any random coordinates (not necessarily the last few) and still we would get a slice (if we can call that one). Warner next proves a proposition that : Let $\psi:M^c\longrightarrow N^d$ be an immersion and let $m\in M$. Then there exists a cubic centered coordinate system $(V,\phi)$ about $\psi(m)$ and a neighbourhood $U$ of $m$ such that $\psi|_U$ is 1:1 and $\psi(U)$ is a slice of $(V,\phi)$. He follows this by a remark in which I have a doubt. The remark is as follows I don't understand this example. Isn't $\psi(M)\cap V$ a union of two slices, the x-axis portion and the y-axis portion?

754720,Why is the inverse of the Devil's Staircase not measurable?,"I recently did an exercise to show that a monotone function $f:X→ℝ $ is Borel measurable  (it even only asked for Lebesgue measurability). On the other hand, the inverse of the Devil's Staircase function created from the ternary Cantor set is not Borel measurable (stated but not proven in class so not sure about this); does this mean that this function(after choosing the image of the Cantor set appropriately) is not monotone?  Is it not the limit of monotone functions and therefore (weakly) monotone?
$\newcommand{\cantor}{\mathcal{C}}$ Edit: By 'inverse of the Devil's Staircase', function $g$ defined as follows(I am largely copying from my handwritten lecture notes). First note that for $x$ written in ternary, if $x∈ \cantor$ then it has no 1s in its ternary expansion, so it can be written $x = \sum_1^∞  \frac{ε_n}{3^n}$ for $ε_n∈ \{ 0,2\}$ (which is effectively a unique representation); then the Devil's Staircase $f$ maps this to $$ f(x) = \sum_1^∞ \frac{ε_n/2}{2^n}$$ To obtain the 'inverse', first write some $y$ in the image as $\sum_1^∞ \frac{ε_n}{2^n}$ for $ ε_n ∈ \{0,1\} $. If $y$ is not of the form $\frac{c}{2^n}$ for some naturals $c,n$, define $$g(x) = \sum_1^∞ \frac{2ε_n}{3^n}$$ This gives $gf(x) = x$ for $x$ in $\cantor$ and $fg(y) = y$ for $y$ not of the form $\frac{c}{2^n}$. For $y$ of that form, set $g(y) = \sup\{ g(y_0) : y_0 < y  \}$ to try and make it monotone. Now $g$ was claimed to be non-(Borel) measurable, which I can believe for now. But it seems to me that it is monotone, which can't be by the above exercise. Where does it fail to be monotone?","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'functions']"

intercept at $y = \frac{b}{d} $ vertical asymptote at $x = \frac{-d}{c} $
horizontal asymptote at $y = \frac{a}{c}$ When finding the root, you get $0 = \frac{3}{8x - 3}$ and then $0 = 3$ which is not true, therefore this must mean the curve does not cut the x-axis?

754818,Conformal equivalence of resistance,"Link to the question in the physics portal. I'm currently working on a system that uses a logarithmic and a Schwarz-Christoffel transformation to calculate the resistance of a specific area. With resistance I mean the resistance that would apply to that area if it were between two equipotential irregular plates (which are defined by their vertices). In my case it is the magnetic reluctance but it is analogous to electrical resistance . Right click on the image and choose the appropriate option to view a larger image or click here I have multiple areas of the canonical domain that have to be translated to a resistance value in the physical domain(with the intermediate step of a logarithm). Is the resistance (defined analogous to electrical resitance) that can be calculated in the homogeneous field of the canonical domain directly related to the resitance in the phyisical domain? The geometry of a resistor in the canonical domain is a simple rectangle formed from four prevertices. In the physical domain it is far more complicated (see figure). The measure of resistance can be formulated with the help of an ""equivalent length"". Could it be that this $\Lambda$ is not affected by the conformal tranformations?
\begin{align}
&R=\rho\dfrac{1}{\Lambda}\\
&\text{cylinder gives: } &\Lambda_\text{cyl}=\frac{2\pi \ell}{\log\frac{r_2}{r_1}}\\
&\text{cuboid gives: } &\Lambda_\text{cub}=\dfrac{A}{\ell}
\end{align} I have done some calculations by discretising the physical domain and comparing it to the resistance generated in the canonical domain. The results were comparable, maybe because of accident, maybe because of a strong mathematical implication, I can't say. Question in short: Can the prevertices that define a rectangle in the canonical domain define the resistance value of the mapped rectangle in the phyisical domain. (With the intermidate step of a logarithm) I use the SC-Toolbox for Matlab created by Tobin A. Driscoll. EDIT: Addition Lets say that we have a rectangle which has been rotated and translated (Möbius transformations if you want) so that its sides are perpendiculary oriented to the real and imaginary axis, one of its vertices is (0,0) and that it is in the 1st quadrant. We have to calculate its resistance. Lets say the opposite vertex of (0,0) is $z=x+iy=|z|e^{i\varphi}$, the imaginary part of $z$ represents the length of the path, while the real part represents the projected area(the area is only visible in 3D, we are looking at it in 2D). We write $R'$ because of the 2D representation. The resistance of this rectangle will therefore be:
\begin{align}
R'=\rho \frac{\mathfrak{Im}(z)}{\mathfrak{Re}(z)}
\end{align}
Which can be written as:
\begin{align}
R'&=\rho \frac{|z|\sin\varphi}{|z|\cos\varphi}=\rho \frac{\sin\varphi}{\cos\varphi}\\
R'&=\rho\tan\varphi
\end{align} The thing that the resistance is only dependent on the angle $\varphi$ and the definition of conformal transformations as angle preserving , provoked me to ask this question. I found a lot about space being conformally invariant, but in this case it is a function that is discussed. I'm not sure how to proceed. I can prove that the transformations(maps) are conformal, but I don't know what to do about a function in the canonical space.","['conformal-geometry', 'complex-analysis']"

How else can one prove isomorphism? (perhaps more importantly is this actually true; of course my difficulty would be easiest explained if this is false!) Edit: Outline of my 'proof': $\varphi((gH,h))(fH,k)) = \varphi((gH,h))\varphi((fH,k)) = ghfk$ and $\varphi((gH,h)(fH,k)) = \varphi((gfH,hk)) = gfhk$. Hence $\varphi$ is multiplicative iff $G$ abelian. Next, $(gH,h)^{-1} = (g^{-1}H, h^{-1})$, so $\varphi((gH,h)^{-1}) = \varphi((g^{-1}H, h^{-1})) = g^{-1}h^{-1} = (hg)^{-1} = (gh)^{-1} = \varphi((gH,h))^{-1}$. This again relied on $G$ being abelian, and shows that $\varphi$ is a homomorphism. Now $\varphi(gH,h) = 1 \iff g=1$ and $h=1$; so $\ker(\varphi)=(H,1)$ and so $\varphi$ is injective. Lastly, $\varphi(gH,1)\mapsto g$ is a surjection onto $G-H$ and $\varphi(H,h)\mapsto h$ is a surjection onto $H$. Therefore the image of $\varphi$ is $G-H \cup H = G$ This is why I believe that I have an isomorphism; I would be grateful if you could point out its errors!","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

This turned out to be extremely useful, as we could prove general things about linear operations over vector spaces and apply them to a surprisingly wide array of systems with linear properties.  One of the interesting things about this was that you could define a series of unique real number coordinates for a given series of independent basis vectors in the system. It struck me the other day that there is an interesting, albeit slightly different pattern in the natural numbers.  Any natural number can be written as the product of natural powers of primes.  In a sense, it seems like the primes form a kind of 'basis' for the natural numbers, with the series of powers being a kind of 'coordinate'. Is there is a name for this pattern? If so, are there are other kinds of sets that can be decomposed as products of powers in this way, with similar generic results we can deduce for how these 'products of independent factors' behave? I apologize for the lack of clarity here, but my unfamiliarity with the terminology makes it difficult to describe.","['prime-factorization', 'linear-algebra', 'soft-question']"
755597,Is the inverse of a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix also a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix?,"If we let $$S_{++}^n(\mathbb{R})$$ denote the set of all square symmetric positive definite matrix over the real numbers, then is it true if $A\in S_{++}(\mathbb{R}) \implies A^{-1} \in S_{++}(\mathbb{R})$? EDIT Never mind, if the eigenvalues of $A^{-1}$ are the inverse of $A$ So $A \in S_{++}  \iff A ^{-1} \in S_{++}$. This answers my own question.","['linear-algebra', 'analysis']"
755630,How to find opposite and adjacent lengths of a right triangle given the hypotenuse and angle?,I'm writing a few functions for a JavaScript game engine.  Is it possible to calculate the length of the legs of a right triangle given ONLY the length of the hypotenuse and an angle?,"['trigonometry', 'triangles']"
755643,Solutions for quartic,"Suppose I have an equation in the form $(x-a)^4 + (x-b)^4 = c$. What is a clever way to find all four solutions? I have tried expanding and then used long division. However, I believe a better way is to reduce to cubic, then to quadratic. I don't know how to do this.","['algebra-precalculus', 'roots']"

755656,"Subsets of $[0,1]$","Suppose we have a closed subset $A\subset[0,1]$ that is not equal to $[0,1]$. Is it possible $mA=1$? Suppose you have an open subset $B\subset[0,1]$ that is dense in $[0,1]$. Is it possible that $mB<1$? Where $mA$ is the Lebesgue measure of some set $A$ of real numbers. I've spent the last 4 or so hours thinking about what what the possibilities are here. Rationals and Irrationals and Cantor sets oh my!!! Truth be told, I would love to have an intuitive feeling for the intricate structure of all the real numbers in $[0,1]$ but alas I feel I am no closer to this goal than when I started looking at it a couple years ago. When I look at these measurable sets problems Im always trying to construct examples in my head or to construct some sketches in an effort to intuit whats going on but often run into the brick wall that is the actual complexity of the real numbers. Anyone have a suggestion on how to build intuition here?","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
