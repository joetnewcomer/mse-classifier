1593437,Is it possible to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra for all polynomials of degree $n \le 4$?,"Recenly I've been wondering whether it's possible to prove the FTA for all polynomials of degree $n \le 4$ without utilizing advanced maths but, at most, basic linear algebra (concepts such as eigenvectors, eigenvalues, determinants etc.).

1593455,With the exception of the Total Derivative; Is the Chain Rule valid when it has partial derivatives mixed with ordinary derivatives?,"I know that the chain rule for a function of one variable $y=f(x)$ is written as $$\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}x}=\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}y}\times \frac{{\rm d}y}{{\rm d}x}\tag{1}$$ I also know that if $u=f(x,y)$ then the total derivative is $${\rm d}u=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\cdot{\rm d} x+\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\cdot{\rm d}y$$ But from $(1)$ is there any plausibility in changing all the derivatives to partial derivatives such that $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\times \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$$ when $y=f(x)$ or does the above formula only hold iff $y=f(x,y)$? To illustrate my confusion I will add this question and solution to give some context: Start of Question: If $f$ is an arbitrary function, show that $\psi(z,t)=f(z-vt)$ is a solution to the wave equation $$\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial t^2}=v^2\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial z^2}$$ by writing $f(z-vt)$ as $f(y)$ and using the chain rule to differentiate with respect to $t$ and $z$. End of Question. The following is a word for word copy of the solution. I have marked $\color{red}{\mathrm{red}}$ the parts of the solution for which I do not understand and the parts marked with $\color{#180}{\text{green underbraces}}$ are not part of the solution and represent where I think the author has made mistakes: Start of Solution: The wave equation is $$\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial t^2}-v^2\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial z^2}=0$$
  Writing $$f^{\prime}(y)=\frac{{\rm d}f(y)}{{\rm d}y}$$ and 
  $$f^{\prime\prime}(y)=\frac{{\rm d}^2f(y)}{{\rm d}y^2}$$ then writing $y=z-vt$, $$\frac{\partial f(y)}{\partial z}=f^{\prime}(y)\underbrace{\color{red}{\frac{{\rm d}y}{{\rm d}z}}}_{\color{#180}{\Large\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}}}=f^{\prime}(y)\tag{A}$$ and 
  $$\frac{\partial^2 f(y)}{\partial z^2}=\frac{{\rm d}f^{\prime}(y)}{{\rm d}y} \underbrace{\color{red}{\frac{{\rm d}y}{{\rm d}z}}}_{\color{#180}{\Large\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}}}=f^{\prime\prime}(y)$$ Similarly, $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}=f^{\prime}(y)\underbrace{\color{red}{\frac{{\rm d}y}{{\rm d}t}}}_{\color{#180}{\Large\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}}}=-vf^{\prime}(y)$$ and 
  $$\frac{\partial^2 f(y)}{\partial z^2}=\frac{{\rm d}\left(-v f^{\prime}(y)\right)}{{\rm d}y}\underbrace{\color{red}{\frac{{\rm d}y}{{\rm d} z}}}_{\color{#180}{\Large\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}}}=v^2f^{\prime\prime}(y)$$
  Substituting into the LHS of the wave equation gives $$\frac{\partial^2 f(z-vt)}{\partial z^2}-\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial^2 f(z-vt)}{\partial t^2}=f^{\prime\prime}(z-vt)-\frac{1}{v^2}\left(v^2f^{\prime\prime}(z-vt)\right)=0$$ End of Solution. I have three questions regarding the solution above: Are the parts marked in $\color{#180}{\text{green underbraces}}$ correct? I think they should be partial derivatives as $y$ is a function of two variables ($z$ and $t$) since $y=z-vt$. Iff the $\color{red}{{\rm red}}$ text turns out to be correct then from $({\rm A})$ $$\frac{\partial f(y)}{\partial z}=\frac{{\rm d}f(y)}{{\rm d}y}\times \frac{{\rm d}y}{{\rm d}z}$$ How can this possibly be true? Since we have a partial derivative on the LHS and two ordinary derivatives on the RHS. I didn't know that you could 'mix' up derivatives like that. If this is indeed true could someone please explain it to me? Iff the $\color{#180}{\text{green underbraces}}$ turn out to be correct then from $({\rm A})$ $$\frac{\partial f(y)}{\partial z}=\frac{{\rm d}f(y)}{{\rm d} y} \times \frac{\partial y}{\partial z}$$ But this means that the LHS is partial while the RHS is a mixture. Either way round, I don't understand why the partial derivatives can be mixed with ordinary derivatives. Is anyone able to explain why you can mix partial and ordinary derivatives in the chain rule? Feel free to answer using examples if it's easier to explain that way.","['derivatives', 'partial-derivative', 'chain-rule', 'calculus', 'proof-explanation']"

1593497,Negative divergence implies convergent flow?,"Suppose we have a differentiable vector field $X:\Omega\to\mathbb{R^n}$ defined on an open, bounded and simply connected region subset $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R^n}$, and its divergence is negative everywhere, i.e. $\nabla\cdot X(x)<0$ for any $x\in\Omega$. Can we prove that any two solution trajectories will evolve closer and closer, and thus eventually convergent? Formally, given any two points $p,q\in\Omega$ and flows $p(t), q(t)$ satisfying $p(0)=p,q(0)=q,\dot p(t)=X(p(t)), \dot q(t)=X(q(t))$, define $f(t)=||p(t)-q(t)||^2$, then is it true that
$$\frac{d}{dt}f(t)<0$$ Intuitively, I think it is right because negative divergence implies any closed area will evolve smaller and smaller. So if we enclose two points with a thin tube, then the volume of this tube will get smaller and smaller, which forces points get closer. Here is my try:
$$\frac{d}{dt}f(t)=2\left<p-q|X(p)-X(q)\right>=2\left<p-q|\nabla X(r)|p-q\right>$$
The first equation follows from the definition and the second from mean value theorem(though this theorem doesn't exist).

1593527,How to prove that there does not exist a sequence of continuous functions that converge pointwise to $\chi_{\mathbb{Q}}$ (definition only),"A fellow member of the community asked :
""there isn't a sequence of continuous function on $[0,1]$ that converges pointwise to the function $f$ on $[0,1]$ defined by $f(x)=0$ if $x$ is rational and $f(x)=1$ if $x$ is irrational."" This is the reverse of $\chi_{\mathbb{Q}}$, but the proof is obviously the same. I'm wondering about a solution that only uses the definition of continuity and point-wise convergence. I answered the OP with the following attempt: Attempt 1: ""
Suppose that $\{f_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a point-wise convergent sequence that converges to $f$. Let $x \in [0,1]$ and WLOG, suppose that $x$ is irrational. Let $\epsilon>0$. WLOG, suppose that $\epsilon<1$. 1) Then there exists $N_{1} \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $b \in \mathbb{N}$ and $b>N_{1}$ imply that  $|f_{b}(x)-f(x)|=|f_{b}(x)-1|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. 2) Since $\{f_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of continuous functions, there exists some $\delta>0$ such that $|x-y|<\delta$ implies that $|f_{b}(y)-f_{b}(x)|<\epsilon$ for each $y \in [0,1]$. Let $y \in [0,1]$ such that $|x-y|<\delta$. Then choose $p$ such that  $p \in \mathbb{Q}$, where  $x<p<y$. 4) Since  $\{f_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is pointwise convergent, there exists $N_{2} \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a \in \mathbb{N}$ and $a>N_{2}$ imply that  $|f_{a}(p)-f(p)|=|f_{a}(p)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. 5) Let $N=\max\{N_{1},N_{2}\}$. Suppose that $n>N$. By hypothesis, $|f_{n}(p)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and $|f_{n}(x)-1|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. However, by (3), we know that  $|f_{n}(x)-f_{n}(p)|<\epsilon$. But this is clearly a contradiction."" However, this doesn't work , since it assumes that the same $\delta$ will characterize continuity for any $f_{n}$ where $n>N$. **as a side-remark, is there any literature on the idea of a single $\delta$ working to describe continuity in a sequence of point-wise convergent functions $f_{n}$ for sufficiently large $n$? Attempt 3: sigh , here is  another proof that ultimately rests on baire category for contradiction: Let $\{f_n(x)\}$ be a sequence of continuous functions that converge pointwise. We show that $A=\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid f_n(x) \textrm{converges}\}$ is a Borel set [and more specifically, $G_\delta$. If $x \in A$, then there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ so that $n,m \geq N$ implies that $V_{x,n,j}=|f_n(x)-f_m(x)|<\frac{1}{j}$ for each $j \in \mathbb{N}$. Then Let $V_{n,j}=\bigcup V_{x,n,j}$. Since $V_{n,j}$ is open, let the open set $U_{n,j}$ be defined by $U_{N,J}=F^{-1}(V_{n,j})$. But then
$$\bigcap_{j \in \mathbb{N}} \bigcup_{N \in \mathbb{N}} \bigcap_{n,m \geq N} U_{n,j}=A$$
 is $G_\delta$ Then use Baire category to show that $\mathbb{Q}$ is not $G_\delta$, and so the result follows. I'm still interested in a proof that does not use this, and also in a possible proof verification for my proof given in the answers section.","['real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'functions', 'continuity', 'convergence-divergence']"
1593553,$p(x)$ irreducible polynomial $\iff J=\langle p(x)\rangle$ is a maximal ideal in $K[x]$ $\iff K[x]/J$ is a field,"Given a field $K$ and $p(x)\in K[x]$ . Then the following conditions are equivalent: a) $p(x)$ is irreducible over $K$ . b) $J = \langle p(x)\rangle$ is a maximal ideal in $K[x]$ . c) $K[x]/J$ is a field, where $J=\langle p(x)\rangle$ . My book proves $a\implies b$ as follows: Since the degree of $p(x)$ is greater than or equal to $1$ , we have that $J\neq K[x]$ (why the degree?). If $I=\langle h(x)\rangle$ is an ideal of $K[x]$ such that $I$ contains $J$ , let's prove that $J$ contains $I$ . For that look at the following: $$p(x)\in \langle p(x)\rangle \subseteq \langle h(x)\rangle \implies p(x) = g(x)h(x)$$ for some $g\in K[x]$ . Since $p(x)$ is irreducible, we must have: $$g(x) = a\in K - \{0\}$$ or $$h(x) = b\in K - \{0\}.$$ If $g(x)=a\neq 0$ we have $h(x) = a^{-1}\cdot p(x)\in J$ (because $h(x)$ is now $p(x)$ with some constant), and therefore $I$ is contained in $J$ , so we have $I=J$ , therefore $J$ is maximal ideal of $K[x]$ . Now, an unexpected proof of $a\implies c$ appears in the middle of this proof. If we consider the case $h(x)=b\neq 0$ we have ( and this part I didn't understand ) $I = \langle h(x)\rangle = K[x]$ and this proves $a\implies c$ . I think I didn't understand this part because I'm having trouble visualizing $K[x]/J$ where $J = \langle p(x)\rangle$ . In another example, the book actually computes the quotient $A/I$ where $A = \mathbb{R}[x]$ and $I = \langle x^2+1\rangle$ . It uses the theorem above to say that $L = A/I$ is a field since $x^2+1$ is irreducible over $K[x]$ (shouldn't it be $\mathbb{R}[x]$ ?). Then, it computes $L$ as follows: $$p(x) = q(x)(x^2+1)+r(x)$$ where $r(x) = bx+a$ . It then takes $p(x)\bmod I$ which gives the following: $p(x) = q(x)(x^2+1)+r(x)=r(x)= bx + a$ (everything above is with that bar at the top but I don't know how to write it in LaTeX). Then, the book simply says that $L = \{bx + a: a,b \in \mathbb{R}\}$ . Why is it that $L$ is the $p(x) \bmod I$ ? What am I missing about quotient rings? Can somebody clarify it for me?","['irreducible-polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

The number of ways of choosing such points is same as the number of ways of placing these $r$ points among $n-r$ objects such that none of the points $\{x_1,x_2,...,x_r\}$ come together.

1593753,Lost on rational and Jordan forms,"I'm having a lot of trouble trying to understand rational canonical form, primary rational canonical form, and Jordan form. I've looked at the posts about this, but I haven't been able to understand those concepts. I've been given the following matrix which is associated to an endomorphism $\phi$ of $V=\mathbb{R}^{4}$ $$M=\begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 0 & 0 & -1\\
 -1 & 0 & -1 & 2\\
 2 & 2 & 2 & -2\\
 0 & 0 & 0 &  1\\ \end{bmatrix}$$ I have to compute the following: Invariant factors of $\phi$ and a base of $V$ for which the matrix associated to $\phi$ is the rational canonical form of $M$. Determine a basis of $V$ for which the matrix associated to $\phi$ is the primary rational canonical form of $M$. The real Jordan canonical form associated to $M$. Now it comes my try and my doubts: The characteristic polynomial is $(x-1)^2(x^2-2x+2)$ which has just one eigenvalue $(1)$ with algebraic multiplicity $2$. From here, it is easy to see that the minimal polynomial is $(x-1)^2(x^2-2x+2)$ (by multiplying matrixes). However, I've been told that I can also know the minimal polynomial by computing  $dim(Nuc(I-M))$ i.e. $(4-rank(I-M))$ and realising it is $1$ i.e. $(4-3)$, but I do not understand that. Therefore, the only invariant factor is the minimal polynomial, and then the rational canonical form is: $$C=\begin{bmatrix}
 0 & 0 & 0 & -2\\
 1 & 0 & 0 & 6\\
 0 & 1 & 0 & -7\\
 0 & 0 & 1 &  4\\ \end{bmatrix}$$ since $(x-1)^2(x^2-2x+2)= (x^4-4x^3+7x^2-6x+2)$. Now I'm afraid I don't know how to compute the basis I've been asked for. Also, in case that there were two invariant factors, for example, our minimal polynomial and $(x-3)$, I'd know how to write the rational canonical form, but I'm not sure whether the order of the companion matrixes matters. My trouble is quite the same here. I know that the primary rational canonical form is : $$R=\begin{bmatrix}
 0 & -1 & 0 & 0\\
 1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\
 0 & 0 & 0 & -2\\
 0 & 0 & 1 &  2\\ \end{bmatrix}$$ since the elementary divisors are $(x-1)^2$ and $(x^2-2x+2)$ but I'm not sure of the order. And once again, I don't know how to get the basis. Finally, $dim(Nuc(I-M))= 1$ as I just said, so there is 1 jordan block of size at least 1, and therefore, $dim(Nuc(I-M)^2)$ must be $2$ and we have one jordan block for the eigenvalue $1$ and it has size 2. The problem comes with the block(s) associated to $(x^2-2x+2)$. The jordan form should be 
  $$J=\begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
 0 & 0 & 1 & -1\\
 0 & 0 & 1 &  1\\ \end{bmatrix}$$ but I don't know why. Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance.","['matrices', 'jordan-normal-form', 'polynomials', 'linear-algebra']"

1593789,Prove that the product of two continuous functions is continuous,"I was trying to prove an important theorem concerning continuous functions, namely that the product of two continuous functions is continuous. I am nearly at the end of the proof but I do not understand the last step my teacher made... I'm sure some of you is able to help me out :) Thanks in advance! Theorem Let $f, g\colon \Bbb R \to\Bbb R $ be continuous.
Then $F\colon \Bbb R\to\Bbb R$ defined by $F(x) = f(x)g(x)$ is continuous. Proof Let $f, g\colon \Bbb R \to\Bbb R $ be given such that $f$ and $g$ are continuous. Let $F\colon \Bbb R\to\Bbb R$ be defined by $F(x) = f(x)g(x)$. We want to show: $F$ is continuous, that is, for all $a \in\Bbb R$, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists some $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x \in \Bbb R$ with $|x - a| < \delta$, $|F(x)-F(a)| < \epsilon$. Let $a \in\Bbb R$ be given. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Let $\delta_f > 0$ be such that for all $x \in\Bbb R$ with $|x-a| < \delta_f$, $|f(x)-f(a)| < \frac\epsilon{2(|g(a)| + \epsilon)}$. Such a $\delta_f$ exists since $f$ is continuous. Let $\delta_g > 0$ be such that for all $x \in\Bbb R$ with $|x-a| < \delta_g$, $|g(x)-g(a)| < \frac\epsilon{ 2|f(a)| + 1}$. Such a $\delta_g$ exists since $g$ is continuous. Let $\delta_3 > 0$ be such that for all $x\in\Bbb R$ with $|x-a| < \delta_3$, $|g(x)-g(a)| < \epsilon$, which implies $|g(x)| < |g(a)| + \epsilon$. Such a $\delta_3$ exists since $g$ is continuous. Choose $\delta = \min\{\delta_f, \delta_g, \delta_3\}$. Then for all $x \in\Bbb R$ with $|x-a| < \delta$: 
$$\begin{align}|F(x) - F(a)| &= |f(x)g(x) - f(a)g(a)| \\
&= |f(x)g(x) - f(a)g(x) + f(a)g(x) - f(a)g(a)| \\
&\le |f(x)g(x) - f(a)g(x)| + |f(a)g(x) - f(a)g(a)|\\
&= |(g(x)[f(x) - f(a)]| + |f(a)[g(x) - g(a)]|\\&= |g(x)| * |f(x)-f(a)| + |f(a)| * |g(x) - g(a)| \\
&< [|g(x)| + \epsilon] \cdot \frac \epsilon {2(|g(a)| + \epsilon)} + |f(a)| \cdot |g(x) - g(a)| \\
&= \frac\epsilon{2 + |f(a)| \cdot |g(x) - g(a)|}\end{align}$$ Problem Now we need $|f(a)| \cdot |g(x) - g(a)|$ to be equal to $\frac \epsilon 2$ so that we have $\frac\epsilon2+\frac\epsilon 2= \epsilon$ (which completes the proof).
The problem is I do not see why/how $|f(a)| \cdot |g(x) - g(a)|$ is equal to $\frac\epsilon2$. Or is there maybe an error somewhere?","['continuity', 'epsilon-delta', 'real-analysis']"
1593791,For which values of $a\in\mathbb{R} $ the equation $2 \log(x+3)=\log(ax)$ has exactly one root?,"I have to investigate the possible roots of the equation according to $a$, i.e. i have to see whether there is only one root, two roots, or no roots and also what their sign is each time. This is from a book i'm reading and the answer it gives is $a<0$ or $a=12$. Now first we have to to make the restriction that $x>-3$ due to logarithm. What is troubling me is the $a<0$ part. In the solution it says that after getting rid of the logarithms we have $x^2-(a-6)x+9$. Now if $a<0 \land x>0$, then $\log(ax)$ is undefined so the equation has no solution. But we're asked about $a$, not $x$. So it proceeds to say that if $a<0 \land x<0$, i.e. $-3<x<0$ (due to our restriction) then: Let $f(x)=x^2-(a-6)x+9$, so $f(-3)=3a<0$. [The following is primarily what i don't understand.] This means that $-3$ will be between the two roots $x_1$ and $x_2$, so $x_1<-3<x_2<0$, but since we have the constriction $-3<x<0$ then $x_1$ is not possible so $x_2$ is one and only root of the original equation. Thus for $a<0$ there is exactly one root. How could they even do that, plug $-3$ for $f(x)$ to test the roots of the equation, since for $x=-3$ the equation is not defined. Also what i'm not sure i understand is why it says that since $f(-3)<0$ then $x_1<-3<x_2$. I would like to understand that. Help please.

Let $\mathbf{E}_{j}$ be the rank-one projector associated to $\mathbf{e}_{j}\in B$, let $\mathbf{H}=\sum_{j}\nu_{j}\mathbf{E}_{j}$ be a self-adjoint operator on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ such that the one-parameter group of unitary operators $\mathbf{U}_{\tau}:=\exp(-\imath\tau\mathbf{H})$ on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ generated by $\mathbf{H}$ is a closed subgroup of the unitary group $U(n+1)$.
Therefore, $\mathbf{U}_{\tau}$ is an action of the circle group $U(1)\cong S^{1}$ on the complex projective space $\mathcal{P}\mathbb{C}^{n}$.
The fixed points of this action are just the points corresponding to the elements of $B$. Let $\mathcal{P}\mathbb{C}^{n}_{*}$ denotes the complex projective space without the fixed points of the action.
Since $U(1)\cong S^{1}$ is a compact group, its action on $\mathcal{P}\mathbb{C}^{n}_{*}$ is proper.
Furthermore, it is free by construction.
This means that the orbit space $\mathcal{P}\mathbb{C}^{n}_{*}/U(1)\equiv M$ is a differential manifold, the canonical projection $\pi:\mathcal{P}\mathbb{C}^{n}_{*}\rightarrow M$ is a surjection, and $\left(\mathcal{P}\mathbb{C}^{n}_{*}\,;M\,;\pi\,;U(1)\right)$ is a $U(1)$-principal bundle. At this point, if the bundle is trivial, we have that $\mathcal{P}\mathbb{C}^{n}_{*}\cong M\times U(1)$, however, I am not able to go further.","['projective-space', 'differential-geometry']"

1594069,Vector bundle as locally free coherent sheaves,"I am studying coherent sheaves and was looking for a geometric motivation. Hence, in wikipedia and although here is stated that it can be seen as a generalization of vector bundles, which is quite satisfactorical, since this yields a better understanding of what tangent bundle, cotangent bundle or differential forms in sheaf theory and algebraic geometry might be. So, I tryed to see a vector bundle as a locally free coherent sheaf, but I got lost. So here are the two definitions and my first observations: A (real) vector bundle consists of: (i) topological spaces $X$ (base space) and $E$ (total space) (ii) a continuous surjection $\pi:E\mapsto X$ (bundle projection) (iii) for every $x$ in $X$, the structure of a finite-dimensional real vector space on the fiber $\pi^{-1}(\lbrace x\rbrace)$ where the following compatibility condition is satisfied: for every point in $X$, there is an open neighborhood $U$, a natural number $k$, and a homeomorphism \begin{align}
\varphi :U\times \mathbf {R} ^{k}\to \pi ^{-1}(U)
\end{align} such that for all $x \in U$, (a) $(\pi \circ \varphi )(x,v)=x$ for all vectors v in $R^k$, and (b) the map $v\mapsto \varphi (x,v)$ is a linear isomorphism between the vector spaces $R^k$ and $\pi^{‚àí1}(x)$. and the definition of coherent sheaves is the following: A sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ of $\mathcal{O}_X$-Modules is coherent if : 1)$ \mathcal{F} $ is of finite type over $ \mathcal{O}_X $, i.e., for any point $ x\in X $ there is an open neighbourhood $ U\subset X $ such that the restriction $ \mathcal{F}|_U $ of $ \mathcal{F} $ to U is generated by a finite number of sections (in other words, there is a surjective morphism $ \mathcal{O}_X^n|_U \to \mathcal{F}|_U $ for some $ n\in\mathbb{N} $); 2)  and for any open set $ U\subset X $, any $ n\in\mathbb{N} $ and any morphism $ \varphi\colon \mathcal{O}_X^n|_U \to \mathcal{F}|_U $ of $ \mathcal{O}_X $-modules, the kernel of $ \varphi $ is finitely generated. Thus, we can see that they both have a topological space $X$ and we can identify $E=\mathcal{O}_X$.

1594105,Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for a CDF,"This is an attempt to prove Theorem 1.5.3. in Casella and Berger. Note that the only things that have been proven are really basic set-theory with $\mathbb{P}$ (a probability measure) theorems (e.g., addition rule). Recall for a random variable $X$, we define $$F_X(x) = \mathbb{P}(X \leq x)\text{.}$$ Theorem . $F$ is a CDF iff: $\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty}F(x) = 0$ $\lim\limits_{x \to +\infty}F(x) = 1$ $F$ is nondecreasing. For all $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$, $\lim\limits_{x \to x_0^{+}} F(x)= F(x_0)$ $\Longrightarrow$ If $F$ is a CDF of $X$, by definition,
$$F_{X}(x) = \mathbb{P}(X \leq x) = \mathbb{P}\left(\{s_j \in S: X(s_j) \leq x\} \right) $$
where $S$ denotes the overall sample space. $(3)$ is easy to show. Suppose $x_1 \leq x_2$. Then notice
$$\{s_j \in S: X(s_j) \leq x_1\} \subset \{s_j \in S: X(s_j) \leq x_2\}$$
and therefore by a Theorem,
$$\mathbb{P}\left(\{s_j \in S: X(s_j) \leq x_1\}\right) \leq \mathbb{P}\left(\{s_j \in S: X(s_j) \leq x_2\}\right)$$
giving $F_{X}(x_1) \leq F_{X}(x_2)$, hence $F$ is nondecreasing. I suppose $(1)$ and $(2)$ aren't consequences of anything more than saying that $\{s_j \in S: X(s_j) \leq -\infty\} = \varnothing$ and $\{s_j \in S: X(s_j) \leq +\infty\} = S$ (unless I'm completely wrong here). But this seems to suggest that $$\lim_{x \to -\infty}\mathbb{P}(\text{blah}(x)) = \mathbb{P}(\lim_{x \to -\infty}\text{blah}(x))$$
where $\text{blah}(x)$ is a set dependent on $x$. At this point of the text, this hasn't been proven (if it's even true). I'm not sure how to show $(4)$. $\Longleftarrow$ I don't know how to prove sufficiency. Casella and Berger state that this is ""much harder"" than necessity, and we have to establish that there is a sample space, a probability measure, and a random variable defined on the sample space such that $F$ is the CDF of this random variable, but this isn't enough detail for me to go on.","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"

And so if every sequence converges in $M$, then clearly every sequence has a subsequence which converges in $M$ and hence it is also compact (if it is complete). And if every sequence has a subsequence which converges to $M$ then doesn't the sequence itself converge to $M$ in which case the compact space is also complete? Apologies if I'm totally off track.

I interpreted this as a binomial distribution where 0 = up and 1 = down , where the probability of a $1$ occurring is $0 < p < 1$. I realize this notation is a little backward, since we don't usually think of ""up"" as equating with ""failure"". Now I'm trying to characterize the distribution of the length of time that a device is ""up"". Let $X$ be the discrete probability distribution of the length of the first up time. Then \begin{align}

Pr(x = 1) &= (1 - p) p \\
Pr(x = 2) &= (1 - p)^2 p \\

Pr(x = n) &= (1 - p)^{n-1} p \\

\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[X] &= \displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n (1 - p)^{n-1} p \\

1594267,Stability and type of equilibria of 2nd-order DEs,"Given $\ddot{x} = F(x)$, $x(0) = x_0$ and $\dot{x}(0) = y_0$. Assume $c$ is a simple zero of $F$. Let $V(x) = -\int_{x_0}^{x} F(s)ds$. (a) If $V$ has a local min at $c$, find the stability and type of the equilibrium (i.e, saddle, focus, center, center-focus, other) at the point $(x_0, y_0) = (c, 0)$. Use $E(x) = \frac{\dot{x}^{2}}{2} + V(x)$ to explain your answer. What is the stability and type if $V$ has a local max. Explain? (b) Find the type and stability of the equilibria of $\ \ddot{x} = -4x(1-x^2)$. (c) Find the type and stability of $x = \dot{x} = 0$ for the equation: $\ \ddot{x} = -4x(1-x^2) - x^2\dot{x}$ My attempt: For part (a), let $\dot{x} = y$. It's easy to see that we can rewrite the 2nd-order ODE as the system of 1st-order ODE: $\dot{x} = y, \dot{y} = F(x)$, and $E(x,y) = \frac{y^2}{2} + V(x)$. Now, since $\frac{\partial E}{\partial y} = \dot{x}$, and $-\frac{\partial E}{\partial x} = \dot{y}$, our system is Hamiltonian system. Thus, all the solutions $(x(t), y(t))$ belongs to the level sets $E(x,y)= C$ for any constant $C > 0$. Now, since $V(x)$ has a local min at $c$, by Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $F(c)=0$, and $F'(c)< 0$ (since $c$ is a simple zero of $F$, so $c$ is a strict local min). So the point $(c,0)$ is an equilibrium of our system. By principle of linearization, since $Df((c,0)) = (0 1, F'(c) 0)^T$, which has 2 real eigenvalues $\pm \sqrt{F'(c)}$, we conclude that $(c,0)$ is a hyperbolic equilibrium, and it is an unstable saddle. For the case when $V$ has local max at $c$, we have $F'(c) < 0$, so $Df((c,0))$ would have 2 imaginary eigenvalues with real parts $= 0$, so $(c,0)$ is not hyperbolic equilibrium, thus Principle of Linearized Stability cannot apply in this case. However, as we know that $(c,0)$ would be on some level sets $E(x,y) = C_1$ for some $C_1$, $(c,0)$ is stable . In addition, due to the 2 eigenvalues are all imaginary, $(c,0)$ can't be saddle, focus, center or center-focus, so it must be OTHER . Is my solution correct for this part? Part (b) is quite simple by using part (a)'s result (only need to check whether $0$, $1$ or $-1$ is a local min or max of F(x), and choose $y_0=0$), so I omitted the proof here. For part (c), it's quite hard, as we have the term $x^2\dot{x}$, so I cannot use the result above as the RHS is not purely in terms of $x$. Principle of Linearization also does not work in this case, as $Df((0,0))$ has $2$ eigenvalues $\pm 2i$.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

1594292,Intuition behind Riesz-Markov Representation Theorem,"I am currently reading Big Rudin and I have this theorem that I've been struggling with for some time now. Usually, when reading, I either try to get a concrete intuition behind the idea, visualise the theorem and its proof in my head, or at least connect it to something I already know, as well as try to connect the proof to other proofs I know. However, upon this theorem, I truly stumbled. As Rudin notes in the beginning of the chapter, one can see a little connection between the measure and linear functionals as $b-a$ can be approximated by $\Lambda f$ where $\Lambda f=\int_a^b fdx$ and $f$ is a continuous function on $[a;b]$ with range lying in $[0;1]$. However, this honestly felt like ""cheating"". As to why this is cheating, it seems so to me for various reasons. First of all, he gave the most trivial of examples while one needs a general idea. However, the real reason is the fact that the linear function he uses is actually intimately related to measure by itself, without any need for a representation theorem. The ideas of measure and integrations are intertwined and thus stating that we can find a measure that represents an integral (especially since it's only on an interval) seems useless and uninformative. Is there a way to intuitively understand why such a representation is possible or is this theorem too complex for any intuition?

Since even after discussion with my fellow classmates we are not sure how to handle it we decided to post a question here. Basically we are supposed to simulate spreading of disease. Every day every infected person will pick random number of people (possible infected candidates) with Poisson distribution where parameter is 5. Everyone of those selected people (=possible infected candidates) will be infected with probability of 1/2 and at the end of the day the infection takes effect. Next day this particular infected person will be also spreading infection and will again pick random number of people (another possible infected candidates) with Poisson distribution where parameter is again 5.
Number of possibly infected candidates and event static whether person will be infected or not are both independent on each other. Let's suppose on the first day there is only one infected person.
We should simulate disease spreading for one week. And how many infected persons there will be at the end of 8th day. Now finally to my question. Confusing part for me is how are we suppose to determine the number of randomly picked people which represent possible infected candidates since we don't know how many people is there?
I assume that with higher number of people the disease should spread faster? I also think that this number of randomly picked possible candidates should be somehow determined by given parameter and also by Poisson distribution itself but I am struggling how to make these things ""work"" together.","['statistics', 'simulation', 'probability']"

In this case, he gives a ""natural"" choice for such a composition.  Denoting this composition by $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2$ (so skipping the extra ""2"" in Gauss's way of writing forms), Gauss notes that $A$ is determined by his definition, while $B$ is determined modulo $2A$.  Once $A$ and $B$ are determined, $C$ is determined because the determinant is fixed. This can be rephrased by saying that Gauss composition is well defined on the equivalence classes of forms under the action of the subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2 (\mathbb{Z})$ consisting of matrices of the form $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & m\\0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$. These classes then form a countably generated infinite Abelian group.

1594587,"Least positive eigenvalue of the BVP $y''-\lambda y'+\frac{2\lambda-1}{x}y=0$, $y(0) = y(1/2) = 0$","Find the first positive eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the boundary value problem over $x\in [0,\frac{1}{2}]$.
  $$y''-\lambda y'+\frac{2\lambda-1}{x}y=0, \quad y(0)=y(\tfrac{1}{2})=0.$$ My approach: I have tried to use Frobenius Theorem because $x=0$ is a regular-singular point and also the indicial equation implies that the eigenfunction (non-trivial solution) will not a similar form of a Bessel function. I have managed to use self-adjoint properties but the differential operator of the left hand side turns out to be non self-adjoint.","['boundary-value-problem', 'asymptotics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'eigenfunctions']"
