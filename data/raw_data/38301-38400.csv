373561,"Showing that if $N \le G$ is finite minimal normal with every simple homomorphic image abelian, then it is abelian itself","I've been working on the following problem, with no success so far: ""Let $N$ be a finite minimal normal subgroup of a group $G$, and suppose $N$  has the property that every simple homomorphic image is abelian.  Show that $N$ is abelian."" I am told to use the result of the previous problem, ""If $H \le G$, then $G' \le H$ iff $H \triangleleft G$ and $G/H$ is abelian."" ($G'$ is the derived subgroup of $G$) Here are some of my thoughts so far: It seems the natural subgroup to consider here would be $N \le G$.  Since $G' \triangleleft G$ but $N$ is minimal normal, $G' \not\le N$, which implies that (since we assume $N \triangleleft G$) $G/N$ is not abelian.  If this leads us to the proof, I certainly don't see how it does so. Generally, for showing that a subgroup is abelian, we could show that $N'$ is trivial.  We could also establish it as the homomorphic image of some abelian group or subgroup, but in this problem it seems it would be a preimage, but then abelian-ness may not be preserved (consider the zero homomorphism from a non-abelian group). I would really appreciate a HINT on where to go with this.  I would also appreciate whatever commentary and discussion anyone has to offer on how to go about thinking about this (and the same holds for all of my questions), because I feel this is really where I lack experience.  Having attended actual lectures very little, I feel like I don't really know 'how to think' about problems. Thanks for the help, as always.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
373568,"$f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ a continuous open map, show that for each $x \in \text{range}(f)$, $f^{-1}(x)$ is always uncountable.","Let $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous open map.  Show that in fact for each $x \in \text{range}(f)$, $f^{-1}(x)$ is always uncountable. I know that if this was simply a projection onto the one of the two coordinates, this problem would be trivial, since it being continuous, surjective, and open would imply that it's a quotient map, and taking the preimage would yield an uncountable sequence of ordered pairs.  However, it instead being a continuous open map, with no other information, seems to make it slightly more complicated. Couldn't we use the fact that the irrationals (which are uncountable) are dense in the reals implies, for $ A = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ and every open subset of $\mathbb{R}$, say $B$, that $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$, so if we partition the outcome space into disjoint subsets whose union is $\mathbb{R}$, making $f$ into a surjective and therefore quotient map onto it's range, then the inverse function is surjective and continuous, so we can determine that the yielded sequence of ordered pairs is uncountable due to the density of the irrationals in the range and, by continuity and surjectiveness, the domain?

373576,Exponential Distribution Function,"If $X\sim \text{Exp}(X)$  then for all positive $a$ and $b$, $P(X>a+b\mid X>a)=P(X>b).$ So given independent random variables $X \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$, $Y \sim\text{Exp}(\mu)$ we would like to know $P(Y>a+X\mid Y>a)$ with the intention of using this for probabilities that a gap between two order statistics is of a certain magnitude. So $P(Y>a+X\mid Y>a)=P(Y>X)$. Why is $P(Y>X) = \mathbb{E}[\exp(\mu X)]= \frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu}$? Is it because the above theorem is for fixed $a$, and $X$ ""varies"", meaning that we need to integrate and get an expectation value in the process? I also think this will help show, given $Z\sim \text{Exp}(\nu)$, also independent, $P(Y>X\cap Z>X)=\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu+\nu}$. This is referring to the more general $P(\bigcap_{k=1}^n\{X_k>a+b_k\} \mid \min(\{X_k\})>a)=P(\bigcap_{k=1}^n\{X_k>b_k\})$ which imples, by setting $b_k=X$ $\forall k$, that $$P(\min(Y,Z)>a+X\mid \min(Y,Z)>a)=P(\{Y>a+X\}\cap\{Z>a+X\}\mid\min(Z,Y)>a)=P(\{Z>X\}\cap \{Y>X\})$$ Which provided the above expectation identity holds will give me the final expression $$P(\min(Y,Z)>a+X\mid a<\min(Y,Z))=\frac{\lambda}{\lambda +\mu+\nu}$$","['measure-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

373578,Why are (representations of ) quivers such a big deal?,"Quivers are directed graphs where loops and multi-arrows are allowed. And we can talk about representations of quivers by assigning each vertex a vector space and each arrow a homomorphism. Moreover, Gabriel gives a complete classification of quivers of finite type using just five Dynkin diagrams. Although these are both deep and surprising, but I am not sure why quivers deserve so much attention. The only potential application I can think of (although highly unlikely to be true) that they might be useful to answer certain questions in category theory since the notion of quivers are similar to categories, and a representation is very much like a functor from a quiver to some $\mathcal{k}$-$\operatorname{vect}$. So I wonder whether someone can give a hint why quivers deserve so much attention? Do they naturally show up in problems?

That said, I put it out there to anyone who may have seen this before or who knows a trick or two of which I am unaware. Please note that, yes, $\hat{g}(k)$ is finite at $k=0$.  Also note that I use the definition of IFT as $$g(x) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dk \: \hat{g}(k) e^{-i k x}$$ One other thing: note the delicate balance of convergence at $\infty$ - the restriction on $y$ is critical.","['closed-form', 'special-functions', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'fourier-analysis', 'definite-integrals']"

373672,About Euclid's Elements and modern video games,"Update (6/19/2014) $\;$ Just wanted to say that this idea that I posted more than a year ago, has now become reality at: http://euclidthegame.com/ 12.292 users have played it in 96 different countries, and 1232 people have reached level 20 :) Update (8/27/2015) $\;$ The game is now played by more than 500.000 people in 213 different countries :D The iOS version is coming in september, see the facebook page . Original post I just watched this video about Euclid's treatise the Elements. I got introduced to the postulates and a couple of propositions of book I. I really liked this video, I'm not sure if this is because of Euclid or because of how Wildberger explains it (or maybe both ). This may sounds a little strange, especially for the mathematicians here from an older generations (I'm 22), but this way Euclid has structured his postulates/propositions reminds me to and old addiction from me: Video Games. For the ones that are not familiar with video games: In many games you begin with some kind of character, which has some basic ""abilities"", for example you are able to do some kind of ""fight combo"", or ""build"" something or whatever. Okay, I may not do a good job explaining this, but I guess most here understand what I mean. If you proceed through the different levels, you begin to get more and more abilities. In the beginning your character can only do the basics. But if you accomplish the right ""goals"", you character will be able ""unlock"" ""abilities"". After a while you will feel awesome about all the things your character is able to do. When I was watching this video, I feel like, ""hey, isn't that the same thing as Euclid was doing?"". You begin with just 3 constructions (your begin set of abilities). And if you prove theorems (accomplish levels), you will be able to use those in new theorems (abilities you can use in new levels). It seems like Euclid's the Elements got all the elements to be a very addictive game. I'm a little bit fancying this idea. I really see myself getting addictive to such kind of game that would guide level by level to the whole work of Euclid: This is how I picture such a game could look like. Please forgive me for my ugly drawings. Well, I've been looking if something like this already exist, but I couldn't find anything. So that is my first question: ""Does there exist a ""game"" like this ?"" I've seen many geometry software (like GeoGebra), and I think this excellent software, but what I would like is something that is more closer to the addictive set up of most games. Getting a character, and working your way through the levels (in this case: beginning with some basic construction and working your way through all the theorems). I lost hope that this already exist, but if somebody know some kind of software that comes very close, I would love to know! If nothing like this exist, I hope that I may be able to inspire some programmer here that such a game would be really awesome :) Edit $\;$Would it be hard to program such a game ? I'm considering trying to program this myself. It feels like I only need to add some kind of campaign mode to GeoGebra. Or should I ask these question at stackoverflow? Edit $\;$I was playng around a little bit with GeoGebra, but with these 3 constructions I cannot pass level 1 (constructing an equilateral triangle). I think I need to add another construction to the construction bar: Constructing a point at an intersection.","['geometry', 'education', 'math-software', 'euclidean-geometry']"

373701,Can we use (higher order) derivatives to help integration?,"I'm wondering if it's possible to use derivatives to ease the evaluation of an integral.

I also have a method to get higher-order derivatives, like the 2nd derivative, 3rd derivative, etc. with relative ease.  So I'm wondering, and hopefully this isn't to vague, if I can make use of these derivatives so that I can evaluate the function at less than $n$ points. In other words, can I use derivatives so that I can combine them with an integral somehow so that I can evaluate the integral at fewer points?

The notes he gave us say: We will consider a linear difference equation that gives the
  Fibonacci sequence. $y(k) + A_1y(k -1) + A_2y(k -2) = \beta$ That's the general form for a difference equation in which each term is formed from the
  two preceding terms. We specialize this for our Fibonacci sequence by setting $A_1 = 1, $ >$
>A_2 = 1,$ and $ \beta = 0$. With some rearrangement, we get $y(k) = y(k - 1) + y(k - 2)$ which looks more like the general form for the Fibonacci sequence. To solve the difference equation, we try the solution $y(k) = Br^k$. Plugging that in, we
  obtain $Br^{k-2} (r^2 - r - 1) = 0$ I have no idea where the $Br^k$ is coming from nor what it means, and he won't explain it in any sort of terms we can understand.

The area is square summable, but the above sum is infinite.

Then the boundary of the union is $[0,1]$, but the union of the boundaries is $R$ itself.

Does that mean that this is unsolvable without using that fact or a related/derived one? I can of course solve it with L'Hospitals rule, but that uses the derivative of the exponential function which is exactly what I want to derive by solving this limit. Since the derivative of the logarithm can be derived from the derivative of the exponential, using the fact that they are inverses, means that deferring this limit to something that can be solved using the derivative of log seams also cheating. Others have asked that before, but all the ""non-L'Hospital""-solutions seem to defer it to some other limit that they claim obvious. For example two solutions from Proving that $\lim_{h\to 0 } \frac{b^{h}-1}{h} = \ln{b}$ use $$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\log_a(1+x)}{x}=\log_a e$$ and $$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{e^x-1}x=1$$

374626,How to show limit definition of $e^{z}$ holds if $z \in \mathbb{C}$,"It is well known that for $x\in \mathbb{R}$ we have
$$
e^{x} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1+  \frac{x}{n}\right)^n.
$$
This follows quickly by considering logarithms and using L'Hospital's rule.
However, for $z \in \mathbb{C}$ this would involve taking complex logarithms.
I am not convinced that this proof still works and I was wondering if there is another simple proof of this fact when $z \in \mathbb{C}$. EDIT: For definition I am using the Taylor series $$e^z := \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{k!}.$$
I am okay with all the standard alternative definitions and properties of $e^x$ when $x \in \mathbb{R}$, so feel free to use those if the real case can somehow be extended to the complex case.","['exponential-function', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

374685,Are there new possibilities in higher dimensions?,"The question is about spatial dimensions. It seems to me that every dimension adds something fundamentally new to space: If you have one dimension, you have different positions and the ability to move an object (like a point).
By adding the second dimension, the objects have the possibility to go around each other - they mustn't go through each other to change positions.
The third dimension allows to tie a knot.
Is there anything new like this if you add the fourth, fifth, ... dimension?",['geometry']

374713,"If $\operatorname{rk}(A) = 1$, when $B + A$ is invertible?","I should know how do this problem, but I have troubles with it. Let $B$ be an invertible matrix and let $A$ be a matrix with $\operatorname{rk}(A) = 1$. Then $\exists \lambda$ such that $A^2 = \lambda A$ and the problem is for which values of $\lambda$ the matrix $B + A$ is invertible? When $B = I$ then $B + A$ is invertible iff $\lambda \neq -1$ and in the general case I suppose is $\lambda \neq -\det(B)$. I think it'll be better if I type my conclusion for $B = I$, if $I +A$ es invertible let $C$ such that $$(I + A)C = C(I + A) = I.$$
Then $AC = CA$ iff $C^{-1}AC = A$, but $C^{-1} = I + A$ and therefore we have $$A = (I + A)AC = (A +A^2)C=(A +\lambda A)C = (1 + \lambda)AC.$$
If $1 + \lambda = 0$ then $A = 0$ which has no rank 1, thereupon $\lambda \neq -1$ and if $\lambda \neq -1$ the inverse for $I+A$ is $I -\frac{1}{1+\lambda} A$.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
374715,What groups can G/Z(G) be? [duplicate],This question already has an answer here : When can a (finite) group be written as the quotient of some other group by its center? (1 answer) Closed 4 years ago . Let $G$ be a finite group and let $Z(G)$ denote its center.  A simple result states that if $G/Z(G)$ a nontrivial cyclic group then $G$ is abelian.  Of course if $G$ is abelian then $Z(G)=G$ and consequently $G/Z(G)$ is the trivial group.  Hence we conclude that no non-trivial cyclic groups can result when we quotient a group by its center.  My question is whether there are any other restrictions as to what groups can occur as the quotient of some group by its center.,"['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"
374729,can a ring homomorphism map an integral domain to a non integral domain?,"i understand that if two rings are isomorphic, and one ring is an integral domain, so must the other be. however, consider two rings, both commutative rings with unity.  is it possible that one ring contains zero divisors and one does not while there exists an ring homomorphism between the two?
there could not be a isomorphism between the two rings because there would be no one to one or onto mapping between the two rings. but could there be an operation preserving mapping between an integral domain and a commutative ring with unity and with zero divisors? 
clearly if such a mapping did exists it would not seem to be one to one or onto, but does this rule out the potential of a homomorphism existing between the two?","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
374747,If $z_n \to z$ then $(1+z_n/n)^n \to e^z$,"We are dealing with $z \in \mathbb{C}$.
I know that
$$
\left(1+ \frac{z}{n} \right)^n \to e^{z}
$$
as $n \to \infty$. So intuitively if $z_n \to z$ then we should have
$$
\left(1+ \frac{z_n}{n} \right)^n \to e^{z}.
$$
If $z_n \in \mathbb{R}$ I would be happy writing
$$
\exp \left(n \log\left(1+ \frac{z_n}{n} \right) \right) = \exp \left(z_n \frac{\log\left(1+ \frac{z_n}{n} \right)-\log(1+0)}{\frac{z_n}{n}-0} \right) \to \exp(z \cdot 1)
$$
where here we are using the definition of derivative.
But if $z \in \mathbb{C}$ the logarithm is multivalued and I'm not sure that the same calculation is allowed.
Is there a different way to show this for complex $z$?","['complex-analysis', 'exponential-function', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"
