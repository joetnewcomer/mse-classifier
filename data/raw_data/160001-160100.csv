2760020,What is up with the antiderivative of $\arctan^2(x)$?,"Integrating $\arctan^2(x)$ has been a mystery to me since I first learned to compute indefinite integrals. When I plug it into integral calculator or WolframAlpha, I get a primitive written in terms of complex numbers and polylogarythms; but $\arctan^2(x)$ is continuous and defined $\forall\space x\in\mathbb{R}$, the area under the curve $(x,\arctan^2(x))$ is well-defined and obvioulsy real. In fact, I can integrate that function numerically and get the area without using Barrow's Rule at all. I thought maybe the complex part of that expression is constant, therefore applying Barrow's Rule always yields a real number anyway, but then I could subtract a constant equal to its imaginary part times $i$ and get a real and still valid antiderivative. Anyway, I have no idea of how to compute that antiderivative in the first place, so I can't check for myself. Can a real, continuous function have a complex primitive but not a real primitive? And, can anyone give me a hint to help me compute its antiderivative by myself?","['indefinite-integrals', 'integration', 'calculus']"
2760031,A cohomology or homology associated to a Riemannian manifold or a dynamical system,"I  would  like  to know  whether  the  following co boundary or  boundary maps can  introduce some new kinds of cohomology or  homology which contains  some  non trivial, new,  finite  dimensional  and  helpful information  about the  manifold or  the  dynamics of  a vector  field on it. All maps $\phi$  described below are  defined on the chain of  differential  forms on a  manifold $M$  which obviously   satisfy $\phi \circ \phi=0$. In this  question, to sake finite  dimensionality of  resulting cohomology or  homology, instead of  consideration of  the  whole  complex $\Omega^*(M)$,  we are flexible  to consider   an appropriate sub complex of $\Omega^*(M)$. Each operator  $\phi$ listed below    can  suggest  some  subcomplex  as  domain of definition of  $\phi$. Let  $M$  be  a  Riemannian  manifold with  Laplace operator $\Delta$ and  $X$ be a  vector  field  on $M$. Our differential  maps(coboundary or  boundary maps) are  the  following maps. The first $2$  maps  depends  on the  Riemannian structure  and  the last $2$  maps, which decrease the degree by 2,   depend  on the  vector  fields $X$. Suggestion for  $\phi:$ The  map $\phi$ is: 1)$d\circ \Delta$ 2)$d^* \circ \Delta$ 3)$d^*\circ L_X \circ d^*$ 4)$i_X\circ \Delta \circ i_X$ The operator  $L_X$ is the  Lie derivative operator. The operator $i_X:\Omega^i(M) \to \Omega^{i-1}(M)$ is the  interior product and  $d^*$ is  the  codifferential operator.","['homology-cohomology', 'riemannian-geometry', 'dynamical-systems', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

2760176,Why does logarithmic differentiation work even if logs are not defined for negative numbers?,"Say for instance, we have a function $y = x^3$, the derivative of which is $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = 3x^2$. Now, say I want to do a logarithmic differentiation:
$$

$$
so by implicit differentiation with respect to $x$,
$$
\frac{1}{y}\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = 3\cdot\frac{1}{x} \implies \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = y\cdot 3 \cdot \frac{1}{x} = x^3\cdot \frac{3}{x} = 3 x^2. 
$$ Why does this work, even though $\ln(x)$ function is not defined for negative values of $x$? Or does doing differentiation using logarithms limit the result to positive values for $x$ only which in this case is yielding the correct result nonetheless?

2760217,Serre duality in derived category,"Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a field $k$ , and $\omega_X$ its canonical bundle. Denote by $D^b(X):=D^b(\mathbf{Coh})$ the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on $X$ . Theorem: For any two comples $\mathcal{E}^\bullet,\mathcal{F}^\bullet$ in $D^b(X)$ there exists a functorial isomorphism $$\eta : Ext^i(\mathcal{E}^\bullet,\mathcal{F}^\bullet) \to Ext^{n-i}(\mathcal{F}^\bullet,\mathcal{E}^\bullet\otimes \omega_X)^*,$$ where $^*$ denotes the vector space dual. This theorem can be found in D. Huybrechts's Fourier-Mukai Transforms in Algebraic Geometry (theorem 3.12). It basically says that the exact functor $$\cdot\otimes\omega_X[n] : D^b(X) \to D^b(X)$$ is a Serre functor in the sense of Bondal and Kapranov (see here for instance). Now my question is: how can we prove this theorem? I know that this is a particular case of Grothendieck-Verdier duality, but is it possible to avoid it? My attempts: I know the classical Serre Duality (Harthorne's Algebraic Geometry , III.7), which in particular says that the theorem is true when $\mathcal{E}^\bullet = \mathcal{E}$ is a locally free sheaf and $\mathcal{F}^\bullet=\mathcal{F}$ is any coherent sheaf. For the general case, I tried to use the definition: $$Ext^i(\mathcal{E}^\bullet,\mathcal{F}^\bullet) = H^i(RHom^\bullet(\mathcal{E}^\bullet,\mathcal{F}^\bullet)),$$ where $Hom^n(A^\bullet,B^\bullet)=\bigoplus Hom(A^k,B^{k+n})$ with $d(f)=d_B\circ f - (-1)^nf\circ d_A$ . I tried to replace $\mathcal{F}^\bullet$ by a quasi-isomorphic complex of injectives (of quasi-coherent sheaves) and $\mathcal{E}$ by a quasi-isomorphic complex of locally free sheaves so I can use the classical Serre duality on each summand of the direct sum, but I'm not sure this is a way to start. If someone could give me some help I would really appreciate. EDIT: Thanks to the answer of @mayer_vietoris, I tried the following. Suppose $\mathcal{E}^\bullet$ is a complex of locally free sheaves and $\mathcal{F}$ is a complex of injectives so that $RHom^\bullet(\mathcal{E}^\bullet,\mathcal{F}^\bullet)=Hom^\bullet(\mathcal{E}^\bullet,\mathcal{F}^\bullet).$ $$\begin{align*}
Hom^i(\mathcal{E}^\bullet,\mathcal{F}^\bullet) &= \bigoplus_k Hom(\mathcal{E}^k,\mathcal{F}^{k+i}) \\
&= \bigoplus Ext^0(\mathcal{O}_X,(\mathcal{E}^k)^ \vee\otimes\mathcal{F}^{k+i})\\
&\simeq \bigoplus Ext^n(\mathcal{F}^{k+i},\mathcal{E}^k\otimes\omega_X)^* & \text{(by Serre Duality)}\\
&\simeq \bigoplus Hom(\mathcal{F}^{k+i},\mathcal{E}^k\otimes\omega_X[n])^*\\
&\simeq Hom^{n-i}(\mathcal{F}^\bullet,\mathcal{E}^\bullet\otimes\omega_X)^*.
\end{align*}$$ Up to a replacement of $\mathcal{E}^\bullet\otimes\omega_X$ by a complex of injectives, I would like to conclude by replacing $Hom^i(\dots$ by $H^i(Hom^\bullet(\dots$ and similarly with $Hom^{n-i}$ . Thus I obtain the desired equality. Am I wrong somewhere?","['derived-categories', 'algebraic-geometry', 'duality-theorems']"

\ln(y)&=i\phi \tag{6}\\
\implies e^{i\phi}&=y \tag{7}\\

2760385,"What is the Probability Generating Function (PGF) for the ""Matching Problem""?","I've been working on a set of questions that ask me to prove various results regarding probabilities concerning the classic ""matching problem"". There are $n$ letters written to different people, and envelopes correspondingly addressed. The letters are shuffled such that any particular letter-envelope allocation is equally likely as any other. Define a ""match"" if a particular letter is placed in its correct envelope. The question began by letting the notation $M_{n,j}=n!P(A_{n,j})$ represent the number of permutations resulting in $j$ matches out of $n$ letters, where $A_{n,j}$ is the event that $j$ matches have occurred out of $n$ letters. Part a) of the question asked me to show that: $$M_{n,j}={j+1\over n+1}M_{n+1,j+1}$$ I found this easy enough. The next question defined the generating function for the probability of receiving $j$ matches out of $n$ letters: $G_n(z)=\sum_{j=0}^nP(A_{n,j})z^j$, and asked me, using part a) to prove that: $$G_{n+1}(z)=1+\int_{1}^zG_n(w)dw$$ Once again, I had no trouble doing this using the first result. It was the third part of the question, however, that confused me. It read ""hence find the pgf (probability generating function) $G_n(z)$"". The result of the next question leads me to believe that the solution is: $$G_n(z)=\sum_{k=0}^n{(z-1)^k\over k!}$$ That said, I have no idea how to actually reach this conclusion, and would appreciate some help getting there, preferably using properties of generating functions. It would be preferable to avoid using the formula for number of derangements, as we have not covered this in class and therefore is likely not involved in the expected solution.

2760397,Group action defined on generators.,"In a question for an assignment (specific group but I've abstracted the question for academic integrity). I was given a group $G=\langle\ a,b \mid R\ \rangle$ where $R$ is some set of relations. Then, the question defines a group action on $X$ for each generating element. The first question is then ""Verify that this gives a group action on $X$"". My problem is that it seems like by defining a group action on generators inherently assumes that $e(x)=x$ and $a(b(x))=ab(x)$ from the beginning, so it seems like there is nothing left to show? Since the question only defined the functions $a(x)=?$ and $b(c)=?$, I can't verify that $ab(x)=a(b(x))$, since I wasn't given the action defined by $ab$.

In the comments, there is a link to a GeoGebra applet for exploring this problem. Tinkering with the applet led me to believe that the maximization occurs when the other three angles are each $110^{\circ}$, but I neither possess a proof that this is optimal, nor have computed the exact area (in closed form) for this case. I would appreciate an answer that broaches the above special case, although I think it is reasonable to ask about a natural generalization for quadrilaterals; in either scenario, a proof or a link to an already existing one would be great. Generalization: A [convex] quadrilateral has perimeter $N$ and a $d^{\circ}$ angle. What is the maximum possible area? (So, as a well-known example, for the case in which $d = 90$, the maximum possible area occurs for a square with side-length $N/4$; therefore, the max area is $N^2/16$.)","['optimization', 'reference-request', 'trigonometry', 'convex-optimization', 'geometry']"

2760805,Product Measures and Cartesian Products,"I'm using Royden & Fitzpatrick's Real Analysis , and I came across something that, for the life of me, I cannot make sense of.  Background: Start by letting $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{B},\nu)$ be two reference measure spaces.  A measurable rectangle is a subset $A\times B \subseteq X\times Y$ where $A\in \mathcal{A}$, $B\in\mathcal{B}$, and $\mu(A)<\infty$, $\nu(B)<\infty$. Now for the issue: Lemma 1 $\quad$Let $\{A_{k}\times B_{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ be a countable disjoint collection of measurable rectangles whose union also is a measurable rectangle $A\times B$.  Then $$\mu(A)\times \nu(B) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mu(A_{k})\times\nu(B_{k}).$$ Okay fine, the lemma seems reasonable in and of itself. As does most of the proof, except for this step in the beginning: Proof $\quad$ Fix a point $x\in A$. For each $y\in B$, the point $(x,y)$ belongs to exactly one $A_{k}\times B_{k}$. Therefore we have the following disjoint union: $$B=\bigcup_{\{k\,:\,x\in A_{k}\}}B_{k}\qquad\qquad(1)$$
... This doesn't quite make sense to me. Take for example the disjoint rectangles with $m$ the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$:  $A_{1}\times B_{1} = [1,3]\times [1,3]$ and $A_{2}\times B_{2} = [4,5]\times [1,4]$ (see picture -- Note that I've done the natural thing and $A_{1},A_{2}$ are on the $x$-axis and $B_{1},B_{2}$ are on the $y$-axis.) Now say I start by fixing a point, say $2\in A$. Interpreting the union (1) as written, the only set involved in the union is $B_{1}$, since $2$ is only in $A_{1}$. Interpreting the union this way, I don't get all of $B$, as clearly $B$ contains the point $y=4$ for instance, and $4\notin B_{1}$. On the other hand, if I interpret the $x$ as not really ""fixed"" as they say, but rather as moving along with $k$, then the union is not disjoint as claimed, because then $B=B_{1}\cup B_{2}$ yet $B_{1}\cap B_{2}\neq\emptyset$. Now, I am aware that $(A_{1}\times B_{1})\cup (A_{2}\times B_{2}) \subseteq (A_{1}\cup A_{2})\times (B_{1}\cup B_{2})$. But basically my questions are: (1) How should I interpret this union?  Am I interpreting this wrong or is there some issue with the notation? 
(2) Is there a better way to denote this that gets the point across, i.e., the expression of $B$ as a countable disjoint union? If so, what is it, and how can I transform that into what is given here? I suspect I am missing something fundamental here, but I am not sure.

For instance, the IVP $y'=y; y(0)=1$ tells us that the function will be increasing on zero to infinity, by taking another derivative that it will be concave up, etc. However, one may rightly argue that $e^x$ which is the solution easily gives these properties.

Here is a sketch: First, denote by $\pi_p$ the quotiening out by (some) element of order $p$.

2761022,"Characterizing derivatives and other functions as ""best local approximations""","People often say that the derivative of a function at a point is its ""best"" linear (or affine) approximation around that point. This seems like a good intuition, but I've never seen it made precise. What I'd hope for is a sort of universal property, given a class of possible approximations, that specifies which approximation is the best one, if it exists. I'd want to get continuity from the class of constant functions, derivatives from the class of affine functions, and in general the kth-order Taylor polynomial from the class of polynomials of degree up to k. One possible definition of one approximation being better than another might be that its error is smaller at every point in some neighborhood. That is: Given some class $G$ of functions $: X \to Y$, $f : X \to Y$, and $x \in X$, The best $G$-approximation of $f$ at $x$ is a function $g_0 \in G$ such that for all $g \in G$, there's a neighborhood $A$ of $x$ such that for all $x' \in A$, $d(g_0(x'), f(x')) \le d(g(x'), f(x'))$. (In particular, if we say that a function is continuous if it can be approximated by a constant function, we get this somewhat unusual definition of continuity: $f : X \to Y$ is continuous at $x \in X$ if for all $y \in Y$, there's a neighborhood $A$ of $x$ such that for all $x' \in A$, $d(f(x'), f(x)) \le d(f(x'), y)$.)

Right side of Equation (1) grows even faster than (1), so it should blow-up at $t<\pi/\sqrt{2}$ as well, as numerical exploration indicates. We can prove that Equation (2) blows-up by noting that $$ (\chi')^2=2(e^\chi-1)~~.$$ Then, we calculate the integral $$\int_0^\infty \frac{dz}{\sqrt{2(e^z-1)}}=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt 2}~~,$$ from where we can deduce that solution to Eq. (2) blows-up at $\pi/\sqrt{2}$ without actually having to solve (2). Can we maybe adapt something like this to second order? It goes without saying: any help, comment, question, or thought will be very appreciated.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
2761479,Finding the expected value of martingale increments on conditioned on brownian bridge,"I want to show that $\mathbb{E}[W_t - W_s | \mathcal{G}_s] = \frac{t-s}{1-s}(W_1 - W_s)$ for $0 \leq s \leq t$, where $W_t$ is the Weiner process, and $\mathcal{G}_s = \sigma(\mathcal{F}_t^W, \sigma(W_1))$, where $\mathcal{F}_t^W$ is the filtration of $W_t$. This is driving me crazy, I just keep getting the wrong answer. Using the linearity of expectation, we have $\mathbb{E}[W_t - W_s | \mathcal{G}_s] 
 = \mathbb{E}[W_t| \mathcal{G}_s] - \mathbb{E}[W_s| \mathcal{G}_s]$.  It seems to me that since $\mathcal{F}_s^W \subset \mathcal{G}_s$, we should have $\mathbb{E}[W_s| \mathcal{G}_s] = W_s$ (is this part wrong?) Now we are left with $\mathbb{E}[W_t| \mathcal{G}_s]$. I already know from this post: conditional expected value of a brownian motion that $\mathbb{E}[W_t|W_s] = \frac{t}{s}W_t$ for $0 <t <s$, so since $\sigma(W_1) \subset \mathcal{G}_s$, we have $\mathbb{E}[W_t| \mathcal{G}_s] = tW_1$. But then this gives $\mathbb{E}[W_t - W_s | \mathcal{G}_s] = tW_1 - W_s$, which is wrong. How do I properly deal with the fact that the sigma algebra gives us information about the future and past? Am I supposed to somehow use the fact that the question is only asking about the difference? Hints would be appreciated!

2761488,Where is the mistake in the argument? (And two conjectures),"Let $n$ be a natural number. $\Omega = \{ d : d | n \}$, For $A\subset \Omega$ define the probability for $A$ as :
$$P(A) = \frac{1}{\sigma(n)}\sum_{d\in A}{d}$$
Consider the set $B = \{d \in \Omega |d \equiv 0 (2) \}$. Let $a = v_2(n)$. Then (first conjecture)
$$P(B) = \frac{2^{a+1}-2}{2^{a+1}-1}$$
We have $E(d) = \sum_{d|n} {d \cdot P(d)} = \sum_{d|n} { d \cdot \frac{d}{\sigma(n)}} = \frac{\sigma_2(n)}{\sigma(n)}$
Second conjecture: $|B| = a \cdot b$, where $n = 2^a \cdot p_1^{a_1}\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is the factorization of $n$, with $a$ possibly $=0$ and $b = (a_1+1)\dots(a_r+1)$.
Consider $Z = \sum_{d \in B} {d}$ and consider the random variable: $Y_d = 1$ if $d \equiv 0 ( 2) $, otherwise $= 0$. Then $Z = \sum_{d|n} Y_d d$ is a random variable.
Then on the one hand we have:
$E(Z) = \sum_{d \in B}{E(d)} = \sum_{d \in B}{\frac{\sigma_2(n)}{\sigma(n)}} = a b \frac{\sigma_2(n)}{\sigma(n)}$
On the other hand we have
$P(B) = \frac{Z}{\sigma(n)}$ hence solving for $Z$ we get:
$$Z = \sum_{d|n}{d} \cdot \frac{2^{a+1}-2}{2^{a+1}-1}$$
From this it follows that:
$$E(Z) =  \frac{2^{a+1}-2}{2^{a+1}-1} \sum_{d|n}{E(d)} =  \frac{2^{a+1}-2}{2^{a+1}-1} \sum_{d|n}{\frac{\sigma_2(n)}{\sigma(n)}} = \frac{2^{a+1}-2}{2^{a+1}-1} \tau(n) \cdot \frac{\sigma_2(n)}{\sigma(n)}$$
Hence we get:
$$a b \frac{\sigma_2(n)}{\sigma(n)} = \frac{2^{a+1}-2}{2^{a+1}-1} \tau(n) \cdot \frac{\sigma_2(n)}{\sigma(n)}$$
from which it follows:
$$ab = \tau(n) \cdot \frac{2^{a+1}-2}{2^{a+1}-1}$$
But for example for $n=6$ this is wrong, so where is the mistake in the argument? If you happen to have a proof for one of the conjectures, that would also be fine.","['conjectures', 'expectation', 'proof-verification', 'probability', 'divisor-sum']"

To $p$ corresponds a $d$-fold cyclic covering $\pi\colon X \to \mathbb P^1_{\mathbb C}$. Briefly speaking, my question is: How do I get/construct $X$? More precisely: To complete to a covering of $P^1_{\mathbb C}$, I should homogenize the equation $y^d = p(x)$, i.e., I get an equation $$y^d = \prod_{i=1}^n (x-b_iz)z^a$$
for some $a \in \mathbb Z$. Now, such a curve is singular, so I have to normalize it to make it smooth. From the theory of hyperelliptic curves I know that such a normalization lives in a weighted projective space. Concretely, if $d = 2, n = 2g+2, g \geq 2, a = 0$, the above equation gives a smooth curve in the weighted projective space $\mathbb P (x,y,z) = \mathbb P (1,g+1,1)$. Similary, if $d = 2, g \geq 2$ but $n = 2g+1$, I choose $a = 1$ and obtain again a smooth curve in $\mathbb P (1,g+1,1)$.

So my questions are: Can a similar thing as for hyperelliptic curves be done in the greater generality described above?

When $a$ is chosen, is the normalization of the curve $\{y^d = \prod_{i=1}^n (x-b_iz)z^a\} \subset \mathbb P^2_{\mathbb C}$ obtained by the same equation in some weighted projective space?

2761814,Are notations in ZF conservative?,"In first-order logic with the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, it is convenient to introduce notations for sets that we prove exist and are unique. For example the union of two sets, ZF proves that:
$$\forall a \forall b\; \exists! u \;\forall t, \; t\in u \Leftrightarrow (t \in a \lor t \in b) $$
So we note $u = a \cup b$. That means we introduce a binary operator symbol $\cup$ with an axiom derived from the theorem above. It is easy to show that any model of ZF can be extended to a model of ZF $+\cup$, by interpreting $\cup$ as a function that maps $(a,b)$ to the unique $u$ above. However there is a glitch in the replacement axiom scheme. With the newly introduced symbol $\cup$, there are more formulas that can go into the replacement scheme, to produce more axioms. The previous reasoning didn't check that these new axioms are satisfied by the extended model. If we drop the unicity and start with this other ZF theorem : $\forall a, \; a\neq \emptyset \Rightarrow \exists u, u \in a$, then introduce the associated symbol Choice$(a)$ with the following axiom,
$$ \forall a, \; a\neq\emptyset \Rightarrow \text{Choice}(a) \in a $$
it is easy to derive the axiom of choice from that. Adding the symbol Choice and its axiom to ZF is consistent, but not conservative.

2761887,Why is there no matrix representation of a linear operator,"If a Hilbert space, $H$ , has orthonormal basis $\{e_i\}$ , then a linear operator $A:H \to H$ can only be defined by a matrix (i.e., $\{a_{i,j} : \langle Ae_i,e_j \rangle = a_{i,j}\}$ if the operator is bounded. 
I can't fully understand why we need this condition. I don't need an explicit counter-example, since it is seems to be hard to construct unbounded linear operators , but I would like an explanation of what exactly it means for a linear operator to be unbounded. Thanks! Edit: sorry, I worded my question badly. when I said 'I would like an explanation of what exactly it means for a linear operator to be unbounded' I meant in the context of this matrix representation. I.e., if we have a discontinuous linear operator on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, why does this matrix representation fail? To help you understand my confusion better, given this matrix representation, it's easy to see that for any $x = \sum_i x_i e_i \in H$ , $Tx = \sum_k (\sum_i x_i a_{i,j}) e_k$ . I believe this is ill-defined when $T$ is either unbounded (or discontinuous), but why is this? Is it because these infinite sums might be conditionally convergent?

2761892,"Designing a FIR filter in frequency domain: Paley-Wiener ""the other way around"".","This question is about designing a FIR filter in Paley-Wiener space by specifying its behaviour with respect to a finite set of frequencies. From the classical Paley-Wiener theorem(s) we get the following conditions sufficient for a function $h(t)$ to be real-valued with compact support in the interval $[0,A]$: Let $A>0$ and let $\hat{h}\left(z\right):\;\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ be a function with the following properties: 1.) $\hat{h}$ is an entire function. 2.) For $x\in\mathbb{R}$ the function $\Re\left(\hat{h}\left(x\right)\right)$ is even. 3.) For $x\in\mathbb{R}$ the function $\Im\left(\hat{h}\left(x\right)\right)$ is odd. 4.) $\exists c<\infty\;:\;\sup_{y>0}\intop_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left|\hat{h}\left(x+i\cdot y\right)\right|^{2}\mathtt{d}x\leq c$ 5.) $\exists\tilde{c}<\infty\;\forall z\in\mathbb{C}\;:\;\left|\hat{h}\left(z\right)\right|\leq\tilde{c}\cdot e^{A\left|z\right|}$ Then $h\left(t\right)=\intop_{-\infty}^{\infty}\hat{h}\left(x\right)e^{-itx}\mathtt{d}x$ is a real-valued function with compact support $\mathtt{supp}\,h\subseteq\left[0,A\right]$. The idea is now to specify the behaviour of $h$ with respect to a finite set of frequencies by requiring $\hat{h}$ to take certain values at those frequencies:
For $j\in\left[0,N-1\right]$, $\;f_{j}\in\mathbb{R}_{+}$ and $k_{j}\in\mathbb{C}$, we require that $\hat{h}\left(f_{j}\right) = k_{j}$. In order to construct such a $\hat{h}$, a Riesz-basis for the Paley-Wiener space would be helpful. Unfortunately, most of the Paley-Wiener theory applied to filter design deals with the opposite setting of band-limited functions, where only a real-valued and even Riesz-basis of the subspace of real-valued and even functions of frequency is used in order to receive a IIR filter.
We do however require a Riesz-basis for the whole PW-space. While obviously only its values along the real axis are of practical interest, we still need the theoretical properties of that basis as a set of complex-valued functions of a complex variable so that 1.-5. will hold. I would appreciate any hints to readings relevant to the setting described here and on how to obtain such a basis. Thank you! Edit:

(In the sense that they are collections of objects that don't give rise to russel's paradox). E.g. the collection of real numbers, or of $5$-dimensional manifolds or of symmetry maps on the unit circle or whatever, are all sets. However, I recall that sometimes structures cannot be assumed to be sets. E.g. we cannot speak of the Category of Categories apparently (unless we mean the category of small categories), since this would not be a set, and would give rise to russel's paradox (if I underatand correctly) My question is: is it generally required for any mathematical theory that the domain of any arbitrary structure that satiafies it is a set, rather than generally a collection?

2761966,Range of the Gelfand transform on a non-unital Banach algebra,"Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a non-unital commutative Banach algebra. Consider the Gelfand transform

\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}\hat{x}:\sigma(\mathcal{A})&\to \mathbb{C}\\
h&\mapsto \hat{x}(h)=h(x)
\end{align*}
In Folland's A course in Abstract Harmonic Analysis it is stated that in fact $\Gamma_{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{A})\subset C_0(\sigma(\mathcal{A}))$, i.e. if $x\in \mathcal{A}$ then for all $\varepsilon>0$ there is a compact $K\subset \sigma(\mathcal{A})$ such that $|\hat{x}(h)|\leq \varepsilon$ for all $h\in \sigma(\mathcal{A})\setminus K$. It is not well explained why this is true. The basic idea would be to try to get back to the unital case. We can consider the unital extension $\tilde{A}=\mathcal{A}\times \mathbb{C}$ of $\mathcal{A}$, where $\mathcal{A}\cong \mathcal{A}\times \left\{0\right\}\subset \tilde{A}$. We then have a homeomorphism (I think) \begin{align*}\sigma(\tilde{\mathcal{A}})&\cong \sigma(\mathcal{A})\cup \left\{0\right\}\\
0&\mapsto \tilde{0}:(x,\lambda)\mapsto 0\\
\sigma(\mathcal{A})\ni h&\mapsto \tilde{h}:(x,\lambda)\mapsto h(x)+\lambda 
\end{align*}
both are compact Hausdorff spaces in the weak*-topology induced by $\mathcal{A}^*$ and $\mathcal{A}$ respectively, while $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$ is only locally compact in general. The above homeomorphism in turn induces a Banach algebra isomorphism $C(\sigma(\tilde{\mathcal{A}}))\cong C(\sigma(\mathcal{A})\cup\left\{0\right\})$. With this identification we have $\Gamma_{\mathcal{A}}=r\circ \left.\Gamma_{\tilde{\mathcal{A}}}\right|_{\mathcal{A}}$ where $r:C(\sigma(\mathcal{A})\cup\left\{0\right\})\to C(\sigma(\mathcal{A}))$ is the restriction map.
Now I would like to use the topological/algebraic properties I know about $r$ and $\Gamma_{\tilde{\mathcal{A}}}$ to show that $\Gamma_{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{A})\subset C_0(\sigma(\mathcal{A}))$. I am aware that $\mathcal{A}$ is a closed maximal ideal of $\tilde{A}$ so since $\tilde{\mathcal{A}}$ is unital, $\Gamma_{\tilde{\mathcal{A}}}(\mathcal{A})$ is itself a closed non-trivial subalgebra of $C(\sigma(\mathcal{A})\cup\left\{0\right\})$.","['functional-analysis', 'gelfand-representation', 'banach-algebras']"

I define a zero of a function of order $m$ at $z_0$ to mean that the first $0,\dots m-1$ derivatives evaluated at $z_0$ are zero and the $m$th derivative is non-zero at $z_0$. The only if part of the prove leaves me a little unsure as to why the function $g(z)$ as I shall show below is holomorphic. I have searched online but it has mostly been stated that this function is holomorphic so maybe I'm missing something obvious? The proof goes like this: The Taylor series for $f(z)$ is:
\begin{align*}
f(z)&=0+\dots+0+\frac{f^{(m)}(z_0)}{m!}(z-z_0)^m+\frac{f^{(m+1)}(z_0)}{(m+1)!}(z-z_0)^{m+1}+\dots \\&=(z-z_0)^m \Big\{ \frac{f^{(m)}(z_0)}{m!}+\frac{f^{(m+1)}(z_0)}{(m+1)!}(z-z_0)+\dots\Big\}
\end{align*} and now the function in the curly parenthesis is denoted as $g(z)$, which is claimed to be the holomorphic function. It is clear $g(z_0)\neq0$ but could it be pointed out why the function is also a convergent power series ie analytic/holomorphic etc.","['roots', 'complex-analysis', 'analytic-functions', 'proof-explanation', 'power-series']"

The definition I have is $f \in S$ iff for all $N$, $\|f\|_N:=\sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d, |\alpha|,|\beta| \leq N} |x^\beta\partial_x^\alpha f(x)|<\infty$. I have shown that $\|f\|_N<\infty$ is equivalent to: for all $|\alpha|,|\beta| \leq N$, there exists a constant $C_N$ such that $|\partial_x^\alpha f(x)| \leq \frac{C_N}{\prod_{i=1}^n (1+|x_i^{\beta_i}|)}$. I also know that $\partial_x^\alpha (f*g)(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \partial_x^\alpha f(x-t) g(t) \ dt$. Since $\partial_x^\alpha f \in S$, I believe it suffices to show that for all $f,g \in S$, all $N$, and all $|\beta| \leq N$, we have $|(f*g)(x)| \leq \frac{C_N}{\prod_{i=1}^n (1+|x_i^{\beta_i}|)}$.

\left| \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x-t)g(t) \ dt \right| & \leq \int_{\mathbb{R}} \left| f(x-t)g(t)\right| \ dt\\

(Note that $|x-t|<|x|/2$ implies $|t|>|x|/2$.) However, I am struggling with how to split up the integral in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

But in order to do the step $\frac{C_N}{\prod_{i=1}^n (1+|t_i|^{\beta_i})} \leq \frac{C_N}{\prod_{i=1}^n (1+(|x_i|/2)^{\beta_i})} $ I need $|t_i| \geq |x_i|/2$ for all $i$. However these two sets do not encompass all of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (in particular, we miss all $t$ such that $|x_i-t_i| < |x_i|/2$ for some $i$ and $|t_j| < |x_j|/2$ for some $j$). I have tried integrating over one copy of $\mathbb{R}$ at a time, but as soon as we replace $f$ and $g$ by their upper bounds in the innermost integral, they are no longer guaranteed to have finite $L^1$ norm, so I cannot continue.

Show that $\sum a_n$ converges to $A$ if and only if $\sum b_n$ converges to $A$. My Attempt: In order to have a series at all for $\sum b_n$, we must of course assume that there are non-zero terms in $\sum a_n$; rather, we must also assume that there are infinitely many non-zero terms of the series $\sum a_n$, for otherwise both $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ and $\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$ be finite sums having the same non-zero terms and will thus be equal. Am I right? For the sake of definiteness, let us assume that $a_n = 0$ whenever $n$ is a prime number and that $a_n$ is non-zero otherwise. Let $\left( s_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\left( t_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be the sequences of the partial sums of $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$, respectively.  Then we note that

2762356,A question on Lyapunov exponents associated with a fixed point of a vector field.,"The Lyapunov exponent $\chi(x_{0}, e)$ in a direction $e \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ along the trajectory $x(t,x_{0})$ of a vector field $\dot{x} = f(x)$ through a point $x_{0}$ is defined to be $$\chi(x_{0},e) = \lim_{t \to \infty}\frac{1}{t} \log \frac{||X(t;x(t,x_{0}))e||}{||e||}$$ where $X(t;x(t,x_{0}))$ is the fundamental solution matrix of the linearisation of the vector field orbit about $x(t,x_{0})$. Here $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Let us consider the case of the the orbit being a fixed point. It is known that then $\chi$ is just the real parts of the eigenvalues associated with the matrix of the vector field linearised about the fixed point. How does one prove this? Why do the imaginary parts of e-values do not contribute to $\chi$?","['dynamical-systems', 'stability-theory', 'chaos-theory', 'ergodic-theory', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

Let $\bar{F}(s)=1-F(s)$ and $f = F'(s)$. Note that$$
F(0) = 1-\int_0^\infty f(s) ds.$$ Now define the following operation on $F$:
$$
HF(s)=\int_0^s \int_0^u (F(u)-F(u-v)) f(u-v) e^{-v}\, dv\, du.
$$
Now suppose $F_1,F_2$ are both cdfs as described above, and suppose for all $s$, $F_1(s) \leq F_2(s)$ and $F_1(0)=F_2(0)$, show that $HF_1(s) \leq HF_2(s)$ for all $s$. Thoughts One can use Fubini to change the order of integration, the second part can then be solved by writing it as:
\begin{align*}
-\int_0^s \int_v^s F(u-v) f(u-v) \, du e^{-v}\, dv
&=
-\int_0^s\int_0^{s-v}F(u)f(u)\,du e^{-v}\,dv\\
&=-\frac{1}{2} \int_0^s \left( F(s-v)^2-F(0)^2 \right) e^{-v}\, dv.
\end{align*}
However we can not do something similar for the first part as here the argument of $F$ and $f$ are not the same.. Partal Integration As suggested in the answer, partial integration can be used to get rid of the density $f$. An alternative partial integration to use to simplify the first part is to note that the first part equals:
$$
\int_0^sF(u)\int_0^uf(u-v) e^{-v}dv du
$$
and then use partial integration on $\int_0^uf(u-v) e^{-v}dv$, integrating $f(u-v)$ and differentiating $e^{-v}$.","['real-analysis', 'inequality']"

2762427,"No. of boolean functions of $n$ variables constructible from AND and OR, but without NOT","Consider a Boolean function $f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ from $\{0,1\}^n$ to $\{0,1\}$.  It is well known that there are $2^{(2^n)}$ such functions, because for each of $2^n$ possible input vectors you can choose the result.  Moreover, all these functions can be constructed with AND, OR, NOT, e.g. using disjunctive normal form.  (Obviously we allow each input $x_i$ to appear multiple times in the logic formula.)  My question is: How many such functions can be constructed if you can use AND, OR, but you cannot use NOT? As usual, a function is defined by its outputs.  So two different-looking formulas that agree on every input counts as the same function, e.g. $(x_1 \land x_2) \lor x_3$ is the same function as $(x_1 \lor x_3) \land (x_2 \lor x_3).$ My thoughts: At the very minimum, the function now must return $1$ when all inputs are $1$s, and must return $0$ when all inputs are $0$s.  (Note: constant functions $f\equiv 1$ and $f\equiv 0$ cannot be constructed using AND, OR, without NOT and without the literals $1, 0$ themselves.)  This upperbounds the number to $2^{(2^n-2)}$, because for those two input vectors you no longer have a choice of output.  However, I suspect this bound is extremely loose. More generally, consider input vectors $x$ and $y$ where $x_i = 1 \Rightarrow y_i = 1$ (or equivalently, $y_i = 0 \Rightarrow x_i = 0$).  Then I think any function with $f(x) = 1$ forces $f(y) = 1$, and similarly $f(y) =0$ forces $f(x) = 0$.  This is because turning some $0$s in the input into $1$s cannot decrease the output if you are only combining with AND, OR, but without NOT.  (However, I am not sure how to make this reasonsing rigorous...  maybe assume a tree structure of the formula and recurse up the tree?) Anyway, assuming the previous paragraph is correct, then it seems one approach is to consider an input vector $x$ as the subset of indices $\{i: x_i = 1\}$.  These $2^n$ subsets are partially ordered by inclusion, and any $f()$ must kind of define a ""surface"" of transition or a ""cut"" in the directed graph of ordering s.t. $f = 1$ on one side of the surface/cut (the side including the all $1$s vector), and $f=0$ on the other side.  However: (A) I have no idea how to count the number of such surfaces/cuts, and (B) I am not sure every such surface/cut can be constructed with AND, OR, but without NOT.  (I think each surface/cut can be constructed, as a disjunctive normal form of the ""minimal"" subsets for which $f = 1$, but I'm not perfectly sure.  Anyway if some surface/cut cannot be constructed, this would still provide an interesting upperbound on the number of such functions.) Further motivation: My original motivation was actually how many functions of $n$ real variables can be constructed by composing with $\max(,)$ and $\min(,)$, allowing each variable to appear multiple times in the formula.  However, after I noticed that $\max(x,\min(y,z)) = \min(\max(x,y), \max(x,z))$, I think they act like the Boolean AND, OR, so I think the questions are actually equivalent.  (Comments on this point are also welcome, even though it is not my main question.) Finally, expert users of MSE please feel free to edit the tags...  I'm not sure I'm using the right ones for this question.","['boolean-algebra', 'combinatorics', 'function-and-relation-composition']"
