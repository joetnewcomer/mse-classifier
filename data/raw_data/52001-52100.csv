541650,"Harris, Exercise 10.28 (weighted projective spaces)","So I recently started teaching myself about weighted projective spaces from Harris' Algebraic geometry. It was going well until I came across this exercise, which has me stumped: ""Show that any weighted projective space of the form $\mathbb{P}(1, \dots, 1, k, \dots, k)$ is isomorphic to a cone over a Veronese variety $v_k(\mathbb{P})^l$ (and in particular $\mathbb{P}(1, k, \dots, k) \cong \mathbb{P}^n$)."" I feel like I understand the discussion leading up to this exercise (on p. 128), but I don't see how to prove the statement.

541653,Prove a sum of sequence: Discrete math and weak induction,"The problem is as follows: Prove that $2 - (2\cdot7) + ((2\cdot7)^2) - ... +(2(-7))^n =
> \frac{(1-(-7)^{(n+1)})}{4}$ whenever $n$ is a non-negative integer. Our book is asking for a basic inductive proof to show that for any $n$, $n+1$ will also hold. So far I have the following: $\frac{1-(-7)^{(n+1)}}{4} + 2(-7)^{(n+1)} =?= \frac{1-(-7)^{(n+2)}}{4}$ I'm a little confused about why these problems are giving me so much trouble. I understand that we will assume (after having proven a base case) that the proof will work for any number k, and in proving this, we will show that any number (k+1) will also hold.  Perhaps I'm just setting it up incorrectly or am missing some small algebraic facet. In any case, if some one can get me going in the right direction, I would really appreciate it.","['induction', 'discrete-mathematics']"
541664,Homomorphic image of a Sylow p-subgroup is Sylow p-subgroup.,"Let $G$ be finite group and $\phi$ : $G \to H$ be a group epimorphism. If $P$ is a Sylow p-subgroup of $G$ then $\phi(P)$ is a Sylow p-subgroup of $H$. It looks very simple but I'm stuck here. Let $\lvert P\rvert=p^{k}$. Clearly $\lvert \phi(P)\rvert=p^{n}$ where $n\leq k$. Suppose $\phi(P)$ is not a maximal p-subgroup in $H$ and let $Q$ be a maximal p-subgroup of $H$ containing $\phi(P)$. Then $\lvert Q\rvert=p^{m}$ where $n<m$ and $\phi^{-1}(Q)$ is strictly larger than $P$. For the rest of the proof, what can I do? Thanks.","['sylow-theory', 'group-theory']"
541665,Fermat's 2 Square-Like Results from Minkowski Lattice Proofs,"Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem for lattices in the plane: Suppose $\mathfrak{L}$ is a lattice in $\mathbf{R}^2$ defined as $\mathfrak{L}=\{m\vec{v_1}+n\vec{v_2}:m,n\in\mathbf{Z}\}$ , where $\vec{v_1}$ and $\vec{v_2}$ are linearly independent. Suppose $d$ is the area of a fundamental parallelogram of $\mathfrak{L}$ . Then, if $\mathcal{S}$ is a convex and origin-symmetric region with $Area(\mathcal{S})>4d$ , then $\mathcal{S}$ contains some point $q\neq 0$ such that $q\in\mathfrak{L}$ . There is a particularly nice proof of Fermat's two square theorem - an odd prime $p$ is expressible as $x^2+y^2$ for $x,y\in\mathbf{Z}$ $\iff$ $p\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ - using this fact. Here is my proof below: Choose $a\in\mathbf{Z}$ such that $p|a^2+1$ . Now, let $\mathfrak{L}$ be a lattice in $\mathbf{R}^2$ defined as $\mathfrak{L}=\{m\vec{v_1}+n\vec{v_2}:m,n\in\mathbf{Z}\}$ where $\vec{v_1}=(a,1)$ and $\vec{v_2}=(p,0)$ . It is easy to see that a fundamental parallelogram $\mathfrak{F}$ of $\mathfrak{L}$ has area $p$ . Now, suppose $(x,y)\in\mathfrak{L}$ . Then we have $x=ma+np, y=m$ , so \begin{align*}x^2+y^2 &= (ma+np)^2 + m^2 \\ &= m^2a^2+2manp+n^2p^2+m^2\\ &= m^2(a^2+1) + 2manp + n^2p^2 \\ &\equiv m^2(a^2+1)\pmod{p} \\ &\equiv 0\pmod{p} \end{align*} due to our choice of $a$ . Now, let $\mathfrak{C}$ be an $O$ -symmetric circle with radius $\sqrt{2p}$ , so $\mathfrak{C}=\{(x,y)\in\mathbf{R}^2 : x^2+y^2<2p\}$ Then $$Area(\mathfrak{C})=2p\pi > 4p = 4\cdot Area(\mathfrak{F}).$$ Thus, by Minkowski, $\exists$ a lattice point $(j,k)\in\mathfrak{C}\setminus (0,0)$ . By the above work, $p|j^2+k^2$ , and by definition of $\mathfrak{C}$ , $j^2+k^2<2p$ . Moreover, $j^2+k^2$ is positive, so $0<j^2+k^2<2p$ , but in order for $j^2+k^2$ to be divisible by $p$ , we must have $p=j^2+k^2$ , so we are done. Are there any other results that can be derived in a similar manner? Specifically, what primes can be expressed as $x^2+2y^2$ ? $x^2+3y^2$ ? Any ideas are greatly appreciated.","['integer-lattices', 'discrete-mathematics', 'number-theory', 'geometry-of-numbers', 'sums-of-squares']"

Denote by $W$ the trivial Clifford module $\mathrm{Hom}_{C(V)}(S,E)$. $E$ is isomorphic to $W \otimes S$ as a Clifford module. $\mathrm{End}(W)$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{End}_{C(V)}(E)$. Question: Why do the above statements hold? The statements can be found in [BGV,ยง3.2] and [R,4.12] without any details. According to [BGV], the isomorphism $W \otimes S \to E$ is given by the evaluation. This is obviously a homomorphism of Clifford modules, but it is not obvious that the evaluation map is bijective.

541852,basic induction probs,"Hello guys I have this problem which has been really bugging me.

Now assume S(k), that in any group of k everybody has the same hair colour. If we replace any one in the group with someone else, they still make a total of k and hence have the same hair colour. This works for any initial group of people, meaning that any group of k + 1 also has the same hair colour. Therefore S(k + 1) is true. I cant seem to figure out where the problem lies in this proof.

541912,The empty function and constants,"On Wikipedia and also after searching this forum there is stated that for each $A$ there exists a unique function $f : \emptyset \to A$ called the empty function for $A$. In the theory of Algebraic Data Types (ADT's) and in functional programming languages (like Haskell) where one paradigma is ""everything is a function"" it is common to interpret constants as $0$-ary functions. A nullary function is just a function of the form $f : \emptyset \to A$, and so for every $A$ there must be such a function under this interpretation (so $|A|$ such functions) and this contradicts the uniques of one empty function for every $A$. Also on Wikipedia I read. The n-ary cartesian power of a set X is isomorphic to the space of functions from an n-element set to X. As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of X may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain X. So $X^0 = \{ x \}$, but otherwise if I interpret $Y^X$ as the set of functions from $X$ to $Y$ and interpret $X^n$ as $X^{\{1,\ldots,n\}}$ then $X^0 = X^{\emptyset} = \{ f : \emptyset \to X \}$? Could someone please clarify, I am confused... EDIT: Okay guess I got it now, but still confused. For every $A$ there is a  unique $f : \emptyset \to A$, but that is not equal to $f : A^0 \to A$, with $A^0 = \{ f : \emptyset \to A \}$ there are exactly $|A|$ functions $f : A^0 \to A$. But then I guess the following one statement about the nullary product on Wikipedia is wrong, that if the index set $I$ is empty, that

 \prod_{\emptyset} = \{ f_{\emptyset} : \emptyset \to \emptyset \}.

542222,When is Quotient Map a Covering Map,"Group $G$ acts on topological space $X$.

The question asks whether the quotient map $q : X \rightarrow X/G$ a covering map. I've worked at this for several days, but I feel like my understanding is shaky to begin with (especially since I am a beginner in both Abstract Algebra and Topology).  I want to say ""no"", since the quotient map is not, in general, injective so it itself can't be a homeomorphism.  However, a covering map has a union of disjoint open sets each mapped homeomorphically. I can think of a (possible) example: $X=[0,1)\times[0,1]$ with the relative topology from $\mathbb{R}^2$.  $G$ is the group $[0,1)\times\{0\}$ with the operation of componentwise addition modulo $1$.  Then, every $[0,1)\times\{y\} \subset X$ maps to a point in $G/X$.  Yet, $[0,1)\times\{y\}$ isn't a union of open sets each homeomorphic to a point.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"

Then evaluating the double integral I obtained this: $$4 \left ( 2a^{3/2}+2\int_{a}^{2a} \sqrt{a+\sqrt{2ay-y^{2}}} dy \right )$$ But I was stuck on this (I've tried to put the indefinite  integral$\int \sqrt{a+\sqrt{2ay - y^{2}}} dy$ into Wolfram Alpha and I obtained this ), then I said ""why I don't use polar coordinates?"" and I used them, and I obtained this double integral: $$4\int_{0}^{\pi /2} \int_{0}^{a}\frac{r}{\sqrt{2a-rcos\theta}} dr d\theta$$ I evaluated it, and I obtained: $$4\left ( \int_{0}^{\pi/2} -\frac{2}{3}\left ( \sec ^{2} \theta \sqrt{2a-\arccos {\theta}} \left ( 4a + acos\theta \right ) \right ) d\theta  \right )$$ But Wolfram says this for the indefinite integral so...

542870,Did Euclid prove that $\pi$ is constant?,"Pi is defined the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, but of course different circles have different circumferences and diameters, so in order for it to be well-defined we need to show that the ratios for any two circles is the same.  This is fairly trivial if we approximate the circles by regular n-gons and take the limit as n goes to infinity, what the ancients called Eudoxus' method of exhaustion.  Archimedes used this method with great success, in finding the circumference and area of a circle, the volume and surface area of a sphere, area bounded by a parabola, etc. My question is, did Euclid ever prove that Pi is constant in his Elements?  In Book XII Proposition II , he proves that the ratio of the area of a circle to the square of its diameter is the same for all circles, but does he ever prove that the ratio of a circumference of a circle to its diameter is the same for all circles?  In Book VI Proposition 33 he proves that for two circles of equal diameter, the length of an arc is proportional to the angle that subtends it, but does he ever relate the lengths of arcs on unequal circles to each other? Even if Euclid didn't prove this result, is it at least an easy corollary of something he did prove? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank You in Advance. EDIT:  In this thread on MathOverflow , it's claimed that the result follows immediately from Book III Proposition 34 and Book VI Proposition 33 , but I don't see how it follows at all. As I said above, Book VI Proposition 33 is about arc lengths for circles of equal diameter, so how do you get from that to a result about arc lengths for circles of unequal diameter? Book III Proposition 34, which is just about transferring angles from one circle to another, doesn't seem like it would suffice. EDIT 2:  I think there's a proposition that the result is even more likely to follow from than Book VI Proposition 33: Book III Proposition 27 , which says that equal arcs on equal circles correspond to equal angles.  Is there any way to use that proposition to prove that arcs on two UNequal circles corresponding to equal angles are proportional to the diameters of the circles?  That is to say, if S1 and S2 are arcs subtended by equal angles on circles of diameter D1 and D2 respectively, then S1/S2 = D1/D2. EDIT 3:  I should make clear that Euclid may not have viewed ""the ratio of a circumference of a circle to its diameter"" as meaningful, but I think he would have found meaningful the statement I gave in my previous edit: if S1 and S2 are arcs subtended by equal angles on circles of diameter D1 and D2 respectively, then the ratio of S1 to S2 is equal to the ratio of D1 to D2.  I should also mention that Euclid's definition of the equality of two ratios is Eudoxus' theory of proportion , a precursor to the Dedekind cut construction of the real numbers. EDIT 4:  It occurs to me that just as Euclid believed that a straight line and a circular arc were not magnitudes of the same kind, he may have believed the same thing about circular arcs in circles of unequal diameter, i.e. he may have thought that it's meaningless to ask whether a circular arc from one circle is longer or shorter than a circular arc from another circle if the circles don't have the same diameter.

542899,Constructing a directed graph from its spectrum,"This is related to the following question from cs theory stack exchange: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/3742/reverse-graph-spectra-problem So it seems as if given a sequence of real numbers, it is not always possible to generate a 0-1 symmetric matrix (with zeros on the diagonal) whose spectrum is the given sequence. This is because not only is it true that not all sequences can occur as eigenvalues of such matrices, but also because there exist non-isomorphic graphs with the spectrum. This leads to the question of characterizing n-sequences for which such a reverse reconstruction exists and whether such a reverse reconstruction is possible in more specific cases. Consider the case of simple digraphs (directed graph) and their line digraphs. In this case, the adjacency matrices are again 0-1 matrices with zeroes on the diagonal, but not the matrix need not be symmetric. The following paper shows a clean relationship between the spectrum of a digraph and that of its line digraph: http://www.academia.edu/1462821/Algebraic_properties_of_line_digraphs What I noticed in the introduction was that: ""As it is expected, it is not possible, to reconstruct the adjacency matrix of a digraph from the spectrum or the characteristic polynomial only. However we shall prove that this is possible for the case of line digraphs."" The paper claims to do this using a relation between the Jordan normal forms of the adjacency matrices of the digraph and its line digraph, which I am firstly unable to see clearly from the paper. Secondly, given any graph, I could convert it into a digraph in the natural way by having two arcs for each of its edges. Then given the spectrum of a graph, we could construct the spectrum of its line digraph, from which I could reconstruct the line digraph (accordin to the paper's claim), from which I could in turn reconstruct the digraph (this correspondence between a digraph and its line digraph is well-understood in the case of digraphs with no sources or sinks- from the result of Harary and Norman) from which we could construct the underlying graph.

However, I am not sure how to prove, $$\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta ^{n}f(x)}{\Delta x^{n}} = \lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0} \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n}(-1)^{n-i}\binom{n}{i}f(x+i\Delta x)}{\Delta x^{n}} = f^{(n)}(x)$$","['calculus', 'proof-writing', 'derivatives']"
543124,Does every Lie algebra come from commutator of some associative product operation?,"Suppose $\mathfrak{g}$ is an Lie algebra. Is it possible to define an associative product operation $\star$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ such  that $[A,B]=A\star B - B \star A$ ?  If it is not possible to do so in general, how do we know which Lie algebras come as commutator of some product operation ? (Are there any useful criteria ?) I am aware (without proof) that every Lie algebra has an embedding $f$ into an associative algebra such that the Lie bracket $[A,B]$ corresponds to $f(A)f(B)-f(B)f(A)$,but the question that I ask above demands something stronger.","['representation-theory', 'lie-algebras', 'abstract-algebra']"
543147,Quick question: sufficiently positive divisor,"I am referring to line 1-2 of page 472 in Griffiths Harris. M is a compact complex manifold of dimension 2 that may be embedded in projective space. L is an arbitrary line bundle on M. How can one choose a divisor D on M sufficiently positive so that both the linear series |D| and |L+D| contain smooth, irreducible divisors? Thanks.","['algebraic-geometry', 'vector-bundles']"
543153,Does the fact that a tiling is tile-uniform always guarantee that it is also vertex-uniform?,"It seems to me that if a tiling is tile-uniform, then it must be vertex-uniform as well. But is this the case? How would one go about devising a proof? By 'tile-uniform', I mean a tiling whose tile-types are the same; and a tiling which is 'vertex-uniform' is one whose vertex-types are all the same. I suppose to prove the above one would first need to look at the properties of the tile itself? By tiling, I refer to any kind of polygon.","['geometry', 'tiling']"
543174,Difficult Derivative?,"I'm in a single-variable calculus course, in which we recently covered logarithmic differentiation.  The professor proved it that works when $f(x)>0$, and when $f(x)<0$.  I've been trying to find a way to derive that kind of function when $f(x)=0$, but I'm not sure if it's possible, or what.  I've thought of this example, that resists all my efforts to differentiate, but seems to be differentiable, (and even appears to have a value of zero). Find $$f'\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right)\quad \rm where \quad f(x)=(\sin{x} + 1)^x .$$ Is there any way I can find this derivative (if it exists), beyond numerically computing the limit from the definition of the derivative? Or, vice versa, how can I prove that this derivative doesn't exist? Thanks,

543181,True or False? Continuous Functions,"If the function $f+g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then the functions $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are also continuous. False; Let $f(x)=\begin{cases} -1 \text{ if } x<0 \\ 1 \text{ if } x\ge 0 \end{cases}$ $\hspace{10pt}$ and $\hspace{10pt}$ $g(x)=\begin{cases} 1 \text{ if } x<0 \\ -1 \text{ if } x\ge 0 \end{cases}$ Then $(f+g)(x)=0 \hspace{10pt}\forall x$. Here, $f+g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, but the functions $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are not continuous. Is this a good example?","['continuity', 'real-analysis']"
543197,Inequality with the supremum,"I am trying to prove the following statement for $A\subset \mathbb{R},~\epsilon>0$ with $A$ bounded above: $\sup(A)-\epsilon<a\leq\sup(A)$, for some $a \in A$ I have tried dividing it into two cases. Case 1: $\sup(A)\in A$. Then take $a=\sup(A)$ and we are done. Case 2: $\sup(A)\notin A$. I tried to formalise the idea that if we started writing down elements of $A$ in increasing order, then the maximum element of these lists must tend to $\sup(A)$. This is because if it didn't, then there would be some element at which we would have to stop before we got as close as we wanted to $\sup(A)$. This element would be the least upper bound, but $\sup(A)\notin A $ which is a contradiction. Hence there exists $\epsilon$ such that $|a_n-\sup(A)|<\epsilon$ for some $n$ and the result follows. Is this proof valid? Are there any better ones? Thanks.","['elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"
543208,Why do I get 251 square dm the correct answer is 252 square dm? (Error by a fraction),"I am sorry if I am bothering you folks, I've recently started to play with Trigonometry, it's really cool, but trying to understand what mistakes I am making, anyhow, I am guessing that I shall use the Pythagorean Theorem. Here's what I have done: $(a)^2 + (10.9)^2 = (25.6)^2$ $a^2 + 118.81 = 655.36$ $a^2 + 118.81 -118.81 = 655.36 - 118.81$ $a^2 = 536.55 \implies \sqrt{a} = \pm \sqrt{536.55} = 23$ $a = 23$ $\text{Area} = 10.9 \times 23 \approx 251 (250.7)$ What's wrong, a fraction is missing or maybe I shall use Trigonometry instead.","['geometry', 'trigonometry']"
543209,Is this function twice differentiable at $0$?,"I have a function $f(x)$: $$f(x)=\frac{\exp(-|x|)}{1-0.5|\tanh(2x)|}$$ If I try differentiating it in Mathematica (taking $|x|=(2\theta(x)-1)x$ where $\theta(x)$ is Heaviside step function), I get answer in terms of Heaviside functions. But looking at the derivative I can't really see any jump there, which is why I start thinking that it has a second derivative too. But differentiating once more, I get answer with Dirac functions, which don't disappear when evaluating the result at $x=0$. If I instead represent $|x|=\sqrt{x^2}$, then for the first derivative I get an expression which has $0$ as its limit as $x\to0$, and for second derivative the limit appears to be 1. So from this I could make the conclusion that $f(x)$ is twice differentiable at $x=0$. So the question: is this function differentiable at $x=0$? Is it twice differentiable?","['derivatives', 'real-analysis']"
