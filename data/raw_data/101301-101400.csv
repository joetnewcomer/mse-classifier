1407321,Question about Branch Cuts,"I'm starting to learn a little complex analysis, and I'm a little confused as to what the purpose of a branch cut is. Is it to make a function continuous, or single valued? For example, the $\sqrt{}$ function is multivalued: since $w(z)=z^2$ has $w(z)=w(-z)$, in order to make $\sqrt{}$ the inverse of $z^2$, we can choose one of two branches, $w\to\sqrt{w}$ or $w\to -\sqrt{w}$, the former being the principal branch. This function maps $\mathbb{C}\to$(right half plane), and the other maps to the left half plane. As far as I can tell, both functions are now well defined on $\mathbb{C}$, but are not continuous because for a point $-r$ on the negative real axis, the principal branch $w(z)\to i\sqrt{r}$ as $z\to r$ from above, but $w(z)\to -i\sqrt{r}$ as $z\to r$ from below. To make the principal branch continuous, we just cut out this section of the real line and define the principal branch $\sqrt{}_{+}:\mathbb{C}\setminus (-\infty,0]\to\mathbb{C}$. Is this the right idea? Also, I was assuming Arg$(z)\in[-\pi,\pi)$; is this the only branch cut you could make with Arg$(z)\in[-\pi,\pi)$? Where would the branch cut be if Arg$(z)\in[0,2\pi)$ instead?","['self-learning', 'complex-analysis']"

1407328,Prove that $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{3n+5}{2n+7} = \frac{3}{2}$ through epsilon delta,"Prove that $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{3n+5}{2n+7} = \frac{3}{2}$ Proof: Let $a_n = \frac{3n+5}{2n+7}$ . Then, $\left | a_n-\frac{3}{2} \right |=\frac{11}{2(2n+7)}<\frac{3}{n}$ . Given $\epsilon > 0$ , choose $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n_0 > \frac{3}{\epsilon}$ . Then, for all $n \ge n_0, \left | a_n-\frac{3}{2} \right | < \epsilon $ . Therefore, $\lim a_n = \frac{3}{2}$ . I'm not quite sure I understand this proof. Namely: Where did $\frac{3}{n}$ come from? I guess we just replaced n with $\epsilon$ in the third sentence. How did the fourth sentence follow from the third, and why does that show that 3/2 is the limit? So I tried it myself on another problem, where $a_n = \frac{2n+5}{6n-3}$ , and the limit being $\frac{1}{3}$ : Let $a_n = \frac{2n+5}{6n-3}$ . Then, $\left | a_n-\frac{1}{3} \right |=\left | \frac{6n-6n+15-3}{3(6n-3)} \right |= \left | \frac{12}{3(6n-3)} \right |= 4\left | \frac{1}{6n-3} \right | < \epsilon$ . Dividing by 4, $\left | \frac{1}{6n-3} \right | < \frac{\epsilon}{4}$ . And that's as far as I logically get... I assume the next step is to choose an $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n_0 > \frac{\epsilon}{4}$ , and isolating epsilon, $\epsilon < 4n_0$ . but as you can tell, I'm really lost.","['limits', 'real-analysis', 'proof-writing', 'epsilon-delta']"
1407332,Implicit Differentiation. Please help me understand why!,"I am trying to understand implicit differentiation; I understand what to do (that is no problem), but why I do it is another story. For example: $$3y^2=5x^3 $$ I understand that, if I take the derivative with respect to x of both sides of the equation, I'll get: $$\frac{d}{dx}(3y^2)=\frac{d}{dx}(5x^3)$$
$$6y\frac{d}{dx}(y)=15x^2\frac{d}{dx}(x)$$
$$6y\frac{dy}{dx}=15x^2\frac{dx}{dx}$$
$$6y\frac{dy}{dx}=15x^2$$
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{15x^2}{6y}$$ Unless I made some sort of error, this is what I am suppose to do. But why? Specifically, on the second line, I utilize the chain rule for the ""outer function"" and get 6y, but I still need to utilize the chain rule for the ""inner function"" which is the y. So why don't I go ahead and take the derivative of y and get 1? I know that I am not suppose to, but I don't really ""get it."" It seems to me that I only use the chain rule ""halfway"". Why isn't it an all or nothing? If it's all done with respect to x, it would seem to me that the 3y^2 should remain unchanged entirely. This is my problem. And I apologize if I got some of the terminology wrong.","['implicit-differentiation', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"

1407375,Advanced Differential Geometry Textbook,"In algebraic topology there are two canonical ""advanced"" textbooks that go quite far beyond the usual graduate courses. They are Switzer Algebraic Topology: Homology and Homotopy and Whitehead Elements of Homotopy Theory. These are both excellent books that (theoretically) give you overviews and introduction to most of the main topics that you need for becoming a modern researcher in algebraic topology. Differential Geometry seems replete with excellent introductory textbooks. From Lee to do Carmo to so many others. Now you might be thinking that Kobayashi/Nomizu seems natural. But the age of those books is showing in terms of what people are really doing today compared to what you learn from using those books. They just aren't the most efficient way to learn modern differential geometry (or so I've heard). I am looking for a book that covers topics like Characteristic Classes, Index Theory, the analytic side of manifold theory, Lie groups, Hodge theory, Kahler manifolds and complex geometry, symplectic and Poisson geometry, Riemmanian Geometry and geometric analysis, and perhaps some relations to algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. But none of these topics completely , just as Switzer does with a unifying perspective and proofs of legitimate results done at an advanced level, but really as an introduction to each of the topics (Switzer does this with K-theory, spectral sequences, cohomology operations, Spectra...). The only book I have found that is sort of along these lines is Nicolaescu's Lectures on the Geometry of Manifolds , but this book misses many topics. This was inspired by page viii of Lee's excellent book: link where he lists some of these other topics and almost implies that they would take another volume. I'm wondering whether that advanced volume exists. Any recommendations for great textbooks/monographs would be much appreciated!","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'reference-request', 'manifolds', 'book-recommendation']"
1407377,Does anyone have a proof that the intersection and union of two compact sets is compact.,"I have my take on it. It is quite informal and don;t know where it would be evaluated correctly on an exam. Since the sets are compact that means for every open cover there is a finite cover. When the intersection is in question, taking any two covers of the sets, then there respective finite covers and taking that intersection of two finite covers gives us a finite cover of an intersection. For union just taking the finite covers and uniting them also gives us a finite cover of a union. Would this be sufficient in your opinions?","['analysis', 'calculus', 'compactness']"

Does  there  exist  an  element  of  order  $51$  in  the  multiplicative  group  $U(103)$ ? Now  if  the  element  exist  say $x$  then  it  satisfies  the  equation $$x^{51}\equiv 1\pmod {103}$$ .

1407451,"About the relation between the categories $\text{Sch}$, $\text{LRS}$ and $\text{RS}$","I've been trying to find some useful categorical facts about the category of schemes, locally ringed spaces and ringed spaces (that I shall denote by $\text{Sch}$, $\text{LRS}$ and $\text{RS}$ respectively). The motivation is that I'm trying to compute some (co)limits explicitly in the category of schemes. There's this excellent answer here On limits, schemes and Spec functor , but I still have some doubts. More precisely, I want to know about the following assertions: 1) Is the category of locally ringed spaces (co)complete? In the answer cited above, the references implies the existence of cofiltered limits and filtered colimits, however as I understand the notion of filtered in these cases is restricted to the case where the index category is a poset. 2)Is the category of ringed spaces (co)complete? 3)What can be said about the underlying topological space of the (co)limit of locally ringed spaces? (Is it the (co)limit of the topological spaces?) 4)What can be said about the underlying topological space of the (co)limit of  ringed spaces? (Is it the (co)limit of the topological spaces) 5)What can be said about the underlying topological space of the colimit of  schemes? (Is it the (co)limit of the topological spaces) Obviously, the underlying topological space of the pullback of schemes is not the pullback of the topological spaces (for instance, $\text{Spec} (\mathbb{C}) \times_{\text{Spec} (\mathbb{R})}\text{Spec} (\mathbb{C}) \cong \text{Spec} (\mathbb{C}\times\mathbb{C})$ by $a \otimes z \mapsto (az, a\overline{z})$), but the case of push outs seems to be true. 6) Are (co)limits preserved under the inclusions $\text{Sch} \hookrightarrow\text{LRS} \hookrightarrow \text{RS}$? 7) For each forgetful functor $U : \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$, where $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ are equal to $\text{Sch}$, $\text{LRS}$ and $\text{RS}$ (for all possible coherent substitutions), are there adjoint functors? 8) For each inclusion $\mathcal{C} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{D}$, where $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ are equal to $\text{Sch}$, $\text{LRS}$ and $\text{RS}$ (for all possible coherent substitutions), are there adjoint functors? According to http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2139 [Cor. 6], the inclusion $\text{LRS} \hookrightarrow \text{RS}$ have a right adjoint given by localization of the terminal prime system.

1407532,An element of $GL_n(\mathbb F_p)$ cannot have order $p^2$ if $n < p$,"I'm preparing for my graduate program's entrance exams, and I came across this problem when studying. Our study group came up with a solution, but I wanted to ask if it was actually correct, since after reflection I think there is a big hole. I'm also curious if there is a solution that doesn't involve linear algebra. The Problem Let $G$ be the direct product of $n$ copies of $\mathbb Z_p$, where $n < p$. Show that no automorphism of $G$ has order $p^2$. Solution It is easy to see that the automorphism group of $G$ is isomorphic to $GL_n(\mathbb F_p)$, so it suffices to show that no matrix in $GL_n(\mathbb F_p)$ has order $p^2$. Let $M \in GL_n(\mathbb F_p)$ satisfy $M^{p^2} = I$. Then $M$ satisfies the polynomial $x^{p^2} - 1$, which over a field of characteristic $p$ is equal to $(x-1)^{p^2}$, and it follows that the eigenvalues of $M$ are all $1$. (This is the potentially problematic step: it might follow from the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and the fact that the characteristic polynomial of $M$ divides $x^{p^2} - 1$, but I'm not clear that the second thing is true...) Now that we know that $M$ has only $1$ as an eigenvalue, consider the Jordan decomposition of $M$ over the algebraic closure $k$ of $\mathbb F_p$. It consists of Jordan blocks with (generalized) eigenvalue $1$ of size at most $n < p$, which means that the $p$th power of each block is the identity. Thus $M^p = I$ and $M$ cannot have order $p^2$.","['group-theory', 'linear-algebra', 'finite-groups']"
1407550,What hyperbolic space *really* looks like,"There are several models of hyperbolic space that are embedded in Euclidean space . For example, the following image depicts the Beltrami-Klein model of a hyperbolic plane: where geodesics are represented by straight lines. The following image, on the other hand, depicts the Poincare model of the same hyperbolic plane: where geodesics are represented by segments of circles intersecting the boundary of the disk orthogonally. Both of these models capture the entire $n$-dimensional hyperbolic space in a disk (or more generally, a Euclidean $n$-ball). I was thinking about what hyperbolic space would ""really look like"" from the perspective of an observer within the space. What came to mind was the exponential map , which maps an element of the tangent space $\mathrm{T}_PM$ of a point $p$ on a manifold $M$ to another point on the manifold: Intuitively, the exponential map follows the geodesic over the manifold that ""departs"" from the specified direction belonging to the tangent space. For example, the exponential map of the Earth as viewed from the north pole is the polar azimuthal equidistant projection in cartography: This seems to be what elliptic space would ""really look like"" from the perspective of an observer within the space, since light reaches our eyes by traveling along geodesics. This page and this page have demos. You may click around to get a feeling of what moving through an elliptic space would look like, though of course geodesics can go beyond the boundary of the disk in the demo by repeatedly wrapping around the sphere of the Earth. Given this background, my question is as follows: What does the exponential map from some point on a hyperbolic space look like, assuming that the contents of the space are depicted by the models above? Are there any demos or examples? Edit: This question seems to be related.

After this is completed use the $(n-1)$-st equation to eliminate the coefficients of $x_{n-1}$ in the first $n-2$ rows, ans so on.

Now we will use the $i$-th row to eliminate the coefficients of $x_i$ in each of the first $i-1$ rows for each $i=n,n-1,...,2$ ($i$ starts at $n$ and goes down to $2$), and we will get: $$ \left[

And so we get that the total number of multiplications/divisions required to apply the hybrid method is $\frac{n^3}{3}+\frac{1}{2}n^2-\frac{5}{6}n + \frac{1}{2}n^2-\frac{1}{2}n = \frac{1}{3}n^3+\frac{3}{2}n^2-\frac{11}{6}n$ which is different from $\frac{n^3}{3}+\frac{3}{2}n^2-\frac{5}{6}n$.

So far, I have read several equivalent definitions but I can't establish the equivalence between them on my own. The first definition is the Ehresmann connection that defines a connection on a manifold as a distribution of vector spaces completing the vertical space in the tangent space of the total space at each point. The second definition defines a connection on a manifold as a covariant derivative, i.e. a map $$\nabla: \Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(T^*M\otimes E)$$

Consider the integers $1,2,3,...,a$ Randomly Pick $b$ dinstinct element out of them. The question was ; what is the expected value of the smallest integer we picked ?
And the second smallest , third etc Let $P(n)$ denote the expected $n^{th}$ smallest. I started thinking about $P(1)$ and i assumed the following
( and it seemed to agree with my formulas/computations ) $1)$ If $P(n)\gt 0$ Then $P(n) = n P(1)$. That seemed logical ? I know that if $b = 1$ then $P(1)=\frac {a+1}2$. So i assumed $P(n)=\frac {n (a+1)}{(b+1)}$. But a friend told me it is just $P(n)= \frac {n a}b$ for $b\gt 2$ And he defended the idea with The average gap is $\frac ab$.
Or at least $P(1)=\frac ab$ and $P(n)$ is an arithmetic progression. I Said to myself : this can not be true. So I took the data and took the average of the first two smallest $\frac { ( P(1) + P(2) )} 2 $ And to my surprise it supported the idea of my friend ?!? Am I wrong ?

1408119,Proof of multivariate regression plane maximizes correlation in normals,"I am doing a homework sheet as practice for an upcoming course in multivariate statistics and been stuck on the following problem: Let $(Y,X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_p)^T\stackrel{d}{=}\mathcal{N}_{p+1}(0,\mathbf{C})$. Prove that $\mathbb{E}(Y|X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_p)$ maximizes Corr($Y,f(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_p)$) in the space of $f$ linear functions. My attempt so far: Proof of the conditional expectation being linear and calculating its value: We omit the linearly dependent cases due to their triviality. First as a starting point, we prove that the regression is minimized by a linear combination of the $X_i$s, and calculate the coefficients of this. 
Partition $\mathbf{C}$ and use the well-known identity for block matrices, using $Var Y:=\sigma^2$, $Var X_i=\sigma_i^2=c_{ii}$, $Cov(X_i,Y)=c_i$ and $Cov(X_i,X_j)=c_{ij}$:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{C}=\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma^2&\mathbf{c}^T\\
\mathbf{c}&\mathbf{D}\\
\end{pmatrix}\qquad 
\mathbf{C}^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma^2&\mathbf{c}^T\\
\mathbf{c}&\mathbf{D}\\

\begin{pmatrix}
(\sigma^2-\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c})^{-1}&
-\sigma^{-2}\mathbf{c}^T(\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{c})^{-1}\\
-\sigma^{-2}(\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{c})^{-1}\mathbf{c}&
(\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{c})^{-1}\\
\end{pmatrix}=:\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha^2&\beta^T\\
\beta&\delta\\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
With extra assumption $\det\mathbf{C}\det\mathbf{D}\neq 0$. Also note that $Var(\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{X})=\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{a}$. 
Thus their joint density function is:
\begin{equation}
f(y,\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{p+1}\det\mathbf{C} }}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left((y,\mathbf{x})^T\mathbf{C}^{-1}(y,\mathbf{x})\right)\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{p+1}\det\mathbf{C} }}\exp\left(-\frac{\alpha^2y^2+2\beta^T\mathbf{x}y+\mathbf{x}^T\delta\mathbf{x}}{2}\right)=

\begin{equation}
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{p+1}\det\mathbf{C} }}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha y-\frac{\mathbf{x}^T\beta}{\alpha}\right)^2-\frac{\mathbf{x}^T\delta\mathbf{x}}{2}+\frac{(\mathbf{x}^T\beta)^2}{2\alpha^2}\right)
\end{equation}
We know from the notes that $\mathbb{E}(Y-g(X_1,\ldots,X_p))^2$ is minimized by:
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}(Y|X_1,\ldots, X_p)=\frac{\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}yf(y,\mathbf{x})\,\mathrm{d}{y}}{\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(y,\mathbf{x})\,\mathrm{d}{y}}=\frac{\mathbf{x}^T\beta}{\alpha^2}=
\boxed{-(\mathbf{x}^T\sigma^{-2}(\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{c})^{-1}\mathbf{c})(\sigma^2-\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c})}
\end{equation}
The denominator:
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{p+1}\det\mathbf{C} }}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha y-\frac{\mathbf{x}^T\beta}{\alpha}\right)^2-\frac{\mathbf{x}^T\delta\mathbf{x}}{2}+\frac{(\mathbf{x}^T\beta)^2}{2\alpha^2}\right)\,\mathrm{d}{y}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{p}\det\mathbf{C} }\alpha}\exp\left(-\frac{\mathbf{x}^T\delta\mathbf{x}}{2}+\frac{(\mathbf{x}^T\beta)^2}{2\alpha^2}\right)
\end{equation}
The numerator is an expectation of a normal random variable with mean $\displaystyle\frac{\mathbf{x}^T\beta}{\alpha}$:
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{y}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{p+1}\det\mathbf{C}}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha y-\frac{\mathbf{x}^T\beta}{\alpha}\right)^2-\frac{\mathbf{x}^T\delta\mathbf{x}}{2}+\frac{(\mathbf{x}^T\beta)^2}{2\alpha^2}\right)\,\mathrm{d}{y}
=\frac{\mathbf{x}^T\beta}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{p}\det\mathbf{C} }\alpha^3}\exp\left(-\frac{\mathbf{x}^T\delta\mathbf{x}}{2}+\frac{(\mathbf{x}^T\beta)^2}{2\alpha^2}\right)
\end{equation}
which proves it is linear.
We have to minimize $\displaystyle \mathbb{E}\left(Y-b-\sum_{i=1}^{p}a_iX_i\right)^2$. This is from the exponential family, thus we can switch the order of integration and differentiation:
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial a_i}\left(Y-b-\sum_{j=1}^{p}a_jX_j\right)^2\right)=-2c_i+2\sum_{j=1}^{p}a_ic_{ij}\qquad \mathbb{E}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial b}\left(Y-b-\sum_{j=1}^{p}a_jX_j\right)^2\right)=2b
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial a_i^2}\left(Y-b-\sum_{j=1}^{p}a_jX_j\right)^2\right)=2c_{ii}\qquad \mathbb{E}\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial b^2}\left(Y-b-\sum_{j=1}^{p}a_jX_j\right)^2\right)=2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial a_i \partial a_j}\left(Y-b-\sum_{j=1}^{p}a_jX_j\right)^2\right)=2c_{ij}\qquad \mathbb{E}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial a_i \partial b}\left(Y-b-\sum_{j=1}^{p}a_jX_j\right)^2\right)=0
\end{equation}
So the Hessian is positive definite at this point, meaning that the minimum is obtained a when:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{D}\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{c}\Rightarrow \boxed{\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c}\qquad b=0}
\end{equation} And that it is the maximum We want to find the maximum in the direction $\mathbf{v}$, so take $t(X_{i=1}^p,u)=(\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c}+u\mathbf{v})^T\mathbf{X}$, then using $\mathbf{D}^T=\mathbf{D}$:
\begin{equation}
{Corr}(Y,t(X_{i=1}^p,u))=\frac{Cov(Y,(\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c}+u\mathbf{v})^T\mathbf{X})}{\sqrt{Var Y Var((\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c}+u\mathbf{v})^T\mathbf{X})}}=

\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial u}{Corr}(Y,t(X_{i=1}^p,u))=
\frac{u((\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{v})^2-\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{v})}
{\sigma(\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c}+2u\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{c}+u^2\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{v})^{3/2}}
\end{equation}
With some straightforward and lengthy calculations, we have:
\begin{equation}
\left.\frac{\partial^2}{\partial u^2}{Corr}(Y,t(X_{i=1}^p,u))\right|_{u=0}=-\frac{\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{v}-(\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{v})^2}{(\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c})^{3/2}}
\end{equation}
So we must have $u=0$ or $(\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{c})^2-\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{v}=0$, meaning that the correlation is constant in the direction of $\mathbf{v}$.
Let $\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{v}_\perp+\lambda\mathbf{c}$, where $\mathbf{v}_\perp$ is orthogonal to $\mathbf{c}$, thus:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{v}-(\mathbf{v}\mathbf{c}^T)^2=\lambda^2\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{c}+\lambda\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{v}_\perp-(\lambda\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{c})^2
\end{equation}
If $\mathbf{Y}$ is independent, then the correlation is $0$. If that's not the case, with scaling we can achieve $\textbf{c}^T\textbf{c}=1$. $\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{c}\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{D}\mathbf{c}=(\mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{c})^2$ And there I'm just stuck, any ideas how to continue?","['matrix-equations', 'statistics', 'inequality']"

Like, $0.{1^2}'{2^2}'{3^2}'{4^2}'\cdots=0.14916\cdots$. I wasn't able to come up with something better. It is easy to show $0.{1^n}'{2^n}'{3^n}'{4^n}'\cdots$ is always irrational: if it were not, we would find that the number of consecutive zeroes in its period would have a maximum, but obviously we can always get one more reaching a new power of $10$. 
When it comes to the powers of a single natural number $m\ne 0,1$, in general that is $0.{m^0}'{m^1}'{m^2}'\cdots$, the irrationality follows from the fact that the last $1,2,3,4,\cdots,l$ digits of such powers repeat with different periods, yielding no total repetition. We then have Copeland-Erdos's constant $0.2357\cdots$, whose irrationality follows from Dirichlet's theorem. Does this work for the number $x$ whose decimal expansion is formed by concatenating the $n$-th powers of the primes?

1408231,Proof that Right hand and Left hand derivatives always exist for convex functions.,"Definition A function $f$ is convex on an interval if for $a,x, \text{and} \;b$ in the interval with $a\lt x\lt b$, we have $$\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\lt \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.$$ While reading the proof that if $f$ is convex on some open interval containing $a$, then $f_+'(a)$ and $f_{-}'(a)$ always exist. The proof first shows that $[f(a+h)-f(a)]/h$ is decreasing as $h\to 0^+$, so 
$$f_+'(a)=\lim_{h\to 0^+}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}=\operatorname{inf}\{\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}:h\gt 0\}.$$ The proof states that this inf exists because each quotient $\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$ for $h\gt 0$ is greater than any one such quotient for $h'\lt 0$. However, I'm struggling to show this inequality, that for any $h\gt 0$ and $h'\lt 0$, we have $$\frac{f(a+h')-f(a)}{h'}\lt \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.$$ I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can help me prove this inequality.","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'analysis', 'convex-analysis', 'inequality']"

Loosely speaking, for example, one obtains the Borel hierarchy by applying a certain transfinite induction on open/closed sets indexed by ordinal numbers $\alpha_k < \omega_1$, taking unions at limit stages, and so on. On the face of it, it appears that the complexity of the sets used in real analysis and measure theory are of low complexity in the Borel hierarchy, and sets in functional analysis (I am thinking spaces of functions, etc) are of a strictly higher complexity, but I am unsure where or how their relative complexity is classified in the known hierarchies. My main question can be split into some sub-questions: 1) What are the most ""complicated"" sets which one encounters in general analysis, and how may one translate complexity classification in DST to concrete problems in real analysis? 2) Is there any reasonable method in DST to measure the set-theoretic complexity of general spaces?

I apologize if (2) is a silly question, but a nice reference noting the recent applications of DST to functional analysis is found here http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~anush/Notes/dst_lectures.pdf in the introduction, namely in connection with a background for classification problems in a concrete setting.

1408533,Lebesgue Premeasure via Transfinite Induction,"If $I=[a,b)$ we write $|I|=b-a$ for the length of $I$. Given a theorem of Caratheodory, the tricky part in showing the existence of Lebesgue measure is this: Lemma If $[0,1)$ is the disjoint union of a countable collection $(I_j)$ of half-open intervals then $\sum_j|I_j|=1$. It's easy to conclude that this is easier than it really is, if, as for example in Easy proof for existence of Lebesgue-premeasure , one assumes that we can order the $I_j$ in such a way that $I_{j+1}$ lies to the right of $I_j$. The actual arrangement of the $I_j$ within $[0,1)$ can be much more complicated than that. Let's call the failed argument the ""naive"" proof. The lemma is more or less Lemma 1.15 in Folland Real Analysis (Folland does it for general Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures). Folland calls the proof ""remarkably fussy"", which seems right. He says that the reason for the remarkable fussiness is that the arrangement of the intervals within $[0,1)$ can be order-isomorphic to any countable ordinal. His point is that a countable ordinal can be complicated. I read this comment once and said to myself a countable ordinal is not that bad. In fact one can fix the naive proof, using a simple transfinite induction. (And we don't need to actually mention ordinals per se at all.) Question Anyone ever seen the proof below? Proof of the Lemma Given two disjoint intervals $I$ and $J$, write $I<J$ if $x<y$ for every $x\in I$ and $y\in J$. Suppose that $[0,1)$ is the disjoint union of the half-open intervals $I_j$. First we note that the $I_j$ are well-ordered (under the order on intervals we just defined). Indeed, if we had a decreasing sequence of $I_j$ they would accumulate at some point $x$. But there exists $k$ so $x\in I_k=[a_k,b_k)$, and hence disjointness shows our sequence of intervals cannot accumulate at $x$ after all. Just for the sake of notation, we want there to be a rightmost interval. So add the interval $[1,2)$ to the collection, so now the union is $[0,2)$. The letters $I$ and $J$ will always refer to intervals in our collection. We claim that for every $J$ we have $$\left|\bigcup_{I\le J}I\right|=\sum_{I\le J}|I|\quad(*).$$ If not, suppose that $J$ is the smallest counterexample: For every $J'<J$, ($*$) holds with $J'$ in place of $J$. Then $$\bigcup_{I<J}I=\bigcup_{J'<J}\left(\bigcup_{I\le J'}I\right),$$so
$$\left|\bigcup_{I<J}I\right|=\sup_{J'<J}\left|\bigcup_{I\le J'}I\right|
=\sup_{J'<J}\sum_{I\le J'}|I|=\sum_{I<J}|I|,$$and we're done (add $J$ to the union on the left and $|J|$ to the sum on the right). So ($*$) holds for every $J$, and setting $J=[1,2)$ shows precisely that $\sum|I_j|=1$.","['transfinite-induction', 'ordinals', 'reference-request', 'measure-theory']"

Such graphs may be viewed as ""associahedrons"", though my question doesn't involve the graph theory approach so much, and in my case I assume for fixed $n$ that the graph contains as vertices all the parenthesized products. For example, for $n=4$ there are five vertices, each adjacent to $2$ others, and so essentially two possible Hamiltonian cycles. I found that in the case of $n=5$ it was possible to find a Hamiltonian cycle going through all $14$ vertices. (Here I think there are more than one such cycle...) My question is what happens for larger $n.$ I tried $n=6$ and got close, proceeding by using cycles from previous cases and ""sewing them up"" into a complete cycle. However I got lost in the details. So I'm curious about the $n=6$ case, and in general for higher $n$ is there a known cutoff beyond which it is known no Hamiltonian cycle exists.

(I'd like to see a proof of this but maybe it's too hard ) This has a striking similarity with Zsigmondy's theorem and this similarity makes much more sense when we think about the well-known formula for $F_n$:
$$F_n=\frac{x^n-y^n}{\sqrt{5}}$$ (difference of powers like in Zsigmondy's but they're not integers ) 2.The gcd property . It's well-known that :
  $$(F_n,F_m)=F_{(n,m)}$$ Looking again at the representation of $F_n$ we make the connection with the following : $$(a^m-b^m,a^n-b^n)=a^{(n,m)}-b^{(n,m)}$$ As a corollary of this we can get : $$F_n \mid F_{kn}$$ which has the correspondent : $$a^n-b^n \mid a^{kn}-b^{kn}$$ 3.The fact that $$F_{p-\left( \frac{p}{5} \right )} \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$$ for $p$ a prime. (I'd like to see a proof of this ) It seems like an equivalent to FLT in some way .Because of the difference of powers it seems connected with $a^{p-1}-b^{p-1} \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ 4.The Fibonacci binomial coefficients . The numbers :
  $$\binom{m+n}{n}_F=\frac{F_{m+n} \cdot \ldots \cdot F_{m+1}}{F_{n} \cdot \ldots \cdot F_1}$$ are always integers. (I'd like to see a proof of this also ).

What other sequences have such remarkable properties ? (ex what about Lucas's , Pell's or any other sequences ?) I'd appreciate any answers to these questions .Thank you for all the help.

Is it true that $v_p(F_{nk})=v_p(F_{k})+v_p(n)$ with $p$ prime which divides $F_k$ (the above lifting theorem for Fibonacci numbers would be a corollary of this )? Is this true?

So I define a map $P:M\to Y$ such that $p(m)=y$ for which  $d(m,Y)=||y-m||$. This is well defined. Now $S=\{p(m)|m \in M\}$. Now I claim that $\bar{S}=Y$. Let $y_0 \in Y$. Let $r \gt 0$.Then since $\bar{M}=X$, there exists $m_0\in M$ such that $||m_0-y_0|| \lt r$. Corresponding to $m_0$, there exists a unique $P(m_0) \in Y$ such that $||m_0-Y||=||m_0-p(m_0)|| \le ||m_0-y_0|| \lt r$. And we are done. Thanks for the help!!","['hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
1409064,"Proving that $\int_0^{\pi/2} (\sin (\tan (x))+\cot (x) \cos (\tan (x))-\cot (x))\cot (x) \, dx=\frac{\pi(e-2)}{2e}$","I think one of the ways of doing it is by the use of the differentiation with parameter. Do you see an easy way of calculating it by real methods? $$\int_0^{\pi/2}  (\sin (\tan (x))+\cot (x) \cos (\tan (x))-\cot (x))\cot (x) \, dx=\frac{\pi(e-2)}{2e}$$ What tools would you like to employ? Solutions are just optional. EDIT_I: or in other words we might focus on the harder part, that is proving that $$\int_0^{\pi/2} \cot ^2(x) (1-\cos (\tan (x))) \, dx=\frac{\pi}{2e}$$ EDIT_II: and after some work all gets reduced to calculating $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\cos(x)}{1+x^2} \ dx$$ that is well-known, this being the last part. EDIT_III: we're done. Thanks!","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'definite-integrals', 'integration']"
1409066,Geodesics without a metric,"By definition, a geodesic is a mapping $\gamma: I = (0, 1)  \rightarrow M$ such that $\nabla_{\dot{\gamma}(t)} \dot{\gamma}(t) = 0$. Here we only need the connection. So, we do not need a metric to define a geodesic? Is such kind of geodesic useful?","['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry']"
