Problem Prove that if $\Omega = \{1,2,3,\ldots\}$, then $S_{\Omega}$ is an infinite group. Solution : First it is easy to show that it is a group by checking the definition. The only slightly non-trivial part is $\vert S_{\Omega} \vert = \infty$. Given any $n$, we have the element $(1,2,\ldots,n)$ is of order $n$, i.e., the group generated by $(1,2,\ldots,n)$ has $n$ distinct elements. We also have that the order of the group is greater than or equal to the order of the group generated by any element, i.e., all these elements are also elements of $S_{\Omega}$. Hence, we have $\vert S_{\Omega} \vert \geq n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. Hence, $\vert S_{\Omega} \vert = \infty$.

619053,What is known about this jigsaw combinatorics problem?,"The problem: How many valid reconfigurations, as defined below, are there for a given puzzle? My question is, what , if anything, is known about this problem already? For example, does this problem--or an equivalent problem; or perhaps a more limited variation, say $1 \times n$; or with non-square rectangular pieces to limit the number of external edge matches--have a conventional name? Did I actually come up with something new, or am I just describing a known problem with my own terminology because I don't know any better ? The definitions as formally as I can, based on simple physical jigsaw puzzles with unique squiggly parts and uniform straight parts: puzzle : an $m \times n$ grid full of identically-sized, identically-oriented pieces piece : a square of $4$ edges; denoted $a_{i,j}$ for the piece in row $i$, column $j$ of puzzle $A$ where $1 \leq i \leq m$ and $1 \leq j \leq n$ edge : a means of joining two pieces; is either internal or external joined : two pieces sharing exactly one edge (either in the puzzle or a reconfiguration ) internal edge : a unique edge joining two pieces in the puzzle; denoted $\overline{a_{i,j}a_{g,h}}$ for joined pieces $a_{i,j}$ and $a_{g,h}$ the external edge : each of the identical $2m + 2n$ edges in the puzzle that are not internal a reconfiguration : the puzzle, modified by operating on individual pieces by means of right-angle rotations and piece-size translations, such that the end result is contiguous, i.e., any given piece is related to any other piece via a series of edges a valid reconfiguration : a reconfiguration wherein no two pieces are vertically or horizontally adjacent unless the edge they share is either the internal edge they share from the puzzle, or the external edge (i.e. an internal edge matches only as it does in the puzzle, and cannot match a different internal edge, nor the external edge) Informal clarifications Note that, necessarily, a valid reconfiguration is made by various joins of the external edge that were not part of the puzzle, and it will not be a neat rectangle in the end. That is to say, you can glue the straight parts together on the inside, you can't mismatch the squiggly parts, and some squiggly parts will now be on the outside. I actually thought of this question when considering such an arrangement of a normal physical puzzle for an artistic idea (maybe Picasso's cubism collides or colludes with Warhol?) so it is entirely made with real, physical puzzles in mind. Why this seems like a tricky combinatorial problem to me For $1 \times 1$, the puzzle cannot be reconfigured because no joins are possible because there is only one piece. For $1 \times 2$, there are $9$ valid reconfigurations, namely those made from the various combinations of matching any of the $3$ straight edges of $a_{1,1}$ with any of $3$ straight edges of $a_{1,2}$ (here pictured as A and B, respectively, because re-doing work in Excel wore me out): For $1 \times 3$, I count: $\overline{a_{1,1}a_{1,2}}$ intact, with one of $a_{1,3}$'s straight edges joined to one of $a_{1,2}$'s $= 3*2 = 6$ $\overline{a_{1,1}a_{1,2}}$ intact, with one of $a_{1,3}$'s straight edges joined to one of $a_{1,1}$'s $= 3*3 = 9$ $\overline{a_{1,2}a_{1,3}}$ intact, symmetrical with $a_{1,1}$ as in the above two cases $= 6 + 9 = 15$ $a_{1,1}$ joined to $a_{1,2}$ via a straight edge, and $a_{1,3}$ joined to $a_{1,2}$ via $a_{1,2}$'s other straight edge $= 3*2*3 = 18$ $a_{1,1}$ joined to $a_{1,3}$ via a straight edge, and $a_{1,2}$ joined to $a_{1,3}$ via another of $a_{1,3}$'s straight edges $= 3*3*2*2 = 36$ $a_{1,1}$ joined to $a_{1,3}$ via a straight edge, and $a_{1,2}$ joined to $a_{1,1}$ via another of $a_{1,1}$'s straight edges $= 3*3*2*2 = 36$ ...for a total of $120$ valid reconfigurations, if I didn't miss anything. For a $2 \times 2$, it certainly gets hairier: $\overline{a_{1,1}a_{1,2}}$ and $\overline{a_{1,1}a_{2,1}}$ intact, with $a_{2,2}$ removed and rejoined elsewhere $= 3*6 = 18$ symmetry of above with each of the other pieces functioning as $a_{2,2} = 3 * 18$ $\overline{a_{1,1}a_{1,2}}$ intact, and $a_{2,2}$ joined to $a_{1,2}$ by a straight edge: includes the case where the other joins are $\overline{a_{2,1}a_{2,2}}$, $a_{1,1}$'s top external edge with $a_{2,1}$'s bottom external edge, and $a_{1,2}$'s top external edge with $a_{2,2}$'s bottom external edge not as simple to calculate by straight multiplication, though: naturally cannot include invalid reconfigurations like where the other joins are $a_{1,1}$'s top external edge with $a_{2,1}$'s bottom external edge and $a_{2,2}$ rotated once clockwise so that its right edge joins $a_{1,2}$'s top edge, because $a_{2,2}$'s bottom edge, which is external, cannot join $a_{2,1}$'s right edge, which is the internal edge $\overline{a_{2,1}a_{2,2}}$...here it's already tricky ... total unknown For $1 \times 4$, there would, I would think, be more solutions than $2 \times 2$, since there are 10 external edges instead of 8, but it would also be tricky to calculate because of combinations of external edge joins that would need non-matching internal edges to join, which they can't. Holes for slightly larger puzzles Holes may arise in valid reconfigurations: The example above shows three different puzzles and a valid reconfiguration for each one that happens to have a hole.  (Straight edges are solid, and internal edges are dotted, even though different dotted edges may only join if they're joined in the original.  In a real puzzle these are the unique squiggly cuts resulting in two pieces sharing a pair squiggly parts that can only fit each other.)  The top $3 \times 4$ puzzle's reconfiguration has a hole with all internal edges, the middle $2 \times 4$ puzzle's reconfiguration has a hole with a mix of internal edges and straight edges, and the bottom $1 \times 8$ puzzle's reconfiguration has a hole with all straight edges. All of these are valid reconfigurations. Bounds A completely brute force approach to counting these may be taken by looking at all possible reconfigurations, then excluding the invalid ones (any where the graph is disconnected, or unmatching internal edges are adjacent.)  Then the question of rotational equivalence could be addressed, AFAICT simply by dividing by 4. The biggest area to check is $mn$ by $mn$, and each square in it can be occupied by one of the $mn$ original pieces in one of 4 rotations, or left blank.  One cannot use a simple permutation function for the upper bound here because of the rotations--once a piece is used in a particular rotation, the possibility of using its other three rotations in the same potential reconfiguration goes away. Sequences On the topic of just the $1 \times n$ set of cases, we have the sequence 0, 9, 120, ... (or, if you want to include the original configuration, 1, 10, 121, ... but it's not clear if it is, in fact, related to any known sequence.  Perhaps some software could be written to calculate a few more numbers in the sequence to help with this.",['combinatorics']

619074,Understanding the Category of open subsets of a top. space X $Op_X$,"I have a problem very similar to the one posted here by Brian. I guess he also stumbled across the introduction of the category of open subsets of a topological space X (denoted by $Op_X$) in Pierre Schapira's lecture notes on Algebra and Topology (or one of his sources). There you can read: Let $X$ be a topological space. The family of open subsets of $X$ is ordered by inclusion and we denote by $Op_X$ the associated category. Hence: $$\mathrm{Hom}_{Op_X}(U,V) =\begin{cases} \{\text{pt}\} & \text{if }U \subset V,\\ 
\emptyset & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}$$ Okay, $\{\text{pt}\}$ is simply defined beforehand as a set with one single element, I get that. $U$ and $V$ are open subsets of $X$ obviously, that's okay with me, too. What I don't get is: Why ""hence"" - isn't that pure definition? Or is it more like ""so the only possible/useful/... definition of the $\text{Hom}$-sets is: [...]""? So, if $U \subset V$, we have one morphism $pt:U\to V$. I feel like everybody knows which morphism this is, but I don't see it. What does $pt$ do? Is this the identity-morphism, namely $pt(u)=u ~~\forall u\in U$ (which would include $U$ in $V$ if $U\subset V$, which would make sense somehow)? If my guess is wrong, then we must at least have some kind of unique morphism, which we can always find if $U\subset V$. But how do we get that one (or its existence)? (I somehow feel like this has got something to do with fhyve 's argument about isomorphisms mentioned in the question linked above. I think I understood why we have isomorphisms in that situation, but I don't see a connection to why $Op_X$ is a category or to why/how we have that $pt$-morphism. Also another user states that $pt$ is the inclusion map. Is that correct and is the inclusion map the same as what I guessed a few lines above?) I am new to M.SE and also relatively new to category theory, so please be kind. (: I hope my English is okay. (I'm not sure if I should have posted this question directly to Brian's question - as I would have at a standard online board - but regarding this link from the meta, I guess this is the right way.)

I've already done that latter part, I just need a way to explain why I have to do it, why it's necessary in the first place to change $2\cos^2 x +\sin x-1$ in order to factor it. I'm sorry for being unclear. EDIT 2: To clear up some confusion, here's what the assignment asks for: Given the equation $2 \cos^2⁡x+\sin⁡x-1=0$, Explain why this equation cannot be factored. Use a trigonometric identity to change the equation into one that
can be factored. Factor the equation. Determine all solutions in the interval 0≤x≤2π. I've had no problems with steps 2, 3 and 4, so I did those first. However, I'm not sure how to word the answer to 1 right, because I can't think of anything else than ""it just doesn't work"".","['trigonometry', 'algebra-precalculus']"

Suppose we take the projective variety defined by the equation $C: X^2+Y^2-Z^2$, Then if $P \in C$ is a point on this curve, then $\mathbb{C}[C]_P$ is a discrete valuation ring. Thus, we should be able to exhibit a uniformizer. If we scale $Z$ to $1$ for the moment, we can think of this as a circle of radius $1$. A line through the point $(0, \frac{1}{2})$ will intersect the circle at exactly one other point (except when it is horizontal and intersects $(0, \frac{1}{2})$ with multiplicity $2$). Thus, if we let $t$ be the slope of such a line, we can parametrize any point on the curve as $(\frac{2t}{1+t^2}, \frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}, 1)$ and scaling back, $(2t, 1-t^2, 1+t^2)$. We see that this satisfies $C$ for all complex $t$. Now, I would like to say that for a given point, something like $(1+t^2)X-(2t)Z$ should be a uniformizer but I don't know of a good way to tell if this is true or how to prove it.","['valuation-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves', 'abstract-algebra']"

That is; $$|f(z)|\leq \max\{M(r), M(1)\}$$ where $M(x)=sup_{|z|=x}|f(z)|$. Since $f(z)=0$ for all $|z|=1$, then  $|f(z)|\leq \max\{M(r), 0\}$.

The ""$\text{count}$"" is $16$, so that is $f(1350)$.  That's how long the sequence had to be to get all $11$ of the ""small"" primes, i.e. primes no bigger than $\sqrt{1350}$. A reason to care about this is that if one wants to factor an integer in this range, one looks at its distances from each of those first $11$ primes to decide whether it's divisible by any of them, and if not, then it's prime. So one need not search beyond that sequence. I lean toward taking $f(1)$, $f(2)$, and $f(3)$ to be $0$ since no prime numbers are $\le$ the square roots of those numbers.  But that would require a slight rephrasing of the definition of $f$, and I'm not immediately sure how best to do that. So here's my question: Is this a known function?  Does it have a standard name?

Here's one way to formulate the question more precisely: What is a simple formula $f_k(x)$ such that the number of prime $k$-sums less than $x$ is $\sim f_k(x)$? Here's some handwaving. The number of primes less than $x$ is $\pi(x)\sim\frac{x}{\ln x}$, so the number of $k$-sums less than $x$ is
$$n_k(x)\sim\pi(x/k)\sim\frac{x/k}{\ln(x/k)}=\frac{x}{k\ln x - k\ln k}\sim\frac{x}{k\ln x}.$$ If the primes and $k$-sums are totally uncorrelated (?), then the number of prime $k$-sums should be something like
$$\pi_k(x)\sim\frac{\pi(x)n_k(x)}{x}\sim\frac{x}{k(\ln x)^2}?$$ But that's not right, because all $k$-sums (except the first) have the same parity as $k$. So for $k$ even, $\pi_k(x)\sim 0$, whereas for $k$ odd, we should multiply the above guess by 2:
$$\pi_k(x)\sim\frac{2x}{k(\ln x)^2}?$$ There are just naive heuristics, and I don't know how to go further. Do you? Bonus questions: Roughly how large is the first prime $k$-sum, as a function of $k$? What are the statistics for primes that are $k$-sums for at least $n$ different values of $k>1$?

619802,Algebraic and Galois Extension is a Splitting Field of some set.,"This is taken from the book Algebra by Thomas W. Hungerford ; Theorem. Let $K$ be an extension of $F$. The following are equivalent: $K$ is algebraic and Galois over $F$ . $K$ is separable over $F$ and $K$ is a splitting field over $F$ of a set $S$ of polynomials in $F[x]$. $K$ is the splitting field over $F$ of a set $T$ of separable polynomials in $F[x]$. Proof. (1)$\implies$(2),(3) Let $u\in K$ and let $f(x)\in F[x]$ be the monic irreducible polynomial of $u$. Let $u=u_1,\ldots,u_r$ be the distinct roots of $f$ in $K$; then $r\leq n=\deg(f)$. If $\tau\in\mathrm{Aut}_F(K)$, then $\tau$ permutes the $u_i$. So the coefficients of the polynomial $g(x) = (x-u_1)(x-u_2)\cdots(x-u_r)$ are fixed by all $\tau\in\mathrm{Aut}_F(K)$, and therefore $g(x)\in F[x]$ (since the extension is Galois, so the fixed field of $\mathrm{Aut}_F(K)$ is $F$). Since $u$ is a root of $g$, then $f(x)|g(x)$. Therefore, $n=\deg(f)\leq \deg(g) = r \leq n$, so $\deg(g)=n$. Thus, $f$ has $n$ distinct roots in $K$, so $u$ is separable over $F$. Now let $\{u_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a basis for $K$ over $F$; for each $i\in I$ let $f_i\in F[x]$ be the monic irreducible of $u_i$. Then $K$ is the splitting field over $F$ of $S=\{f_i\}_{i\in I}$, and each $f_i$ is separable. This establishes (2) and (3). What I don't understand is why $K$ is the splitting field of $S=\{f_i\}_{i\in I}$.
In order to $K$ to be the splitting field of the said set, $K$ needs to be equal to $F(X)$ (according to the definition of the book) where $X = \{v | v$ is a root of $f_i$ and $i \in I\} $ It can be easily seen that $F(X) \subseteq K$.

619832,Show that $GL_n(\mathbb{F})$ is a finite group iff $\mathbb{F}$ has a finite number of elements,"I would like to know if my proof below is correct. Problem Show that $GL_n(\mathbb{F})$ is a finite group iff $\mathbb{F}$ has a finite number of elements. Solution If $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite field and say $\vert \mathbb{F} \vert = m$, then the set of all $n \times n$ matrices, which is a superset of $GL_n(\mathbb{F})$, where the elements comes from $\mathbb{F}$ has cardinality $m^{n^2}$. Hence, $\vert GL_n(\mathbb{F}) \vert < m^{n^2}$ and thereby $GL_n(\mathbb{F})$ is a finite group. If $GL_n(\mathbb{F})$ is a finite group, note that for every non-zero element $a \in \mathbb{F} -\{0\}$, the matrix $aI_{n \times n}\in GL_n(\mathbb{F})$, where $I_{n \times n}$ is the identity matrix with the multiplicative identity along the diagonal. This means $\vert \mathbb{F} \vert \leq GL_n(\mathbb{F}) + 1$ and thereby $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite field. Thanks","['proof-verification', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

I am currently stuck with exercise 1.3.1. It is about the equation $x'' + \epsilon x^2 x' + x = 0$, with $\epsilon > 0$, which has the particularity that when linearized the eigenvalues have null real part, so we cannot apply the theorem that says there is an homeomorphism between flows. The exercise asks to prove via a Lyapunov function that the point $x=0, x'=0$ is assimptotically stable. My first guess was a very simple function $V(x,y) = \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{y^2}{2}$ where $y=x'$, and I got $V'(x,y) = -\epsilon x^2y^2$ which is not enough (the derivative is along the curves) to prove assimptotic stability. Then I tried something along the lines of a previous example in the book, $V(x,y) = \frac{x^2}{2} + \alpha \frac{y^2}{2} + \gamma xy$, but now $V' = xy(\cdots) + \gamma(y^2 - x^2)$ so I cannot get any stability from here.

620117,Ways to partition a sphere?,"first of all, sorry for the lack of terminology/ignorance on the subject, I just joined this website. I need a sphere or sphere-like 3D shape, whose surface is partitioned into another geometric primitive, in some kind of grid. I would prefer these partitions to be hexagons, tiled into each other. The bigger the sphere surface is, the more hexagons are supposed to be present. After some research, I found the truncated icosahedron, which looks quite similar to what I want, except it has some pentagons in there, which kills the premise I need to satisfy: If i have an object in any given partition, I need to be able to travel that object all around the sphere, always passing through the center of the next partition, and it has to arrive the initial location in a straight line. The traveling direction is arbitrary but always is the middle of one of the edges of the geometric shape of the partition. I need to be able, in a visualization sense, to have a whole line of the elementary geometric shapes be moved at once, as if it was a huge circular rubik puzzle.
