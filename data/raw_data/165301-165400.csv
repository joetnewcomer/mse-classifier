  from a friend. I found an answer in terms of the digamma function, but he told me that the answer is obtainable without imaginary numbers. I am completely dumbfounded on how he got the answer.

2875252,Translating and inflating a set of $k$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb F_p^n$ to form a cover by affine hyperplanes?,"Fix a prime number $p$ and consider the affine space $V = \mathbb F_p^n$. Let $k < n/2$. Consider subspaces $V_1, \ldots, V_n \subseteq V$ of dimension $k$, and take $v_i \notin V_i$. Do there always exist subspaces $W_i \supseteq V_i$ of codimension $1$ and $t_1, \ldots, t_n \in V$ such that $v_i \notin W_i$ and
$$t_1 + W_1, \ldots, t_n + W_n$$
is a cover of $V$ by affine hyperplanes? Is this true for at least some $n$? Note that: Comparing cardinalities, one needs $n \geq p$. It suffices to do the case where $k = \lfloor \frac{n-1}2 \rfloor$ is the largest integer strictly less than $n/2$ (we can always replace the $V_i$ by larger subspaces) I'm especially interested if there exists an even $n > p$ for which this is true. Also, I don't mind assuming that $p$ belongs to some infinite set. Motivation: If it is true for some even $n$, this would imply that the answer to this question is 'yes': Hat 'trick': Can one of them guess right?","['finite-fields', 'finite-geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'combinatorics', 'affine-geometry']"

2875364,The etale locale of a sheaf?,"It's well-known that sheaves over a topological space are equivalent to etale spaces over the same space. Now if we replace ""topological space"" by ""locale"", we can still define sheaves over a locale, and we can define etale locales over the same locale (at least it seems to me : the notion of local homeomorphism of locales seems pretty easy to guess). Are they still the same (i.e. equivalent) ? I could (easily) prove that given an etale locale over a given locale $X$ we may form a sheaf over $X$ in the obvious way (the ""sheaf of sections"") but the reverse direction is giving me more imaginative trouble : the construction I know for topological spaces of the etale space of a sheaf is not that easily transportable to locales (the construction I know uses stalks at points of the space, but the point of locales is to avoid points); at least not at first sight. But I believe (hope ?) that there is such a construction and that if I was more comfortable with sheaves on a space I would probably see it; but it turns out I'm wondering about this before being comfortable with them, so I wanted to know: thus there are two questions : Is it true that for a locale $X$, $\mathbf{Sh}(X)\simeq \mathrm{Etale}(X)$ (with obvious notations ) ?
  If it is, how may we construct the etale locale of a given sheaf over $X$ ?","['general-topology', 'locales', 'sheaf-theory']"
2875381,Help with Calculus Optimization Problem!,"We wish to construct a rectangular auditorium with a stage shaped as a semicircle of radius $r$, as shown in the diagram below (white is the stage and green is the seating area). For safety reasons, light strips must be placed on the perimeter of the seating area. If we have $45\pi + 60$ meters of light strips, what should $r$ be so that the seating area is maximized? So I first set the width of the seating area to 2r, and the depth to be x. The perimeter would then be  $2x + 2r + \pi r$ = $45\pi + 60$. The problem asks us to maximize the area, though, so it's $2rx - (\pi r^2)/2$. I can solve the equation in terms of x so that it becomes $x = (45\pi + 60 - r(\pi + 2))/2$.

2875451,Chain Rule for Surface Differentials,"So given three surfaces $S_1,S_2,S_3$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (I am currently doing differential geometry of curves and surfaces, so I am not really familiar with most manifold jargon. I assume the proper terminology would be something to the effect of smooth manifolds embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$) and a chain of smooth maps:
$$
S_1\xrightarrow[]{\phi} S_2 \xrightarrow{\psi}S_3
$$
I would like to prove the chain rule for the differentials of $\phi,\psi$. That is, for a point $p$ in $S_1$, we have:
$$
d(\psi \circ \phi )_p = d\psi_{\phi(p)} \circ d\phi_p
$$
My book's definition of the differential for a function $ \phi: S_1 \to S_2$ is a map $d\phi_p:T_pS_1 \to T_\phi(p)S_2$ and is defined by:
$$
d\phi_p = (\phi \circ \gamma )'(0)
$$ where $\gamma$ is a smooth curve, $\gamma:(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\to S_1$ with the property that $\gamma(0)  = p$. Using this definition, computing the differential of the composition at $p$ comes down to computing:
$$
(\psi \circ \phi \circ \gamma)'(0)
$$
However, here is where I am a bit unsure. Let us define $\beta = \phi \circ \gamma$. Then, we have that $\beta$ is a smooth curve from $\mathbb{R}$ into $S_2$, with $\beta(0) = \phi(p)$. Then, we conclude:
$$
d(\psi \circ \phi )_p 
= (\psi \circ \phi \circ \gamma)'(0) = (\psi \circ \beta)'(0) =  d\psi_{\phi(p)}

2875659,How to prove a specific quotient of polynomial ring is a free module?,"Problem 1.19 in Eisenbud's Commutative Algebra asks the following. Given $R = k[x,y,z,w]$ and $I = (yw - z^2, xw - yz, xz - y^2)$ , show that $R/I$ is free as an $k[x,w]$ -module, and exhibit a basis. It is simple to show that under the desired substitutions any monomial can be reduced to $\{1, y, z\}$ with some $k[x,w]$ monomial scalar. Linear independence is implicitly a kind of converse: we must demonstrate the limits of the substitution rules, often by finding an invariant or canonical form. I've handled problems like this before using the following techniques: Prove that $z$ (or maybe $x, w$ ) is not a zero divisor. This would be a good start, as all monomials are of the form $w^a x^b z^{\{0, 1, 2\}}$ . Apply some kind of counting trick on the grading of the ring (since the ideal is homogeneous, the $R$ grading does descend). For example, if the parity of the total degree in $y$ and $z$ were preserved by the relations, then that could be used to show $y$ and $y^2$ are distinct, for example. I tried a number of such tricks, but there doesn't seem to be any obvious ""invariant"" of the substitutions like degree, or difference of degrees, etc. Can we reduce to the case of showing linear independence of the form $m_1 + m_2y + m_3 z = 0$ with $m_i$ monomials with scalar 1? This is true of pairwise linear independence, as the elements would have to cancel pairwise in each degree, so the general case of pairwise linear independence reduces to comparing two monomials. While the problem does not seem to be looking for it, there may well be a sophisticated argument using dimensionality arguments or something else algebraic-geometric. The problem is trying to conclude the ideal is prime, so a geometric argument could show the corresponding projective variety to be irreducible. Does one of the above techniques work? Is there an elementary proof of this fact? A high-tech slick proof?","['free-modules', 'algebraic-geometry', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'commutative-algebra']"
2875682,Construct an analytic function which has simple zeros at all $m+in$,"I found a ""duplicate"" question: Entire function having zeros at $m+in$ , and I went through some wiki pages of Weierstrass sigma function, but they don't seem to have constructions.

Since the ""evidence"" is now an interval rather than a point realization, how to compute the posterior mean $E[\mu|\mathbf{1}\{s_1\ge t\}]$? Is the posterior distribution even normal? I am at a loss here. Any help or references to help would be greatly appreciated. Edit : I computed the posterior distribution numerically. See the plot below (where the ""signal"" indicates the realization is above a threshold). The posterior density is clearly not symmetric, hence not normal. So the question remains: Is there a closed form expression for the posterior density, or a somewhat simple expression for the posterior mean?","['statistics', 'conditional-expectation', 'bayesian', 'normal-distribution', 'probability']"

Two players A and B start to take out $1$ ball at a time from the box one after another without replacing the ball till the game is over.

$$\Rightarrow 36 \cdot 4 + 18 + 6 = 168$$ But my books says that the answer should be $96$ which is grossly different from my answer. Where have I faltered in the whole approach?","['permutations', 'combinations', 'combinatorics']"

Each $T_j$ is a ""tube of radius $R>0$ "" (independent of $j$ ). That is, for every $T_j$ there is $x_j \in \mathbb{R}^3$ (the tube center) and $v_j \in \mathbb{R}^3$ with $\|v_j\|=1$ (the tube direction) so that $$T_j=\{y\in \mathbb{R}^3|\, \|y-x_j\|^2<|v_j\cdot(y-x_j)|^2+R^2\}$$ Q1 : Does there exist a mikado configuration $m$ where the tube directions $v_j$ are distributed randomly(*) and the tube density is the same everywhere(**)? Q2 : Does there exist a mikado configuration $m$ where the tube density is the same everywhere and the tube directions are locally distributed randomly(***)? (*) With ""the direction vectors being distributed randomly"", one could first demand that the empirical measure $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \delta_{v_j}$ converges weakly to the uniform measure on the unit sphere $S^1 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ (for the induced topology from the Euclidean topology in $\mathbb{R}^3$ ) (**) With ""the tube density being the same everywhere"", one could intend that the fraction $\frac{\text{Vol}\left((\cup_{j}T_j)\bigcap B(x,r)\right)}{\text{Vol }B(x,r)}$ converges to an $x$ -independent constant $c\in (0,1)$ as $r \to \infty$ .

About my own efforts to solve this problem: I thought about using a variant of Olbers paradox to negatively answer those questions. The reasoning is that if we place ourselves in the middle of one of the tubes of one of those supposedly-existing configurations and we look around us, we would see a sky filled with tubes everywhere. If we remove the tube from where we're looking, that situation doesn't change. If we then want to reinsert that tube, we fail because our tube hits other tubes in every angle of the sky.

to be true (where $u$ is the error term). Here is how I have tried to reason through it, although I am not sure if this is a good reasoning on why. Let's say $u$ is somehow correlated with some variable $y$, which $x$ is also correlated with. In this case, 
$$E(u\mid x) \not= E(u) $$
since for greater $x$ values the expectation of the error would go up or down since it is correlated with $x$ through the $y$ variable. With this being the case, the line of best fit would end up with greater or lesser expected errors as $x$ increases and decreases. Is this what the zero conditional mean assumption is trying to say, or is there a better reasoning that I'm not hitting on? Thank you!","['regression', 'statistics', 'conditional-expectation', 'economics']"

$$=\frac{\pi^2}{8}-\int_0^1 \frac{\arcsin^2 x}{(1+x^2)^{3/2}}dx$$  We can expand into power series the integral, we have: $\arcsin^2z=\sum\limits_{n\geq1}\frac {2^{2n-1}z^{2n}}{n^2\binom {2n}n}$ and using  the  binomial series for $(1+x^2)^{-3/2}$ will result in: $$\sum_{n\geq1}\frac{2^{2n-1}x^{2n}}{n^2\binom {2n}n}\sum_{k\ge 0}\binom{-3/2}{k}x^{2k}$$ But I dont know how to simplify this. I tried one more thing, letting $\sin x= \sin^2 t$ gives: 
$$I=2\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{x\sin x}{\sqrt{1+\sin^2 x}}dx$$ Since $\int \frac{\sin x}{\sqrt{1+\sin^2x}}dx=-\arcsin\left(\frac{\cos x}{\sqrt 2} \right)+C$  we can integrate by parts to obtain: $$I=2\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\arcsin\left(\frac{\cos x}{\sqrt 2}\right)dx=2\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\arcsin\left(\frac{\sin x}{\sqrt 2}\right)dx$$ But  I am stuck, so I would appreciate some help. Edit: By letting $\frac{\sin x}{\sqrt 2} =t $ We get: $$I=2\int_0^\frac1{\sqrt{2}} \frac{\arcsin x}{\sqrt{\frac12-x^2}}dx=2\text{Li}_2\left(\frac1{\sqrt 2}\right)-\frac{\pi^2}{24}+\frac{\ln^2 2}{4}$$ Where the latter integral was evaluated with wolfram.

Since $[-M, M]$ is compact and $f$ is continuous, there is $K > 0$such that $|f(x)| \leq K$ with $x \in [-M,M].$ So $|f_n(x)| \leq |f(x)| \leq K+1$ for all $n, x.$ That is, $\{f_n\}$ is bounded under the infinity norm $||\cdot||_\infty.$ So $F = \{f_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a bounded and equicontinuous family of function.

\text{backward:           }&\Delta_B U=\frac{U(x)-U(x-h)}{h}\tag 2\\
\text{centered:           }&\Delta_C U=\frac{U(x+h)-U(x-h)}{2h}\\

However, there is a bit of a leap in the explanation of second derivatives: $$\frac{d^2U}{dx^2}\approx\frac{-U_{i+1}+2U_i-U_{i-1}}{(\Delta x)^2}\\$$ The numerator seems to arise from the substraction of the numerators of Eq. 2 from Eq.1 with a change of sign. But it is not clear why this works. It does look like taking two adjacent approximations to the first derivative side-by-side, as opposed to the difference of a difference, or a multiplication of $\Delta_F\Delta_B.$ The squared delta in the denominator will presumably follow from the answer to the problem with the numerator.

2876869,Two Dirac delta functions in an integral?,"For context, this is from a quantum mechanics lecture in which we were considering continuous eigenvalues of the position operator.
Starting with the position eigenvalue equation,
$$\hat{x}\,\phi(x_m, x)=x_m\phi(x_m,x)$$
where $x_m$ is the eigenvalue and $\phi(x_m, x)$ are the continuous eigenfunctions of the position operator $\hat x$. 
The professor wrote that $\phi(x_m, x)=\delta(x-x_m)$ and stated that this is because the eigenbasis is continuous.
But then he wrote the following
$$\begin{align}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\phi^*(x_m,x)\phi({x_m}',x)\,dx &=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(x_m-x)\delta({x_m}'-x)\,dx \tag{1}\\ &=\color{red}{\delta(x_m-{x_m}')}\end{align}$$ I don't understand how the expression in $(1)$ can be equal to the expression in red.

since the integral 'sifts' out the only value of $x$ where the argument of the Dirac delta function is zero (at $x_m$). I have applied this sifting property for one Dirac delta function (as in $(2)$). But I don't understand how this works when there are two Dirac deltas in the integrand, $(1)$. By my logic, I think it should sift out each value, one at a time, so I think that $(1)$ should be 
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(x_m-x)\delta({x_m}'-x)\,dx =\delta(x_m)+\delta({x_m}')$$
where the results of the integration are added, since the values $x_m$ and ${x_m}'$ are sifted out one after the other , depending on which of $x_m$ and ${x_m}'$ are larger (here I assumed ${x_m}'\gt x_m$).

Thus, the atlas consisting of these two charts is smooth. I have struggled to prove that these two charts form a maximal smooth atlas on $\mathbb{S}^n$. After some frustration, I checked this site and found that this smooth atlas is not actually maximal, according to the following post: How to show this atlas is maximal on the sphere $S^n$?

The solution to the above problem is to let $\zeta = e^{\frac{2i\pi}{n}}$ and let $x_j$ be the number of subsets of $A$ such that $|X| = p$ and $m(X) \equiv j \mod p$ ($m(X)$ denotes $\sum_{i \in X} x$).

f^i(t,x) = -b_i(t) + \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ji}(t) x^j, \qquad 1 \leq i \leq n.
$$
Clearly $f$ is continuously differentiable. The $n \times n$ matrix $M(t,x) = \left(D_{1+j} f^i(t,x)\right)$ equals $\left(a_{ji}(t)\right)$. So, if $t_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $f(t_0,x_0) = 0$, then
$$
\det M(t_0,x_0) = \det \left(D_{1+j}f^i(t_0,x_0) \right) = \det \left(a_{ji}(t_0) \right) \neq 0.
$$
Therefore, by the implicit function theorem, there exists a function $g : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $f(t,g(t)) = 0$ for all $t \in (t_0 - \epsilon, t_0 + \epsilon)$, for some $\epsilon > 0$. But, this means that $g^1(t),\dots,g^n(t)$ is a solution to the system of equations
$$
\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ji}(t) s_j(t) = b_i(t), \qquad i = 1,\dots,n.
$$
Since the solution is unique for every $t \in (t_0 - \epsilon, t_0 + \epsilon)$, $g^i(t) = s_i(t)$ in this interval. But since $t_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ is arbitrary, we have that $f(t,s_1(t),\dots,s_n(t)) = 0$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $s : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be defined by $s(t) = (s_1(t),\dots,s_n(t))$. By the implicit function theorem, $s$ is differentiable, and so the $s_i$ are differentiable. To calculate ${s_i}'(t)$, we will take the derivative on both sides of the expression $f^i(t,s(t)) = 0$, for each $1 \leq i \leq n$. This gives us
$$
0 = D_1 f^i(t,s(t)) + \sum_{k = 1}^n D_{1+k} f^i(t,s(t)) \cdot D_1 s_k(t), \qquad 1 \leq i \leq n.
$$
This is precisely the system of equations given by
$$
M(t,s(t)) \cdot s'(t) = B(t),
$$
where $B(t)$ is an $n \times 1$ matrix with the entry in the $i$th row equal to
$$
{b_i}'(t) - \sum_{j=1}^n {a_{ji}}'(t)s_j(t).
$$
Since $M(t,s(t)) = \left( a_{ji}(t) \right)$ and $\det \left( a_{ji}(t) \right) \neq 0$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, $M(t,s(t))$ is invertible. So,
$$
s'(t) = \left( a_{ji}(t) \right)^{-1} B(t). \tag*{$\blacksquare$}
$$ Is the final expression the best one can do using the implicit function theorem? I haven't found the precise expression for each ${s_i}'(t)$ through this method. It feels like I was able to arrive at a more concrete result without using the implicit function theorem as in my previous attempt . Again, any comments or suggestions are appreciated.","['alternative-proof', 'multivariable-calculus', 'proof-verification', 'implicit-function-theorem']"
2877325,Area under a curve of an odd function from negative infinity to positive infinity,"In integration, there is a property that says: If you're integrating from -a to a some odd function f(x), then the area under the curve between -a and a is zero. I was listening to this in class , and then I thought about integrating some odd function, like x^3, from negative infinity to positive infinity. But, if you integrate x^3 and then solve it from negative infinity to positive infinity, wouldn't you end up subtracting infinity from infinity, which is undefined? Given this, which answer is the correct one: is the area 0 or is it undefined?","['integration', 'even-and-odd-functions', 'improper-integrals']"
2877329,Practical physical processes for various random distributions?,"You can draw from the Cauchy distribution by attaching a stick to a spindle somewhere on the y-axis, spinning it, and reading off the x-intercept as your drawn value. Where you place the spindle on the y-axis parameterizes the distribution. Are there (practical) physical processes for other distributions? Especially ones that could actually generate all possible values? Throwing darts at a dart board, for instance, is a poor process for the normal distribution since there’s a bound on how far you’ll ever get from the center. For the Geometric distribution you can roll a die until you get a 1, say, though this requires an appropriate die for each value of the single parameter, so it’s not as ideal as the Cauchy case. EDIT: In particular I'm thinking of processes that give you some physical intuition for the distribution. Sure you can convert a randomly drawn number from one distribution into a draw from another distribution, but that doesn't give you any intuition for the second distribution.","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

Show that $X\cdot (\nabla \times X)=0$ at all points $f(x)$. My thoughts: any vector field on $R^3$ can be written as $a(p,q,r)\partial_p+b(p,q,r)\partial q+c(p,q,r)\partial _r$ where $p,q,r$ are coordinates in $R^3$. So $$\nabla\times X=(\partial_qc\partial_r-\partial_rb\partial_q,\partial_ra\partial_p-\partial_pc\partial_r,\partial_pb\partial_q-\partial_qa\partial_p)$$ and $$X\cdot (\nabla \times X)=a\partial_p\partial_qc\partial_r-a\partial_p\partial_rb\partial_q+b\partial_q\partial_ra\partial_p-b\partial_q\partial_pc\partial_r+c\partial_r\partial_pb\partial_q-c\partial_r\partial_qa\partial _p$$

What is the expected value of the Manhattan distance, $m$, between the two points, $E[m|d]$? For context: I originally thought it was just a simple application of the Pythagorean theorem. But knowing that $a^2+b^2=c^2$ doesn't allow me to recover $a+b$ as a function of $c$, right? That function depends on factors other than the side lengths, and it's not immediately obvious to me as to how to proceed. For further context, I have haversine distances between pairs of points.

Apart from that, I' m not sure on how to proceed.

. Suppose W is $n \times m$ matrix and $x$ is m-dimensional vector. ============================================================= ============================================================= While in the picture below from Wikipedia , we have $\frac{\partial(AX)}{\partial x} = A^T$(since we take derivative with respect to column vector, I assume the denominator layout is the equivalent format. ) ================================================================ ================================================================ Q1. I don't understand why in the note it shows $W$ instead of $W^T$. Can anyone help explaining this please? Next, In the last part of note , the author added : We see that the dimensions of all the terms in the gradient match up (i.e., the
    number of columns in a term equals the number of rows in the next term). This will always be the case if we computed our gradients correctly.
    Now we can use the error terms to compute our gradients. Note that we transpose out answers when computing the gradients for column vectors terms to follow the shape convention. You can see the picture below for further details. ============================================================= ============================================================= Q2- If we always take the derivative with respect to column vector, why do we need to transpose the result? Rather than matching dimension as a way of verification how can I understand from the beginning when I need to transpose the result when calculating the derivative using the chain rule?

I write $X_{k:n}$ the $k$-th order statistic out of a sample of size $n$. I am trying to prove that for all $d > 0$:
$$
S_n = \frac{1}{n^d} \sum_{k=1}^n (X_{k:n} - Y_{k:n})^2 \underset{n \rightarrow +\infty}{\overset{\mathbb{P}}{\to}} 0
$$
which seems to me to be true, at least under reasonable regularity assumptions. I know this is true for samples $(U_1, \dots, U_n)$ and $(V_1, \dots, V_n)$ that follow a uniform distribution over $[0,1]$. Indeed, I calculated that:
$$
\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{k=1}^n (U_{k:n} - V_{k:n})^2\right] = \frac{n}{3(n+1)}
$$
and
$$
\text{Var}\left[\sum_{k=1}^n (U_{k:n} - V_{k:n})^2\right] = \frac{n \left(4 n^2+44 n+45\right)}{45 (n+1)^2 (n+2)}
$$
(The proofs simply involve calculating the relevant integrals using the explicit formula for the distribution of $U_{k:n}$ and $V_{k:n}$.) Then I apply Chebyshev's inequality. Letting $\varepsilon > 0$:
\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}\{|S_n|>\varepsilon\} &\leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[S_n^2]}{\varepsilon^2} \\
&\leq \frac{\text{Var}[n^dS_n]+\mathbb{E}[(n^dS_n)^2]}{n^{2d}\varepsilon^2}\\
&\leq \frac{1}{n^{2d}\varepsilon} \frac{n (n+5)}{5 (n+1) (n+2)}\\
&\overset{\mathbb{P}}{\to} 0
\end{align} I ran simulations and they suggest that the result holds for other distributions, including distributions with infinite support (although finite variance seems required). I thought I could move from uniform to the general case by assuming a smooth quantile function $Q$ for $X$ and $Y$ and using the fact that $X=Q(U)$ and $Y=Q(V)$. After doing a Taylor expansion (with Lagrange remainder) of $X_{k:n}=Q(U_{k:n})$ and $Y_{k:n}=Q(V_{k:n})$ around $p_k = k/(n+1)$, I get that
$$
(X_{k:n} - Y_{k:n})^2$$ is equal to $$\left[Q'(p_k)(U_{k:n}-V_{k:n}) + \frac{1}{2}Q''(p_k^U)(U_{k:n}-p_k)^2 + \frac{1}{2}Q''(p_k^V)(V_{k:n}-p_k)^2\right]^2
$$
where $p_k^U$ (resp. $p_k^V$) is between $p_k$ and $U_{k:n}$ (resp. $V_{k:n}$). But I see no good way of dealing with the remainder, or with the coefficient $Q'(p_k)^2$ which can go to infinity if the distribution has an unbounded support. This is especially problematic given that the term must be bounded uniformly in order to get the sum.
