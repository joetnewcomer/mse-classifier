2300228,Square-root for nonnegative (and not necessarily self-adjoint) operators,"Let $H$ be a $\mathbb R$-Hilbert space and $A$ be a bounded linear operator on $H$. If $A$ is nonnegative and self-adjoint, then there is a unique nonnegative and self-adjoint bounded linear operator $B$ on $H$ with $B^2=A$. This can be proved by an elementary version of the spectral theorem. Now, suppose that $A$ is only nonnegative (and not necessarily self-adjoint). I've read that we can still find a unique nonnegative bounded linear operator $B$ on $H$ with $B^2=A$. How can we prove this statement? My knowledge in operator theory is rather limited. So, I hope we can provide an elementary proof.","['functional-analysis', 'operator-theory']"
2300268,Connections between finite and Lie groups in Fulton and Harris,"In Representation Theory: A First Course by William Fulton and Joe Harris, the following appears on the first page about Lie Groups From a naive point of view, Lie groups seem to stand at the opposite end of the spectrum of groups from finite $\text{ones}^1$ with the superscript referencing the following note $^1$ In spite of this, there are deep, if only partially understood, relations between finite and Lie groups, extending even to their simple group classifications. Would someone shed a little more light on this? Specifically: Why is it naive to think of Lie Groups as being at the opposite end of the spectrum of groups from finite groups? What are the relations between finite and Lie groups that the authors are referencing?

My work: Suppose $A$ is invertible. Then $ABA^{-1}=I+B$ . So $B$ is similar to $I+B$  .Let $B$ have eigenvalues $c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n \in \mathbb{C}$. So $B$ has basis such that $B$ is upper triangular with respect to it and  has $c_1,\ldots,c_n$ as diagonal entries . It is easy to see that $I+B$ is upper-triangular with respect to this basis and has entries $1+c_1,\ldots, 1+c_n$ . Hence $$c_1+c_2+\ldots +c_n=\operatorname{trace}(B)$$ $$=\operatorname{trace}(I+B)=(1+c_1)+\ldots+(1+c_n)=n+c_1+\ldots +c_n .$$ So $n=0$, contradiction. I'm not sure if my solution is correct one.

2300422,unique minimal models and birational automorphisms of algbraic surfaces,"In his book on cubic forms Manin writes that if an algebraic surface has unique minimal
model $X$ then ""it follows easily from definitions"" that the group of
automorphisms of the field $k(X)$ is isomorphic to the group of
biregular automorphisms of $X$. it is ch. III, 18.7.1. (Here is a link to Google books) While an automorphism of the field surely induces a birational map (an isomorphism of dense open subsets) $f$ from $X$ to itself, I fail to see how one can produce a birational morphism (a totally defined morphism that induces a birational map after restriction to a dense open subset)  from $X$ to itself out of it. By closing the graph of $f$
in $X \times X$ one can find a modification of $X$, $\varphi: X'\to X$,
and factor $f$ as a composition of a birational map $X' \to X$ (projection of the closure of the graph of $f$ on the second factor $X$) and the inverse
of a the modification $\varphi$. It is unclear though how this
factorisation helps, and how one can use uniqueness of minimal models

How many distinct energy configurations can the system have? [In statistical mechanics the particles are said to obey Bose-Einstein statistics.] After my ""research"" in many physics websites, I found this: Consider an energy level $\varepsilon_i$ with degeneracy $g_i$, containing $n_i$ bosons. The states may be represented by $g_i-1$ lines, and the bosons by $n_i$ circles; distinguishable microstates correspond to different orderings of the lines and circles. For example, with $9$ particles in the $8$ states corresponding to a particular energy, a particular microstate might be: The number of distinct orderings of lines and circles is:
  $$t_i = \frac{(n_i+g_i-1)!}{n_i!(g_i-1)!}.$$ A particular distribution has a specified number of particle $n_i$ within each of the possible energy levels $\varepsilon_i$. The total number of microstates for a given distribution is therefore:
  $$t(\{n_i\}) = \prod_i \frac{(n_i+g_i-1)!}{n_i!(g_i-1)!}.\tag 8$$ I also found a couple of Bose-Einstein Statistics problems: A combinatorics problem related to Bose-Einstein statistics Indistinguishable particles: obeing ""Bose-Einstein Statistics""","['combinatorics', 'physics', 'statistical-mechanics']"

2300710,Techniques for computing the Brouwer degree of a smooth map,"This question is relative to John Milnor's Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint book, more precisely relative to the problems 13,14 & 15 he is giving at the end of his book. Let $\eta:S^3\to S^2$ be the Hopf fibration, with $S^3\subset\mathbb{C}^2$ and $S^2\subset\mathbb{C}\times\mathbb{R}$. I was able to show easily that for any point $P\in S^2$, $\eta^{-1}(P)$ is homeomorphic to $S^1\subset\mathbb{C}^2$. Furthermore, Milnor suggests that for any two points $P,Q\in S^2$, $P\neq Q$, the circles $\eta^{-1}(P)$ and $\eta^{-1}(Q)$ are linked. From this, we introduce the linking map $\lambda$ which is well defined for disjoints manifolds. Hence, for

  concentric with the rim. The jets are equally spaced on each circle and
  there is at least one radius of the shower head that intersects every circle
  at a jet. The angular separation of two jets on a circle is the size of the angle
  formed by the two radii of the circle that pass through the jets. All angular

2300808,"Show that $j:X \rightarrow X^{**}$ is an injective bounded linear map, where $j$ is the natural embedding.","Let $X$ be a Banach space with bidual $X^{**}$ and let $j:X \rightarrow X^{**}$ be the natural embedding. Question: Show that $j$ is an injective bounded linear map. My attempt: Recall that for all $x \in X, $ we have $j(x)(x^*) = x^*(x)$ for all $x^* \in X^*.$ Suppose that $x , y \in X.$ Note that for all $x^* \in X^*,$ we have 
$$(j(x) + j(y))(x^*) = x^*(x+y) = x^*(x) + x^*(y) = j(x)(x^*) + j(y)(x^*).$$
Hence, $ j(x+y) = j(x) + j(y)$ For any $\alpha \in \mathbb{K},$  we have 
$$j(\alpha x )(x^*) = x^*(\alpha x) = \alpha x^*(x) = \alpha j(x).$$
Therefore, $j(\alpha x ) = \alpha j(x).$ Hence, $j$ is linear. Suppose that $x, y \in X$ such that $j(x) = j(y).$
For any $x^* \in X^*,$ we have $j(x)(x^*) = x^*(x) = x^*(y) = j(y)(x^*).$
Since $x^*$ is linear, we have $x^*(x-y) = 0$, which implies that $x- y =0.$
Hence, $x = y.$
Therefore, $j$ is injective. For all $x \in X,$ note that 
$$\| j(x) \| = \sup_{\| x^* \| \leq 1 } |j(x)(x^*)| = \sup_{\| x^* \| \leq 1} |x^*(x)| = \| x \|.$$
Therefore, 
$$\| j \| = \sup_{\| x \| \leq 1} \| j(x) \| \leq 1.$$
Hence, $j$ is bounded. Is my proof correct?","['functional-analysis', 'proof-verification', 'dual-spaces']"

Then we place the $2n-1$ tiles in the same row and in the same column as that first tile.  There are $2$ ways  to place each of these, since they will each share one side with an already-placed square when they are laid down.

$$|ma-\sqrt{p_n}|<\varepsilon_n$$
where $p_n$ is the nth prime number. I have a proof of this fact produced below, but it comes as an edge case of a lemma based on Baire's theorem. Is there a more direct approach which uses number theory or combinatorics? Lemma: Let $f\colon \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ be a continuous function such that for all $a>0$ we have $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} f(na)=0$. Then $\lim\limits_{x\to \infty} f(x)=0$. We prove this as follows: Choose any $\varepsilon>0$ and set $$E_n = \{x\colon |f(mx)|\leq \varepsilon \text{ for all }m\geq n\}=\bigcap\limits_{m\in \mathbb N} \{x\colon mx\in f^{-1}([-\varepsilon,\varepsilon])\}.$$ Each of these sets will be closed by the continuity of $f$, and by the definition of our function we have that $\mathbb R_+ = \bigcup\limits_{n\in \mathbb N} E_n$, so that by Baire's theorem at least $E_n$ has nonempty interior. Thus we have an interval $I=[a,b]$, and some positive integer $n_0$ such that for all $n>n_0$, $f(nI)\subset [-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]$. We also have that if $n$ is big enough that $na<(n-1)b$ so that integer multiples of this interval will eventually cover the tail of the $\mathbb R_+$. All $x$ large enough will then be in a large integer multiple of $I$, and so we have $f(x)\in[-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]$. QED Now to prove the statement in the question, take $f$ to be $1$ at the square root of prime numbers, $0$ on $\mathbb R_+ \setminus \bigcup (\sqrt{p_n}-\varepsilon_n,\sqrt{p_n}+\varepsilon_n)$ and linear elsewhere. This function does not go to $0$ as $x\to \infty$ so we must have the existence of at least one point $a$ such that $$\lim_{m\to \infty}f(ma)\not\to 0.$$ It follows that $ma$ must wind up in infinitely many of the peaks centered about $\sqrt{p_n}$.","['number-theory', 'combinatorics', 'real-analysis']"

A friend of mine and me were discussing whether completeness is a necessary assumption, but couldn't come up with a counterexample. We tried the restricted doubling map to the rationals mod $1$, but finding the obstruction seems rather hard, as the Baire Category Theorem is non-constructive. Does anyone know a counterexample?

2301738,Simple calculation in imprecise probability urn example,"In Miranda and de Cooman's chapter 3, ""Structural judgements"" , in Augustin et al.'s Introduction to Imprecise Probability , example 3.4 on p. 65 shows that independence in the selection (type-2 independence) does not imply strong independence (type-3 independence) for lower previsions.  One of the numerical values in the example seems incorrect to me.  I'm not sure whether there is a typo (there is an obvious trivial typo at the top of the same page, so this seems possible), or whether I don't fully understand the example (quite plausible). There are two possible configurations, or compositions, for a pair of urns containing red ( $R$ ) and green ( $G$ ) balls, but we don't know which configuration is actual.  Given a configuration, draws from each urn are random, i.e. independent. Configuration 1:    Urn 1: $\{R, R, G\}$ Urn 2: $\{R,R,G\}$ Configuration 2:    Urn 1: $\{R, G, G\}$ Urn 2: $\{R,G,G\}$ Let $X_k$ be the r.v. representing the outcome of the draw from the $k$ th urn.  The text claims that given this setup, the lower prevision $\underline P$ of $X_1=R$ & $X_2=G$ is \begin{equation}
\underline P(X_1 = R, X_2=G) = \frac{4}{9} .
\end{equation} It seems to me that this value should be 2/9.  Since the draws are independent within each configuration, the probability (linear prevision) corresponding to configuration 1 is \begin{equation}
P(X_1 = R, X_2=G) = P(X_1=R) \times P(X_2=G) = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{9} .
\end{equation} Similarly, the probability corresponding to configuration 2 is \begin{equation}
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{9} .
\end{equation} Since the lower prevision is the lower envelope of the probabilities in this example, it seems to follow that $\underline P(X_1 = R, X_2=G) = 2/9$ .  However, I suspect that I've interpreted the example incorrectly in some respect or have some more basic misunderstanding. (I believe that if 2/9 were the correct value here, the example would still illustrate the point that independence in the selection doesn't imply strong independence.  For that point all that's needed is that $\underline P(X_1 = R, X_2=G) > 1/9$ .)","['bayesian', 'probability', 'imprecise-probability']"

where $\mathbb G $ denotes some Gaussian random variabel (with known covariance structure) and $\ell^\infty$ is the space of bounded real-valued functions ( why actually not only continuous-bounded as usual? ) equipped with the sup-norm. Convergence in Law for $X_n\overset{\mathcal L}\longrightarrow X$ means here in this setting
$$
\forall f\in \ell^\infty:\lim_{n\to\infty}Ef(X_n)=Ef(X)

$$
\forall f\in \ell^\infty:\lim_{n\to\infty}Ef\left(\sqrt n(\hat{N}_n(t)-N(t))\right)=Ef\left(\mathbb G \right)

\forall c:\lim_{n\to\infty}P\{\left(\sqrt n(\hat{N}_n(t)-N(t))\right)\leq c\}=P\{\mathbb G \leq c\}
$$ Now we are interested in $(\hat{N}_n(t)-N(t))$, so
$$
\forall c:\lim_{n\to\infty}P\{\left(\hat{N}_n(t)-N(t))\right)\leq c\}=\lim_{n\to\infty} P\{\left( \sqrt n(\hat{N}_n(t)-N(t))\right) \leq \sqrt n c\}

which is for $c>0$ equal to $1$ and for $c<0$ equal to $0$. For $c=0$ we don't have a continuous point of $F$. So we have the distribution function of random variable a.s. equal to $0$ (Dirac distribution). Since $(\hat{N}_n(t)-N(t))\to 0 $ in distribution we have even $(\hat{N}_n(t)-N(t)) \overset{\text{a.s.}} \longrightarrow 0 $. EDIT : As pointed out by Did in the comments, the convergence  of
$(\hat{N}_n(t)-N(t)) \longrightarrow 0$ is actually in probability. The implication is: Convergence in distribution against a constant implies convergence against this constant in probability.

2301901,Holonomic basis and commutativity,"I am trying to better understand the concept of connection in diff. geometry by defining different vectors fields and working with them. For example, if I take the usual coordinates $x$ and $y$ coordinates on the plane, I have the vector fields $\partial_x$ and $\partial_y$. Now if I replace the coordinate $y$ by $z=y+x^2$, then I should replace $\partial_y$ with $\partial_z=\partial_y+2x\partial_x$. On the one hand, I think the pair $\{\partial_x,\partial_z\}$ can still be used as a basis for the tangent space at every point and this basis is holonomic, i.e. the elements are derivatives with respect to coordinates. On the other hand, holonomic basis are supposed to be commutative, but I get $[\partial_x,\partial_z]\neq 0$. Can someone clarify this, please?",['differential-geometry']

2301984,Is it mandatory to specify integration variables before taking the integral?,"This very simple question was asked of me recently and I was unable to give a convincing answer. For example, if you were simply told to 'integrate $2x$'. Then we would normally write $$\int 2x\,\mathrm{d}x=x^2 + C$$ But where did the $\mathrm{d}x$ come from? In other words should it be 'integrate $2x\,\mathrm{d}x$'? When we integrate $2x$, is the integration variable $\mathrm{d}x$ already specified and is part of the integration operation? Or, do we need to specify it before we carry out the integration? Alternatively, if I wrote instead 'integrate $2x$ with respect to $x$'. Does this guarantee the integration variable $\mathrm{d}x$ is included? I ask this question because there are times in physics and math when we in fact do specify the integration variable before hand. Using differential equations as an example if asked to solve $$x\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=1$$
then in this simple case we would treat the $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}$ as though it is a fraction and separate the variables such that $$\mathrm{d}y=\frac{1}{x}\mathrm{d}x\tag{1}$$ and then put integral signs in front  $$\int\mathrm{d}y=\int\frac{1}{x}\mathrm{d}x\tag{2}$$  $$\implies y=\ln x + k$$ So for $(1)$, placing the integral signs out in front didn't introduce the integration variables like this: $$\int\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}y=\int\frac{1}{x}\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}x\ne (2)$$ I have shown both ways that there is room for confusion.

2302157,"On ""small triangles"" in a square lattice","A ""small triangle"" in a square lattice is defined as one whose vertices are non-collinear lattice points, and whose boundary and interior contain no other lattice points. I recently came across the following: Claim: the area of any ""small triangle"" is 1/2 the area of the lattice's unit cell. I'm looking for a simple proof of this claim. I see that the claim would hold if the following condition holds: Condition: the shortest side of the smallest ""lattice rectangle"" 1 containing the small triangle has length 1. Then the claim follows from the elementary formula $\frac{1}{2} b h$ for the area of a triangle, since the condition implies that $b = h = 1$. This condition, however, does not hold for all small triangles.  (In fact, the triangle defined by lattice points $(0, 0), (1, 2),$ and $(2, 3)$ is small, and the smallest lattice rectangle that contains it has sides with lengths $2$ and $3$.) It is not clear to me that the claim would hold for all small triangles that don't satisfy the condition above. Update One possibility is that the condition above should have been part of the definition of a small triangle, but was omitted by mistake.  After all, the context for the claim was a proof of Pick's theorem, and it seems to me that this proof would have still gone through even if the definition of small triangles included the condition above. IOW, if we define a ""tiny triangle"" as any small triangle that satisfies the condition above, then one could derive a proof of Pick's theorem from the proposition that the polygon in the theorem's premise can always be covered by a set of tiny triangles.  I don't have a proof of this last assertion (anything that I can think of would probably be a tedious slog through a number of cases), but it seems to me very plausible. 1 By ""lattice rectangle"" I mean a rectangle whose corners are lattice points, and whose sides are parallel to the sides of a lattice unit cell.",['geometry']

I have the same doubt with solutions of the following IVP too, $\bullet$ $\;\;y'=y^{1/3}\;\;\; , y(0)=0$ The solution of the above IVP is given by ; $$y(x)=\cases{0 & for $x\le x_0$\cr \pm \left(\frac{2}{3}(x-x_0)\right)^{3/2} & for $x> x_0$}$$ where $x_0 \ge 0$. Can anyone clear this misunderstanding of mine. And also providing a geometrical interpretation of IVP would help a lot.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'initial-value-problems']"

2302429,Number of different counts of $1$s in sliding windows,"Consider a tuple $A = (a_1, \dots, a_{2n-1})$ where $a_i \in  \{0,1\}$.   For each sub-tuple of length $n$ in order from left to right, that is $(a_i, \dots, a_{i+n-1})$ for all $i$, we count the number of $1$s and output the result as a ""counting tuple"".  For example if $n = 3$ and $A= (1,0,1,1,1)$  the resulting counting tuple is  $C_A = (2,2,3)$. Not every different tuple $A$ gives a different counting tuple. For example for $n = 3$, if $A= (1,0,1,1,0)$ we get the counting tuple $C_A = (2,2,2)$ which is the same as we get for $A' = (0,1,1,0,1)$. For a given $n$, what is the total number of distinct counting tuples $C_A$
  taken over all $2^{2n-1}$ possible input tuples $A$? @orlp has found that $3^{n-2}(n+5)$ fits perfectly for $n \leq 13$. Is it possible to prove this is the right formula?  The sequence also occurs at https://oeis.org/A038765 .",['combinatorics']
2302450,For what values of $\alpha > 0$ the equation $p(x) = x^3-9x^2+26x-\alpha =0$ has three positive real roots?,"For what values of $\alpha > 0$ the equation $p(x) = x^3-9x^2+26x-\alpha =0$ has three positive real roots? The options given are as follows : $(A)$ $\alpha \ge 27$ $(B)$ $\alpha > 81$ $(C)$ $27 < \alpha <81$ $(D)$ $54 < \alpha \le 81$ What I have tried is that I first transform the equation to the form $y^3 + 3Hy + G = 0$ and then I have applied the fact that this equation has three positive real roots if $G^2 + 4H^3 < 0$ .Here I found $G = 24 - \alpha$ and $H = -\frac {1} {3}$ and then calculating we get $\alpha \in (24-\frac {2 {\sqrt 3}} {9} , 24 + \frac {2 {\sqrt 3}} {9})$ which is not similar to any of the given options.Please help me in finding the right option. Thank you in advance.","['algebra-precalculus', 'roots', 'polynomials']"
2302506,Show a curve is not a regular surface,"A set $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$ is said to be a regular surface, if for every $p\in S$ there exists an open ball $B_p(r)$ around $p$, an open set $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ and a function $f:A\to\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $f(A) = B_p(r)\cap S$, $f$ is continuously differentiable and $rank(D_f) = 2$. I need to show that a straight line $\gamma(t) = \gamma(0) + tv$ where $v\in\mathbb{R}^3$ is not a regular surface. I don't think the definition has fully sinked in, and this seems really intuitive but I just can't think how to start.","['curves', 'differential-geometry', 'surfaces']"
2302515,Convergence in distribution of $\sqrt n X_n$,"This is a follow-up question from my earlier one - context and motivation can be found there: If we have a sequence of random variables $Z_n:=\sqrt n X_n$ converging in distribution to X (all defined on the same probability space), i.e. for the all continuous points of the distribution Function of $F$ 
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}F_{Z_n}(x\leq c)=F_X(x\leq c)\iff\lim_{n\to\infty}P(Z_n \leq c)=\lim_{n\to\infty}P(\sqrt X_n \leq c)=P(X\leq c)
$$
can we then say actually draw the following conclusion (is this implication even correct) for $c_{+}>0,c_{-}<0$:
$$
P(X_n \leq c_{+})=P(\sqrt nX_n \leq \sqrt n c_{+})\implies\lim_{n\to\infty} P(\sqrt nX_n \leq \sqrt n c_{+})=P(X\leq \infty)=1
$$
and
$$
P(X_n \leq c_{-})=P(\sqrt nX_n \leq \sqrt n c_{-})\implies\lim_{n\to\infty} P(\sqrt nX_n \leq \sqrt n c_{-})=P(X\leq -\infty)=0
$$
I don't see a reason why this shouldn't hold, nevertheless the implication feels somehow not quite right (in the definition of convergence in distribution the right hand side is always fixed, here we let it grow itself). On the other hand, if $\sqrt n X_n$ really converges in some way, $X_n$ would somehow need to compensate the extra growth of $\sqrt n$ and therefore need to go to zero itself in probability. (which would be the implication of the above).
Anyone has a reference or any other insight?","['weak-convergence', 'probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"
2302521,"Premise of Minkowski's theorem: ""Irrational"" Line","If we take a straight line $L$ in $\Bbb{R}^2$ of the form $y=ax$ where $a\in\Bbb{R}\setminus{\Bbb{Q}}.$ Then we see that (except at the origin $(0,0)$) $$L\cap \Bbb{Z}^2=\emptyset.$$ But now if the line becomes a strip of width $r>0$ denoted $S$ how can we be sure that $$S\cap \Bbb{Z}^2\ne\emptyset?$$ I know about Minkowski's theorem but in this particular case is there a high school argument? Perhaps by writing the continued fraction of $a?$","['real-analysis', 'geometry']"
