215206,Why would we expect the pushforward to encode the total derivative of a smooth map?,"According to Lee, the pushforward was invented to give a coordinate independent definition of the total derivative of a smooth function between two smooth manifolds.  To each smooth map $F:M \to N$ and each point $p \in M$ we associate a linear map $F_*:T_pM\to T_{F(p)}N$ defined by $F_*X(f) = X(f \circ F)$ where $X$ is any derivation in $T_pM$ and $f:N \to \mathbb{R}$ is any smooth function.  Given a smooth chart $\phi:M \to \mathbb{R}^m$ near $p$ we have a basis for $T_pM$ given by $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_{p} = ({\phi ^{-1}}_*)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}|_{\phi(p)}$.  Similarly given a smooth chart $\psi$ near $F(p)$ we have a basis for $T_{F(p)}N$ given by $\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}|_{F(p)} = ({\psi ^{-1}}_*)\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}|_{\psi(p)}$.  A calculation in Lee shows that the matrix representation of $F_*$ with respect to these bases is the total derivative of the coordinate representation $\hat{F} = \psi \circ F \circ \phi ^{-1}$ evaluated at $\phi(p)$. My question is, is there some intuitive reason why we would expect this to be true?  This all seems very abstract to me.  I can't tell if it is supposed to be obvious that this definition should be a coordinate independent way of encoding the total derivative of $F$ and I am just missing something, or if it is just difficult to understand.

215235,Reconciling several different definitions of Radon measures,"Upon reviewing some basic real analysis I have encountered two different definitions for Radon measure. Let the underlying space $X$ be locally compact and Hausdorff. Folland's Real Analysis gives the definition A Radon measure is a Borel measure that is finite on all compact sets, outer regular on Borel sets, and inner regular on open sets. Folland goes on to prove that a Radon measure is inner regular on $\sigma$-finite sets, and remarks that full inner regularity is too much to ask for, especially in the context of the Riesz representation theorem for positive linear functionals on $C_c(X)$. Folland's approach seems to match the approach taken by Rudin, if I recall. However, I've heard from others, as well as Wikipedia , that a Radon measure is defined as a Borel measure that is locally finite (which means finite on compact sets for LCH spaces) and inner regular, and no mention of outer regularity. Neither definition seems to connect well with Bourbaki's approach of defining Radon measures as positive linear functionals on $C_c(X)$, because, at least according to Wikipedia's article on the Riesz representation theorem , a positive linear functional on $C_c(X)$ uniquely corresponds to a regular Borel measure, which is stronger than Radon in either of the two definitions given above. Sadly I do not have any more advanced analysis treatises to compare against, so I was hoping somebody could clear up this discrepancy.","['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

215291,Evaluating improper integral $ \int_a^b \frac{dt}{\sqrt{(b-t)(t-a)}} $,"For $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ and $a<b$, I'd like to evaluate the following improper integral
$$
\int_a^b \frac{dt}{\sqrt{(b-t)(t-a)}}
$$
Since I'd like to evaluate the integral rather than just make sure it converges, the comparison test isn't particularly useful. I started by expanding the terms under the radical, and then I attempted to complete the square. This left me with the following
$$
\int_a^b \frac{dt}{\sqrt{\left(t-\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^2+ab}}
$$
In order for completing the square to be useful, I'd need to be able to make $ab-\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^2$ into a square. I'll just sweep everything under the rug and say
$$
ab-\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^2 = c^2 
$$
for some $c\in\mathbb{R}$. Similarly, I'll let
$$
u^2=\left(t-\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^2
$$
Then my resulting integral has the form
$$
\int_a^b \frac{dt}{\sqrt{u^2-c^2}}
$$
I think at this point, I'm supposed to use a trig substitution to finish evaluating the integral. However, because of the substitutions I made above, I'm not really sure how to go about doing the actual substitution. Is there a better way to go about evaluating this integral, or do I just need to continue grinding it out?","['improper-integrals', 'integration']"
215324,Proof for exact differential equations shortcut?,"Today in my math class, we learned about exact differential equations . During class, our teacher first taught us the accepted way to solve exact equations, but then, told us of a shortcut that one of her students had apparently discovered several years ago, where you integrate both components, and ""merge"" the common terms. For example, if I have the following equation: $(x^2 + y^2)dx +  (2xy + \cos{y})dy = 0$, then the shortcut would be the following: $$\begin{align}
\int(x^2 + y^2)dx \;\;\;\;\; & and\;\;\;\;\;\; \int (2xy + \cos{y})dy \\
\frac{1}{3}x^3 + xy^2  \;\;\;\;\; & and\;\;\;\;\;\; xy^2 + \sin{y}
\end{align}$$ Because $xy^2$ is a term common to both expressions, I would ""merge"" the equation into the following to get the final solution: $$\frac{1}{3}x^3 + xy^2 + \sin{y} = c$$ Our teacher then told us that neither her nor the student was able to formally prove why this works, and so cautioned us against relying on this (specifically, she told us we were only allowed to use this method to double-check our work in our upcoming quiz). Given that my teacher had difficulties figuring out how this works, I feel ill-equipped to try and prove how and why this works on my own. Can somebody help me understand or prove (or disprove) the validity of this shortcut?

215377,Character theory of $2$-Frobenius groups.,"Edit Summary : I've posted this on MO and received a partial answer there.  Can anybody help me expand on this? Definition. Let $G$ be a finite group and $F_1=\text{Fit}\,G$ and $F_2/F=\text{Fit}\left(G/F_1\right)$ .  If $F_2$ is a Frobenius group with kernel $F_1$ and $G/F_1$ is a Frobenius group with kernel $F_2/F_1$ , we say that $G$ is $2$ -Frobenius . Easy example of a $2$ -Frobenius group is $S_4$ , where a $2$ -cycle acts fixed point freely on the $3$ -cycles, and the $3$ cycles act fixed point freely on the $4$ -cycles.  In general it's easy to make $2$ -Frobenius groups like this by selecting cyclic groups of appropriate orders, but there are other examples too.  One can interpret also this by taking a faithful representation of a Frobenius group over a finite field with $0$ -dimensional fixed point space from the kernel. Question 1: I've seen some theorems about characters of Frobenius groups in Huppert's and Isaccs' character theory books, but nothing specifically about $2$ -Frobenius groups.  In fact there is a specific formula for the characters of a Frobenius group $G=FH$ with kernel $F$ : The characters of $G=FH$ are The characters in $\text{Irr}\,H$ are characters of $G$ with $F$ in their kernel. Define an action of $H$ on $\text{Irr}\,F$ by $\phi^h(f)=\phi(f^{h^{-1}})$ .  The orbits of $H$ on $\text{Irr}\,F$ are $\{\phi_1=1_F\},\{\phi^h_j|h\in H\}$ for $j=2,\ldots,(1+|\text{Irr}\,F|-1)/|H|$ .  Then the $\phi_j^G$ are irreducible on $G$ . (Thus, a corollary: $|\text{Irr}\,G|=|\text{Irr}\,H|+\frac{|\text{Irr}\,F|-1}{|H|}$ .) Could this be adapted to describe the characters of $2$ -Frobenius groups?  I'm particularly interested in Frobenius groups where $F_1$ and $G/F_2$ are $p$ -groups and $F_2/F_1$ is a $q$ -group (for distinct $p$ , $q$ ). Question 2: Is there any information out there in the literature about characters of $2$ -Frobenius groups? (Maybe some papers?) If not, can anyone think of other Frobenius group character theorems that could be adapted smoothly to $2$ -Frobenius groups?  Doesn't matter how tedious or specific; anything to help me understand this type of group better.","['representation-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'characters', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

$$\big(g(x)-1\big)\big(g(-x)-1\big)=1.$$ I started with some special functions like $g(x)=1+e^x$. Then later: $g(x)=1+a^{bx}$ or $g(x)=1-a^{bx}$. I wonder there are more, or how to find all of them. Edit: At first, I didn't mentioned that I am interested only in those continuous function. Follows from Marvis's post, I think I got the answer. Let $h(x)=|g(x)âˆ’1|$. Then $h(x)h(âˆ’x)=1$ and hence $\ln(h(x))+\ln(h(âˆ’x))=0$. This implies that $\ln(h(x))=âˆ’\ln(h(âˆ’x))$. Now, $\ln(h(x))=k(x)$ where $k(x)$ is an odd function. So $h(x)=e^{k(x)}$ and hence $g(x)=1Â±e^{k(x)}$, where $k(x)$ is an odd function. Note that the base e can be changed to any base a with positive $aâ‰ 1$. Do I miss out anything? By the way, this questions was due to the following post which I wonder why the function $1+e^x$ is so special.

215515,"Solution of $x^2 + s(x)\cdot x - n = 0$, with $s(x)$ is the sum of digits of $x$.","This problem comes from an programming competition website, but I'd interested
in analyze it from mathematics prespective. Given this problem below, we must
create a program that could give us the correct output from the given input.
The program must run under the time limit that provided by the system. The Problem Let define function $s$ that take input from positive integers, such that $s(x)$
is the sum of the digit of $x$. For example, $$s(1024) = 1 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 7$$ Given some integer constant $n$ as the input of the program.
Now, find positive integer solution of $x$ in equation $$x^2 + s(x) \cdot x - n = 0.$$ If more than one solution exist, choose the lowest one.
If the solution doesn't exist, give output -1. Time Limit of the program: 2 second. Range of the input $n$: $[1, 10^{18}]$ The Solution In finding the solution, we could iterate from some range of possible value
of x, and try each of these value whether it satisfy the equation or not. To improve the run time of the program, we must choose the shortest range for x. My Question What is the shortest range of possible value of x that we
could iterate to find the answer of the problem above? Is there a better way to find the solution without iterating from the set
possible value of x? My Attempt: Consider that
$$x^2 + s(x) \cdot x - n = 0$$
$$\Leftrightarrow  x ( x + s(x) ) = n$$ and since both $x$ and $(x + s(x))$ are positive integers and the product of both
number is $n$, we can conclude that $x$ and $(x + s(x))$ is a pair of positive
factor of $n$. Since $x$ is a factor of $n$, we now have the first possible range of $x$, that is
$[1, n]$. But, iterating $x$ over this range gives bad performance to the program. For
small value of $n$, it won't matter, but for $n \geq 10^{17}$, the program will reach
it's time limit. If I could recall correctly, we have this theorem $$x_1 \cdot x_2 = x$$ and $$x_1 \leq x_2$$ implies that $$x_1 \leq \sqrt{x} \leq x_2$$ And since $x (x + s(x)) = n$ and $x \leq x + s(x)$ we have $x \leq \sqrt{n} \leq x + s(x)$ Now we have the second range: $[1, \sqrt{n}]$ But, still, this range also give bad performance for larger $n$. My last attempt is by considering the biggest possible value of $s(x)$, that is the digit of $x$ is all $9$ and $x$ less than or equals to the maximum value of $n$, $10^{18}$. $$s(x) \leq s(999,999,99 \cdots 9,999) = 9 \cdot 18 = 162$$ Hence, we have $$x + s(x) \leq x + 162$$ so that,
$$\sqrt{n} \leq x + s(x) \leq x + 162 \leq \sqrt{n} + 162$$
hence,
$$\sqrt{n} - 162 \leq x \leq \sqrt{n}$$ Now, we have better range that will suffice for all value of $x$.
$$l_1 = \max \{ 1, \sqrt{n} - 162 \}$$
$$l_2 = \sqrt{n}$$
the range is $[l_1, l_2]$ But, I though there must be a better solution to this problem. Hence I try
$$l_1 = \max \{ 1, \sqrt{n} - 162/2 \}$$
And that range is also correct. But I can't justify my finding. So, hence my third question: Why $l_1 = \max \{ 1, \sqrt{n} - 162/2 \}$ also gives us correct solution?",['functions']

Then $S/R$ is a partition of $S$ . Specifically: (i) For each $a$ in $S$ , we have $a âˆˆ [a]$ . (ii) $[a] = [b]$ if and only if $(a,b) âˆˆ R$ . (iii) If $[a] \ne [b]$ , then $[a]$ and $[b]$ are disjoint. Conversely, given a partition $A_i$ of the set $S$ , there is an equivalence relation $R$ on $S$ such that the sets $A_i$ are the equivalence classes.

Also: $[1] = \{1,2\}$ , $[2] = \{1,2\}$ , $[3] = \{3\}$ Observe that $[1] = [2]$ and that $S/R = \{[1],[3]\}$ is a partition of $S$ . One can choose either $\{1,3\}$ or $\{2,3\}$ as a set of representatives of the equivalence classes. My confusion arises from the $S/R = \{[1],[3]\}$ .

215951,Comparable Graduate ODE Text Suggestions,"First off, I'm very sorry if this sort of question is not allowed here.  I've seen a couple similar questions on the OverFlow site, but I think discussions of basic material should be kept to this site. Anyway, in my ODE course we are using the introductory ODE text written by Jack Hale: http://www.amazon.com/Ordinary-Differential-Equations-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486472116/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1350512056&sr=8-1&keywords=jack+Hale Actually, it's only introductory in the sense that it is self-contained, but it is rather advanced (think of those Dover reprints in size 8 font, half of which is written in Greek letters).  The table of contents and first pages give a hint of the level and material covered (see below). The proofs encountered in ODE seem to me VERY VERY unintuitive, in the sense that one (without experience) would be very unlikely to ever reproduce such proofs on their own.  Often they begin by establishing (without any motivation) estimates which are then used to prove things like ""now we see such and such is a nondecreasing,"" and only once three fourths through the proof does one see why it was even necessary to establish any of the prerequisite facts. I'm hoping this is just the style of the author, but perhaps this is just the specific taste of ODE theory. In any case, I would like some recommendations for texts that cover similar material on ODE theory that people here have found useful in the past .  There are many ODE texts, and they cover different parts of ODE theory.  This text (and our course) is aimed specifically at establishing the general theoretical framework for ODE theory (e.g. preliminaries on fixed point theorems/Banach spaces, Peano existence, Picard uniqueness, continuation of solutions, continuous dependence of parameters, differential estimates, further theory on linear systems, etc.), and then going straight to stability analysis (e.g. analysis of linear systems, perturbations of non-linear systems, Poincare-Bendixson theory, and Liapunov methods) and finally perturbation methods (e.g. asymptotic expansions, averaging, multiple scales, etc.).  In other words, this is not a course on elementary solution methods encountered in undergraduate courses, nor is it a course on advanced analytic topics such as Sturm-Louiville theory and eigenfunction expansions.  It is very much an ""applied"" course. Thank you in advance, and again I apologize if this is not strictly a ""Math Stackexchange"" question. EDIT (1): I know that several people have used Strogatz' non-linear dynamics text, which covers the ladder two topics discussed (actually, it covers very little on perturbation methods).

My thoughts are that if a matrix $A$ is diagonalisable as $A=PD^{-1}P$ then it is 'regular,' since then all $A^k$ exist; but does this also imply all entries of $A^k$ are positive? Any hints?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'positive-matrices']"
216020,An exercise 2.3 from Harris's AG: A First Course,"This is an exercise 2.3 from Harris's AG: A First Course: Using the result of the exercise 2.2 ($A(\mathbb{A}^2 \setminus \{0\}) = K[x_1, x_2]$) show that $X = \mathbb{A}^n \setminus \{0\}$, $n > 1$, [as a quasi-affine variety] is not isomorphic [as in biregular] to any affine variety. I have serious issues with this exercise. I'm going to use the fact that regular mappings are Zariski continuous. I am also assuming that the underlying field $K$ is infinite. Consider a regular isomorphism $f: X \to Y$ where $Y$ is an affine subvariety of $\mathbb{A}^m$ cut out by polynomials $h_i$, $i \in I$. By (a slight generalization of) ex. 2.2 we know that the components of $f$ are exactly restrictions of polynomials to $X$, we'll denote the extension of $f$ to the whole $\mathbb{A}^n$ as $\hat{f}$. But then $h_i \circ \hat{f} \vert_{\mathbb{A}^1}$ has infinite number of zeros, which means that the image of $0 \in \mathbb{A}^n$ lies in $Y$ as well. Consider now a line $L \subset \mathbb{A}^n$ passing through both preimages of $\hat{f}(0)$. It is now sufficient to prove that $\hat{f} \vert_{X \cap L}$ is not an isomorphism onto its image. I don't really know how to proceed. It is clear that $X \cap L$ is isomorphic to a hyperbola $xy = 1$, and thus we can reduce the problem to the one about affine varieties. However, I don't know how to prove that they are not isomorphic without using Euclidean topology (and thus assuming that $K = \mathbb{R}$ or $K = \mathbb{C}$. I guess I could look ahead and use the definition of a singularity, but it's so far ahead in the textbook it would be cheating. I can't think of a nice Zariski closed set that $\hat{f}$ would not pull back onto a Zariski closed set either, and I'm pretty sure one doesn't exist. So I'm left with having to study coordinate rings of the hyperbola and its image, and I don't know how to reason about the latter. Am I on the wrong track with this exercise? I suspect that I am, yet I don't know any better way to go about it. Is there a hint I could use?",['algebraic-geometry']

216061,Euler and infinity,"What do people mean when they say that Euler treated infinity differently? I read in various books that, today, mathematicians would not approve of Euler's methods and his proofs lacked rigor. Can anyone elaborate? Edit:
If I remember correctly Euler's original solution to the Basel problem is as follows. Using Taylor series for $\sin (s)/s$ we write
$$\sin (s)/s = 1 - {s^2}/3! + {s^4}/5! -  \cdots $$
but $\sin (s)/s$ vanishes at $\pm \pi$, $\pm 2\pi$, etc. hence
$$\frac{{\sin s}}{s} = {\left( {1 - \frac{s}{\pi }} \right)}{\left( {1 + \frac{s}{\pi }} \right)}{\left( {1 - \frac{s}{{2\pi }}} \right)}{\left( {1 + \frac{s}{{2\pi }}} \right)}{\left( {1 - \frac{s}{{3\pi }}} \right)}{\left( {1 + \frac{s}{{3\pi }}} \right)} \cdots$$
or
$$\frac{{\sin s}}{s} = {\left( {1 - \frac{{{s^2}}}{{{1^2}\pi^2}}} \right)}{\left( {1 - \frac{{{s^2}}}{{{2^2}{\pi ^2}}}} \right)}{\left( {1 - \frac{{{s^2}}}{{{3^2}{\pi ^2}}}} \right)} \cdots$$
which is
$$\frac{{\sin s}}{s} = 1 - \frac{{{s^2}}}{{{\pi ^2}}}{\left( {\frac{1}{{{1^2}}} + \frac{1}{{{2^2}}} + \frac{1}{{{3^2}}} +  \cdots } \right)} +  \cdots.$$
Equating coefficients yields
$$\zeta (2) = \frac{{{\pi ^2}}}{6}.$$ But $\pm \pi$, $\pm 2\pi$, etc. are also roots of ${e^s}\sin (s)/s$, correct? So equating coefficients does not give ${\pi ^2}/6$.","['nonstandard-analysis', 'calculus', 'math-history']"

216181,"Is there a quicker, nicer way to show that the union of compact sets is not necessarily compact?","Working on this real analysis problem set, and the problem is: Is every union of compact sets compact? I decided to try to construct a counterexample, but it seems convoluted and hard to follow (maybe not). Here's my answer, which I intend to use as my answer, but I'm wondering if there is a way I can answer this using the properties of compactness rather than constructing an explicit counterexample. Let $S_n=[n,n+1]$. Then for any $i\in\mathbb{N}$, $S_i$ is compact (this is a theorem so I'm good here). Now suppose $S=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty S_i$ is compact and let ${G_n}$ be the open interval $(0,2^n)$. Then $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}G_i$ is an open cover of $S$ (is this obvious? Should I try to show this explicitly?), so there exist finitely many indices $\{\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n\}$ such that $G=\bigcup_{i=1}^nG_{\alpha_i}\supseteq S$. Since there are finitely many indices $\{\alpha _i\}$, there exists some index $\alpha_i^*$ with the greatest least upper bound $2^{\alpha_i^*}$. Now let $x=2^{\alpha_i^*}+1$. Then $x\in S_x\subset S$ but $x\notin G$. But under the hypothesis that $S$ is compact, $G\supseteq S$. Hence $S$ is not compact. $\square$ So yeah, it seems convoluted and I'm not sure if it's even airtightâ€”there might be some blanks that I need to fill in. Is there a faster way?","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"

There is an identity element $e \in S$, that is, there exists $e \in S$ such that $e \cdot a=a$ and $a \cdot e=a$ for all $a \in S$. Question :  Suppose, $x,y \in S$ such that $x \cdot y=e$.  Does $y \cdot x=e$? This question was motivated by the question here , where the author attempts to prove a special case of the above in the context of matrix multiplication.  It was subsequently proved, but the proofs require the properties of the matrix. I attempted to use Prover9 to prove the statement.  Here's the input: formulas(assumptions).

% associativity
(x * y) * z = x * (y * z).

% identity element a
x * a = x.
a * x = x.

formulas(goals).

x * y = a -> y * x = a.

end_of_list. and it returned sos_empty , which, I guess, implies that no proof of the above statement is possible from the axioms of monoids alone.  I ran Mace4 on the same input, and found no counter-examples for monoids of sizes $1,2,\ldots,82$. A comment by Martin Brandenburg here regarding K-algebras might also apply here.  For example, the property might be true for finite monoids, but not all infinite monoids.

Using uniform continuity: for some $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists an $n \geq N$ such that $|\phi_n(x)-f| < \frac{1}{n}$.  Since simple functions take on a finite number of values, it is reasonable to take a $\max$.  So I let $\phi(x)=\max\{\phi_n(x)\}$.
