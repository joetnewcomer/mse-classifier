4102,Sufficient statistics vs. Bayesian sufficient statistics,"Given sample data $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ generated from a probability distribution $f(x|\theta)$ ($\theta$ being an unknown parameter), a statistic $T(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ of the sample data is called sufficient if $f(x|\theta, t) = f(x|t)$. However, I'm always kinda confused by this definition, since I think of a sufficient statistic as a function that gives just as much information about $\theta$ as the original data itself (which seems a little different from the definition above). The definition of Bayesian sufficiency, on the other hand, does mesh with my intuition: $T$ is a Bayesian sufficient statistic if $f(\theta|t) = f(\theta|x)$. So why is the first definition of sufficiency important? What does it capture that Bayesian sufficiency doesn't, and how should I think about it? [Note: I believe that every sufficient statistic is also Bayesian sufficient, but not conversely (the reverse implication doesn't hold in the infinite-dimensional case, according to Wikipedia).]","['statistics', 'probability']"
4105,Solving Diffie–Hellman problem for low primitive root,"What's a good way of solving the Diffie–Hellman problem when those exchanging the message have chosen a low primitive root $g$ (e.g. $g=3$)?

The integers $a$ and $b$ are private integers and we want to calculate the secret key $s = g^{ab} \pmod{p}$.","['modular-arithmetic', 'cryptography', 'number-theory']"
4106,normalization factor for restricted density,"Bounty update : this can be solved by change of basis, but I'm intrigued by David's solution relying on Fourier Transform of Dirac Delta function, so the bounty is for whoever finds a way to fix his solution to give the right result. Suppose I have a non-negative real-valued function over $d$-dimensional real vectors as follows $$f(\mathbf{x})=\exp(-\mathbf{x}' A \mathbf{x})$$ Where $A$ is some symmetric positive definite $d\times d$ matrix. What is the normalization factor to turn this into a valid density over the following set? $$S_d=\{(x_1,\ldots,x_d)\in \mathbf{R}^d | \sum_i x_i=0 \}$$ Below, David Bar Moshe gives a general solution to computing that integral over space orthogonal to some vector $v$, but I suspect it has a mistake because the answer depends on the norm of $v$. In particular, suppose $A$ is $d$-by-$d$ identity matrix. Let $v$ be a vector of all ones. Because of symmetry, integrating over space orthogonal to $v$ should be the same as as $d-1$ dimensional Gaussian integral, ie $\pi^{(d-1)/2}$, whereas David's solution gives $$\frac{\pi^{(d-1)/2}}{d}$$",['integration']

4199,Deriving an implicit Cartesian equation from a polar equation with fractional multiples of the angle,"Usually, applying the conversion formulae $r^2=x^2+y^2$ $\cos\;\theta=\frac{x}{r}$ $\sin\;\theta=\frac{y}{r}$ to transform an equation in polar coordinates to an implicit Cartesian equation is quite straightforward for an equation of the form $r=f(\cos(n\theta),\sin(n\theta))$ with $n$ an integer, thanks to multiple angle formulae. Polar equations of the form $r=f\left(\cos\left(\frac{p}{q}\theta\right),\sin\left(\frac{r}{s}\theta\right)\right)$ where $p$, $q$, $r$ and $s$ are integers, and $\frac{p}{q}$ and $\frac{r}{s}$ are in lowest terms, are more difficult to handle, but the case where $q$, $s$ are powers of 2 is slightly eased by the existence of identities like $\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)=\frac{\sin\;\theta}{1+\cos\;\theta}$. The really difficult ones to handle are the cases like Cayley's sextic : $r=4a\cos^3\left(\frac{\theta}{3}\right)$ and in general, the cases with fractions whose denominators are not powers of 2. In particular for Cayley's sextic, I can't seem to find a quick way to exploit the appropriate multiple angle identities. One ""cheat"" I have seen is to instead represent the polar equation as a pair of parametric equations, and then make the substitution $\theta=3\arctan\;t$ so that everything is represented algebraically. The problem is that apparently it takes some insight to recognize how to remove the new parameter $t$ easily. For even tougher cases like $r=\cos\left(\frac{2\theta}{3}\right)-\sin\left(\frac{3\theta}{5}\right)$ the appropriate substitution after transforming to parametric equations is $\theta=\mathrm{LCM}(3,5)\arctan\;t$, but the expressions, though algebraic, look even more nightmare-ish to manipulate. Mathematica has no trouble figuring out the implicit Cartesian equation, through a judicious use of Gröbner bases: Factor /@ GroebnerBasis[Append[Thread[{x, y} == TrigExpand[{4a Cos[t/3]^3 Cos[t], 4a Cos[t/3]^3 Sin[t]}]],
Cos[t/3]^2 + Sin[t/3]^2 == 1], {x, y}, {Cos[t/3], Sin[t/3]}, MonomialOrder -> EliminationOrder] but I'm pretty sure the Cartesian equations have already been determined way before Buchberger was born. How would one determine the Cartesian equation of such a curve using only classical techniques? Apropos to this question, is there a quick way to determine the degree of an algebraic curve represented in polar coordinates without having to do a conversion?","['geometry', 'plane-curves']"
4201,Singular and Sheaf Cohomology,"Let $X$ be a complex manifold of dimension $n$. Thus, it's a real manifold of dimension $2n$. Now cohomology is a topological concept so it should not depend upon the structure given on a topological space. We know that $k^{th}$ Singular cohomology of $X$ is $0$ for $k \gt 2n$. We can also define a sheaf cohomology on that space using derived functor approach of Grothendieck. Then (by a result of Grothendieck) we know that k'th sheaf cohomology is $0$ for $k \gt n$. Now, for constant sheaves [say R ], the sheaf cohomology agrees with singular cohomology [with coefficient R ]. Does this means that even the $k^{th}$ singular cohomology of $X$ vanishes for $k \gt n$? [Edited] I now feel that the result which says that sheaf and singular agrees is actually this that $k^{th}$ sheaf cohomology [of a complex manifold and constant sheaf] will agree with $2k^{th}$ singular cohomology [of the underlying real manifold]. Is this correct?? I would still like others to comment. Thanks.",['algebraic-geometry']

Of course you have to change some things in the inductive step, when you want to use it on real numbers. I guess that using induction on real numbers isn't really possible, since $[r,r+\epsilon]$ with $\epsilon > 0$, $r \in \mathbb R$ is never empty.

My question is, since $S$ is not totally ordered is it possible to have two lower bounds that are not comparable, and hence be unable to say whether one lower bound is really the greatest lower bound since you cannot compare to every other lower bound? If such a thing is not possible, (which I believe is the case since it is given $\inf E$ exists) would it also be fair to say that the existence of $\inf E$ implies that the set $L(E)$ of lower bounds of $E$ is a totally ordered subset of $S$?

I would appreciate any hints on how to solve this problem as I'm stuck, but that's not my actual question. I understand that for finite fields this implies that two sets of the same cardinality must have the same field structure, if any exists. The classification of finite fields answers the above question in a constructive manner. What got me curious is the infinite case. Even in the finite case it's surprising to me that the field axioms are so ""restrictive"", in a sense, that alternate field structures are simply not possible on sets of equal cardinality. I then started looking for examples of fields with characteristic zero while thinking about this problem. I didn't find many. So far, I listed the rationals, algebraic numbers, real numbers, complex numbers and the p-adic fields. What are other examples?

4323,Are all algebraic integers with absolute value 1 roots of unity?,"If we have an algebraic number $\alpha$ with (complex) absolute value $1$ , it does not follow that $\alpha$ is a root of unity (i.e., that $\alpha^n = 1$ for some $n$ ).  For example, $(3/5 + 4/5 i)$ is not a root of unity. But if we assume that $\alpha$ is an algebraic integer with absolute value $1$ , does it follow that $\alpha$ is a root of unity? I know that if all conjugates of $\alpha$ have absolute value $1$ , then $\alpha$ is a root of unity by the argument below: The minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ is $\prod_{i=1}^d (x-\alpha_i)$ , where the $\alpha_i$ are just the conjugates of $\alpha$ .  Then $\prod_{i=1}^d (x-\alpha_i^n)$ is a polynomial over $\mathbb{Z}$ with $\alpha^n$ as a root.  It also has degree $d$ , and all roots have absolute value $1$ .  But there can only be finitely many such polynomials (since the coefficients are integers with bounded size), so we get that $\alpha^n=\sigma(\alpha)$ for some Galois conjugation $\sigma$ .

Having read about iterated functions shortly before though, I came up with this train of thought: $$f(f(x)) = f(x) + x$$
$$\Leftrightarrow f^2 = f^1 + f^0$$
$$f^2 - f - f^0 = 0$$ where $f^n$ denotes the $n$'th iterate of $f$. Now I solved the resulting quadratic equation much as I did with plain numbers $$f = \frac{1}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + 1}$$

4368,On computing the largest eigenvalue of a very large sparse matrix,"I am trying to compute the asymptotic growth-rate in a specific combinatorial problem depending on a parameter w, using the Transfer-Matrix method. This amounts to computing the largest eigenvalue of the corresponding matrix. For small values of w, the corresponding matrix is small and I can use the so-called power method - start with some vector, and multiply it by the matrix over and over, and under certain conditions you'll get the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. However, for the values of w I'm interested in, the matrix becomes to large, and so the vector becomes too large - $n>10,000,000,000$ entries or so, so it can't be contained in the computer's memory anymore and I need extra programming tricks or a very powerful computer. As for the matrix itself, I don't need to store it in memory - I can access it as a black box, i.e. given $i,j$ I can return $A_{ij}$ via a simple computation. Also, the matrix has only 0 and 1 entries, and I believe it to be sparse (i.e. only around $\log n$ of the entries are 1's, $n$ being the number of rows/columns). However, the matrix is not symmetric.

Definition : Birthday is defined as an element of the set $\\{\text{Monday},\text{Tuesday},\text{Wednesday},\text{Thursday},\text{Friday},\text{Saturday},\text{Sunday}\\}$ Definition : A Child is defined to be an ordered pair: (sex $\times$ birthday).

If $\inf_T S$ and $u=\inf_U S$ both exist, and there exists a subset $S'\subseteq T$ such that $u=\sup_U S'$, then $\inf_U S=\inf_T S$. First I noted that $\inf_T S\preceq\inf_U S$, since $\inf_T S\in U$.

Now suppose there exists some $y\in U$ such that $u\prec y$, but $y\preceq x$ for all $x\in [u)\cap T$. Since $S\subseteq [u)\cap T$, $y$ would be a lower bound of $S$ larger than $u$, contradicting the fact that $u=\inf_U S$.

Since $\delta = \chi_f(t)$, so $P(A) = 0 \Rightarrow \chi_f(A) = 0$.

I felt an obvious bijection would be $f\colon A\rightarrow B\colon (p,p+2)\mapsto p+1$, where $A$ is the set of all pairs of twin primes, and $B$ is the set of all positive $n$ such that $n^2-1$ has only four positive divisors. $f$ is injective, and for any such $n$, if $n^2-1=(n-1)(n+1)$, has only four positive divisors, they must be $1,(n-1),(n+1),n^2-1$, implying that $n-1$ and $n+1$ are twin primes, and thus $(n-1,n+1)$ would be a suitable preimage. However, I assumed the wording of the problem meant I should show a bijection from unordered pairs of twin primes to positive integers, but I'm not sure if the problem intended for me to find a bijection that takes a single prime that happens to be a twin prime, to any such $n$, not necessarily positive which is problematic since both $n$ and $-n$ give the same $n^2-1$.

4626,How do I prove the partial denominators formula of the Bauer-Muir transformation of a generalized continued fraction?,"Notation : $b_{0}+\underset{n=1}{\overset{\infty }{\mathbb{K}}}\left( a_{n}/b_{n}\right) $ is the Gauss Notation for generalized continued fractions . Description of the Bauer-Muir transformation (Based on pp. 76-77 of Lisa Lorentzen and Haakon Waadeland's book (A), chapter II, theorems 11, and Theorem 7;  also section 5 of J. Mc Laughlin, and Nancy J. Wyshinski's online paper (C), and section 5 of Bruce C. Berndt, Sen-Shan Huang, Jaebum Sohn, and Seung Hwan Son's online paper (B) ). Given a convergent c.f. $\underset{n=1}{\overset{\infty }{\mathbb{K}}}(a_{n}/b_{n})=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }A_{n}/B_{n}$ and a sequence ${w_{n}}$ we can construct a new c.f $\underset{n=1}{\overset{\infty }{\mathbb{K}}}({c_{n}/d_{n}})=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }C_{n}/D_{n}$ (if convergent) which is its Bauer-Muir transform with respect to ${w_{n}}$. By theorem 11, chapter II, of Lisa Lorentzen and Haakon Waadeland's book (A), pp.76-77 , the relations between $A_{n},B_{n}$ and $C_{n},D_{n}$ are given by: $C_{n}=A_{n}+A_{n-1}w_{n}$, $D_{n}=B_{n}+B_{n-1}w_{n}$, with the initial conditions $C_{-1}=1,D_{-1}=0.$ If for $n\geq 1$,  $\lambda_{n}=a_{n}-w_{n-1}(b_{n}+w_{n})\neq 0$, then $$c_{n}=a_{n-1}\lambda_{n}/\lambda_{n-1},$$ $$d_{n}=b_{n}+w_{n}-w_{n-2}\lambda_{n}/\lambda _{n-1},$$ for $n\geq 2,$ and $$\underset{n=1}{\overset{\infty }{\mathbb{K}}}(a_{n}/b_{n})=w_{0}+\dfrac{\lambda_{1}}{b_{1}+w_{1}+\underset{n=1}{\overset{\infty }{\mathbb{K}}}(c_{n}/d_{n})}.$$ The elements of $\underset{n=1}{\overset{\infty }{\mathbb{K}}}(a_{n}/b_{n})$ are computed by an application of Theorem 7, chapter II, of Lisa Lorentzen and Haakon Waadeland's book (A), which transforms a sequence into a continued fraction. I was able to derive $c_{n}$ but not $d_{n}$. Example: Application to the $\log (1+t)$ expansion. By choosing $w_{0}=w_{1}=0,w_{n}=(n-1)t$, for $n\geq 2$, one can derive $$\underset{n=1}{\overset{\infty }{\mathbb{K}}}\left( n^{2}t/\left( \left(
n+1\right) -kt\right) \right) =\dfrac{t}{2+\underset{n=3}{\overset{\infty }{%
\mathbb{K}}}\left( \left( n-2\right) ^{2}t/\left( n-\left( n-3\right)
t\right) \right) }.$$ Hence (see Wikipedia ) the expansion $$\log (1+t)=\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty }\dfrac{(-1)^{n-1}t^{n}}{n}=\dfrac{t}{1+%
\underset{n=1}{\overset{\infty }{\mathbb{K}}}\left( n^{2}t/\left( \left(
n+1\right) -nt\right) \right) },$$ can be improved with respect to the convergence speed to this one $$\log (1+t)=\dfrac{t}{1+\dfrac{t}{2+\underset{n=3}{\overset{\infty }{\mathbb{%
K}}}\left( \left( n-2\right) ^{2}t/\left( n-\left( n-3\right) t\right)
\right) }}.$$ Derivation of $c_n$ Here is how I got $c_n$. In page 77 of reference A it is proved that $$C_{n-1}D_n-D_{n-1}C_n=(A_{n-1}B_{n-2}-A_{n-2}B_{n-1})\lambda_n.$$ Hence $$C_{n-2}D_{n-1}-D_{n-2}C_{n-1}=(A_{n-2}B_{n-3}-A_{n-3}B_{n-2})\lambda_{n-1}.$$ For $n\ge 2$ Theorem 7 of reference A (derived from the fundamental c.f. recurrence) gives $$c_n=\dfrac{C_{n-1}D_n-D_{n-1}C_n}{-(C_{n-2}D_{n-1}-D_{n-2}C_{n-1})}=\dfrac{(A_{n-1}B_{n-2}-A_{n-2}B_{n-1})\lambda_n}{-(A_{n-2}B_{n-3}-A_{n-3}B_{n-2})\lambda_{n-1}}.$$ By the determinant formula we have $$A_{n-1}B_{n-2}-A_{n-2}B_{n-1}=-a_{n-1}(A_{n-2}B_{n-3}-A_{n-3}B_{n-2}).$$ Thus $$c_n=a_{n-1}\dfrac{\lambda_n}{\lambda_{n-1}}.$$ QUESTION 1: How does one prove $$d_{n}=b_{n}+w_{n}-w_{n-2}\lambda_{n}/\lambda_{n-1}$$ from $$d_{n}=\dfrac{C_{n}D_{n-2}-D_{n}C_{n-2}}{C_{n}D_{n-1}-D_{n}C_{n-1}}\qquad\text{for}\quad n\ge 2$$ and $\lambda_{n}=a_{n}-w_{n-1}(b_{n}+w_{n})$,

I've spent quite a bit of time working on this (for a while my friend and I were using Figurate numbers, as the early items in the series match up) but at this point I'm tired and stumped, and would love some assistance.

4643,"An efficient method for computing the number of submultisets of size n, of a given multiset","There are a number of ways to describe this problem. I shall name a few. Submultisets Let $(M, f)$ be a multiset where $M = {x_1, ... x_k}, |M| = k$ and $f(x_i) = m_i$, i ranging from 0 to k inclusive. Find the number of submultisets $(S,g)$ of $(M,f)$ of size n, $|(S, g)| = n$. Integer Partitions Let $n, x_1, ... x_k, m_1, ... m_k \in \mathbb{N}$ Find the number of solutions of the equation: $x_1 + x_2 + ... x_k = n$ such that $0 \le x_i \le m_i$, i of course ranging from 0 to k inclusive. Unordered combinations of size n Let a collection of objects M have k types of objects, where there are $m_i$ identical objects for each type, i from 0 to k inclusive. How many ways can I pick n elements from M, given the restriction that I cannot pick more than $m_i$ from each type? Unless I've made a mistake somewhere, each of these problems should be identical. In the ordinary undergrad combinatorics literature, there is a method for picking the number of ways to solve this, without the $m_i$ restrictions I mentioned (or at least $m_i \ge n$. That is call the multiset coefficient. There is also the number of ways of ordering all of the elements of M, provided you use all of them. That is called the multinomial coefficient. This, of course, uses only n elements from M, and does not include ordering. The only solution I've come across, given the 5 measly hours I've researched the problem, was in Combinatorics and Graph Theory by Harris et. al, which mentions a crude method for counting the number of strings of length 4 of a given set of letters ""Alma, Alabama"". They enumerate 4 different patterns by hand, and use well known equations on those patterns. It works when n and k are small, but is inefficient otherwise. Update Sorry, I should have made my question a bit more explicit. I'm looking for an efficient method to do it by hand. The recurrence equations are helpful, but it's not quite what I was looking for. I don't think there is a simple equation that provides the answers. A recurrence equation is likely to catch all of the cases, but may not be efficient for computing by hand. I don't think there is an efficient way to do this, if k is large and n is small. Or is there? Update 2 Forgive me for bringing up the concept of a multiset. I thought it was in the standard literature. The size of a multiset $|(M, f)|$ is just the summation of the multiplicities $|(M, f)| = \sum_{i} f(x_i)$. It's not the same as the size of the support $|M|$. They are only equal when $f(x_i) = 1$ for all of the elements, just a regular set.","['multisets', 'combinatorics']"

the outline estimated with packed $45-45-90$ triangles would be great. How do I get started ? EDIT @J.M.'s comment makes perfect sense, which means I should first make sure my shape is suited for this. Here's a sketch I did to illustrate this: The black shape is the 'arbitrary shape', the blue path is the path I should be filling.

Hints for estimating random angles lines with 45/90 degrees angled lines or 45-45-90 triangle packing ?

    }
    return result;
} I loop trough the the path (an ordered list of points) and I calculate the angle and radius of each line(cartesian to polar I think). Then I 'round' the angle to 45 degrees,
and draw a line to a 45 degrees constrained version of the original angle, and keep the same length for the line. This isn't very good way to do it, especially for consecutive lines with similar angles. Here are some tests: The faded red is the original, the green is the estimation. @Américo Tavares's suggestion is great though. I could use this approach for bitmap graphics too, not just vector graphics.

4733,Direct proof that f(x)=x sin(1/x) does not satisfy Lusin N condition,Let $f$ be defined as $$f(x)=\begin{cases} x \sin(\frac{1}{x}) & x\ne 0 \\ 0 & x=0 \end{cases}$$ $f(x)$  is not absolutely continuous so it cannot might not satisfy the Lusin N condition. Is there a direct proof of that it does not?  i.e. I wanted to know how to construct a set of zero measure which does not satisfy Lusin's Condition for this function.,['real-analysis']
4737,"Packing disjoint family of discs with radii $\tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{3}, \tfrac{1}{4},\ldots$ inside the unit disc","Does there exist a family of discs $\lbrace D_{n}\rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in the Euclidean plane such that the radius of $D_{n}$ is $\frac{1}{n+1}$, each $D_{n}$ is contained in the unit disc, and $D_{n}\cap D_{m} = \emptyset$ for each $n\neq m$ ? (I'm not sure what tags are appropriate for this kind question, so if You have any suggestions, You're welcome to inform me about it via comments)","['geometry', 'puzzle']"
