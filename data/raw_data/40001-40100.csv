392987,"Given $f(x) =x^2+bx+c$, $f(1) = 2$, and $f(-1) = 12$, how do I get $b$ and $c$?","Is there a different way to get $b$ and $c$ values and then the value of $f(2)$? Here's how my book does it: Given that
$$f(x) =x^2+bx+c, \qquad f(1) = 2,\qquad f(-1) = 12$$
we see
$$
f(1) = 2 \implies 1^2+b+c=2\implies b+c = 1\\
f(-1) = 12 \implies (-1)^2+b(-1)+c = 12 \implies -b+c = 11
$$
and therefore
$$
b+c = 1, \qquad -b+c = 11.
$$
Thus
$$
2c = 12 \implies c = 6 \implies b = -5
$$ and then $$
f(2) = 2^2-5\cdot2+6 = 0
$$
$$
f(2) = 0.

393051,Understanding the internal direct product of a group.,"I have come across the statement: $G$ is the direct product of its subgroups $N_1$ and $N_2$ if the following conditions hold: 1) $N_1,N_2$ are normal subgroups. 2) $N_1\cap N_2=\{e\}$ 3) They generate the group, i.e. $G=N_1N_2$ The book had previously defined the external direct product of two groups as consisting of ordered pairs of elements, one from each group. I felt that this wouldn't make much sense in this context, so I assumed this meant you could write each element of $G$ uniquely as a product of $n_1n_2$ where $n_1\in N_1,n_2\in N_2$. Then to prove this I wrote if $n_1n_2=n_1'n_2'$ then we have $n_1'^{-1}n_1=n_2'n_2^{-1}$, and since $N_1\cap N_2=\{e\}$ we have $n_1=n_1',n_2=n_2'$. This didn't however use the fact that these are normal subgroups, and I thought that maybe this is necessary because suppose $n_1n_2\ne e$, then $n_1n_2=n_2(n_2^{-1}n_1n_2)$. As $n_2\in N_2$ the product in the brackets must be in $N_1$, since $n_1n_2\ne e$ and the subsets are trivially disjoint. I think this is correct, but the book doesn't say anything more on the subject so I can't be sure. Is this chain of reasoning correct?",['group-theory']

393063,Questions on Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem,"Here is how it is worded in Apostol: Theorem. If a bounded set $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ contains infinitely many points, then there is at least one point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which is an accumulation point of $S$. Proof. (for $\mathbb{R}^1$) Since $S$ is bounded, it lies in some interval $[-a, a]$. At least one of the subintervals $[-a, 0]$ or $[0, a]$ contains an infinite subset of $S$. Call one such subinterval $[a_1, b_1]$. Bisect $[a_1, b_1]$ and obtain a subinterval $[a_2, b_2]$ containing an infinite subset of $S$, and continue this process. In this way a countable collection of intervals is obtained, the $n$th interval $[a_n, b_n]$ being of length $b_n -a_n = a/2^{n-1}$. Clearly the sup of the left endpoints $a_n$ and the inf of the right endpoints $b_n$ must be equal, say to $x$. The point $x$ will be an accumulation point of $S$ because, if $r$ is any positive number, the interval $[a_n, b_n]$ will be contained in $B(x;r)$ as soon as $n$ is large enough so that $b_n -a_n < r/2$. The interval $B(x;r)$ contains a point of $S$ distinct from $x$ and hence $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$. My questions: 1) Why bother with the first 3 sentences? What's wrong with just saying ""Since $S$ is bounded, there is an interval $[a_1, b_1]$ containing an infinite subset of $S$"". Actually, now I'm not entirely sure why it has to be bounded. Couldn't you always find some infinite subset to do this with? 2) Why does $b_n -a_n < r/2$? I would think it just has to be less than $r$. For example, these intervals could just ""converge"" to one end point ($x = a_1$ or $x = b_1$), in which case the length just has to be less than the radius of the ball (neighborhood). 3) I'm not entirely sure why we kept bisecting the intervals. I'm confused, but I don't really have a good concrete question.","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

393361,Closed subset of an affine variety... is it affine?,"Preliminaries So, first of all let me give you the definitions I'm dealing with. Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, and $\mathbb{A}^n = k^n$ . An affine variety is a closed and irreducible subset of $\mathbb{A}^n$ . Here we endow $\mathbb{A}^n$ with the Zariski topology, so a closed subset is the zero set of an ideal in the polynomial ring $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ . The irreducibility condition in the definition of affine variety requires that such an ideal is prime. A k-space is a topological space $X$ together with a sheaf of $k$ -algebras $\mathscr{O}_X$ . We require that $\mathscr{O}_X$ is a subsheaf of the sheaf of $k$ -valued functions on $X$ . An algebraic variety is an irreducible k-space $X$ such that $\exists$ an open cover $X=\bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i$ where each $U_i$ is an affine variety. Moreover we ask the diagonal $\Delta(X)$ to be closed in $X\times X$ . Now we use the term affine variety also for an algebraic variety which is isomorphic as a $k$ -space to an affine variety as defined above. The question Given a closed subset of an affine variety, is this subset affine? Remarks My professor claimed this to be true, and I noticed some people take this fact as granted on this website as well, so I guess this should be true! Nevertheless I don't see why such a closed subset should be irreducible. But the point is: do we really care? My naive understanding of this affine/not affine business is that for an affine variety we can write down something like a global coordinate system (the coordinate ring), while for a general algebraic variety we have just local coordinates, ie we have many affines patched together in a way that cannot be described globally with the usual tools. Hence if a variety is reducible this is not a real obstruction to being affine: we can still find a global coordinate system. The important thing is that all the components lie in the same $\mathbb{A}^n$ As you can see I'm a bit confused... some clarification about these ideas would be really appreciated!","['affine-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"
393366,Symplectic Form Preserved by Orthogonal Transformation,"I'm trying to prove that the symplectic form $$\omega = d(\cos\theta) \wedge d\phi$$ is preserved by the action of $SO(3)$ on $S^2$ where $\phi$ and $\theta$ are spherical polars.

It doesn't seem like the form is invariant under $SO(3)$. Perhaps it's only meant to be a local symplectomorphism though. Am I allowed to claim that it is a local symplectomorphism because it gives the right result in the limit as $\epsilon \to 0$?

393404,Is Euclidean Geometry complete and unique,"Please help me understand this concept of completeness of geometry and set me on the right path. This is my context: From wikipedia, a formal system is complete if every tautology is also a theorem. For me this means that a system of axioms is complete if every statement that is true can be proved from the axioms (the question is tautologies in what kind of logic, first order, second order,...?). Anyway, it seems then that the concept of completeness depend on the system of axioms. So, in the case of Euclidean Geometry, its completeness depends on their axioms (For example Euclid's Axioms, Hilbert Axioms, Tarki's Axioms,etc). Comparing for example the axioms of Hilbert and the axioms given by Tarski, I can see that they are essentially different in that Hilbert uses second order logic and Tarski's only first order logic. Also Tarski proved that his system of axioms is complete. Now, the incompleteness theorem of Gödel stated that the system of axioms of arithmetic is incomplete. So, when we consider $R^2$ and $R^3$ as a representation of Euclidean Geometry we are talking about a system that is not complete because we are using the real numbers. So, are we speaking of different Euclidean Geometries? I'm totally confused.","['geometry', 'logic', 'model-theory']"

393664,Curve through four points -- simple algebra??,"The motivation for this is Bezier curves. But, if you don't know what these are, you can skip down to the last paragraph, where the problem is described in purely algebraic terms. Suppose I want to construct a quadratic Bezier curve that passes through some given points. First, the standard approach: I would use three points, say $\mathbf A$, $\mathbf B$, $\mathbf C$,  choose a ""middle"" parameter value, typically $h = \tfrac12$, and then construct a quadratic curve $\mathbf P(t)$,  such that $\mathbf P(0) = \mathbf A$, $\mathbf P(h) = \mathbf B$, and $\mathbf P(1) = \mathbf C$. Easy. But, it's fairly well known that given four coplanar points, you can (usually) construct a parabola that passes through them. This problem goes back to Newton, even. But, every parabola is a quadratic Bezier curve. So, given the four coplanar points $\mathbf A$, $\mathbf B$, $\mathbf C$, $\mathbf D$, I'm hoping that there is a fairly simple calculation that gives us a quadratic Bezier curve passing through them. More specifically, let's call the quadratic Bezier curve $\mathbf P(t)$, again, and let $\mathbf P_0$, $\mathbf P_a$, $\mathbf P_1$ be its control points, so that
$$\mathbf P(t) = (1-t)^2 \mathbf P_0 + 2t(1-t) \mathbf P_a + t^2 \mathbf P_1$$ 
We want to find control points $\mathbf P_0$, $\mathbf P_a$, $\mathbf P_1$ and parameter values $t=u$ and $t=v$ such that
$$\mathbf P(0) = \mathbf A \quad ; \quad
  \mathbf P(u) = \mathbf B \quad ; \quad
  \mathbf P(v) = \mathbf C \quad ; \quad
  \mathbf P(1) = \mathbf D \quad$$
It's obvious that $\mathbf P_0 = \mathbf P(0) = \mathbf A$, and $\mathbf P_1 = \mathbf P(1) = \mathbf D$, so the remaining problem is to find the middle control point $\mathbf P_a$ and the two parameter values $u$ and $v$. I'd like to know how to calculate these remaining unknowns. Ideally a nice simple way. There is a paper on this subject , but the authors' approach seems oddly complex and esoteric, to me. I'm hoping for a simple series of elementary calculations that a smart high-school student could understand. As far as I can tell, you don't need to know anything about Bezier curves to solve this problem. It can be considered purely algebraically: we are given $\mathbf A$, $\mathbf B$, $\mathbf C$, $\mathbf D$ in $\mathbb R^2$, and we want to find $\mathbf P \in \mathbb R^2$ and $u,v \in \mathbb R$ such that
$$(1-u)^2 \mathbf A + 2u(1-u) \mathbf P + u^2 \mathbf D = \mathbf B$$
$$(1-v)^2 \mathbf A + 2v(1-v) \mathbf P + v^2 \mathbf D = \mathbf C$$

Comp. ,44(169):211-221,1985.): $$\psi(x) - \vartheta(x) > \sqrt{x} + \frac{6}{7}\sqrt[3]{x}, \;\;\;(2,036,329 \le x \le 10^{16})$$ Then: $$\vartheta(x) < \psi(x) - \sqrt(x) - \frac{6}{7}\sqrt[3]{x}$$ I am unclear on the next step: $$ \psi(x) - \sqrt(x) - \frac{6}{7}\sqrt[3]{x} < \left\{1.0000284888 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} - \frac{6}{7}\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\right\}x $$ I can see that: $$- \sqrt(x) - \frac{6}{7}\sqrt[3]{x} < \left\{- \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} - \frac{6}{7}\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\right\}x $$ I am unclear how it is established that: $$\psi(x) < 1.0000284888x$$ If anyone can help me to understand this, that will be very helpful.

393814,Determining a confidence interval for $\sigma$ from a Rayleigh distribution,"Hello stackexchangers, Suppose we have $n$ Rayleigh distributions defined by
$$f_X(x)=\frac{x}{\sigma^2}e^{-x^2/2\sigma^2}.$$
How would you go about determining an approximative confidence interval for $\sigma$?
I got this problem from a dear friend, and he suggested that I use the method of least-squares on $\sigma$. Guided by his wisdom, I found the least-squares prediction to be
$$\sigma^*=\bar{x}\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}},$$
where $\bar{x}$ is the mean value, but I am completely lost as to how to proceed. Any hints would be greatly appreciated. Your Mayor, Ron Ford","['statistics', 'probability-distributions']"
393820,Concerning unbounded linear operators on a Hilbert space,"Let $H$ be some Hilbert space and let $B:H\rightarrow H$ be a bounded linear operator and $T:D(T)\rightarrow H$ an unbounded linear operator. Furthermore we assume that $T$ is closed ,i.e. it's graph in $H\times H$ is closed and we also have that that the domains $D(T)$ and $D(BT)$ of operator $T$ and $BT$ are both dense sets in $H$. The closure of a closable linear operator $S:D(S)\rightarrow H$ is written as $\overline{S}$. The adjoint of a densely defined linear operator $S:D(S)\rightarrow H$ is written as $S^*$. Operator $A^*$ is always closed for any densely defined operator $A$. With the given assumptions and notations I would like to show the following equation holds $ (TB)^*=\overline{B^* T^*}$. This also means that the domains must coincide. So far I am only able to show that $TB$ is closed and that $(TB)^*$ is an extension of $\overline{B^* T^*}$. But I still need to show that $\overline{B^* T^*}$ is an extension of $(TB)^*$. The most difficult and crucial part seems to me to show that the following inclusion holds $D((TB)^*)\subset D(\overline{B^*T^*})$. But so far I got nothing.

393869,Hille Yosida theorem application,"Disclaimer: pretty long and specific (contraction semi groups involved). I have fourth order parabolic equation
$$
u_t + \Delta^2 u = 0
$$
on $U_T = U \times [0,T]$. $U \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ is a bounded open set with smooth boundary. Boundary conditions are:
$$
u(x,0) = g \in L^2(U)
$$
and
$$
u=\frac{\partial U}{\partial n}=0 \quad \text{on } \partial U \times [0,T] 
$$
I would like to prove the existence of a weak solution. From Hille Yosida theorem i deduce that weak solution exists if the operator $-\Delta^2$ generates a contraction semigroup (is this ok?):
To prove this i define (is this ok?)
$$
D(-\Delta^2) = H^4(U) \cap H_0^2 (U)
$$
Density: $C_0^{\infty}(U) \subset H^4(U) \cap H_0^2 (U)$. $C_0^{\infty}(U)$  is dense in $L^2(U)$ and thus $D(-\Delta^2) $ is dense in $L^2(U)$ (is this ok?) Closedness: $\{u_k\}_k^{\infty} \subset D(-\Delta^2)$ with
\begin{align*}
u_k & \to u \\
-\Delta^2 u_k & \to f
\end{align*}
in $L^2(U)$ when $k \to \infty$. I have
$$
||u_k - u_l||_{H^2(U)} \leq C(||-\Delta^2 u_k + \Delta^2 u_l||_{L^2(U)} + ||u_k - u_l||_{L^2(U)})
$$
and then $u \in D(-\Delta^2)$ and $-\Delta^2 u =f$ $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ belongs to resolvent set $\rho (-\Delta^2)$ if operator $\lambda I + \Delta^2: D(-\Delta^2) \to L^2(U)$ is one-to-one and onto. For $\lambda \in \rho (-\Delta^2)$, the resolvent operator $R_{\lambda}: L^2(U) \to L^2(U)$ is defined by $R_{\lambda}u =  (\lambda I + \Delta^2)^{-1} u $. I have to prove also $(0,\infty) \subset \rho (-\Delta^2)$: I show that equation $\lambda u + \Delta^2 u = f$ has unique weak solution for $\lambda > 0$ and assume that is also regular (can i do this?)
Now $\lambda I + \Delta^2$ is one-to-one and onto for $\lambda > 0$ and thus $(0,\infty) \subset \rho (-\Delta^2)$. Last thing to prove $||R_{\lambda}||_{L^2(U)} \leq \frac1{\lambda}$: Weak solution satisfies
$$ \lambda \int_U uv dx + \int_U \Delta v \Delta u dx = \int_U fv dx
$$
for all $v \in H_0^2(U)$. I set $u=v$ to get
$$
\lambda \int_U u^2 dx + \int_U (\Delta u)^2 dx = \int_U fu dx
$$
From here 
$$
\lambda \int_U u^2 dx  = \lambda ||u||_{L^2(U)}^2 \leq \int_U fu dx \leq ||f||_{L^2(U)} ||u||_{L^2(U)} 
$$
and
$$
||u||_{L^2(U)} \leq \frac{1}{\lambda} ||f||_{L^2(U)}
$$
Acknowledging
$$R_{\lambda}f = u$$
we get
$$
||R_{\lambda}|| \leq \frac{1}{\lambda}
$$
as desired. Is this close to ok?

Say you have 5 sets of 5 possible options (25 options total); and you select 1 option from each set.
