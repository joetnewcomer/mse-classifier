4542715,Polya's urn martingale proof,"At time $0$ , an urn contains $1$ black ball and $1$ white ball. At each time $1,2,3,...,$ a ball is chosen at random from the urn and is replaced together with a new ball of the same colour. Just after time $n$ , there are therefore $n+2$ balls in the urn, of which $B_n+1$ are black, where $B_n$ is the number of black balls chosen by time $n$ . Let $M_n = \frac{B_n + 1}{(n + 2)}$ , the proportion of black balls in the urn just after time $n$ . Prove that (relative to a natural filtration which you should specify) $M$ is a martingale. There are several ways of solving the problem. One proof starts off by letting $\mathcal{F}_n=\sigma(B_1,...,B_n)$ and then stating $$E[M_n|\mathcal{F}_{n-1}]=P(B_n=B_{n-1})\frac{B_{n-1}+1}{n+2}+P(B_n=B_{n-1}+1)\frac{B_{n-1}+2}{n+2}$$ Intuitively speaking, I agree completely with the equation. It reminds of the basic definition of conditional expectation for discrete rv $X$ given $Y=y$ : $$E(X|Y=y)=\sum_xx\cdot P(x|y)$$ How can one prove the equation rigorously? There are similar problems like De Moivre's martingale ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(probability_theory) ) which make use of the same property of conditional expectation to state: $$E(Y_{n+1}|X_1,...,X_n)=p\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^{X_n+1}q\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^{X_n-1}$$ from which it is easy to then show that $(Y_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a martingale.
What is the general formula that I am missing which applies to both of these problems?","['measure-theory', 'statistics', 'conditional-probability', 'martingales', 'probability-theory']"
4542727,How many expected flips before my sausage patties are all face up?,"I was in front of the stove making breakfast sausages this morning and I thought of a problem. If I have 3 patties that need to be flipped, and after every pan flick somewhere between 1 and 3 random patties flip, how many flicks should I expect before all of the patties are flipped to the right orientation? I'm sure this problem has been abstracted for coins or something, but I can't seem to think of how I put them together (especially because AT LEAST 1 patty is always flipped). I see that logically about 1/3 of the time I get it first try (not my personal experience but lets assume I'm a better chef than that). but after that it looks like a Markov chain problem (right?). My programatic trials seem to suggest at mean of around 6, but how would I work this out on pen and paper? Here is my simulation code import random as rd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tqdm import tqdm
total_trials = 1000000
hist_data = []
for _ in tqdm(range(total_trials)):
    patty_list = [False, False, False]
    num_attempts = 0
    while not all(patty_list):
        num_flips = rd.choice([1, 2, 3])
        rd.shuffle(patty_list)
        for i in range(num_flips):
            patty_list[i] = not patty_list[i]
        num_attempts += 1
    hist_data.append(num_attempts)
    
sns.histplot(hist_data, bins=range(1, 100)).set(title=f'trials: {total_trials:,}\nmean: {sum(hist_data)/len(hist_data)}')
plt.show() resulting in: Edit: I think my code is wrong, as it does not account for the different permutations of flips. TTF = TFT = FTT despite those being 3 scenarios. Does that check out? Edit 2: Does it make sense for me to assume N flips and then assign those flips randomly to pattys? Or do I have to assume that each patty has some probability of flipping? If I do the latter, is it just magic that they never all-not-flip? Edit 3: Thanks all for the thoughtful approach to my breakfast problem. I've learned a lot about the consequences of not defining my problem well! There are a lot of great answers here and since they're all right from a different point of view (I'll define better next time) I'm going to mark the first answer given as the correct.

4542734,"Find all bounded infinite sequences of positive integers $(a_n)$ with $a_n = (a_{n-1}+a_{n-2})/(\gcd(a_{n-1},a_{n-2}))$ for $n\ge 2$.","Find all bounded infinite sequences of positive integers $(a_n)$ with $a_n = (a_{n-1}+a_{n-2})/(\gcd(a_{n-1},a_{n-2}))$ for $n\ge 2$ . I think the only possible sequence is the constant sequence with each term equal to $2$ . Let $g_n = \gcd(a_{n},a_{n+1})$ . One can show that $(g_n)$ is eventually constant by proving that it is nonincreasing, since it is bounded below by zero and a convergent sequence of integers is eventually constant (the sequence $g_n$ converges by the Monotone Convergence theorem).  If $d$ divides $a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n+2}$ , then it divides $g_n a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = a_n,$ so $g_{n+1} | g_n$ , proving the claim.  Clearly one cannot have $g=1$ , since then for all $n$ sufficiently large, $a_n = a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$ so $(a_n)$ has a strictly increasing, unbounded subsequence. One should also be able to eliminate the case $g\ge 3$ . Now I think once one proves $g=2$ , one can use backwards induction to prove that the sequence $(a_n)$ must be as claimed, though I'm not sure about the details. Here's some additional justification of the third case of the given answer by acreativename: For the third case, I think they're assuming $A_{n} = 2$ for $n\ge k-2$ (even if not, the proof should still work if you instead assume this). We have that for all $n\ge k-2, A_n = 2.$ So in particular, $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ cannot both be divisible by $4$ for any $n\ge k-2.$ We have $a_{k+1} = \dfrac{a_{k-1}+a_{k}}2.$ So $a_k$ is even. If $a_k\equiv 0\mod 4,$ then $a_{k-1} + a_k\equiv 0\mod 4$ (as $a_{k+1}$ is even) implies $a_{k-1}\equiv 0\mod 4,$ contradicting $\gcd(a_k, a_{k-1}) = 2.$ Hence $a_k\equiv 2\mod 4,$ and so $a_{k-1}\equiv 2\mod 4.$ But from this point on, I don't know why $a_{k-1}=a_{k-2} = 2$ must hold. Once we show that $a_{k-1} = a_{k-2} = 2,$ we can then conclude the result by backwards induction ( $a_{k-j-1} =a_{k-j} = 2\Rightarrow  a_{k-j-2}=2$ ).","['contest-math', 'number-theory', 'divisibility', 'elementary-number-theory']"
4542776,Ellipse bounded between two lines and a circle,"Given two circles with radii $\beta$ and $\beta^{-1}$ , where $\beta\geq1$ . Also, given two lines $y=x\tan\alpha$ and $y=-x\tan\alpha$ , where $\pi/2>\alpha\geq0$ . I am interested in all ellipses with center at $(k,0)$ that are bound between these two lines and the larger circle (LHS of Figure). I also assume that ellipses are tangent to points $(\beta^{-1}\cos\alpha, \beta^{-1}\sin\alpha)$ and $(\beta^{-1}\cos\alpha, -\beta^{-1}\sin\alpha)$ , and has the following equation: $$\frac{(x-k)^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1.$$ I assume that $b\geq a$ . I found that all such ellipses can be obtained by the following equations: $$a=\sqrt{\frac{k(k\beta-\cos\alpha)}{\beta}}, \quad b=\sqrt{\frac{k\sin^2\alpha}{\beta\cos\alpha}}.$$ So, by changing $k$ in the range $[\beta^{-1}\cos\alpha, \beta^{-1}\frac{1}{\cos\alpha}]$ I can obtain all such ellipses: desmos . However, for some combination of $\beta$ and $\alpha$ , $k$ cannot reach $\beta^{-1}\frac{1}{\cos\alpha}$ , since ellipse will touch larger circle before that (RHS of Figure). Given $\alpha,\beta$ pair, I want to find the largest $k$ allowed, before an ellipse touches the larger circle.","['desmos', 'conic-sections', 'geometry']"

4542870,Independent and identically distributed random variable,"It is my first time learning probability theory, and if I understand correctly, the following is the meaning/motivation behind the definition of a random variable: "" A function's output is uniquely determined by its input. Random variable $f$ is a function defined on a sample space of a random phenomenon. Only after a realisation of the random phenomenon, we can know what is $x$ and hence $f(x).$ Additionaly, if the function is measurable, knowing the distribution of the underlying random phenomenon(on the sample space $\Omega$ ), one can understand the probability distribution of $f(\Omega).$ Thus, the so-called measurable functions are used to model this and are referred to as random variables. Now let $f$ and $g$ two measurable functions defined on a measurable sample space $(\Omega,\mu).$ We say that $f$ and $g$ are independent random variables if the elements of sigma algebra generated by them are mutually independent. What is the motivation behind this definition. ? I understand that by independence of two events, we mean that occurrence of one does not change the  chance of occurrence of others. Also, I am looking for some explicit real-world examples of a few functions that are all defined on the same sample space $\Omega$ to better understand the following: Random variables are independent but not identically distributed.

Interpreting $dx$ , this is the arbitary choice of $\delta{x}$ , and when we differentiate we take the limit to 0. But before we differentiate we can read this as some arbitary segment along x. Is this correct? Similar, $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is the change in y w.r.t change in x when we make a small $\delta{x}$ . As such $\frac{dy}{dx}dx$ can be interpreted as $dy$ because we are multiplying $\frac{dy}{dx}$ with are arbitary change in x, giving an arbitary change in y.

First $\limsup A_n - \liminf A_n = \limsup (A_{n+1}-A_n)$ . 1.1 For $x\in \limsup A_n\cap (\liminf A_n)^c=\limsup A_n\cap \limsup A_n^c$ , given any $N$ , there exists $n_1>N$ such that $x\in A_{n_1}^c$ . There exists $n_2>n_1$ such that $x\in A_{n_2}$ . By well-ordering principle, there exists a least $n_2>n_1$ satisfies $x\in A_{n_2}$ . Then $x\in A_{n_2}-A_{n_2-1}$ , which shows $\limsup A_n - \liminf A_n \subset \limsup (A_{n+1}-A_n)$ . 1.2 on the other side, if $x\in \limsup (A_{n+1}-A_n)$ , then for any $N$ , there exists $n>N$ such that $x\in A_{n+1}$ and $x\in A_n^c$ . From the definition, $x\in \limsup A_{n}$ and $x\in \limsup A_n^c=(\liminf A_n)^c$ . Therefore $x\in \limsup A_n - \liminf A_n$ . From 1, take $A_n$ be $A_n^c$ (change the notation), then $\text{LHS}=\limsup A_n^c-\liminf A_n^c=(\liminf A_n)^c-(\limsup A_n)^c=(\liminf A_n)^c\cap (\limsup A_n)=\limsup A_n - \liminf A_n$ , stays the same. While $\text{RHS}=\limsup (A_{n+1}^c-A_{n}^c)=\limsup (A_n-A_{n+1})$ . Since LHS=RHS, we have $\limsup A_n - \liminf A_n=\limsup (A_n-A_{n+1})$ . 2*. The same proof in 1 also could prove 2. Therefore, I think in general $\limsup (A_n-A_{n+1})=\limsup (A_{n+1}-A_n)$ . I am not so sure because I couldn't find anyone state this on the internet (google).

By the AM-GM inequality and induction, $x_{n}\leq y_n$ for all $n\ge 2$ . It could be useful to define a new sequence with a limit that's easier to evaluate.

Through trial and error, I came up with this formula to compute the new value of $y$ : $$
y_{new}=\frac{y_{old}}{((k)^{y_{old}})^{\Delta t}}
$$ where $k$ is a constant parameter such that $k>1$ , $y$ will always be $>1$ (meaning that if it goes below 1 I will discard the value and consider $y=1$ instead), and $\Delta t$ is a value in seconds always $>0$ .
Now, this ""formula"" is okay from a coding perspective, it's ready to be implemented, but I would like to be able to plot it on Geogebra or Wolfram Alpha in order to analyze and tweak it as needed, and for that I need to transform it in a ""traditional"" function $y=f(t, y_0)$ .

Because there are $5$ groups, this means that $\mathbb{P}(Q1)=5\frac{1}{5}\frac{3}{19}\frac{2}{18}=\frac{1}{57}$ . Q2: What is the probability that they all are placed in different groups?

Now, if someone were to ask me for the equation of the line of best fit between $X$ and $Y$ , WITHOUT mentioning that we want to minimize mean squared error, my naive guess would be that whatever slope the line of best fit has for $Y$ vs $X$ , the line of best fit for $X$ vs $Y$ should have the inverse slope, that is (assuming $X$ and $Y$ are normalized for simplicity): $$\hat{Y} = aX \quad \iff \quad \hat{X} = \frac{1}{a}Y,$$ with the case $a=0$ being left undetermined.
This was my first naive attempt, but after some reflection I realized why this doesn't need to be the case, both on a conceptual level and on an algebraic level. Basically, my confusion was resting on the following logic: $$(\hat{Y} = \rho X \quad \& \quad \hat{Y} \approx Y) \implies  Y \approx \rho X \iff X \approx \frac{1}{\rho}Y \implies \hat{X} = \frac{1}{\rho}Y,$$ and written this way it is clear that the mistake is at the $\hat{Y} \approx Y$ step. Now, I'm saying all of this to finally get to the following question: is there a (natural, useful) way of defining $\hat{X}$ and $\hat{Y}$ so that they do satisfy the naive logic I presented? Perhaps by changing the cost function from mean squared error to something else, and/or by replacing the correlation coefficient by some other quantity $\rho'$ satisfying $\rho'(X,Y) = \frac{1}{\rho'(Y,X)}$ ? $\textbf{tldr:}$ Can we reformulate linear regression to make $\hat{Y} = \rho{X} \iff \hat{X} = \frac{1}{\rho}Y$ ?","['statistics', 'mean-square-error', 'correlation', 'linear-regression', 'probability']"
4543435,Motivation behind Fatou's lemma.,"I am a graduate student of Mathematics and currently studying measure theory.There is a lemma which is used to prove the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem called Fatou's lemma .It states that: If $(X,\mathcal S,\mu)$ is a measure space and $f_n:X\to [0,\infty]$ be measurable functions,then $\int_X \liminf\limits_{n \to \infty} f_n d\mu\leq \liminf\limits_{n\to \infty}\int_Xf_nd\mu$ . I am looking for some motivation behind this theorem.One motivation may be this: We know that $\liminf$ is finitely super-additive i.e. $\liminf a_n+\liminf b_n\leq \liminf(a_n+b_n)$ for two sequences $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ in $\overline{\mathbb R}$ .Now this can be generalized to $\liminf a_{1,n}+...+\liminf a_{N,n}\leq \liminf (a_{1,n}+...+a_{N,n})$ for $N$ number of sequences $(a_{1,n}),...,(a_{N,n})$ in $\overline{\mathbb R}$ .Now define a sequence of functions $f_n:\{1,2,...,N\}\to \overline{\mathbb R}$ by, $f_n(k)=a_{k,n}$ then the above can be rewritten as $\sum\limits_{k=1}^N\liminf f_n(k)\leq \liminf\sum\limits_{k=1}^N f_n(k)$ .So,it is natural to ask whether it is still valid if the sum is on a countably infinite index set say $\mathbb N$ .Our lemma implies that if $X=\mathbb N$ and $\mathcal S=\mathcal P(\mathbb N)$ and $\mu$ is the counting measure,then for any sequence of non-negative functions $f_n:\mathbb N\to [0,\infty]$ ,which is measurable as $\mathcal S=\mathcal P(\mathbb N)$ we can write $\int_{\mathbb N}\liminf f_nd\mu\leq \liminf\int_{\mathbb N} f_nd\mu$ which is nothing but summation.So,we have, $\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty \liminf f_n(k)\leq \liminf\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty f_n(k)$ .So,our initial result can be generalized to a countably infinite index set if the sequence is non-negative. I like to think in this way.Is my intuition correct?","['motivation', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-integral', 'intuition']"
4543474,What makes Cousin's theorem remarkable?,"I've stumbled upon a mention of Cousin's theorem in the context of HenstockâKurzweil integral and got confused. I do not understand why this fact is called a theorem and what makes it any remarkable, when it seems to be a more or less trivial consequence of compactness (in the sens that every open cover has a finite subcover). Here is the statement taken from Wikipedia (slightly simplified): Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a full cover of $[a, b]$ , that is, a collection of closed subintervals of $[a, b]$ with the property that for every $x\in[a, b]$ , there exists a $\delta > 0$ so that $\mathcal{C}$ contain all subintervals of $[a, b]$ which contain $x$ and are of length smaller than $\delta$ . Then there exists a partition $a = x_0 < x_1 <\dotsb < x_n = b$ of $[a, b]$ such that $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]\in{\mathcal{C}}$ for all $i$ . Is there some historical context that makes this obvious consequence of compactness deserve to be called a theorem? If so, why is this theorem still so often mentioned in the context of HenstockâKurzweil integral nowadays instead of just referring to the compactness of the interval? Am I missing something? Clearly, the interval $[a,b]$ is covered by the interiors (the interiors relative to $[a,b]$ ) of closed intervals in $\mathcal{C}$ such that all their closed subintervals containing their midpoint are also in $\mathcal{C}$ , so there is a finite set $\mathcal{D}$ of such closed intervals in $\mathcal{C}$ that covers $[a,b]$ . Is the hard part supposed to be to prove that if $[a,b]$ is covered by a finite set $\mathcal{D}$ of closed intervals, then there is a partition $a = x_0 < x_1 <\dotsb < x_n = b$ of $[a, b]$ such that each $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ is contained in an element of $\mathcal{D}$ and contains that element's midpoint?","['integration', 'real-analysis', 'gauge-integral', 'math-history', 'soft-question']"

4543578,Radius of curvature at a point on a Lorentzian manifold,"I recently asked this question on the physics stack exchange. After some discussion in the comments, I didn't really arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, so I thought it might be worth it to ask it here as well. I'm new to posting questions here, so if it goes against guidelines, then apologies and a mod can close this. Anyway, here is the question. For context, I am reading this paper. The authors speak of the radius of curvature of a spacetime at a particular point. However, they don't give an explicit definition of this term. So more precisely, let $(M,g)$ be a $D$ -dimensional Lorentzian manifold with Riemann tensor $R$ , which is non-vanishing, and consider an arbitrary point $p\in M$ . Then how is the radius of curvature at $p$ defined? In the comments to my original post, user Prahar provided the following definition: \begin{equation}
\tag{1}
r^2(x)=\frac{D(D-1)}{R(x)}
\end{equation} where $r(x)$ is the radius of curvature at $x$ and $R(x)$ is the Ricci scalar at $x$ . The problem is, the authors of the article mentioned above, have to be using a definition where the radius of curvature is finite, even in a Ricci-flat region of $M$ . This is clearly not the case for this definition, since the Ricci scalar would be identically zero in a Ricci flat region and hence $r$ would diverge. My question can thus be summarized: Is there a definition of the radius of curvature at a point on a Lorentzian manifold such that the radius of curvature is finite even in a Ricci-flat region of the manifold? One candidate I could think of would be to replace $R(x)$ with the square-root of the Kretschmann scalar in $(1)$ . However I don't know if this even makes sense as a definition of radius of curvature. Any answers or reference suggestions are greatly appreciated.","['definition', 'general-relativity', 'differential-geometry']"
4543594,Eigenvectors spanning closed subspace in a Banach space,"I'm looking for an example of a (bounded) linear operator $T$ on a Banach space $X$ with infinitely many eigenvalues such that $\sum_{\lambda\in\mathbb C}\ker(T-\lambda)$ is closed where the sum denotes the algebraic sum as vector spaces, i.e. the smallest vector space containing $\ker(T-\lambda)$ for all $\lambda\in\mathbb C$ . So far in the examples I've tried, it seems like this fails to be the case, at best this sum is dense in $X$ , for instance any normal operators on a Hilbert space. Since $\sum_{\lambda\in\mathbb C}\ker(T-\lambda)$ is closed, we know that it must have an uncountable dimension, so either there are uncountably many eigenvalues or the eigenspace has uncountable dimension. However this doesn't seem to help much. My intuition is that $X$ being complete would prevent this from happening but I can't seem to show that there must be an element in the closure that is not an eigenvector. So far my current attempt to show that $X$ need to have uncountably many eigenvalues is as follows: Let $\lambda_i$ be the set of eigenvalues of $T$ , i.e. $\{\lambda\in\mathbb C:\ker(T-\lambda)\neq\{0\}\}=\{\lambda_i\}_{i=0}^\infty$ . Then we want to show that $$\bigoplus_{i=0}^\infty\ker(T-\lambda_i)$$ is not closed. Choose arbitrary $x_i\in\ker(T-\lambda_i)$ such that $\left\lvert x_i\right\rvert<i^{-2}$ , then $$\sum_{i=0}^\infty x_i\in\overline{\bigoplus_{i=0}^\infty\ker(T-\lambda_i)}$$ However $$\alpha\sum_{i=0}^\infty x_i=\sum_{i=0}^\infty\lambda_ix_i$$ From here I'm hoping to show that $\sum_{i=0}^\infty x_i$ cannot be a finite sum of eigenvectors, but I'm not sure if the $\lambda_i$ on the RHS is the only way of expressing the LHS as a limit of scalar multiples of $x_i$ .","['banach-spaces', 'operator-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"

The community reviewed whether to reopen this question 1 year ago and left it closed: Original close reason(s) were not resolved Improve this question I found this problem on the web, and it seemed like an interesting exercise to me. So I am trying to solve this as a system of equations. I tried using for example Wolfram Alpha. That means e.g. I am trying to find the radius $R$ of the circle, and the point $x$ , where the two curves touch each other. I was hoping at least for a numeric solution. But I don't get anything  useful. Could anyone help to get this working in WA? I am not sure why WA doesn't understand this syntax.

Well, I think they should give me the solution to this problem above. Why? Because they express that $f(x) = g(x)$ and also $f'(x) = g'(x)$ where the radius is denoted by $R$ . Here I have denoted $$f(x) = e^{-x^2}$$ $$g(x) = R + \sqrt{x(2R-x)}$$ ( $g$ is the top semi-circle basically) and I am looking for a solution $x$ , where $x \in (R, 2R)$ I hope I didn't mess any calculations... but I think I didn't.
The two derivatives are easy to calculate.
So I am not sure why WA doesn't understand this. EDIT : I am not sure if any of the solutions below is actually an exact/explicit solution. I think I didn't get any formula for the blue area or for the touch point. This is not a Mathematica stack exchange question actually. Mathematica was used just as a means to solve the problem. I am actually looking for a formula for the blue area (or for the X value of the touch point). I constructed a system of equations but solving by hand wasn't possible.

Let $f:P\rightarrow P$ be a global bundle automorphism; there then exists a map $\sigma_f:P\rightarrow G$ such that: $$f(p)=p\cdot \sigma_f(p)$$ Finally let $\mu_G$ be the maurer cartan form, given by: $$\mu_G(X_g)=L_{g^{-1}*}X_g$$ where $X_g$ is a vector field on some Lie group $G$ . Under the pullback of $A$ by $f$ we have:"" $$f^*A=\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}} } \circ A+\sigma_f^*\mu_G$$ I am trying to show that: $$F^{f^*A}=\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ F^A$$ where: $$F^A=dA+\frac{1}{2}[A,A]$$ and for two Lie algebra valued one forms $\eta,\omega$ : $$[\eta,\omega](X,Y)=[\eta(X),\omega(Y)]-[\eta(Y),\omega(X)]$$ which comes from the definition of the wedge product for Lie algebra valued $k$ and $l$ forms. When replacing $A$ with $f^*A$ , we see that: $$F^{f^*A}=d(\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A)+\sigma_f^*d\mu_G+\frac{1}{2}\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ [A,A]+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_f^*[\mu_G,\mu_G]+\frac{1}{2}[\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A,\sigma_f^*\mu_G]+\frac{1}{2}[\sigma_f^*\mu_G,\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A]$$ By the Maurer-Cartan equation we have that: $$\sigma_f^*d\mu_G=-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^*_f[\mu_G,\mu_G]$$ hence: $$F^{f^*A}=d(\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A)+\frac{1}{2}\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ [A,A]+\frac{1}{2}[\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A,\sigma_f^*\mu_G]+\frac{1}{2}[\sigma_f^*\mu_G,\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A]$$ My problem is now that I am unsure of how to calculate the exterior derivative of $\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A$ . By our previous formula for two Lie algebra valued one forms we have that for $\eta=\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A$ ,
and $\omega=\sigma_f^*\mu_G$ : $$\frac{1}{2}\left([\eta,\omega]+[\omega,\eta]\right)(X,Y)=\frac{1}{2}\left([\eta(X),\omega(Y)]-[\eta(Y),\omega(X)]+[\omega(X),\eta(Y)]-[\omega(Y),\eta(X)]\right)$$ $$=[\eta(X),\omega(Y)]-[\eta(Y),\omega(X]$$ $$=[\eta,\omega](X,Y)$$ So I feel that: $$d(\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A)=\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ dA-[\eta,\omega]$$ but I don't see why this should be true. In fact, since $\text{Ad}$ is a representation of $G$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ I would think that: $$d(\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A)=\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ dA$$ but then I have this extra factor of $[\eta,\omega]$ , so I am at a loss. Any hints on how to calculate this exterior derivative, or on how that wedge product may actually be zero would be greatly beneficial. Edit: Employing Professor Shifrin's notation, I write that: $$f^*A=\sigma_{f^{-1}}A\sigma_f+\sigma_{f^{-1}}d\sigma_f$$ I have already calculated the exterior derivative of the second term, albeit in a different notation, so I move to the first term: $$d(\sigma_{f^{-1}}A\sigma_f)=d(\sigma_{f^{-1}})\wedge A\sigma_f+
\text{Ad}_{\sigma_f^{-1}}\circ dA+\sigma_{f^{-1}}A\wedge d(\sigma_f) $$ Note that: $$\sigma_{f^{-1}}\sigma_f=e$$ hence: $$d(\sigma_{f^{-1}})\sigma_f=-\sigma_{f^{-1}}d\sigma_f\Rightarrow d\sigma_{f^{-1}}=-\sigma_f^{-1}d\sigma_f\sigma_{f^{-1}}$$ Therefore we obtain: $$d(\sigma_{f^{-1}}A\sigma_f)=-\sigma_{f^{-1}}d\sigma_f\wedge \text{Ad}_{\sigma_f^{-1}}A+
\text{Ad}_{\sigma_f^{-1}}\circ dA-\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A \wedge d(\sigma_{f^{-1}})\sigma_f$$ The final term in this sum can be rewritten as: $$\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A \wedge d(\sigma_{f^{-1}})\sigma_f=-\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A \wedge \sigma_f^{-1}d\sigma_{f}$$ Thus: $$d(\sigma_{f^{-1}}A\sigma_f)=-\sigma_{f^{-1}}d\sigma_f\wedge \text{Ad}_{\sigma_f^{-1}}A+
\text{Ad}_{\sigma_f^{-1}}\circ dA+\text{Ad}_{\sigma_{f^{-1}}}\circ A \wedge \sigma_f^{-1}d\sigma_{f}$$ From here, I can kind of see how the pieces should move, but I am unsure why. Reconciling the two notations is proving troublesome to me. To be clearer, it seems that from the definition for the wedge product of twisted forms, this product is actually symmetric for one forms, so I feel like the first term and the last term would cancel, which doesn't make sense. I am then left to conclude that there is something different about the wedge product I have used in this edit, and the wedge product I used in the original post, but I am unsure what that difference actually is, or how to make it precise. Edit 2: The definition of wedge product for Lie algebra valued one forms is
as follows: Given a $\omega\in \Omega^k(P,\mathfrak{g})$ and $\eta\in \Omega^k(P,\mathfrak{g})$ , then their wedge product is given by: $$[\omega,\eta](X_1,\dots,X_{k+l})=\frac{1}{k!l!}\sum_{\sigma\in S}\text{sign}(\sigma)\left[\omega(X_{\sigma(1)},\dots,X_{\sigma(k)}), \eta(X_{\sigma(k+1)},\dots,X_{\sigma(k+l)} ) \right]$$ When choosing a basis $\{T_i\}$ for the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ , we have that $\eta$ and $\omega$ can be written as: $$\eta=\sum_{i=1}^n \eta^i\otimes T_i$$ $$\omega=\sum_{i=1}^n \omega^i\otimes T_i$$ where each $\omega^i$ and $\eta^i$ are $k$ and $l$ forms on $P$ respectively. Then the wedge product can be written as $$\omega \wedge \eta =\sum_{i,j=1}^n \omega^i\wedge\eta^j\otimes[T_i, T_J]  $$ Hence: $$[\eta,\omega] =\sum_{i,j=1}^n \eta^j\wedge\omega^i\otimes[T_j,T_i] $$ $$=(-1)^{lk}\sum_{i,j=1}^n\eta^i \wedge\omega^j\otimes[T_j,T_i]$$ $$=(-1)^{lk+1}\sum_{i,j=1}^n\eta^i \wedge\omega^j\otimes[T_i,T_j]$$ $$=(-1)^{lk+1}[\omega,\eta]$$ So for two one forms, $\eta$ and $\omega$ : $$[\eta,\omega]=(-1)^2[\omega,\eta]=[\omega,\eta]$$ Hence the wedge product of Lie algebra valued forms is symmetric for one forms.","['connections', 'curvature', 'gauge-theory', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

4543895,Quantify the similarity between a polynomial roots and the roots of its derivatives,"On $\mathbb{C}[X]$ , many theorems and conjectures deal with relations between a polynomial roots and the roots of its derivatives. When looking at a graph, the derivative roots distribution somewhat mimics the distribution of the polynomial roots. It is this ""somewhat mimics"" that I would like to look at in this question. Examples. Let $P$ be a degree $n$ polynomial in $\mathbb{C}[X]$ , then: (Well-known) The mean of $P$ roots is also the mean of $P$ successive derivatives roots. And so it is the only root of $P^{(n-1)}$ which has degree $1$ . The mean being the first cumulant, what about the other cumulants of the roots? The second cumulant is the variance $\sigma^2$ , same as second central moment. We find that $\sigma^2/(n-1)$ is conserved: if $\sigma'^2$ is the variance of $P'$ roots, $\sigma'^2 = \frac {n-2} {n-1} \sigma^2$ (proof at the end). Similarly, for the third cumulant $\kappa_3$ , which is also the third central moment $\mu_3$ : if $\kappa_3'$ is the third cumulant of $P'$ roots, $\kappa_3'= \frac {n-3} {n-1} \kappa_3$ (proof at the end). However this does not extend to $\kappa_4$ nor to $\mu_4$ (which by the way are different). $\sigma'^2 = \frac {n-2} {n-1} \sigma^2$ has the following consequence (proof at the end): distance between the two roots of $P^{(n-2)}$ is proportional to $\sigma$ : $\frac 2 {\sqrt{n-1}} \sigma$ . Question :
Are there other quantities that characterize the roots distribution of a polynomial, that are conserved (possibly with a factor only depending upon $n$ ) in the polynomial derivative? These quantities should have an established statistical meaning, or a geometric interpretation. E.g. what about the PCA (principal component analysis) of the roots? Proofs : Use the following relations between cumulants $\kappa_i$ , elementary symmetrical polynomials $e_i$ , elementary symmetric polynomials for the derivative $e'_i$ , central moments $\mu_i$ , raw moments $\mu'_i$ (sorry for the notation clash: not the central moments of the derivative), power sums $p_i$ , polynomial roots $a_i$ : $\mu'_i=\frac 1 n p_i=\frac 1 n \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^i$ $p_1=e_1$ $p_2=e_1^2-2e_2$ $p_3=e_1^3-3e_1e_2+3e_3$ $\kappa_2=\mu'_2-\mu_1'^2$ $\kappa_3=\mu'_3-3\mu'_2\mu'_1+2\mu_1'^3$ $e'_i = \frac {n-i} n e_i$ Second cumulant (variance): $\kappa_2=\mu'_2-\mu_1'^2=\frac 1 n p_2 - \frac 1 {n^2} p_1^2$ $=\frac {n-1} {n^2} e_1^2 - \frac 2 n e_2$ $\kappa'_2=\frac {n-2} {(n-1)^2} e_1'^2 - \frac 2 {n-1} e'_2$ then replace $e'_i$ with $\frac {n-i} n e_i$ , gives $\kappa'_2=\frac {n-2} {n-1} \kappa_2$ . Third cumulant: $\kappa_3=\mu'_3-3\mu'_2\mu'_1+2\mu_1'^3$ $=\frac 1 n p_3 - \frac 3 {n^2} p_2p_1 + \frac 2 {n^3} p_1^3$ $= \frac 1 n (e_1^3-3e_1e_2+3e_3) - \frac 3 {n^2}(e_1^2-2e_2)e_1 + \frac 2 {n^3}e_1^3$ $=\frac {(n-1)(n-2)} {n^3} e_1^3 - 3 \frac {n-2} {n^2}e_1e_2 + \frac 3 n e_3$ $\kappa'_3= \frac {(n-2)(n-3)} {(n-1)^3} e_1'^3 - 3 \frac {n-3} {(n-1)^2}e'_1e'_2 + \frac 3 {n-1} e'_3$ then replace $e'_i$ with $\frac {n-i} n e_i$ , gives $\kappa'_3=\frac {n-3} {n-1} \kappa_3$ . Distance between roots of the $(n-2)$ th derivative: this can be proven using the variance conservation relation, or directly: Let $P(Z) = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j e_j \; Z^{n-j}$ . $P^{(n-2)}(Z)=\frac {n!} 2 Z^2-(n-1)! \; e_1 \; Z+(n-2)! \; e_2.$ Its two roots are $\frac 1 n {e_1} \pm \frac 1 {n!} \sqrt{(n-1)!(n-2)!((n-1)e_1^2-2ne_2)}$ . The quantity $(n-1)e_1^2 - 2n e_2 = (n-1)(\sum a_j)^2 - 2n \sum_{j<k}a_j a_k$ $= n (\sum a_j)^2 - 2n \sum_{j<k}a_j a_k - (\sum a_j)^2 = n \sum a_j^2 - (\sum a_j)^2$ $= n^2 (\frac 1 n \sum a_j^2 - (\frac {\sum a_j} n)^2) = n^2 \sigma^2$ , with $\sigma^2$ the variance of $P$ roots. So distance between the two roots $= \frac 2 {n!} \sqrt{(n-1)!(n-2)!n^2 \sigma^2} = \frac 2 {\sqrt{n-1}} \sigma$","['cumulants', 'derivatives', 'polynomials']"
4543918,A direct computation on Dirac delta function,"For the two dimensional vectors $x=(x_1,x_2)$ and $\xi=(\xi_1,\xi_2)$ , define the following operator $$e^{it\Delta}f(x):=\int_{\mathbb{R}^2}e^{i x\cdot\xi+it|\xi|^2}\hat{f}(\xi)\mathrm{d}\xi, \quad x\cdot\xi:=x_1\xi_1+x_2\xi_2.$$ For the functions ${\psi}_1$ and ${\psi}_2$ , assume that $$\mathrm{supp}(\widehat{\psi}_1) \subset\{\xi\in\mathbb{R}^2:|\xi|\sim M\}, \quad \mathrm{supp}(\widehat{\psi}_2) \subset\{\xi\in\mathbb{R}^2:|\xi|\sim N\}.$$ Here $\widehat{\psi}_1$ denotes the Fourier transform of $\psi_1$ and the notation $|\xi|\sim M$ means that $$c_1 M\leq |\xi|\leq c_2 M$$ for some universal constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ . Furthermore, let $\delta_0$ be the Dirac delta function. Then my question is how to use Cauchy-Schwarz to conclude the following estimate: \begin{align}
\left\|e^{it\Delta}\psi_1 e^{it\Delta}\psi_2\right\|_{L_{t,x}^2(\mathbb{R}^3)}&=\int_{\mathbb{R}_{\tau,\xi}^3} \left|\int_{\mathbb{R}_{\xi'}^2}\widehat{\psi}_1(\xi')\widehat{\psi}_2(\xi-\xi') \delta_0(\tau-|\xi'|^2-|\xi-\xi'|^2)\mathrm{d}\xi'\right|^2\mathrm{d}\tau\mathrm{d}\xi \\

&\leq C \frac{M}{N}.
\end{align} This estimate appears in Bourgian's paper Refinements of Strichartz' inequality and applications to 2D-NLS with critical nonlinearity in the proof of Lemma 111. Further details can be seen there. As far as I know, up to a constant, there holds $$\widehat{e^{it\Delta}\psi}(\tau,\xi)=\delta_0(\tau-|\xi|^2)\widehat{\psi}(\xi),$$ where $\widehat{e^{it\Delta}\psi}(\tau,\xi)$ is the space-time Fourier transform of $e^{it\Delta}\psi(t,x)$ . Therefore, Plancherel theorem can give the identity $$\left\|e^{it\Delta}\psi_1 e^{it\Delta}\psi_2\right\|_{L_{t,x}^2(\mathbb{R}^3)}=\int_{\mathbb{R}_{\tau,\xi}^3} \left|\int_{\mathbb{R}_{\xi'}^2}\widehat{\psi}_1(\xi')\widehat{\psi}_2(\xi-\xi') \delta_0(\tau-|\xi'|^2-|\xi-\xi'|^2)\mathrm{d}\xi'\right|^2\mathrm{d}\tau\mathrm{d}\xi.$$ However, I am not very familar with the computations for delta functions and confused about using Cauchy-Schwarz to compute further.

I'm quite sure that my model once found a very good approximation (I discarded it because I wasn't looking for it) of this ""new"" solution.

I got a solution but it seems to be wrong, and I was wondering where it went wrong. Here's how I did it: I first started by differentiating both sides, using Chain Rule on the RHS: $$\frac1{f(x)}=-\frac{f(x)}{(\int f(x)dx)^2}$$ Cross multiplying, I get: $$-(f(x))^2=\left(\int f(x)dx\right)^2$$ So: $$\int f(x)dx=\sqrt{-(f(x))^2}$$ Then, differentiating both sides again: $$f(x)=\frac12(-(f(x))^2)^{-1/2}\cdot(-2f(x))\cdot f'(x)$$ Which simplifies to (I switch from $f(x)$ to $y$ from here to make it easier to keep track of the variables): $$y=-(-y^2)^{-1/2}\cdot\frac{dy}{dx}$$ Separating the variables: $$dx=\frac{-(-y^2)^{-1/2}}ydy$$ At this point I'm not sure what else to do so I introduce the imaginary numbers into the equation (this is where it starts getting iffy for me, because I never mixed imaginary numbers with integration before): $$dx=\frac{-(-1)^{-1/2}\cdot(y^2)^{-1/2}}ydy$$ $$dx=\frac{-1/i}{y^2}dy$$ $$\int dx=-\frac1i\int\frac1{y^2}dy$$ $$x+C_1=-\frac1i\cdot\left(-\frac1y+C_2\right)$$ $$x+C_1=\frac1{yi}+C_2$$ $$x+C_3=\frac1{yi}$$ $$yi=\frac1{x+C_3}$$ $$\boxed{f(x)=\frac1{ix+C}}$$ where $C$ is an arbitrary complex number. But the problem with this solution is when I try to plug this back into the original equation, it doesn't seem to make the equation true. For example, let's say I choose $C=0$ , so that $f(x)=\frac1{ix}$ . Then the LHS becomes: $$\int\frac1{f(x)}dx=\int ixdx=i\frac{x^2}2+C_4$$ But the RHS becomes: $$\frac1{\int f(x)dx}=\frac1{\int\frac1{ix}dx}=\frac1{\frac1i\ln|x|+C_5}$$ which obviously don't match each other at all.","['integration', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus', 'derivatives', 'complex-numbers']"
4544117,Inutitive explanation for why my crude approximation of a probability approaches exactly half of the exact value,"First, an introductory question: There are $3n$ couples. The $6n$ people are each randomly allocated to one of three rooms, so that each room has $2n$ people. What is the probability that every couple is separated? I made a crude approximation for large $n$ : $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{3n}$ , because (assuming for the sake of simplicity that each couple consists of a husband and a wife) for each husband, there is an approximately $\frac{2}{3}$ chance that his wife is in a different room. My question is: It turns out that my approximation approaches exactly half of the exact value, as $n\to\infty$ . Is there an intuitive explanation for this? In case you're interested, the exact value is $\dfrac{\binom{3n}{2n}\binom{2n}{n}2^{3n}}{\binom{6n}{2n}\binom{4n}{2n}}$ . Explanation: The denominator is the total number of ways to divide the $6n$ people
into three rooms. First, among the $6n$ people, we choose $2n$ people
to go to the first room, so $\binom{6n}{2n}$ . Then among the
remaining $4n$ people we choose $2n$ people to go to the second room, so $\binom{4n}{2n}$ . Then the remaining $2n$ people go to the third
room. The numerator is the total number of ways in which each couple is
separated. First, among the $3n$ couples, we choose $2n$ couples to
each be represented in the first room (one person from each couple),
so $\binom{3n}{2n}$ . Then we allocate the $n$ remaining couples into
the second and third rooms (each room getting one member of each of
these couples), so the second room must now get an additional $n$ people, and these are chosen among the $2n$ people whose spouse went
to the first room, so $\binom{2n}{n}$ . Then the remaining $n$ people
go to the third room. Then each couple has two ways of being separated among two rooms, so $2^{3n}$ . It can be shown algebraically or by Wolfram that my approximation, $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{3n}$ , approaches exactly half of the exact value, as $n\to\infty$ . I'm looking for an intuitive explanation. (The introductory question was inspired by this question .)","['intuition', 'combinatorics', 'approximation', 'probability']"

$$ Let us consider the distribution of the ancillary statistic from now. WLOG take $\mu=0, \sigma=1$ , and since $X_1 > X_{(1)}$ , $X_{(1)} = \min_{2\leq i \leq n}X_i = \min_{1\leq i \leq m}Z_i$ ,  where $Z_1,\dots,Z_m \sim \text{i.i.d. } \operatorname{Exp}(1)$ . Observe that $X_1, Z_{(1)}, \sum^m_{i=1}(Z_i-Z_{(i)})$ are independent by exponential spacing. Then we have $$
\frac{X_1-X_{(1)}}{S}=\frac{X_1 - Z_{(1)}}{X_1 - Z_{(1)} + \sum^m_{i=1}(Z_i-Z_{(1)})}
$$ As you can see by implementing this new $Z$ variable, the joint distribution we had which was dependent is now jointly independent. With the transformation of variables we also have $$

$ , and that certainly doesn't hold in general.
In particular it seems I need to somehow use that it's the smallest $\sigma_n$ that's in the numerator. The equivalent result with an arbitrary $\sigma_i$ doesn't seem to be true in general. It's also interesting to notice that in the simple case $n=2$ we get $$

Though that definitely doesn't hold for $n > 2$ . I suppose the equation $\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2 x_i^2 = 1$ corresponds to integrating over an ellipse, but I haven't found a nice geometric way to make use of that. I tried something else.
In the case $\sigma_1 = 1$ and $\sigma_2=\sigma_3$ , Mathematica can evaluate the expectation as $$
\frac{x_1^2}{x_1^2 + \sigma_2^2 (x_2^2 + x_3^2)}
=
\frac{1}{1-\sigma_2^2}+\frac{\sigma_2 \sinh ^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\sigma_2^2-1}\right)}{\left(\sigma_2^2-1\right)^{3/2}}.
$$ As expected this is below $1/(1+2\sigma_2^2)$ for $\sigma_2 > 1$ : Mathematica even finds an expression for the general case $E[\frac{x_n^2}{x_n^2+a \chi^2}]$ where $\chi^2$ is Chi-squared distributed with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.
So maybe there's a proof works by ""evening out"" the larger $\sigma$ values...
The bound with chi-squared isn't particularly pretty though... A statement equivalent to my inequality is that $$
\mathbb E\left[
\frac{x_n^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i^2}
\right]
\ge E\left[
\frac{x_n^2}{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}
\right],
$$ where $\sum_i p_i=1$ , and $p_1 \ge p_2 \ge \dots \ge p_n \ge 0$ .
Since $E\left[
\frac{x_n^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}
\right]=\frac1n$ by symmetry.
It might even be that all of this is true independent of $x_i$ being Gaussian, as long as they are IID.","['geometric-probability', 'conic-sections', 'normal-distribution', 'inequality', 'probability']"

homeomorphism such that $\nu \circ \nu= id_{T}$ . If $(T_1,\nu_1)$ and $(T_2, \nu_2)$ are $\mathbb{Z}_2$ -spaces, a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ -map
between them is a continuous mapping $f : T_1 \rightarrow T_2$ such that $f \circ \nu_1 = \nu_2 \circ f$ . The sphere $S^n$ is considered as a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ -space with the antipodal homeomorphism $x \rightarrow -x$ .

I am working on a huge 35-dimensional simplicial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ -complex that is very complicated. Let $B$ be this simplicial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ -complex with the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ -action $\nu$ . I want to show there is no (continuous) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ -map from $B$ to $S^3$ . In this text when we talk about an $S^4$ , we mean a ""hollow"" $S^4$ such that $\nu(S^4)=S^4$ .

I applied a discrete Morse function on $B$ and got $B'$ which is simpler than $B$ , and homotopy equivalent to $B$ . Since $B$ and $B'$ are homotopy equivalent, their homology groups $H_k$ are isomorphic and their Betti numbers $b_k$ are equal: $$ H_k(B') \simeq H_k(B) \quad b_k(B')=b_k(B).$$ I am thinking to compute the homology group $H_4(B')$ and the Betti number $b_4(B')$ to get $H_4(B)$ and $b_4(B)$ , and prove there exists a copy of $S^4$ included in $B$ . I am not sure what homology group or Betti number show there exists an $S^4$ in $B$ . I guess that if I get $b_4(B)\neq 0$ , I could conclude there is an $S^4$ included in $B$ ; or if $H_{4}(B)\neq 0$ and $b_4(B)= 0$ , I could conclude there is no $S^4$ included in $B$ but still there is no $\mathbb{Z}_2$ -map from $B$ to $S^3$ .

4544481,Probability that a random element of a group has order $2$ [closed],"Closed . This question needs to be more focused . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 1 year ago . Improve this question If $G$ is a finite group, let $\tau(G)$ be equal to probability that a random element $x \in G$ satisfies $x^2=1$ , ie. $\tau(G) = \frac{|\{x \in G :\ x^2=1\}|}{|G|}$ . Can we say something about $\tau$ ? My intuition about the range of possible results we could possibly obtain here comes from another problem: taking two elements of $G$ at random, let $c(G)$ be the probability that they commute. It is quite widely known that if $c(G) > \frac{5}{8}$ , then $G$ is abelian and $c(G)=1$ . More recently it was proven that the set of possible values of $c(\cdot)$ is nowhere dense, has no irrational limit points, and is well-ordered by $>$ . We can state more or less the same problems in our case: a) Is there a constant $c<1$ such that $\tau(G)>c$ implies $\tau(G)=1$ ? b) Is the set of values of $\tau$ nowhere dense? Does it have any infinite increasing sequence (okay, this is essentially the same as well-order)? c) Is the set of values of $\tau$ closed? Parts b, c) look like they might be hard, and I don't expect anyone to write a serious paper in answer to this post, so two more questions, less specific and hopefully easier to answer. d) Are there any sources of examples of groups (or families of groups) with high value of $\tau$ ? Of course $\tau(G)=1$ if and only if $G \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2^k$ . We have $\tau(G \times H) = \tau(G) \cdot \tau(H)$ , and $\tau(\mathbb{Z}_n) = \frac{1}{n}$ for odd $n$ , $\frac{2}{n}$ for even; in particular for abelian groups other than $\mathbb{Z}_2^k$ we have $\tau(G) \leqslant \frac{1}{2}$ . We get better efficiency with dihedral groups: we always have $\tau(D_n) > \frac{1}{2}$ , although half is the limit with $n \to \infty$ . Groups such as $\operatorname{Aut}(D_8)$ also give a half. Therefore it seems like a good bound for a conjecture of the following kind: e) For every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is an integer $N$ , such that $\tau(G) \geqslant \frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon$ and $|G| \geqslant N$ imply $G \simeq H \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ for some group $H$ . (As $-\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ does not change $\tau$ , this means we have essentially finitely many examples of $G$ giving values bigger than $1/2 + \varepsilon$ , and in particular there are finitely many such values.)","['combinatorial-group-theory', 'group-theory', 'probability']"

\nabla^2 u \quad \text{or} \quad \nabla \cdot \nabla u = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}

I was just trying to understand the physical intuition behind defining the Laplacian as the divergence of the gradient? I understand that the Laplacian operator represents diffusion and that it looks to reduce the deviation between a point and its neighboring points. But I was not clear on how this idea relates to the ideas of divergence--which relates to flux, and gradient--which describes how a scalar valued function is changing at a point given its variables.","['divergence-operator', 'notation', 'multivariable-calculus', 'intuition', 'partial-differential-equations']"

4544628,Explicitly Computing Structure Sheaves For Quotients of Polynomial Rings,"I'm working through an introductory problem in scheme theory and just want to make sure I'm understanding the concepts correctly.  The problem states to consider the following two rings, specify their Zariski open sets, as well as the restriction maps: $A = \mathbb{C}[t]/\left (t^2-t\right) = \{a+bt \; | \; a,b\in\mathbb{C}\}$ $B = \mathbb{C}[t]/\left (t^3-t^2\right) = \{a+bt+ct^2 \; | \; a,b,c\in\mathbb{C}\}$ For ring $A$ we can compute $X_A = \text{Spec} A = \left \{\widetilde{(t)}, \widetilde{(t-1)}\right \}$ where the $\sim$ is to signify that we are really dealing with the quotients $\widetilde{(t)} = (t)/\left (t^2-t\right )$ .  I arrived at this since prime ideals in a ring $R/I$ are projections of prime ideals of $R$ containing $I$ .  Furthermore, I concluded that the Zariski topology on $X_A$ is discrete since both prime ideals can be written as the zero set of an ideal (namely itself) in $A$ .  At the risk of overdoing the notation I'll call the open sets $U_t$ and $U_{t-1}$ , then the structure sheaf elements should be \begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{O}(U_t) & = & A_{\widetilde{(t)}} \;\; =\;\; \left \{\left .\frac{a+bt}{c+dt} \;\right | \; c+dt \not \in \widetilde{(t)}\right \} \\
\mathcal{O}(U_{t-1}) & = & A_{\widetilde{(t-1)}} \;\; =\;\; \left \{\left .\frac{a+bt}{c+dt} \;\right | \; c+dt \not \in \widetilde{(t-1)}\right \}.
\end{eqnarray*} Is my logic more or less correct?  We as well have that $U_t \cap U_{t-1} = \emptyset$ so we need not worry about the sheaf element in that case. For ring $B$ much of my logic remains the same in that $X_B = \text{Spec} B = \left \{\widetilde{(t)}, \widetilde{(t-1)}\right \}$ , this is discrete as well for similar reasons, and the only difference is in the forms of the structure sheaf elements: \begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{O}(U_t) & = & B_{\widetilde{(t)}} \;\; =\;\; \left \{\left .\frac{a+bt+ct^2}{d+ft+gt^2} \;\right | \; d+ft+gt^2 \not \in \widetilde{(t)}\right \} \\
\mathcal{O}(U_{t-1}) & = & B_{\widetilde{(t-1)}} \;\; =\;\; \left \{\left .\frac{a+bt+ct^2}{d+ft+gt^2} \;\right | \; d+ft+gt^2 \not \in \widetilde{(t-1)}\right \}.
\end{eqnarray*} I'm studying algebraic geometry for the first time out of Bosch's Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra , and I also don't have much of an algebra background aside from groups, Lie groups, and basic ring theory. Response to Comments I think I caught KReiser's comment about the denominators in ring $B$ being incorrect.  In response to the comments about rationalization, for ring $A$ we can take $$
\frac{a+bt}{c+dt} \;\; =\;\; \frac{at+bt^2}{ct+dt^2} \;\; =\;\; \frac{at+bt}{ct+dt} \;\; =\;\; \frac{a+b}{c+d}
$$ which means that both sheaf elements in ring $A$ are just copies of $\mathbb{C}$ .  So can we conclude that $\mathcal{O}(U_t) \cong \mathbb{C}$ as well as $\mathcal{O}(U_{t-1}) \cong \mathbb{C}$ ? Moving on to ring $B$ we can similarly compute $$
\frac{a+bt+ct^2}{d+ft+gt^2} \;\; =\;\; \frac{at^2 + bt^3 +gt^4}{dt^2+ft^3+gt^4} \;\; =\;\; \frac{a+b+c}{d+f+g}

4544682,"Given n squares, in how many ways can they be contiguously arranged into a single shape?","Context: At school today, a friend of mine ripped up a piece of paper he had written on. I was considering the number of possible ways I could rearrange these individual pieces to try to reconstruct the whole, and the runtime complexity of such a de-rearrangement. However, thatâs a question for the theoretical CS StackExchange, not here. What Iâm interested in is a more simplified problem: If some polygon in a Euclidean space which only contains right-angles is cut into equally-sized individual squares, into how many possible configurations can these squares be rearranged, allowing only rotation and translation, and no reflections (since a reflection of an actual piece of paper would imply flipping over whatever text is written on it)? I thought of using graph theory to analyze thisâthat is, each square node can be in 4 possible states, because it can be rotated into 4 separate states ( $4^{n}$ possible rotational states overall) and each node can have at most 4 edges extending from it (since equally-sized squares can touch at most 4 others). However, note that if you have square-nodes A, B, and C, and they are connected in a line from left to right like ABC, that is a different configuration from CBA even though each individual letter has an edge connecting it to the same other nodes, which doesnât align with the way that graph theory equates any two such graphs regardless of their physical representation. ABC is the same thing, however, to CBA with each node rotated twice if Iâm not mistaken, if you wish to think of all rotations of the overall structure as the same thing. Iâm thinking that maybe each edge can also be labeled with a number 1-4 that represents the direction in which the contact between the two squares occurs, but at this point Iâm stuck because I have no formal training in graph theory.
This certainly seems like a problem within combinatorics, in which I have very minor experience (I learned a little bit for Academic Decathlon last year).
I think the problem will be more easily represented by looking at a few cases. Case 1: 1 square Result: Either 1 or 4 ways, depending on whether you wish to consider rotations of the entire structure to be the same thing. From now on, for simplicityâs sake, I will say that every rotation of the entire structure is a separate structure. Case 2: 2 squares Result: Letâs call these squares A and B. A can connect to Bâs left, right, top, or bottom side. A being on Bâs left is the same as B being on Aâs right. There are thus 4 connection states, and for each square, there are 4 rotation states. Thatâs $4^2 = 16$ rotation states overall, multiplied by the 4 connection states, giving $4^3 = 64$ states overall. Case 3: 3 squares Result: Letâs call these squares A, B, and C. I think that each outcome might be able to be represented by a tree, where at each point I choose whether to include or exclude a square from the next side. Each time I make a choice to include another square, I have one fewer squares to choose from. I must, however, choose every square, because Iâm not making a discontinuous or incomplete shape here.
Note that if two squares touch the same other square, they do not touch each other, so contact is never transitive. However, if the difference between the sides chosen on a given square (A) for two other squares (B and C) has an absolute value of 1, then a fourth square (D) is able to touch both B and C. This makes a tree very confusing to deal with. So, at square A, I can choose either B or C to go on either side 1, 2, 3, or 4. Once I place 1 of those 2 squares, I have only 1 square left to choose from that can go on 1 of the 3 remaining sides of the other two squares, giving me 6 choices. If I choose B the first time around, then that gives me 4 possible position-configurations, and then after placing C I can actualize the next 6 possible configurations one step down the line. This gives $4*6 = 24$ possible position configurations when choosing B first. The same follows with C, meaning that there are actually $4*6*2 = 48$ possible position-configurations. With the 4 possible rotations for each square, I have $4^3 = 64$ rotation-states for the figure, giving $64*48 = 3,072$ possible configuration states for the three squares in the image. If, hypothetically (though not applicable in my usage case), we were allowed to reflect each of these squares as well, you would have to consider the 4 axes of symmetry on each of the squares, giving another $4^3 = 64$ reflection states for the shape, which when multiplied by our previous $3,072$ states gives $196,608$ possible states for the image. Iâm not sure which sets of rotations or reflections would be equivalent (Iâd have to learn some group theory to predict that), but thatâs a lot for 3 squares. Case 4: 4 squares Results:
This one is a bit harder. Since the first three squares can be placed in an L-shape, the fourth square can be placed to fill in the corner, which can be reached two separate ways by placing the square on one side of two separate squares respectively. I donât know how to calculate this one. Overall:
I think it would be nice if anyone could tell me of a more general view of this problem and its solution (for example, using any polygon as the decomposed shape which can be arranged into a gapless tiling like a triangle, square, or hexagon, and considering the options based on its number of sides and its number of symmetries). Edit: I just realized that in the case of the three squares, I can also perform a similar process of choice starting with each of the three squares individually rather than the others. This means that I have a separate set of $3,072$ configurations starting with each square, giving me $3*3072 = 9,216$ arrangements with rotation, and $9,216*64 = 589,824$ reflection-allowing states.","['puzzle', 'mathematical-modeling', 'graph-theory', 'geometry', 'combinatorics']"

4544710,Combinatorics Problem: Basketball Team with Players that Can Play any Position,"Problem. Suppose you are to choose a basketball team of 5 players from 12 available athletes. How many ways can you choose a team composed of 2 guards, 2 forwards, and a center? Solution. The way I understood the problem is that any player can be delegated to either of the three positions. There is no restriction to how many players we can only delegate to a certain position. So I assumed that the only concern I have is not over-counting the players I have already chosen for a certain role in a team of 5. Thus $$\binom{12}{2}\binom{10}{2}\binom{8}{1}=23,760 \:\text{ways}$$ Is this correct?","['solution-verification', 'combinatorics']"

However, this model leads to high variance on lower dimensional, less complex data. I am using a neural network to parameterize the scale and shift components of the MAF. I think we need to smooth the loss surface, i.e., the log likelihood of the normalizing flow. Is there any literature outlining good ideas or what would be a good starting point?

4544742,Is it possible to prove the derivative of $e^x$ is $e^x$ using the limit definition of $e$ without using binomial expansion?,"I am teaching my students about the derivative of $e^x$ . I have walked through what is in our textbook and they have all happily believed me, but I would like to have a better explanation for why the derivative is $e^x$ . I know several other proofs exist like those that define $e$ using the slope at $0$ and those that use the natural log, but I'd like my proof to closely follow the method used in the textbook.  That is why this question and this question have not answered all of my questions. Here is what the textbook says. I understand everything until they decide to let $e^{\Delta x}\approx 1 + \Delta x$ . My question is why do they not directly use the limit definition of $e$ . Is it because they can't without introducing students to binomial expansion? I put $e^{x}$ outside the limit and then tried to substitute the definition of $e$ . But I think I made a mistake. Here is my work: $$e^{ x} \lim_{\Delta x\to\ 0} \frac{(\lim_{\Delta x\to\ 0}( 1+ \Delta x)^{\frac{1}{\Delta x}}) ^{\Delta x}-1}{\Delta x}$$ Using limit properties I know I can rewrite this as: $$e^{x} \lim_{\Delta x\to\ 0} \frac{(\lim_{\Delta x\to\ 0}( 1+ \Delta x))-1}{\Delta x}$$ This is where I get confused/stuck. If I resolve the inner limit first, I get: $$e^{x} \lim_{\Delta x\to\ 0} \frac{1-1}{\Delta x}$$ $$e^{x}\lim_{\Delta x\to\ 0} \frac{0}{\Delta x}$$ $$e^{x} \times 0 = 0$$ Is there a property of limits that would allow me to ""get rid"" of that inner limit?","['proof-explanation', 'calculus', 'derivatives', 'exponential-function']"
4544756,How to construct the normalized set of random variables?,"I have read the paper Narrow Reliability Bounds for Structural Systems . The author stated on page 458 that there exists a transformation such that a $n$ -set of random variables $X=(X_1,...,X_n)$ can be normalized. Here, the term 'normalized' means transforming $X$ into a set of variables $Y=(Y_1,...,Y_n)$ with all means equal to zero, all standard deviations equal to one, and all covariances equal to zero. The author further stated that It is well known from the general theory of random variables that such a transformation exists if the covariance matrix of $X$ is regular. $X$ in the above quotation is the original $n$ -set of random variables before normalization. I was wondering how to construct such a transformation to make all covariances equal to $0$ . Besides, I was also wondering what the term ' regular ' means in the above quotation.

They're not quite the Stirling numbers of the first kind since it's possible to have e.g. $i_1 = i_2$ . Denoting the sum by $(k\mid n)$ we have the recurrence relation $(k\mid n) = n(k-1\mid n) + (k\mid n-1)$ I thought maybe the average term of the sum would be similar to the average product over a random list of $k$ numbers from $1$ to $n$ .
