2321180,Mean distance between matrix entries,"Given a $4$ by $4$ matrix, or in general an $n$ by $n$ square matrix, can we determine the mean euclidean distance (i.e. $\sqrt{\Delta x ^2 + \Delta y^2}$) between entries that are not neighbours? Two matrix entries $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ are neighbours if $\Delta x=\Delta y=1$ or $\Delta x=1$ and $\Delta y=0$; or lastly $\Delta x=0$ and $\Delta y=1.$ This means for example that the middle entry $(2,2)$ in a $3$ by $3$ matrix has $8$ neighbours, which means that this entry cannot be paired with any other matrix entry to create a non-neighbouring pair. This also means that all entries in a 2 by 2 matrix (below the entry coordinates in the matrix are written) \begin{matrix}
  (1,1) & (1,2)  \\
  (2,1) & (2,2)  
 \end{matrix} are considered as neighbours. I understand the first part to solve is: for a given matrix size, how many non-neighbouring pairs of entries are there? For example in a $3$ by $3$ matrix, we have $16$ combinations of entries that are not neighbours. Note we care about combinations of entries because for example the pair $(1,3) \& (3,3)$ and the pair $(3,3) \& (1,3)$ are considered as indistinguishable, i.e., swapping the position of an entry in a pair does not count as a new pair of entries.
Once we know the count $C$ of non-neighbouring pairs, then we can safely assign each pair with a probability $1/C,$ in order to solve the mean distance problem.","['matrices', 'probability-theory', 'linear-algebra']"
2321182,Find if there exists an element which is sum of squares,"Consider the sequence : $\langle 3,7,11,15,\cdots\rangle$. Is it possible that an element of this sequence is sum of two squares? My approach: General term of the sequence if $4n-1$. Consider the canonical homomorphism $\phi \colon \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_4$. If $a^2+b^2=4n-1$ has a solution in $\mathbb{Z}$, then it has a solution in $\mathbb{Z}_4$. That is, $$a^2+b^2=(4n-1) \ \text{mod}\ 4=3 $$ Clearly, this has no solution in  $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and hence neither does the original.

2321203,Kalman Filter constant steady state value,"Without explaining you the details of my problem I would like to ask you a theoretical question. I think I know the answer but I would like to be sure. I have a set of $n$ agents moving in 3D space. In some way I am estimating their pose (positions+orientations). The pose of the agents represents the state of my Nonlinear System . The goal was to design an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to observe the poses of the agents. I understood how to implement the EKF but now I arrived to estimate the poses with a constant error at steady state. Is this, in your opinion, correct? I thought that the EKF, assumed that the difference between the initial state and the estimated state is not too big and the nonlinearities are not too big , would converge to the true state of the system. NOTE: beside the difference between the actual and estimated states I have no noise, neither in the measurement nor in the process (for now I am working just in simulation, MATLAB/SIMULINK) Thanks for your time in reading my question.","['multivariable-calculus', 'kalman-filter', 'linear-algebra', 'multilinear-algebra']"
2321210,proof of the right continuity of a CDF (i.e. the Stieltjes measure function),"Let $\mu$ be a probability measure on the real line $\mathbb R$ with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra.  Define $F(t)\triangleq \mu((-\infty, t])$, i.e. the CDF (or the Stieltjes measure function).  I want to show that $F$ is right-continuous, but I'm not sure if my arguments (shown below) are correct.  I'd greatly appreciate it if someone can confirm it or correct me. To show that $F(t)=\lim_{s\to t^+}F(s)$, it suffices to prove that $\lim_{s\to t^+}\mu((t,s])=0.$  To do so, I consider a sequence of open intervals $I_n=(t,t+2^{-n}), n=1,2,3,...$.  Since $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n=\emptyset$, we have $0=\mu(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n)=\lim_{n\to \infty}\mu(I_n),$ where the last equality is due to the fact that $I_1\supset I_2\supset ....$  The claim then follows from the monotonicity of $\mu$ and the fact that for every $I_n$, we have $(t,s]\subset I_n$ for every $s \in I_n$. Are these arguments correct?  The result holds for any nonnegative, countably additive measure on $\mathbb R$, doesn't it?

2321212,Intersection of Jordan measurable sets is Jordan measurable,"I am currently self teaching myself measure theory from https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/gsm-126-tao5-measure-book.pdf . I would like some help/tips in proving the Boolean closure properties in Exercise 1.1.6. I am first proving that if $E$ and $F$ are Jordan measurable then $E\cap F$ is Jordan measurable, it seems very elementary and so I don't know why it is causing difficulty. Here is my attempt of a proof: If $E$ and $F$ are Jordan measurable then there exists elementary sets $A_1,B_1,A_2,B_2$ such that
$$ A_1\subset E\subset B_1, A_2 \subset F \subset B_2$$
with $m(A_1) = m(B_1), m(A_2) = m(B_2).$ Note that
$$ A_1 \cap A_2 \subset E\cap F \subset B_1 \cap B_2.$$
I now want to show that $m(A_1 \cap A_2) = m(B_1\cap B_2)$ and then since $A_1 \cap A_2$ and $B_1 \cap B_2$ are elementary $E\cap F$ would be Jordan measurable. I also know that $m(B_1 \cap B_2) \leq m(A_1\cap A_2)$ by the monotonicity property  of elementary sets. I was trying to partition each of the sets $A_1,B_1,A_2,B_2$ e.g. 
$$ A_1 = (A_1 \cap A_2)\cup (A_1\backslash A_2).$$
Using this we can conclude
$$ m(A_1 \cap A_2) + m(A_1\backslash A_2) = m(B_1 \cap B_2) + m(B_1\backslash B_2) $$
$$ m(A_1 \cap A_2) + m(A_2\backslash A_1) = m(B_1 \cap B_2) + m(B_2\backslash B_1). $$
This doesn't seem to help and I've tried various other things to no avail. Thanks for your help.","['measure-theory', 'analysis']"

People thinks $S$ is like a small neighbourhood of $x$ in the analytic topology if there is an embedding $k \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, could someone explain why more carefully?

2321391,Spectrum and point spectrum of a multiplication operator,"I am considering an arbitrary measure space $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ and the Hilbert space $H = L^2(\mu)$. The space $B = L^{\infty}(\mu)$ of essentially bounded functions can then act on $H$ as bounded linear operator by multiplication, i.e. if $g \in B$, then $M_g(f) = gf \in H$ for all $f \in H$. I've managed to prove the following if $\mu$ is either $\sigma$-finite or locally finite. For any $g \in B$, the spectrum of $M_g$ is equal to the essential range of $g$ and the point spectrum of $M_g$ is equal to $\{ \lambda \in \mathbb{C} \mid \exists A \in \mathcal{A} \text{ with } \mu(A)>0: f(A) = \lambda\}$. I also know this doesn't hold for general measure spaces, because there is the following counter example:
 If we have $X = \{0,1\}$, $\mu(0) = 1$, $\mu(1) = \infty$, $g(0) = 0$ and $g(1) = 1$. Then $M_g=0$ but the essential range and point spectrum of $g$ is $\{0,1\}$. My questions are the following then: Is there a more general class of measures for which this would hold? I know locally finite doesn't imply $\sigma$-finite and vice versa, so preferably it would hold them both. If such a class doesn't exist, are there maybe counterexamples less trivial than the one I mentioned? Are there any non-trivial counterexamples where a part of the statement still holds, meaning the essential range isn't the spectrum but the point spectrum is still the same set described in the statement? Or maybe the other way around.","['functional-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'operator-theory']"

2321435,Number of permutations that map every part of a particular partition away from itself,"Let $C_1=\{1,2,\dots,c_1\}, \space C_2=\{c_1+1, \dots,c_2\}, \dots \space C_k=\{c_{k-1}+1,\dots, n\}$ be a partition of the set $\{1,2,\dots n\}$. I want to calculate the number of permutations $\sigma \in S_n$ that don't take any element in any part of the partition to that same part; that is, the number $$a_C = \#\{\sigma\in S_n \space | \space \forall k : \forall j \in C_k : \sigma(j) \notin C_k\}$$ My thoughts and ""conjectures"" on the problem: A special case when $|C_j|=d$ is constant and $n=kd$. A further special case of this is $d=4, k=13$ (and $n=52$). This corresponds to a card game where the deck is gone through one card at a time and at the same time counted $1,2,\dots, 13,1,2,\dots, 13,1,2,\dots, 13,1,2,\dots, 13 $. If at any point the number said out loud matches the value of the card laid down (suit doesn't matter), the game is lost. Otherwise, if the end is reached without matches, the game is won. (Trying to calculate the winning probability of this game is how I came up with the general problem.) The case $d=1$ gives the permutations without fixed points . For these the fraction $\frac{a_n}{n!} \to \frac{1}{e}$ as $n\to \infty$. I suspect that for other values of $d$ the limit is $\frac{1}{e^d}$ but I can't find a proof for this. Still, simulation seems to support the claim and there's the heuristic argument that if the events $\sigma(j) \notin C_k$ were independent, the probability of ""$\sigma$ to be good"" would be $(1-\frac{d}{n})^n \to e^{-d}$. For some partitions $a_C=0$: if one part has more than $n/2$ elements, some element must stay in that part after permuting.","['permutations', 'probability']"

$$
where $f\in L_1(0,\infty)+L_2(0,\infty)$ is a decreasing function (so that the above is well-defined). Now, this may be obvious, but since $t\in(0,\infty)$ is arbitrary, this requires that the function 
$\Phi_f\colon x\in(0,\infty)\mapsto x + \int_x^\infty \left( \frac{f(t)}{f(x)} \right)^2\; dt$ be onto $(0,\infty)$. Is that clear? I cannot really see why; in particular, this does hold for all $f$'s of the form $f(x)=\frac{1}{x^{1/2+\alpha}}$ ($\alpha>0$), for instance; then one gets a linear function.

2321757,Rigorous nature of combinatorics,"Context: I'm a high school student, who has only ever had an introductory treatment, if that, on combinatorics.

Question: I apologise in advance for the naive question, but at an elementary level it seems as though combinatorics (and the ensuing probability that can make use of it), seems not overly rigorous. It doesn't seem as though you can ""prove"" that the number of arrangements you deemed is the correct number. What if you forget a case?

But, that  doesn't seem to be the way other areas of mathematics is done.

I'll show what I tried at the bottom. Question A test is used to determine if a sequence of binary numbers are independent, by counting the number of times $X$ that there is a change in response between consecutive trials in the sequence (from failure to success and vice versa). As an example, a sequence (let $S$ denote success and $F$ denote failure) is $$S \ S \ F \ S \ F \ S \ F \ S \ S \ F.$$ This sequence has $X = 7$ changes. $(i)$ Assume this test is an unconditional test, with some known probaility $p = 0.5$ where $n$ is the number of trials.
Explain why $X \sim Bin(n-1,0.5)$. $(ii)$ Consider the 3 sequences: $$(A): \ \ \ F \ F \ S \ S \ S \ S \ S \ F \ F \ S \\ (B): \ \ \ S \ S \ F \ S \ F \ S \ F \ S \ S \ F \\ (C): \ \ \ S \ S \ S \ F \ S \ F \ S \ S \ F \ F.$$ Which test is the least consistent with a sequence of independent failures/successes? We are given the p-values for $X = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ being $0.002, \quad 0.020, \quad 0.090, \quad 0.254,  \quad0.500, \quad 0.746, \quad 0.910, \quad 0.980 , \quad0.998, \quad 1.000$ respectively. My attempts The amount of changes $K$ are dependent on how many $F's$ are squeezed between two adjacent $S's$. So for the case where $F$ does not start at the beginning or end, we require $\frac{K}{2}$ number of failures, where $K$ is even. The number of ways we can do this is: $\begin{pmatrix} n-1 \\ \frac{K}{2}\end{pmatrix}$. Sadly, this is only the case where $K$ is even and when the failures are not adjacent to other failures... $(ii)$ I feel like the most least ""consistent"" is $(A)$, but I'm not sure how to mathematically reason with this. Do we test a hypothesis that $p = 0.5$ vs. $p \neq 0.5$?","['combinatorics', 'statistics']"

2321990,A Socratic look on the Residue Theorem,"So a friend of mine and I were talking about the Residue Theorem and we were wondering if it is actually possible for a closed, rectifiable curve to contain a non-constant sequence of singularities and if in that case the Residue Theorem is applicable. Let's add some symbolisms: Let $\Omega$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{C}$ and $f:\Omega\setminus\{z_n: n\in\mathbb{N}\}\to\mathbb{C}$ be a holomorphic function defined on $\Omega$ except of the different points $(z_n)$ which are $f$'s singularities. Let $\gamma$ be a closed, rectifiable, simple curve in $\Omega$, such that $z_n \not\in \hat{\gamma}$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, but all $z_n$ are inside $\gamma$, or if you'd like, $\chi(\gamma,z_n)=1$ . Since the area inside $\gamma$ is a compact set, $(z_n)$ will have a converging sub-sequence, let's call it $(z_{n_k})$, with $z_{n_k}\to z_0$. There is no real interest if the singularities are removable from an index on, so let's suppose that they're all poles or essential singularities. The questions are the following: 1) Is it possible for the function $f$ to be holomorphic on the limit point $z_0$? Now if one says ""but $z_0$ belongs to $\Omega$, that changes nothing, cause the question would become ""can there be such a function $f$?"" 2) Is it possible for the limit point $z_0$ to be in the inside of $\gamma$ and not on $\hat{\gamma}$? 3) If (1) is possible, would the Residue Theorem take the form of ""Integral = Series of residues"" ?

The gradient of a scalar field points in the direction of greatest rate of change. Now if I have a surface given by $f(x,y,z)$, then the normal to the sruface can be found by taking the gradient of $f$ at that point. Intuitively, this also makes sense to me. The change is zero along the tangent plane, so the greatest rate of change must be normal to the surface. However I was doing a question which gave a surface and then asked in what direction a marble would roll if placed at a particular point on the surface. Now I initially thought that the marble would roll in the direction of greatest rate of change- i.e. a ball on a hill will roll down where the potential will decrease most rapidly. I would take the gradient and then take the direction in which f was decreasing as opposed to increasing. However if the gradient is normal to the surface, then a marble would be ejected directly off of the surface? This is not what happens! Now I have a hunch as to what might be the problem here although I am not sure. I think the problem is two-fold. First, the mathematical description allows the possibility of the marble passing through the surface or coming off of it. Secondly, I think maybe I am mixing up surfaces and scalar fields which are not surfaces. Perhaps in the physical case I actually have a scalar field (not a surface) describing the potential energy AND a surface on which the marble is constrained to move, and the marble will move in the direction of greatest rate of decrease of potential energy while still being constrained on the surface.

We know from continuous mapping theorem that if $g:\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{E}$ is a fixed continuous function (independent of $n$), where $\mathbb{E}$ is another metric space, then $g(X_n)\stackrel{d}{\to} g(X)$ as $n\to\infty$. My question: Let $\{g_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of continuous functions such that $g_n\to g$ ""pointwisely"" on $\mathbb{D}$. Can one conclude that

$$
If not, is there a counterexample? The proof for the classical continuous mapping theorem uses portmanteau theorem (see the proof of Theorem 1.3.6 on p.20 of van der Vaart and Wellner (1996)). For example, one can prove $g(X_n)\stackrel{d}{\to} g(X)$ by showing that for any closed $F\subset\mathbb{D}$,
$$

2322888,Alternative proof to non-emptiness of spectrum/spectral radius formula,"The following two results are probably the most basic results in the spectral theory: Let $a$ be an element in a unital Banach algebra $\mathcal{A}$ (over $\mathbb{C}$). The spectrum of $a$, $\sigma(a) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} \mid (\lambda \mathbb{1} - a) \text{ isn't invertible} \}$, is non-empty. This allows us to define the spectral radius $r(a) = \sup \{ \lvert \lambda \rvert \mid \lambda \in \sigma(a)\}$ for which $r(a) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \lVert a^n \rVert^{1/n}$ holds. All proofs I've seen of these two theorems are essentially the same. The sketch of the proof of the first proposition goes as follows: We prove this via contradiction, so suppose $\sigma(a)$ is empty. Define the resolvent of $a$ as the map
$$
R:\mathbb{C} \to \mathcal{A}: \lambda \mapsto (\lambda \mathbb{1} - a)^{-1}.
$$
It's analytic in the sense that $\phi \circ R$ is analytic for all $\phi$ continuous linear functionals on $\mathcal{A}$. Then it's not so hard to prove $R$ is bounded, so by Liouville's theorem $\phi \circ R$ must be constant for every $\phi$. This then implies $R$ must be constant and zero and thus we arrive at a contradiction. The proof of the second theorem is very similar:
First it's proven that $r(a) \leq \inf_n \lVert a^n \rVert^{1/n}$, which is not so hard. Then all that is left to prove is that $r(a) \geq \limsup_n \lVert a^n \rVert^{1/n}$. Let $\Omega$ be the open disk in $\mathbb{C}$ around $0$ with radius $\frac{1}{r(a)}$ and define
$$
f:\Omega \to \mathbb{C}: \lambda \mapsto (\mathbb{1} - \lambda a )^{-1}.
$$
We prove that $\phi \circ f$ is analytic for every $\phi$ as before. Then we can argue that $\phi(a^n) \lambda^n$ is a bounded sequence for every $\phi$ and $\lambda \in \Omega$ by using the power series of $\phi \circ f$. By Banach-Steinhaus we then have that $a^n \lambda^n$ is bounded for every $\lvert \lambda \rvert < \frac{1}{r(a)}$. It then follows that $r(a) \geq \limsup_n \lVert a^n \rVert^{1/n}$. Every text I've encountered so far describe the same proof, maybe in a slightly different fashion but essentially the same. Are there any alternatives to these proofs? Preferably ones that use less complex analysis. I imagine this could be very hard, particularly for the second one. This because that formula is already very reminiscent of the root test for series, so it ""screams"" power series to me. But I would be very interested if there were any at all. Edit: I would also like to add my interest in proving only the convergence of $\lVert a^n \rVert^{1/n}$ without relying on the proof described here. So no proof that it's equal to the spectral radius, but simply a proof that it converges.","['functional-analysis', 'spectral-theory', 'operator-theory']"

2323216,Why do derivatives behave like fractions when they are not fractions but an operator as a whole?,The operator  $\frac{d}{dx}$ sometimes behaves like a fraction.For eg. when we use chain rule to write $\frac {d}{dy}=\frac {d}{dx}\frac {dx}{dy}$ it apparently seems the $dx$ cancel out to give the previous thing.Also when differentiating parametric functions we use $\frac {dy}{dx}=\frac {dy/dt}{dx/dt}$ it seems that the $dt$ cancel out as if they were fractions. I referred a few books but could not find any explanations (rather how the thing works).I will be great if someone explains this. Thanks for any help!!,['derivatives']
