99840,"Why is the hard Lefschetz theorem ""hard""?","Let $X$ be a compact Kähler manifold of complex dimension $\dim_{\mathbb C} = n$. Let $[\omega]$ be the cohomology class of a Kähler metric on $X$. Then powers of the class $[\omega]$ defines a linear morphism between cohomology groups $$ L^k :  H^{n-k}(X,\mathbb C) \longrightarrow H^{n+k}(X,\mathbb C) $$ which is simply given by cup product against the class $[\omega]^k$. The hard Lefschetz theorem says that this is in fact an isomorphism of vector spaces. Question: Why do we call this the ""hard"" Lefschetz theorem? Modern proofs of this theorem are not that involved; one picks a Kähler metric $\omega$ and proves the Kähler identities on $X$, and the rest then follows from the existence of primitive decompositions. Thus it seems a bit of hype to call the theorem ""hard"". One might think this is to distinguish this from another theorem of Lefschetz, often called the ""weak"" Lefschetz theorem, which gives a similar result in the case where $[\omega]$ is the Chern class of an ample line bundle. But then we'd surely call this the ""strong"" Lefschetz theorem, right?","['algebraic-geometry', 'math-history', 'complex-geometry', 'kahler-manifolds']"

99850,How can I solve the differential equation $y'+y^{2}=f(x)$?,"$$y'+y^{2}=f(x)$$ I know how to find  endless series solution via  endless integral or endless derivatives and power series solution if we know $f(x)$. I also know how to find general solution if we know one particular solution ($y_0$). I am looking for an exact analitic solution $y= L({f(x)})$ without knowing a particular solution,  if it exists. (Here $L$ defines an operator such as integral, derivative, radical, or any defined function.) If it does not exist, could you please prove why we cannot find it? Note: This equation is related to second order differantial linear equation. If we put $y=u'/u$, this equation will turn into $u''(x)-f(x).u(x)=0$. If we the find general solution of $y'+y^{2}=f(x)$, it means that $u''(x)-f(x).u(x)=0$ will be solved as well. As we know, many functions such as Bessel function or Hermite polinoms and so many special functions are related to Second order linear differential equations. Thank you for answers.

99863,Intersection of a Subgroup with an Abelian Subgroup is Normal in the Product,"Question: Let $A$ be an Abelian group with $A \trianglelefteq G$, and let $B \leq G$ be any subgroup. Show that $A \cap B \trianglelefteq AB$. [ref: this is exercise 20 on page 96 of [DF] := Dummit and Foote's Abstract Algebra , $3^{\text{rd}}$ edition] My attempt: Clearly, $AB$ is a subgroup of $G$ (because $B \leq G = N_G (A)$, so this is just corollary 15 on page 94 of [DF]). As $A \cap B$ is also a subgroup, we therefore already have $A \cap B \leq AB$, so we only need to show that $AB$ normalises $A \cap B$. Let $ab \in AB$. What is $(ab) A\cap B (ab)^{-1}$? Choosing any $g \in A \cap B$, we note that in particular $g \in A$, so
$$
ab gb^{-1} a^{-1} = aa'a^{-1} = a' \in A,
$$
since $A$ is Abelian. Now, I'm stuck: I would like to show that the same $ab gb^{-1} a^{-1}$ also lies in $B$ by taking into account that $g \in B$. This will then show that $(ab) A\cap B (ab)^{-1} \subset A \cap B$, and we are done.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'abelian-groups']"
99866,Is analytic capacity continuous from below?,"EDIT: I also asked this question on mathoverflow , since it might be too specialized for math.stackexchange.com. I've been wondering about the following, I don't know if anyone knows the answer : For a compact set $K$ in the complex plane, define the analytic capacity of $K$ by
$$\gamma(K) := \sup |f'(\infty)|$$
where the supremum is taken over all functions $f$ holomorphic and bounded by $1$ in the complement of $K$ : $f \in H^{\infty}(\mathbb{C}_{\infty} \setminus K)$, $\|f\|_{\infty} \leq 1$. Here
$$f'(\infty) = \lim_{z \rightarrow \infty} z(f(z)-f(\infty)).$$ A theorem due to Ahlfors states that for each compact $K$, there always exists a unique function $F$, called the Ahlfors function of $K$, such that $F \in H^{\infty}(\mathbb{C}_{\infty} \setminus K)$, $\|F\|_{\infty} \leq 1$, and $F'(\infty)=\gamma(K)$. It's not hard to show that $\gamma$ is continuous from above : if $(K_n)$ is a decreasing sequence of compact sets, then
$$\gamma(\cap_n K_n) = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \gamma(K_n).$$
This essentially follows from Montel's theorem and the fact that $\gamma(E) \subseteq \gamma(F)$ whenever $E \subseteq F$. My question is the following : Is analytic capacity continuous from below ? More precisely, if $(K_n)$ is a sequence of compact sets such that
$$K_1 \subseteq K_2 \subseteq K_3 \subseteq \dots$$
and such that $K:=\cup_n K_n$ is compact, then is it true that
$\gamma(K) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \gamma(K_n)?$ I could not find anything in the litterature. Thank you,

99875,Does this Condition on Exit Times imply $X_t$ is a Local Supermartingale?,"Let $(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ be a continuous (or càdlàg), real-valued process, and define stopping times $$\tau_{s,a,b}=\inf~ [s,\infty)\cap\{t:X_t\notin (a,b)\}.$$ We can interpret $\tau_{s,a,b}$ as the first time after time $s$ that the process hits $a$ or $b$. Suppose that for all $s,a,b$ we have: $$\mathbb{E}[X_{\tau_{s,a,b}}|\mathcal{F}_s]\leq X_s$$ Then is $X$ necessarily a local supermartingale? Context: At first I thought that perhaps $X$ was necessarily a supermartingale, but Nate pointed out that there are local supermartingales with this property. For example, $$ X_t = \begin{cases}
  W_{\min(\frac{t}{1-t},T)} &\text{for } 0 \le t < 1,\\
  1 &\text{for } 1 \le t < \infty,
 \end{cases}$$ where $(W_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is a Wiener process and $T=\inf\{t\geq 0:W_t=1\}$, seems to fit the bill. (The question was edited in response to Nate's comment.) I can solve the analogous problem in discrete time by induction, but don't know where to go from there, if indeed it's of any use.

99909,Which trigonometric identities involve trigonometric functions?,"Once upon a time, when Wikipedia was only three-and-a-half years old and most people didn't know what it was, the article titled functional equation gave the identity
$$
\sin^2\theta+\cos^2\theta = 1
$$
as an example of a functional equation.  In this edit in July 2004, my summary said ""I think the example recently put here is really lousy, because it's essentially just an algebraic equation in two variables.""  (Then some subsequent edits I did the same day brought the article to this state, and much further development of the article has happened since then.) The fact that it's really only an algebraic equation in two variables, $x^2+y^2=1$, makes it a lousy example of a functional equation.  It doesn't really involve $x$ and $y$ as functions of $\theta$, since any other parametrization of the circle would have satisfied the same equation.  In a sense, that explains why someone like Norman Wildberger can do all sorts of elaborate things with trigonometry without ever using trigonometric functions. But some trigonometric identities do involve trigonometric functions, e.g.
$$
\sin(\theta_1+\theta_2)=\sin\theta_1\cos\theta_2+\cos\theta_1\sin\theta_2
$$
$$
\sec(\theta_1+\cdots+\theta_n) = \frac{\sec\theta_1\cdots\sec\theta_n}{e_0-e_2+e_4-e_6+\cdots}
$$
where $e_k$ is the $k$th-degree elementary symmetric polynomial in $\tan\theta_1,\ldots,\tan\theta_n$.  These are good examples of satisfaction of functional equations. So at this point I wonder whether all trigonometric identities that do seem to depend on which parametrization of the circle is chosen involve adding or subtracting the arguments and no other operations.  In some cases the addition or subtraction is written as a condition on which the identity depends, e.g.
$$
\text{If }x+y+z=\pi\text{ then }\tan x+\tan y+\tan z = \tan x\tan y\tan z.
$$ QUESTION: Do all trigonometric identities that do involve trigonometric functions, in the sense that they are good examples of satisfaction of functional equations by trigonometric functions, get their non-triviality as such examples only from the addition or subtraction of arguments?  Or is there some other kind?  And if there is no other kind, can that be proved? Postscript: Wikipedia's list of trigonometic identities is more interesting reading than you might think.  It has not only the routine stuff that you learned in 10th grade, but also some exotic things that probably most mathematicians don't know about.  It was initially created in September 2001 by Axel Boldt, who was for more than a year the principal author of nearly all of Wikipedia's mathematics articles.","['trigonometry', 'functional-equations']"

99921,Determining where a function is complex differentiable,"I have a homework question, and I'm having a hard time interpreting it. Question: Where is the function $f(x+iy)=x^4y^5+ixy^3$ complex differentiable? Determine the derivative in such points. My first plan was to find a region for which the following theorem applied: Suppose $f=u+iv$ is a complex-valued function defined on an open set $\Omega$. If $u$ and $v$ are continuously differentiable and satisfy the Cauch-Riemann equations on $\Omega$, then $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$ and $f'(z)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}$. Of course, $u$ and $v$ are going to be continously differentiable; the only question is, on what region are the Cauchy-Riemann equations satisfied? So, I found that the Cauchy-Riemann equations in this case are the following: $4x^3y^5=3xy^2$ and $5x^4y^4=-y^3$ and the only point at which these equations are satisfied is $(0,0)$. There's a converse to this theorem, but a lone point is not a region, so I'm not sure if either of these theorems are relevant. Is the only way to go back and find at which points $lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(z_{0}+h)-f(z_{0})}{h}$ exists? Thanks.",['complex-analysis']

Because I'm specially interested in the definite integral of $\text{li}(a+ib)=\int_0^{a+ib}\frac{1}{\ln u}du$, I continue with $f(u)=\frac{1}{\ln u}$. I set $z=re^{i\phi}$ and get

For a fuller explanation, see this post. This problem is from assignment 6. The notes from this lecture can be found here . Use Proposition (2.6) to prove the Chinese Remainder Theorem : Let $m,n,a,b$ be integers, and assume that the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is 1. Then there is an integer $x$ such that $x\equiv a \pmod m$ and $x\equiv b \pmod n$ . Proposition (2.6): Let $a,b$ be integers, not both zero, and let $d$ be the positive integer which generates the subgroup $a\mathbb{Z}+b\mathbb{Z}$ .  Then a) $d$ can be written in the form $d=ar+bs$ for some integers $r$ and $s$ . b) $d$ divides $a$ and $b$ . c) If an integer $e$ divides $a$ and $b$ , it also divides $d$ . Since $x\equiv a \:(\mathrm{modulo}\:m)$ and $x\equiv b \:(\mathrm{modulo}\:n)$ , $x=a+km$ and $x=b+jn$ , for some $k,j\in\mathbb{Z}$ . So if $x$ exists $a+km=b+jn$ and $km-jn=b-a$ .  Since gcd $(m,n)=1$ , 1 generates the subgroup $m\mathbb{Z}+n\mathbb{Z}$ .  By Proposition (2.6), there are integers $r$ and $s$ such that $rm+sn=1$ .  Multiplying by $b-a$ we get $r(b-a)m+s(b-a)n=b-a.$ Then $k=r(b-a)$ and $j=-s(b-a)$ .  Therefore, $x=a+r(b-a)m$ is a solution to both congruences.

100001,Why aren't all real self-adjoint operators diagonal?,"I'm experiencing some confusion regarding self-adjoint operators.  As background for my question, I give the following 3 results (all from Linear Algebra, 3rd ed. by Friedberg, Insel, and Spence): Theorem 6.17: ""Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional real inner product space $V$.  Then $T$ is self-adjoint if and only if there exists an orthonormal basis $\beta$ consisting of eigenvectors of $T$."" Theorem 6.14 (Schur's Theorem): ""Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space $V$.  Suppose that the characteristic polynomial of $T$ splits.  Then there exists an orthonormal basis $\beta$ for $V$ such that the matrix $[T]_\beta$ is upper triangular."" Lemma: ""Let $T$ be a self-adjoint operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space $V$.  Then (a) Every eigenvalue of $T$ is real.  (b) Suppose that $V$ is a real inner product space.  Then the characteristic polynomial of $T$ splits."" From these results I want to say this: Let $T$ be a self-adjoint linear operator on a finite-dimensional real vector space $V$.  Then by the lemma, the characteristic polynomial splits, and by Schur's theorem there exists an orthonormal basis $\beta$ for $V$ so that $[T]_\beta$ is upper triangular.  Let $A=[T]_\beta$.  Then since $T$ is self-adjoint we have $A^*=[T]_\beta^*=[T^*]_\beta=[T]_\beta=A$ (this comes from the proof of Theorem 6.17) so that $A$ must be a diagonal matrix.  So this seems to imply that every self-adjoint linear operator on a finite-dimensional real vector space is diagonal, but this is not the case since the self-adjoint matrices clearly include any real symmetric matrix.

100055,proof of l'Hôpital's rule that minimizes special-casing,"A simple form of l'Hôpital's rule looks like this: If $u$ and $v$ are functions with $u(0)=0$ and $v(0)=0$, the derivatives $\dot{v}(0)$ and $\dot{v}(0)$ are defined,
and the derivative $\dot{v}(0)\ne 0$,
then
\begin{align*}
  \lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{u}{v} &= \frac{\dot{u}(0)}{\dot{v}(0)} \qquad .
\end{align*} To me, the clearest way to arrive at this result uses a little nonstandard analysis: Since $u(0)=0$, and the derivative $d u/d x$ is defined at $0$, $u(d x)=d u$ is infinitesimal, and likewise for $v$. By the definition
of the limit, the limit is the standard part of
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{u}{v} = \frac{d u}{d v} = \frac{d u/d x}{d v/d x} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where by assumption the numerator and denominator are both defined (and finite, because the derivative
is defined in terms of the standard part). The standard part of a quotient like $p/q$ equals the quotient of the
standard parts, provided that both $p$ and $q$ are finite (which we've established), and $q \ne 0$ (which is
true by assumption). But the standard part of $d u/d x$ is the definition of the derivative $\dot{u}$, and
likewise for  $d v/d x$, so this establishes the result. The generalizations to $x\rightarrow a$, where $a\ne 0$, and $x\rightarrow \infty$ are pretty trivial with the changes of variable $x\rightarrow x-a$ and $x\rightarrow 1/x$. But there are a bunch of other cases of l'Hôpital's that seem to me to involve toxic doses of case-splitting. There are cases where you have to differentiate more than once, and cases where the indeterminate form is $\infty/\infty$ rather than $0/0$. Is it possible to treat all of this in a unified way, possibly using ideas from projective geometry or inversions with respect to a circle in the complex plane?","['alternative-proof', 'calculus', 'limits']"

If $A \subseteq B$ and $B$ is a finitely generated $A$-module, then all $b \in B$ are integral over $A$. Proof: Let $\{c_1, ... , c_n\} \subseteq B$ be a set of generators for $B$ as an $A$-module, i.e $B = \sum_{i=1}^n Ac_i$. Let $b \in B$ and write $bc_i = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}c_j $ with $a_{ij} \in A$, which says that $(bI_n - (a_{ij}))c_j = 0 $ for $ 1 \leq j \leq n$. Then we must have that $\mathrm{det}(bI_n - (a_{ij})) = 0 $. This is a monic polynomial in $b$ of degree $n$. Why are we not done here? The proof goes on to say: Write $1 = \alpha_1 c_1 + ... + \alpha_n c_n$, with the $\alpha_i \in A$. Then $\mathrm{det}(bI_n - (a_{ij})) = \alpha_1 (\mathrm{det}...) c_1 + \alpha_2 (\mathrm{det}...) c_2 + ... + \alpha_n (\mathrm{det}...) c_n = 0$. Hence every $b \in B$ is integral over $A$.

100380,is a net stronger than a transfinite sequence for characterizing topology?,"For metric spaces, knowledge of the convergence of sequences determines the topology completely. A set is closed in the metric topology if and only if it is closed under the limit of convergent sequences operation. Put another way, a map between metric spaces is continuous if and only if it preserves limits of sequences. For general topological spaces, this result no longer holds. Spaces for which it does hold are called sequential spaces . Spaces are usually not sequential because they are not first countable. In such spaces, there are ""not enough"" numbers in the countable index set to extend into these very large spaces and reach every limit point. For example, if $\omega_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal, then $\omega_1+1$ is a topological space under the order topology, and $\omega_1$ is a limit point, but no sequence of ordinals reaches $\omega_1$. The topology of this space is not characterized by limits of sequences. This defect is usually fixed by replacing the notion of a sequence with the more general notion of a net, which is like a sequence but indexed by an arbitrary directed set, instead of the natural numbers. Since the net's index set is arbitrary, it can be of any cardinality and therefore nets can reach those faraway limit points in non first countable spaces, and the result is restored: a function between topological spaces is continuous iff it preserves limits of nets. A set is closed iff it is closed under limit of nets. But if the problem is that the cardinality of the space is too high for sequences to do the job, the most conservative generalization that suggests itself to me is to just increase the cardinality of the index set; the transfinite sequence, indexed by an arbitrary ordinal. So my question is: is this strong enough? Is it just a matter of convenience? Nets require less machinery, and are natural because e.g. the neighborhoods of a point constitute a net, whereas transfinites require a detour into unrelated areas of set theory. But nets are not totally ordered, and there may be times it would be nice to have a totally ordered index set for our sequence-like object. So can we say that a set in an arbitrary topological space is closed iff it's closed under taking limits of arbitrary convergent transfinite sequences? Is there a space with a set which is closed under limit of transfinite sequence, but not limit of net?","['general-topology', 'sequences-and-series', 'nets']"

Help in proving.,"I am studying the properties of a particular class of functions, and I'd appreciate some help in proving a property of that class. I started with a class of functions and made some modifications to show that it forms a vector space and to show that it is closed under convolution. I have given the entire description below, and require help in proving that the set is closed under the operation of convolution (circular). I have also mentioned what methods I have used to prove that it forms a vector space, so that i can get cleared of the difficulty i am facing in arriving at the result of closure under convolution. ( in case you want to avoid reading the entire post linearly, the property needs to be proved on the set $S_{pc}$ and it is described in the section ""closure under addition""). PS : Please do let me know if you want to know the motivation for such a study. I do not have any concrete reasons which can be expressed in mathematically precise terms, behind the motivation, but I have an intuition behind it. PS 2 : A construction method and proof of non-emptiness of this class of functions is given in this Q&A . Definition Let $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function, consider a point $x \in \mathbb{R}$ where $f$ is continuous, then the following two statements are equivalent. $Cf(x) = k$, where $k \in \{0\}\bigcup\mathbb{N}\bigcup\{\infty\}$. The function is continuous at $x$ and the maximum number of times $f$ is differentiable at $x$ is $k$. Clarification (Added) $Cf(x)=k$, where we know that $f$ is a function and $x$ is the point in its domain, then it means that the maximum number of times $f$ is differentiable at $x$ is $k$. This is not a good notation as someone could think that $Cf$ itself is one function different from f and not associated with it, but here I intended that $C$ tells about a proprty of the function at a point in its domain.....not a convincing notation......but i'd like know any ideas to make a good notation for it. Definition of a class of functions The set $S$ consists of functions $f \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{R}$, which satisfy the following properties. Given any $f \in S$ there exist a countable dense subset $D \subset (0,1)$ and maps $k,ck$ defined as $k \colon D \to \mathbb{N}$ and $ck \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{N}\bigcup\{\infty\}$ which satisfy the following properties. $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, the pre-image $k^{-1}(\{n\})$ is a finite set. $\forall x \in $D$, ck(x) \ge k(x)$ but finite and $\forall x \in (0,1)$\D$, ck(x) = \infty$. $\forall x \in (0,1), Cf(x) = ck(x)$ Whenever $Cf(x) = k$ is finite, for the $(k+1)^{nth}$ derivative of $f$ at $x$, the left and right limits exist and are not equal. (the left and right limits do not diverge). Let $S_p$ be the set of all functions $f_p$ which are periodic versions of the functions $f \in S$. The periodic version $f_p$ of the function $f \in S$ is defined as $f_p(x) = f(x) \forall x \in (0,1)$, $f_p(0) = f(0+)$ and $f_p(1) = f_p(0)$ and $ \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, f_p(x) = f_p(x+1)$. Closure property under addition EDIT : (This argument is false and the set $S_{pc}$ is not closed under addition) (see comment by Andrew) Let $f_1,f_2 \in S_p$ such that $f_1$ is not same as $-f_2$. I am able to prove that if $f_3 = f_1 + f_2$, then $f_3 \in S_p$, by making the following considerations. Let $D_1,k_1,ck_1$ be the required set and maps respectively for the function $f_1$ as per the definitions given above. Let $D_2,k_2,ck_2$ be the required set and maps of $f_2$. Let $D_3,k_3,ck_3$ be defined as below. $D_3 = D_1 \bigcup D_2$. Let $l_1 \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{N}\bigcup\{\infty\}$ and $l_2 \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{N}\bigcup\{\infty\}$ are defined as $l_1(x) = k_1(x)$ if $x \in D_1$ otherwise $\infty$.
$l_2(x) = k_2(x)$ if $x \in D_2$ otherwise $\infty$. $k_3(x)$ is assigned as $k_3(x) = \min\{l_1(x),l_2(x)\}$ and Let $m_1 \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{N}\bigcup\{\infty\}$ and $m_2 \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{N}\bigcup\{\infty\}$ are defined as $m_1(x) = ck_1(x)$ if $x \in D_1$ otherwise $\infty$.
$m_2(x) = ck_2(x)$ if $x \in D_2$ otherwise $\infty$. $ck_3(x)$ is assigned as $ck_3(x) = \min\{m_1(x),m_2(x)\}$. By assigning $D_3,k_3,ck_3$ as mentioned above I am able to prove that $f_3 \in S_p$. To get the closure property under addition, we can add the set of all constant functions $K$ to the set $S_p$ to form a new set $S_{pc}$. Hence I am able to prove that the set $S_{pc}$ as defined above is closed under the addition operation (and it easily follows that the set $S_{pc}$ is closed under the multiplication operation as well). There by I am able to show that the set $S_{pc}$ is indeed a vector space. (as it cab be easily seen that the set $S_{pc}$ is closed under scalar multiplication). The Question Where I need some help is to show that the set $S_{pc}$ is closed under the binary operation of circular convolution. Here by circular convolution, i mean the convolution operation with the convolution integral summed only over one period i.e., on $[0,1]$. Specifically How should i make the choice of $D_3,k_3,ck_3$, the required set and maps for the resultant function of a convolution, to show that it belongs to $S_{pc}$. What I know Let $f_1$ is periodic with period $1$ and is smooth (within one period) except at $x = a_1 \in [0,1]$, where it is only $n_1$ times differentiable and Let $f_2$ is periodic with period $1$ and is smooth (within one period) except at $x = a_2 \in [0,1]$, where it is only $n_2$ times differentiable. Now the function $f_3 = f_1 \star f_2$ is smooth (within one period) except at $x = a_1 - a_2$ where it is only $n_1 + n_2$ times differentiable. But I am confused as to how to use this fact to arrive at the desired result.","['vector-spaces', 'real-analysis', 'convolution']"

$ but How do I get eigenvectors and eigenvalues from $USV^T$, I was reading that $S$ are the eigenvalues but like the sign must be changed... also
the $U$ gives the eigenvectors but there is an issue with the sign, is there a rule to get the correct sign?","['matrices', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"

100791,How to efficiently estimate quantile function of Gamma distribution,"I have an application that analyzes datasets comprised mostly of samples from a Gamma distribution. Mixed in with the data are an unknown number ($>= 0$) of outlier samples (which are actually taken from a scaled noncentral chi-squared distribution with unknown centrality parameter) that are significantly larger in magnitude than the samples from the Gamma distribution. I would like to locate these values with as high of a detection probability as possible, under the constraint that the probability of falsely choosing one of the Gamma-distributed samples as an outlier is bounded by a specified probability $P_{f}$ (where $P_f$ is on the order of $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-12}$ or so). The shape parameter $k$ of the Gamma distribution is known. I've developed the following method of approaching the problem: Fit a Gamma distribution to the data using a method that attempts to be robust to outliers: Since the shape parameter is known, I just need the scale parameter $\theta$ in order to describe the distribution. The mode of the distribution is equal to $(k-1)\theta$, so estimating the distribution's mode will provide a way to estimate $\theta$. I'm using the half-sample range method to estimate the distribution's mode (i.e. the PDF's peak). Given the mode estimate $m$, estimate the scale paramter as $\tilde \theta = \frac{m}{k-1}$. Given the desired false-detection probability $P_f$, calculate the threshold $x$ where $F_x(x) = 1 - P_f$, where $F_x(x)$ is the CDF of the fitted Gamma distribution. Declare all values in the sample greater than $x$ as outliers. I'm looking for a computationally efficient way to estimate the appropriate threshold $x$. This is intended for a real-time processing application, and the method of directly inverting the Gamma distribution's CDF requires me to perform root-finding on special functions that are relatively expensive to compute. If there is a more efficient way to estimate (even approximately) the desired threshold in terms of the distribution parameters, that would help a lot.","['statistics', 'gamma-function', 'probability-distributions', 'estimation']"
100794,number of table with $1$ and $-1$,How many $m\times n$ tables are there if they are subject to the following two conditions? In each cell of the table we have $1$ or $-1$. The product of all the cells in any given row and the product of all cells in any given column equals $-1$.

100799,units of a ring of integers,"I am currently studying algebraic number theory and I have discovered recently Dirichlet's unit theorem. Since some things are quite too abstract for me, I try to understand it with some examples. I have considered the polynomial $P(X)=X^3-4X^2-4X-1$. It has 1 real root (call it $r$) and 2 conjugate complex roots, so the set of unity is cyclic. I thought that it was generated by r, and I was quite surprised to see that $1+2r$ is another unit. After some computations I have found that actually the generator of the group of unity is $1+\frac{2}{r}$, which is the square of $r$. So, I wonder whether there exists some conditions for a cubic polynomial $P$ with 1 real root and 2 complex conjugates roots such that the real root is a generator of the group of unity (in my example the ""nice"" polynomial is $X^3-2X^2-1$).

y & = 2|x + 2|, \quad \text{where }x = -3\\

100815,Does the Hirsch conjecture hold for $n < 2d$?,"The Hirsch conjecture states that the graph (i.e. $1$-skeleton) of a $d$-dimensional polytope with $n$ facets has diameter at most $n - d$. It was known for a long time that it sufficed to prove it for $n \ge 2d$ --- indeed, if $n < 2d$ then every pair of vertices shares a common facet, and iterating if necessary, one eventually ends up with a case where $N = 2D$.  (See Ziegler's book Lectures on Polytopes, p. 84). Now it is known that the Hirsch conjecture fails in general, but
  does it hold for $n < 2d$?  So far I haven't been able to think of a
  simple proof, and actually I don't even know if it's true.  The counterexample due to Santos has $d=43$ and $n=86$.","['linear-programming', 'combinatorics']"
100818,Does every continuous map from $\mathbb{H}P^{2n+1}$ to itself have a fixed point?,"This question is motivated by Fixed point property of Cayley plane and idle curiosity. In the link, it is shown that every continuous map from the Cayley plane to itself has a fixed point and the argument (with easy modification) applies equally well to $\mathbb{R}P^{2n}$, $\mathbb{C}P^{2n}$ and $\mathbb{H}P^{2n}$. The leaves open the case of $\mathbb{R}P^{2n+1}$, $\mathbb{C}P^{2n+1}$, and $\mathbb{H}P^{2n+1}$. In the case $\mathbb{R}P^{2n+1}$, this space covers many the lens spaces, so in particular (via the Deck group), admits many fixed point free self maps (diffeomorphisms, in fact). In the case $\mathbb{C}P^{2n+1}$, the Lefschetz theorem shows that any continuous map without fixed points must act as $-1$ in $H^2$, and indeed, there is a such a map $(\mathbb{C}P^{2n+1}$ double covers a nonorientable manifold).  So again, there is a diffeomorphism with no fixed points. This leaves open the case of $\mathbb{H}P^{2n+1}$.  The same argument as in the previous case shows that $f$ must act as $-1$ in $H^4$.  This certainly can be achieved when $n=0$.  In this case, $\mathbb{H}P^1 = S^4$ and the antipodal map is a diffeomorphism which acts without fixed points. However, for $n > 0$, there is no such diffeomorphism.  This comes from the fact that the first Pontrjagin class is a diffeomorphism invariant and is a nonzero multiple of the generator of $H^4(\mathbb{H}P^{2n+1})$.  This implies that any diffeomorphism must act as $+1$ on $H^4$.  I think Novikov's result on the rational invariance of Pontrjagin classes under homeomorphisms gives us the same result for homeomorphisms. Thus, if there is a map $f:\mathbb{H}P^{2n+1}\rightarrow \mathbb{H}P^{2n+1}$ without fixed points, it cannot be a homeomorphism.  Hence my question: Is there a continuous function $f:\mathbb{H}P^{2n+1}\rightarrow \mathbb{H}P^{2n+1}$ without fixed points when $n > 0$?  Is there an example where $f$ is a homotopy equivalence?","['general-topology', 'fixed-point-theorems', 'algebraic-topology']"
