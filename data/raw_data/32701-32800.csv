310292,Negative Binomial Question Without Exact Values,"The question I am working on is: Three brothers and their wives decide to have children until each family has two female children. What is the pmf $X=$ the total number of of male children born to the brothers?
  What is E(X), and how does it compare to the expected
  number of male children born to each brother? So, the probability that we have x amount of failures preceding the final birth, which will be the birth of the 6th girl, is $P(X=x) = nb(x;6,p(S)) = {{x+6-1}\choose{6-1}} \cdot[p(S)]^6 \cdot [p(F)]^x$ And the expected value would be $E(X)= \frac{6 \cdot p(F)}{p(S)}$ I know that this make be an incredulous claim, but I can't figure out why the answer to the very last question is 6. I know 6 represents the total number of girls among the three families, two per family, but what does the ratio of $\frac{p(F)}{p(S)}$ portray?

310397,Profinite and p-adic interpolation of Fibonacci numbers,"On the topic of profinite integers $\hat{\bf Z}$ and Fibonacci numbers $F_n$, Lenstra says ( here & here ) For each proﬁnite integer $s$, one can in a natural way deﬁne the $s$th Fibonacci number
  $F_s$, which is itself a proﬁnite integer. Namely, given $s$, one can choose a sequence of positive integers $n_1, n_2, n_3,\dots$ that have more and more initial digits in common with $s$, so that it may be said that $n_i$ converges to $s$ for $i\to\infty$. Then also the numbers $F_{n_1}, F_{n_2}, F_{n_3},\dots$ get more and more initial digits in common, and we deﬁne $F_s$ to be their ""limit"" as $i\to\infty$. This does not depend on the choice of the sequence of numbers $n_i$. Now, $\hat{\bf Z}\cong\prod_p{\bf Z}_p$ is a direct product of rings of $p$-adic integers , which has FToA and CRT sort of hardcoded into it (via decompositions of the underlying inverse systems ). If a sequence of profinite integers $(x_p)$ converges, then in particular each coordinate converges (note I am using the direct product notation for profinite integers, rather than the factorial number system Lenstra uses). This would indicate that the Fibonacci numbers are $p$-adically interpolable. However, in $p$-adic Interpolation of the Fibonacci Sequence via Hypergeometric Functions , We say that a sequence $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ of rational numbers is $p$-adically interpolatable if there exists a continuous function $f:{\bf Z}_p\to{\bf Q}_p$ such that $f(n)=a_n$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. Since the set of nonnegative integers is dense in ${\bf Z}_p$, for a given sequence $\{a_n\}$ there can be at most one such function, which will only exist under certain strong conditions on $\{a_n\}$. Specifically, an integer sequence is $p$-adically interpolatable if and only if it is purely periodic modulo $p^M$ for all positive integers $M$, with each period a power of $p$. While $\{F_n\}$ is purely periodic modulo $p$ for every prime $p$, its period modulo $p$ is never a power of $p$, which means that the Fibonacci sequence itself can never be $p$-adically interpolated. This says pretty much the opposite. Evidently there are holes in my understanding. Any ideas?","['p-adic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'interpolation', 'fibonacci-numbers']"

From what I can tell, the likelihood function is defined as $f(x_1;\alpha,\beta)*...*f(x_1;\alpha,\beta)$. If i'm not mistaking, $f(x_1;\alpha,\beta)$ should be the same as the pdf for the gamma distribution (although not a pdf, on account of x being a fixed value here?), so would the likelihood function in this case be ${(\text{pdf-of-}\Gamma)}^n$?

$$ \epsilon <||x_k-x||=|\lambda^*_k(x_k-x)| $$
for a functional provided by Hahn-Banach theorem with norm 1. From that and the separabilty we conclude that there is a further subsequence such that $\lambda_{k_l}^*\to \lambda^*$ weakly-* . Since each subsequence of $x_k$ also converges weakly to $x$ we use the ""weakly-*"" assumption to receive a contradiction since for the previous subsequence
$$|\lambda^*_{k_l}(x_{k_l}-x)|=|\lambda^*_{k_l}(x_{k_l})-\lambda^*_{k_l}(x)|\to 0$$ Somehow this seems to easy and I feel like I'm not using especially the weak convergence in the right way.","['weak-convergence', 'convergence-divergence', 'functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

310621,"Definition of a filtration on a ring, module, algebra","In most books, a graded ring/module/algebra means either a $\mathbb{N}$- or $\mathbb{Z}$-graded ring/module/algebra. But often, different gradings appear: doubly graded (spectral sequences) = $\mathbb{N}^2$- or $\mathbb{Z}^2$-graded; multigraded = $\mathbb{N}^n$- or $\mathbb{Z}^n$-graded; superalgebra = $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded; etc. It is desirable to have a definition which is general enough, and still retains most properties of usually graded objects. One such definition (I think) is the following: Let $G$ be any monoid, written additively, though commutativity of $G$ is not assumed. A $G$-graded ring is a ring $R$ together with a chosen direct sum decomposition into additive subgroups $R\!=\!\bigoplus_{i\in G}\!R_i$, such that the ring multiplication satisfies $R_iR_j\!\subseteq\!R_{i+j}$. A $G$-graded $R$-module is an $R$-module $M$ that has a direct sum decomposition into $R$-submodules $M\!=\!\bigoplus_{i\in G}\!M_i$. A $G$-graded $R$-algebra is an $R$-algebra $A$ that has a direct sum decomposition into $R$-submodules $A\!=\!\bigoplus_{i\in G}\!A_i$ such that $A_iA_j\!\subseteq\!A_{i+j}$. In the case when $R$ is a $G$-graded ring, there are more general definitions of $G$-graded modules and algebras. Question 1: Do these definitions apply only to commutative rings/algebras? Are gradings used in noncommutative algebra? I wish to have a general enough definition of a filtration on a ring/module/algebra as well: index set not necessarily $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$; preferably the definition for rings/modules/algebras are compatible when a
ring $R$ is viewed as a $R$-module and a $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra; preferrably it is defined for noncommutative rings and algebras as well. Most books define a filtration as a sequence. There are some generalizations: In Grillet's Abstract Algebra , p. 462: In Pete Clark's Commutative Algebra notes, p.50: In Stacks Project , 10. Homological Algebra, 13. Filtrations: Question 2: What is the right definition of a filtration of a ring/module/algebra in regard to 1,2,3? If $R$ is noncommutative, do we need to take left or two-sided ideals to obtain a filtration? Does the index set need to be totally ordered, or a monoid, or a group, or a directed set? I realise the answer is probably going to be ""depends what you want to do with a filtration"", and since I don't yet know what is or can be done with filtrations, or even what their main use is, I'll just say that my motivation comes from Algebraic Topology, Homological Algebra, and Commutative Algebra. I would simply like to have a definition, general enough so that I am not confused when I take 10 different books and each has a bit different definition of a filtration.","['noncommutative-algebra', 'algebraic-topology', 'abstract-algebra', 'homological-algebra', 'commutative-algebra']"

$$dx = 2\sec^2\theta d\theta$$
$$\int{ \frac {5x + 1}{x^2 + 4}dx} = \frac{1}{4}\int{\frac{10\tan\theta + 1}{\sec^2\theta} 2\sec^2\theta \,d\theta}$$

$$ = 5 \ln|\sec\theta| + \frac{\theta}{2} + C$$
We know $\theta = \displaystyle\arctan\left(\frac x2\right)$ and since $\tan\theta = \displaystyle\frac{x}{2}$, we can draw a triangle to see that $\sec\theta = \displaystyle\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 4}}{2}$. $$5 \ln|\sec\theta| + \frac{\theta}{2} = 5\ln\left({\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 4}}{2}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\arctan\left({\frac x2}\right) $$

I know that this isn't an algebraic-like function, so we can't evaluate it as one; but, by using the definition of absolute value, we can rewrite it as one. The function $f(x)$, without the absolute value signs, can take on both positive and negative values; so, in order to retain the strictly positive output that the absolute value function demands, we have to put a negative sign in front of the algebraic definiton of our absolute vaue function on the interval where the values yield a negative value, so we'll get a double negative -(-), resulting in the positve we want. This is how far I've gotten so far. From what i've been taught, in order to find the intervals where the function is positive and where it is negative, you have to find the values that make the function zero, and create test intervals from those values. For instance, the zeros of the function above are $x = -4$ and $x = 1$; our test intervals are then $(- \infty, -4)$, $(-4, 1)$, and $(1, \infty)$ My question is, why does finding the zeros of the function guarantee that we will find those precise test intervals?","['absolute-value', 'calculus', 'algebra-precalculus']"

311630,Evaluate $\int_{0}^{\pi/4}x\ln^{2}(\sin(x))dx$,"Here is a some what challenging log sine integral. $$I=\int_{0}^{\pi/4}x\ln^{2}(\sin(x))dx$$ The upper limit of integration is $\frac{\pi}{4}$ instead of the usual $\frac{\pi}{2}$ . I tried the famous identity $\displaystyle\ln(\sin(x))=-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(2kx)}{k}-\ln(2)$ But, the log is squared and I do not think Parseval is applicable here. But, I may be wrong.  By Parseval, I mean $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(kx)\cos(nx)}{kn}$ . I have tried other means.  I made the sub $t=\sin(x)$ . This led to $\displaystyle\int_{0}^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}\frac{\sin^{-1}(t)\ln^{2}(t)}{\sqrt{1-t^{2}}}dt$ Now, I thought perhaps the famous sum $\displaystyle\frac{\sin^{-1}(t)}{\sqrt{1-t^{2}}}=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(2t)^{2k-1}}{k\binom{2k}{k}}$ could be used. So, I integrated and got the form $$I=\frac{\ln^{2}(2)}{16}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(k!)^{2}2^{k}}{k^{2}(2k)!}+\frac{\ln(2)}{8}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(k!)^{2}2^{k}}{k^{3}(2k)!}+\frac{1}{8}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(k!)^{2}2^{k}}{k^{4}(2k)!}$$ These sums actually evaluate to the correct integral result, so it would appear they are equivalent to said integral. But evaluating them may be even more daunting. Though the first one from the left evaluates to $\frac{{\pi}^{2}}{8}$ and the center one evaluates to $$\frac{\ln(2)}{8}\left(\pi G-\frac{35}{16}\zeta(3)+\frac{{\pi}^{2}}{8}\ln(2)\right)\;.$$ This center one looks to be related to the integral: $\displaystyle8\ln(2)\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\ln(\sin(x))dx=\frac{35}{16}\ln(2)\zeta(3)-\pi\ln(2)G-\frac{{\pi}^{2}\ln^{2}(2)}{4}$ , which I got by expanding the square of the log sine and integrating. This just leaves the sum to the right.  It is tougher and I can find no closed form. Alas, If I could evaluate it then I think the integral would be solved. I also thought...how about a closed form of some sort for $$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}x\sin^{a}(x)dx$$ that could be differentiated w.r.t 'a' and applied?. I do not know of a closed form for 
this, though. I got an encouraging looking solution by expanding, making the sub $t=x/2$ , then solving for the integral on the far right (which is the integral in question): $\displaystyle  \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}x\ln^{2}(2\sin(x/2))dx$ $=\displaystyle \ln^{2}(2)\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}xdx+8\ln(2)\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}x\ln(\sin(x))dx+\color{red}4\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}x\ln^{2}(\sin(x))dx$ But, it did not check numerically. ( Error has now been fixed. - Editor ) Numerically, the integral in question should evaluate to $I = 0.263605....$ Then again, I may just have a computation error in all of that. So, does anyone know of a method for evaluating this log-sine integral?. EDIT:  Here is what Mathematica gave for the solution.  It may be too involved to be worth the effort. $\displaystyle I=\frac{37{\pi}^{4}}{92160}-\frac{\pi}{4}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(\pi k/4)}{2^{k/2}k^{3}}$ $\displaystyle +\frac{\pi}{8}\ln(2)G+\frac{25}{768}{\pi}^{2}\ln^{2}(2)+\frac{\ln^{4}(2)}{384}+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(\pi k/4)}{2^{k/2}k^{4}}-\frac{35}{128}\ln(2)\zeta(3)$ . Sometimes with these math engines the solution can be simplified down. But, maybe not in this case.

311650,What is the name of this property of a function,"I'm trying to find the right vocab word to describe a concept: In computational geometry, there's a concept of a polygon ""monotone"" with respect to a line.  Which means that the polygon intersects the line and all lines parallel to it in at most two places.  I want to find the equivalent concept for real valued functions.  That is, I want a property that describes a function that intersects a given line and lines parallel to it (in this case I'm interested in lines of the form $f(x) = c$, for all values of $c$, ie: horizontal lines) in at most two places. The obvious analog, monotone functions, isn't what I want at all, since it limits the first derivative to always have the same sign, and even allows it to go flat for a bit. The most sophisticated example I can think of: $\sin(x)$ over the interval $[0, 2\pi)$.  If the interval was increased at all in either direction, there'd exist a horizontal line that intersects the function in 3 places.  But if it's limited to just $[0, 2\pi)$, $\sin(x)$ only ever crosses any given horizontal line twice or less.  From this example, there doesn't seem to be any rules you can impose on the first or second (or higher) derivatives, which was my initial thought. Motivation: I'm thinking it's possible to decompose an oscillating (but not necessarily periodic) function in to chunks like this to help numerical root finders.  eg: $f(x)=\sin(x)+c$ (for all $c$) evaluated over all possible intervals exactly $2 \pi$ wide will have this property.  So if you break $\sin(x)+c$ in to $2\pi$ sized chunks, you know each chunk has at most two roots.  Smaller intervals (no matter how small) can still have up to two roots, so $2\pi$ is the largest interval that still guarantees this property.","['calculus', 'functions']"
311654,The resemblance between Mordell's theorem and Dirichlet's unit theorem,"The first one states that if $E/\mathbf Q$ is an elliptic curve, then $E(\mathbf Q)$ is a finitely generated abelian group. If $K/\mathbf Q$ is a number field, Dirichlet's theorem says (among other things) that the group of units $\mathcal O_K^\times$ is finitely generated. The proof of Mordell's theorem and the proof of Dirichlet's theorem are somewhat similar (a covolume calculation in one case, and what feels to me like bounding a covolume in the other). How can these two objects be realized as instances of the same construction?  Could it be done so well as to reduce the proof of Mordell-Weil and Dirichlet's theorems to a single proof? In the correspondence between the class number formula and the conjectured formula for the leading term of $L(E/\mathbf Q, s)$ , it appears that $\mathcal O_K^\times$ really does play the role of $E(\mathbf Q)$ (regulator corresponds to regulator, torsion to torsion). From my understanding, the general belief is that these two objets are analogous. But I'm having a hard time putting them on the same footing. In fact, there is a generalization of the Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture to any abelian variety over $\mathbf Q$, but in this case the conjectured leading term of the $L$-function is symmetric in $A$ and $\breve{A}$ (where $\breve{A}$ is the dual abelian variety). This conjecture degenerates to the BSD conjecture in the case of an elliptic curve, which is self-dual. But $\mathcal O^\times$ isn't an abelian variety. At best, $\mathcal O_K^\times$ can be thought as the $\mathcal O_K$-valued points of the group scheme $\mathbf G_m = \text{Spec }(\mathbf Z[x,y]/(xy-1))$. But: (1), $\mathbf G_m$ isn't an abelian variety over any field, and (2), we are looking at its points in the ring of integers of a number field, rather than in a field. So, why should we expect it to be the same as $E(\mathbf Q)$? Or, perhaps $E(\mathbf Q)$ and $\mathcal O_K^\times$ the wrong objects to be trying to compare?","['elliptic-curves', 'arithmetic-geometry', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

311701,Singularities at infinity,"I'm a little confused on the concept of singularities at infinity.
For example, take the function $f(z) = 1/z$.
This has a removable singularity at infinity, since $f(1/z) = z$
is analytic at zero. However, the residue of $f(z)$ at infinity is by definition
$$\text{Res } 1/z^2 f(z) = -1.$$
which is nonzero. This seems bizarre; for removable singularities in the regular complex plane
have residue equal to zero. If we intuitively think of the definition of a residue to mean
the coefficient of $z^{-1}$, then it also appears that we have a 'pole' of order at least one at infinity, despite the fact that it vanishes at infinity. Again, this is in contrast to points in the plane where functions always blow up at poles. I think this shows that Cauchy's integral theorem fails at infinity, so a function
analytic in a neighborhood of infinity does not necessarily have a zero contour integral over a curve enclosing infinity. What other pathologies do singularities at infinity exhibit?

311710,"Why is weak convergence of measures called ""weak""?","From Wikipedia In mathematics and statistics, weak convergence (also known as narrow convergence or weak-* convergence, which is a more appropriate name from the point of view of functional analysis, but less frequently used) is one of many types of convergence relating to the convergence of measures. It depends on a topology on the underlying space and thus is not a purely measure theoretic notion. There are several equivalent definitions of weak convergence of a sequence of measures, some of which are (apparently) more general than others. The equivalence of these conditions is sometimes known as the portmanteau theorem . Definition. Let $S$ be a metric space with its Borel σ-algebra $Σ$. We say that a sequence of probability measures $P_n$ on $(S, Σ), n = 1, 2, ...,$ converges weakly to the probability measure $P$, if any of the following equivalent conditions is true (here $E_n$ denotes expectation with respect to $P_n$ while $E$ denotes expectation with respect to $P$): $E_nf → Ef$ for all bounded, continuous functions $f$; $E_nf → Ef$ for all bounded and Lipschitz functions $f$; $\limsup E_nf ≤ Ef$ for every upper semi-continuous function $f$ bounded from above; $\liminf E_nf ≥ Ef$ for every lower semi-continuous function $f$ bounded from below; $\limsup P_n(C) ≤ P(C)$ for all closed sets $C$ of space $S$; $\liminf P_n(U) ≥ P(U)$ for all open sets $U$ of space $S$; $\lim P_n(A) = P(A)$ for all continuity sets $A$ of measure $P$. Did explained why the convergence mode is called weak* : In the page you quote, Wikipedia defines weak convergence of (probability) measures. This mode of convergence should be called weak* rather than weak because it refers to the convergence against any bounded continuous functions, and the space $M_1$ of probability measures is included in the dual of the space $C_b$ of bounded continuous functions. That is, $(\mu_n)$ in $M_1$ converges to $\mu$ in $M_1$ if and only if $\int f\mathrm d\mu_n\to\int f\mathrm d\mu$ for every $f$ in $C_b$ and this is a weak* convergence because $M_1\subset(C_b)^*$. Now I wonder why this convergence mode is called weak? Can ""weak"" be explained from the point of view of functional analysis, or is it explained from some other point of view?

Given $f\colon X\to Y$ such that $f_n(x_n)\to f(x)$ whenever a real sequence $x_n\to x$. Must $\{f_n\}$ converge uniformly? According to Canez's hint , it's true that $f_n\to f$ pointwise and $f$ is continuous (modifying my ugly answer , replace $+1/N_k$ with $+0$) even if $X$ is an arbitrary metric space (without assuming that $X$ is connected or complete). If it's too abstract, we can consider a concrete one, such as $X=Y=\mathbb R$ or $X=Y=\mathbb C$. Explanations If $X$ is compact, it's true that $f_n\to f$ uniformly. Prove by contradiction. Suppose $\exists\epsilon_0>0,\forall N,\exists n\ge N$ such that
$$\sup_{x\in X}d_Y(f_n(x),f(x))>\epsilon_0$$ We can choose a increasing sequence $\{m_k\}\subset\mathbb N$, and a sequence $\{x_{m_k}\}\subset X$, such that $d_Y(f_{m_k}(x_{m_k}),f(x_{m_k}))>\epsilon_0$ for all $k$. Since $X$ is compact, there's a subsequence $\{n_k\}$ of $\{m_k\}$ such that $x_{n_k}\to x$ for some $x\in X$, then we can show that $f_{n_k}(x_{n_k})\to f(x)$ by constructing a sequence with duplicated $x_{n_k}$'s, just like this . On the other hand, since $f$ is continuous, we have $f(x_{n_k})\to f(x)$ contradicting to $d_Y(f_n(x),f(x))>\epsilon_0$. In contrary to the preceding statement, if $X$ isn't connected (or at least, with finite connected components), even if $X$ is complete, $f_n\to f$ needn't be uniform, such as $X=\mathbb Z$.

311789,differential geometry about neither local isometry nor conformal map,"hi I need help in geometry I try to get the the idea but I couldn't solve so. It becomes great if someone try solve with explain to me by using figures if possible. I see this question change a lot of geometry experts and thank you for trying to solve.
the question (Lambert’s cylindrical projection) Project the unit sphere (except for the north and south poles) radially outward to the cylinder of radius $1$ by sending $(x,y,z)$ to $(x/\sqrt{(x^2+y^2)},y/\sqrt{(x^2+y^2)},z)$ Check that this map preserves area, but is neither a local isometry nor conformal. Hint: Let $x(u,v)$ be the spherical coordinates parametrization of the sphere, and consider $x^*(u,v)=(cos(v),sin(v),cos(u)$ } Thank you very much

311801,A multiple integral question II,"We know from the previous post that 
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\underbrace{\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \cdots \int_0^1}_{n \text{ times}}\frac{1}{(x_1\cdot x_2\cdots x_n)^2+1} \mathrm{d}x_1\cdot\mathrm{d}x_2\cdots\mathrm{d}x_n=1$$ and now I wonder what is $f(n)$ such that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}f(n)\left(1-\underbrace{\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \cdots \int_0^1}_{n \text{ times}}\frac{1}{(x_1\cdot x_2\cdots x_n)^2+1} \mathrm{d}x_1\cdot\mathrm{d}x_2\cdots\mathrm{d}x_n\right)$$

311875,Find out whether a matrix is a distance matrix or not,"I have a $5 \times 5$ symmetric matrix $A$ with zeroes on the diagonal and I am supposed to find whether there exist 5 points in $\mathbb R^4$ such that $A$ is the distance matrix. How can I solve this formally? I am guessing I have to use a Gram matrix but I don't know what to do after that... Here is the matrix:  $$A= \begin{pmatrix}
0 &1 &2 &2 &2\sqrt 2\\
1& 0 &\sqrt5 &\sqrt5 &3 \\
2 &\sqrt5 &0 &2\sqrt2 &2\\
2 &\sqrt5 & 2\sqrt2 &0 &2\sqrt3\\
2\sqrt2 & 3 &2 &2\sqrt3 &0

0& \sqrt5 &  \sqrt5 &  \sqrt5 & \sqrt5 \\
 \sqrt5 & 0&  2\sqrt5 &  2\sqrt2 & 2\\

311897,Completion as a functor between topological rings,"In the following all rings are assumed to be commutative and unitary. Preliminaries: For any topological ring $R$ we can form its completion $\widehat{R}$ by taking all Cauchy sequences modulo null sequences. This is again a ring and we can consider completion as a functor $\textbf{RingTop} \to \textbf{Ring}$. If $R$ is even a linear topological ring - i.e. it admits a fundamental system of neighborhoods of 0 consisting of ideals, say $R \supseteq I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq \dots$ - then $\widehat{R}$ carries a canonical linear topology given by $\widehat{R} \supseteq \widehat{I_1} \supseteq \widehat{I_2} \supseteq \dots$ which turns completion into a functor $\textbf{LRingTop} \to \textbf{LRingTop}$ between linear topological rings. Question: Is it possible to spare linearity and turn completion into a functor $\textbf{RingTop} \to \textbf{RingTop}$ in a canonical way which covers the above considerations and additionally has $\widehat{\mathbb{Q}} \cong \mathbb{R}$ as special case? If not: is there a counterexample which illustrates the difficulties in defining a canonical topology on $\widehat{R}$ which turns completion into a functor in the non-linear case?

311916,Can a non-zero vector have zero image under every linear functional?,"Let $X$ be an infinite-dimensional vector space, and let $x_0$ be an element of $X$ such that $f(x_0)=0$ for every linear functional $f$ defined on $X$. Then can we prove that $x_0$ is the zero vector in $X$? Or, is it possible to find a non-zero $x_0$ whose image under every linear functional is zero? In the case of $X$ being finite-dimensional, we can prove that if $f(x_0)=0$ for every linear functional $f$ on $X$, then $x_0$ must be the zero vector.
