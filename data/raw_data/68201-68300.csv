818578,Is the global section ring of a Noetherian Scheme Noetherian as well?,"As the title suggests, I am asked to prove that, given a Noetherian scheme $(X,\ \mathcal{O}_{X})$ and any open subset $U\subseteq X$ , $\Gamma(U,\ \mathcal{O}_{X}):=\mathcal{O}_{X}(U)$ is a Noetherian ring. Up to now, I have been able to show that the result is true if $U$ is an affine open subset of $X$ , i.e. $U\simeq\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ for some ring $A$ (and this is actually true when $X$ is just locally Noetherian). I have also shown that, given $U$ as above, $(U, \mathcal{O}_{X\vert U})$ is a Noetherian scheme as well, which should then allow me to reduce the problem to the case $U=X$ . So, when all is said and done, I should try to prove that the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X}(X)$ is Noetherian. However, I can not go any further and I am stuck here. Any help or suggestion would be grately appreciated. Thank you.","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'noetherian']"

818624,Center of the categories $\mathbf{Grp}$ and $\mathbf{Ab}$.,"This is Exercise II.5.8 from Mac Lane, Categories for the Working Mathematician . For the identity functor $I_C$ of any category, the natural transformations $\alpha:I_C\dot{\to}I_C$ form a commutative monoid. Find this monoid in the cases $C=\mathbf{Grp}$, $\mathbf{Ab}$ and $\mathbf{Set}$. I found out that this monoid is called the center of the category $C$, and I'm going to call is $Z(C)$. My  problem was to find a nice characterization of the centers of $\mathbf{Grp}$ and $\mathbf{Ab}$. Here's my work so far: Notice that $\alpha:I_C\dot{\to} I_C$ is natural iff $\alpha_c$ commutes with every arrows $f:c\to c$ for every $c$ (in other words, iff $\alpha_c$ is in the center of the monoid $\hom_C(c,c)$). In symbols:
$$Z(C)=\left\{\alpha:I_C\dot{\to}I_C \mid \forall c\in C, \forall f\in\hom_C(c,c), \alpha_c f=f\alpha_c\right\}\qquad (*)$$
This implies directly that the center of $\mathbf{Set}$ is trivial (that is, it contains only the unit natural transformation). However, this will not work in $\mathbf{Grp}$ and $\mathbf{Ab}$, since the monoid of endomorphisms of $\mathbb{Z}$ is commutative. However, not every two endomorphisms of arbitrary groups commute: Let $G=F_2$, the free group with two generators $a$ and $b$. Let $f,g:F_2\to F_2$ be morphisms such that $f(a)=f(b)=ab$, $g(a)=g(b)=a$. Then $fg(a)=f(a)=ab$, and $gf(a)=g(ab)=a^2$. That said, the best description of $Z(C)$, for $C=\mathbf{Grp}$ or $\mathbf{Ab}$, I can give at the moment is ($*$) as above. What would be better descriptions of $Z(\mathbf{Grp})$ and $Z(\mathbf{Ab})$?

818637,Groups of isometries,"I recently read the popular scientific book ""Symmetry and the Monster"" and it emphasizes groups as the sets of symmetries of geometrical objects. So I was wondering, do all groups appear as symmetry groups of geometrical objects? I think the question can be formalized like this: Let $M$ be a metric space and let $S\subseteq M$. The set of all isometries $f$ in $M$ with $f(S)=S$ form a group $G_S$ with composition. Let $G(M) = \{G_S : S \subseteq M \}$. This raises many questions, all up to isomorphism, here are some of them: Do all (finite) groups appear as some $G_S$? If $M=\mathbb{R}^d$ with Euclidean metric, what groups appear in $G(M)$? For $d \in \mathbb{N}$, is there always a group $G$ such that $G \in G(\mathbb{R}^d)$ but $G \notin G(\mathbb{R}^{d-1})$?

818832,Matrices A+B=AB implies A commutes with B,"$A$ and $B$ are $n\times n$ matrices and $A+B=AB$. I have an interesting proof that this implies $A$ commutes with $B$, but the proof only works when $||B|| \lt 1$. I'm looking for a way to salvage the proof so that it works for all $B$. $$A=AB-B$$
$$A=(A-I)B$$
by repeatedly substituting $A$ with $(A-I)B$ on the RHS, $$A= (A-I)B^N - \sum_{i=1} ^{N-1} B^i$$ Since the space of $n\times n$ matrices is Banach (hence complete) under the standard operator norm, the limit $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}B^i$ is well defined given $||B|| \lt 1$. Hence, taking the limit as $N \rightarrow \infty$, $$A =  -\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}B^i$$ Now the LHS commutes with B, hence so does the RHS. Is there some trick to extend the method to work with any $B$ where $||B|| \geq 1$?

818882,Is my solution correct? subgroups and quotients of solvable groups are solvable,"I want to solve the following exercise from Dummit & Foote's Abstract Algebra: Prove that subgroups and quotient groups of solvable groups are solvable My attempt: Let $G$ be a solvable group with a chain $1=G_0 \triangleleft G_1 \triangleleft \dots \triangleleft G_s=G$ such that all factors $G_i/G_{i-1}$ are abelian. Let $H \leq G$ be a subgroup. We claim that the chain $1=H_0 \leq H_1 \leq \dots \leq H_s=H$ where $H_i=G_i \cap H$ does the trick. Firstly we prove that $H_i \triangleleft H_{i+1}$ for all $i$. Let $x \in H_{i+1}=G_{i+1} \cap H$. Since $x \in H$ we have $x H x^{-1}=H$. Since $x \in G_{i+1} \triangleright G_i$ we have $xG_i x^{-1}=G_i$. Combining these gives $x(H \cap G_i) x^{-1}=H \cap G_i$, as required. Next, we prove that the quotients $H_{i+1}/H_i=(G_{i+1} \cap H)/(G_i \cap H)$ are abelian. Let $x,y \in G_{i+1} \cap H$. We would like to prove that $xy (G_i \cap H)=yx (G_i \cap H)$. Observe that using the fact the cosets of $G_i$ in $G_{i+1}$ can be interchanged, we find \begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&xy (G_i \cap H)=(xy G_i) \cap (xy H)=(x G_i) (y G_i) \cap H=(y G_i)(x G_i) \cap (yx H)\\
&=(yx G_i) \cap (yx H)=yx (G_i \cap H).
\end{split}
\end{equation} Let $N \trianglelefteq G$ be a normal subgroup, and let $G/N$ be the corresponding quotient group. We suggest the following normal chain: \begin{equation}
1=G_0/ N  \triangleleft G_1/  N \triangleleft \dots \triangleleft G_s/ N =G/N.
\end{equation} We first prove that $G_i/N \triangleleft G_{i+1}/N$: Let $gN \in G_{i+1}/N,aN \in G_i/N$. We have $(gN)(aN)(gN)^{-1}=(gag^{-1})N$. Since $G_i \trianglelefteq G_{i+1}$ the element $gag^{-1} \in G_i$, which gives $(gN)(G_i/N)(gN)^{-1} \in G_i/N$ for all $gN \in G_{i+1}/N$. The quotients (or factors) are \begin{equation}
(G_{i+1}/N) \big/ (G_i/N),
\end{equation}
and we wish to prove they are abelian. Indeed, let $g_1N(G_iN),g_2 N(G_iN) \in (G_{i+1}/N) \big/ (G_i N)$ (i.e. $g_1,g_2 \in G_{i+1}$). These two arbitrary elements commute iff \begin{equation}
[g_2Ng_1N]^{-1}[g_1Ng_2N] \in G_i/N
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to the condition $g_1^{-1}g_2^{-1}g_1g_2 \in G_i$. Since we have that the quotient $G_{i+1}/G_i$ is abelian we know that $(g_1G_i)(g_2G_i)=(g_2G_i)(g_1 G_i)$ which gives precisely this condition. We conclude that quotient groups of solvable groups are solvable. Is my solution correct? If not, please help me fix it. Thanks!","['group-theory', 'proof-verification']"
818885,Relationship between radii in Riemannian manifolds,"S.T. Yau raised an (somewhat) interesting question in a lecture today, which I thought I would ask for thoughts on from the good people here. The context is as follows: Consider a 3-manifold $M$ with boundary and $\sigma$ be a loop that bounds a disk in $M$ . Then we define the radius $\text{Rad}(M)$ of $M$ as: $$ \text{Rad}(M):=\sup_{\sigma}\inf\big\{\epsilon>0 \ \big| \ [\sigma]=0\in\pi_1(T_{\epsilon}(\sigma)) \big\}, $$ where $T_{\epsilon}(\sigma)$ is the $\epsilon$ -tubular neighborhood around $\sigma$ . It turns out that this is useful for estimating the first eigenvalue of an operator important in GR: Thm: (See Prop. 1, Schoen-Yau (1983) ) Suppose $M$ is a Riemannian 3-manifold and $\Omega\subset M$ is a bounded domain. Then the first eigenvalue of $-\nabla+\tfrac{R}{2}$ satisfies: $$ \lambda_1\leq \frac{2}{3\pi\cdot\text{Rad}^2(\Omega)}. $$ At any rate, Yau remarked that one could, of course, generalize this definition by replacing loops with higher-dimensional spheres: We define the $i$ -radius $\text{Rad}_i(M)$ of $M$ as: $$ \text{Rad}_i(M):=\sup_{\sigma}\inf\big\{\epsilon>0 \ \big| \ [\sigma]=0\in\pi_i(T_{\epsilon}(\sigma)) \big\}, $$ Then the question is: $\fbox{$\textbf{Q: What relationship, if any, is there between the various } \text{Rad}_i(M)?$}$ Thoughts? Anything jump out as even likely to be true? Note: Of course one could also increase the dimension of $M$ - the only reason for focusing on 3-manifolds here is because, well, they tend to be more relevant for people doing GR, and many of the results Yau was discussing during this lecture depended on certain maps being conformal, which was only the case (generally speaking) in this context. Note 2: It seems to me that if we focus on a map $\sigma:S^{i+1}\rightarrow M$ that is an isometry , and we consider the collection of $\sigma':S^i\rightarrow M$ (again focusing on isometries) sitting inside of (the image of) $\sigma$ , then the $\sup$ over such $\sigma'$ will be obtained by the $\sigma'$ that are great circles. In that case, the $\inf\{\epsilon\}$ will be the same for both $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ … and so it seems like $\text{Rad}_{i+1}(M)=\text{Rad}_i(M)$ (and an inductive argument would yield that all the $i$ -radii agree)… but for general $\sigma:S^{k+1}\rightarrow M$ (that might be ""lumpier"") it isn't so clear… hmm…","['soft-question', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'differential-geometry']"

818987,value of the integral $\int_0^{2\pi} \log|1-ae^{i \theta}| $,This is a problem from Complex Analysis by Stein and  Shakarchi. We have to find the the value of  $\int_0^{2\pi}  \log|1-ae^{i \theta}| $ when $|a|<1$. So I tried to solve it in this manner. I first made the substitution $e^{i\theta}=z$.   Then the integral becomes $\int_\gamma  \frac{\log|1-az|}{iz} $. Then we observe that $\int_0^{2\pi}  \log|1-ae^{i \theta}| $ is the real part of the integral $\int_0^{2\pi}  \log(1-ae^{i \theta}) $. So we will evaluate $\int_\gamma  \frac{\log(1-az)}{iz} $. But this function has a removable singularity at $z=0$.So the integral of this function is zero since it is holomorphic. So its real part is also zero. Is my reasoning right?If not can someone please point out what is wrong. Thanks,"['self-learning', 'complex-analysis']"

However, I am used to working either over splitting fields or in characteristic zero. Question. Let $G$ be a finite group and $k$ a field of characteristic $p>0$.  The quotient $kG/rad(kG)$ decomposes as a direct product of matrix rings over division algebras, finite dimensional over $k$.  What can be said about these division algebras? If $D$ is one of these division algebras, is it true that $p$ does not divide the dimension of $D$ over its center? I sort of convinced myself that in fact these division algebras must be fields in characteristic $p$ (and hence what I want is true), but since I couldn't find this stated anywhere, I suspect there is a flaw in my logic.  Anyway, here is my ""proof"". Please let me know where it goes astray. Let $F_p$ be the field with $p$ elements.  Then $F_pG/rad(F_pG)$ is a separable algebra because $F_p$ is perfect. Claim. $kG/rad(KG)\cong k\otimes_{F_p}(F_pG/rad(F_pG))$. Pf.   Note that $k\otimes_{F_p}(F_pG/rad(F_pG))=  kG/(k\otimes_{F_p}rad(F_pG))$.  But since $F_pG/rad(F_pG)$ is separable, we have that $k\otimes_{F_p}(F_pG/rad(F_pG))$ is semisimple.  As $k\otimes_{F_p}rad(F_pG)$ is a nilpotent ideal, we conclude that it is $rad(kG)$. Since finite division rings are fields and $F_p$ is perfect, we have that $F_pG/rad(F_pG)\cong \prod_{i=1}^m M_{n_i}(L_i)$ where the $L_i$ are finite separable extensions of $F_p$.  Thus by the claim $kG/rad(kG) = k\otimes_{F_p}(F_pG/rad(F_pG))=\prod_{i=1}^m M_{n_i}(k\otimes_{F_p}L_i)$.  But since the $L_i$ are finite separable extensions, each $k\otimes_{F_p}L_i$ is a finite product of separable extensions of $k$. I guess if there is a mistake here, it is in the claim.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'representation-theory', 'group-rings']"

On the other hand $B_E=\{f\in E^*; \|f\|\leq 1\}$
is compact in the weak* topology, which means in particular, sequentially compact. ADDENDUM: compactness implies sequential compactness Let X be a compact set and $(x_n)$ a infinite sequence(infinite distinct terms), suppose the opposite i.e that $(x_n)$ does not have a accumulation point. Then for each $x\in X$ there is a neigh. $U_x$ of $x$ but containing only a finite number of elements of $\{x_n\}$. The family $\{U_x\}$ cover $X$, by passing to a finite subcover $\{U_1,\ldots,U_n\}$ we conclude that the set of the terms of $(x_n)$ must be finite.

819572,Why choosing Linear Regression?,"First I would like to say that I am not a statistician nor am I good in the field. I have been collecting data for over a period of e.g 100 days and each day has a varying amount of data that I can collect.

Now, I wanted to see how based on all the data I have up till now, what can I expect tomorrow? Excel provides some (click and produce) trend options like exponential, linear regression, etc. So, although I don't fully understand how they work, I used the linear regression trend.

Now, I've been able to calculate the Riemann tensor of the $g'$ metric in terms of the other one, getting to this result: $$R'{_{abc}}^d=R{_{abc}}^d+2C{_{c[a}}^d\nabla_{b]}+2\nabla_{[a}C{_{b]c}}^d+2C{_{c[a}}^eC{_{b]e}}^d$$ Where $R{_{abc}}^d$ are the components of the Riemann tensor in the $g$ metric.

And $C{_{abc}}^d$ is the components of the difference tensor of both cov. derivatives. Now, obviously, the terms that go like $C\nabla$ must vanish because it wouldn't be a linear operator.

(This is early in the book, and I believe he's referring to the maximal ideals as traditional points.) As he says, this is because the prime ideals of a quotient $A/I$ are in natural bijection with the primes of $A$ containing $I$. I can see partially why this is true. If a maximal ideal $(x_1-a_1,\dotsc,x_n-a_n)$ contains $(f_1,\dotsc,f_r)$, then for each $i$, we can write $f_i=g_{i1}(x_1-a_1)+\dotsb g_{in}(x_n-a_n)$ so that indeed, $f_i(a_1,\dotsc,a_n)=0$ for all $i$. However, I'm not immediately seeing why the converse is true. That is, how does $f_i$ vanishing at $(a_1,\dotsc,a_n)$ for all $i$ give us that  $(x_1-a_1,\dotsc,x_n-a_n) \supset (f_1,\dotsc,f_r)$?

But then we have that $(f_1,\dotsc,f_r)$ vanishes at both $(a_1,\dotsc,a_n)$ and $(b_1,\dotsc,b_n)$. What allows us to conclude that $a_i=b_i$ for all $i$?",['algebraic-geometry']

820117,"Limit of ratio between a power series and a ""subset"" of the power series","$B$ is an infinite power series that converges everywhere, and $A$ is an infinite power series that converges everywhere which is composed only of terms found in $B$ - both have nonnegative real coefficients and are series in a single, nonnegative real variable, $x$, thus both are strictly increasing in $x$. Are there conditions on $A$ or $B$ which determine that $A/B$ has a limit, (i.e. it doesn't oscillate) as $x \to \infty$? It certainly doesn't diverge because $B\ge A$. For my problem, I have a strong feeling, based on some heuristic reasoning and based on strong evidence from a graph, that $A/B$ converges to some limit, but I am having the darnest time proving it. Any help greatly appreciated! EDIT: The actual series' I have in mind are: $$ B = e^x = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^i}{i!} $$ and, for fixed $n\in\mathbb{Z^+}$ $$ A = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{jn}}{(jn)!} $$ In other words, $A$ is composed of every $n$th term of $e^x$, starting with the $0$th term.","['power-series', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"
820129,How to show that this equation involving partial derivatives is true? (Change of variables),"Let $z$ be a function of $u$ and $v$ where $u=x+y$ and $v=3x-3y$. I have previously shown, by the Chain Rule, that $$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}= \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial u}\right)^2 - 9 \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial v}\right)^2.$$ Now, ""assuming equality of mixed second-order partial derivatives"", I must show that
$$\frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial y^2} = 2\frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial u^2} + 18\frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial v^2}.$$ Firstly, I don't understand what is meant by ""equality of mixed second-order partial derivatives"". Please could somebody explain this? I think I must use the Chain Rule again to get this equation but I don't really understand how to do this. I just need a pointer to get me started. Thanks.","['multivariable-calculus', 'partial-derivative']"
820135,Prove that p has m distinct roots if and only if p and p' have no roots in common,"Problem: Suppose $p \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{C})$ has degree $m$. Prove that $p$ has $m$ distinct roots if and only if $p$ and its derivative $p'$ have no roots in common. My proof so far:
If $m=0$, then $p(z)=a_0\neq 0$ and $p$ has no roots. Then $p'(z)=0$ and has no roots. If $m=1$, then $p(z)=a_0+a_1z$ with $a_1 \neq 0$ so $p$ has 
exactly one root, namely $-a_0/a_1$ and $p'(z)=a_1$ and has no roots. In both cases, $p$ and $p'$ have no roots in common. Now suppose $m > 1$. We use induction on $m$, assuming that for every polynomial $r$ with $m-1$ distinct roots, $r$ and $r'$ have no roots in common. Let 
$p$ be a polynomial of degree $m$ with distinct roots. There exists $q$ such that
\begin{align*}
p(z)=(z-\lambda)q(z)
\end{align*}
for all $z \in \mathbf{F}$. Since q has $m-1$ distinct roots, $q$ and $q'$ have no roots in common. By the chain rule, 
\begin{align*}
p'(z)=(z-\lambda)q'(z)+q(z)
\end{align*}
We know that $\lambda$ is not a root of $p'$ since $p'(\lambda)=(\lambda-\lambda)q'(z)+q(\lambda)=0+q(\lambda)\neq 0$ as lambda is not a root of $q$. All
other roots of $p$ are roots of $q$. For these roots $\lambda_q$, $p'(\lambda_q)=(\lambda-\lambda_q)q'(\lambda_q)+q(\lambda_q)=(\lambda-\lambda_q)q'(\lambda_q) + 0 \neq 0$. Now suppose $m > 1$. We use induction on $m$, this time assuming that for every polynomial $r$ of degree $m-1$ such that $r$ and $r'$ have no roots in common, $r$ has
$m-1$ distinct roots. I'm stuck here, since I don't know how to how to manipulate the derivatives. I'm not sure if proof by induction is the best approach here as well and I'd appreciate your help!","['linear-algebra', 'polynomials']"
820159,Infinitely generated subgroup of a finitely one (weird),"I'm solving this question in Hungerford's book: 8​. Let $G$ be the multiplicative group generated by the real matrices $a=\begin{pmatrix}2&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}$ and $b=\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\0&1\end{pmatrix}$. If $H$ is the set of all matrices in $G$ whose (main) diagonal entries are $1$, then $H$ is a subgroup that is not finitely generated. I've already proved that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ and every element of $H$ is of the form: $$
        \begin{pmatrix}
         1 & x \\
        0 & 1 \\
        \end{pmatrix}
$$ I thought this question really weird, $H$ is a subgroup of a group generated by $a$ and $b$ but $H$ itself can't be generated by $a$ or $b$, how can be possible? My question is how to show $H$ is infinitely generated? I didn't find any good candidates to generate $H$. Thanks in advance","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
