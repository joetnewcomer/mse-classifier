2072204,"Operator topologies on $L^{\infty}(X,\mu )$","Let $(X,\mu )$ be a measure space.  Then, $L^2(X):=L^2(X,\mu )$ is a Hilbert space in the usual way and we may view $L^{\infty}(X):=L^{\infty}(X,\mu )$ as a subalgebra of bounded operators on $L^2(X)$ via $L^{\infty}(X)\ni f\mapsto M_f$, where $M_f\colon L^2(X)\rightarrow L^2(X)$ is the multiplication operator defined by $[M_f(g)](x):=f(x)g(x)$. Regarding $L^{\infty}(X)$ as an algebra of bounded operators in this way, the question can be stated as How can we describe explicitly convergence in the various operator topologies on $L^{\infty}(X)$? At least one is relatively easy.  For example, $\lambda \mapsto M_{f_{\lambda}}$ converges to $M_f$ in the operator norm topology iff $\lambda \mapsto f_{\lambda}$ converges to $f$ in the $L^{\infty}$ norm.  It seems that convergence in measure corresponds to ultra-weak convergence .  Furthermore, pointwise almost-everywhere convergence can't correspond to any topology .  These are perhaps the three most obvious notions of convergence in $L^{\infty}(X)$, but that leaves many operator topologies unaccounted for.  Perhaps most of them just don't have a very nice description? Update #1 :  It seems as if the weak operator topology corresponds to the weak-$^*$ topology:  $\lambda \mapsto f_{\lambda}\in L^{\infty}(X)$ converges to $f\in L^{\infty}(X)$ in the weak-$^*$ topology iff $\lambda \mapsto \int _Xgf_{\lambda}$ converges to $\int _Xgf$ for all $g\in L^1(X)$, and on the other hand, $\lambda \mapsto M_{f_{\lambda}}$ converges to $M_f$ in the weak operator topology iff $\lambda \mapsto \int _Xgf_{\lambda}h$ converges to $\int  _Xgfh$ for all $g,h\in L^2(X)$.  As $gh\in L^1(X)$ for $g,h\in L^2(X)$, we obtain the $(\Rightarrow )$ direction immediately.  For the $(\Leftarrow )$ write $g=u|g|$ for some Borel function $u$ with $|u|=1$, so that we have $\lambda \mapsto \int _Xgf_{\lambda}=\int _X(u|g|^{1/2})f_{\lambda}|g|^{1/2}$ converges to $\int _X(u|g|^{1/2})f|g|^{1/2}=\int _Xgf$.

(a) Find the distribution of $X$. Solution. Define an r.v. $I_{p}$. $$\begin{align}

2072486,Continuous extension of Euclidean spaces?,"I am wondering if it is possible to ""continuously"" increase the dimension of Euclidean spaces — in other words, would it be possible to define Euclidean spaces of non-integer dimensions with nice topological properties? I have thought about the way to generalize Euclidean space with nonnegative real dimension, and here are some axioms that I have set. A sequence $\mathcal{R}$ of generalized topological spaces is given by the following data and properties: For each nonnegative real $d \geqslant 0$, there corresponds a topological space $\mathcal{R}(d)$. If $d \geqslant 0$ is an integer, then $\mathcal{R}(d)$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^d$. If $d, e \geqslant 0$ satisfies $d \neq e$, then $\mathcal{R}(d)$ and $\mathcal{R}(e)$ are not homeomorphic to each other. For each pair of nonnegative reals $d \geqslant e \geqslant 0$, there corresponds an embedding (i.e. a continuous injection) $\rho_{ed} : \mathcal{R}(e) \rightarrow \mathcal{R}(d)$. If $d \geqslant 0$, then $\rho_{dd}$ is an identity function on $\mathcal{R}(D)$. If $d \geqslant e \geqslant f \geqslant 0$, then $\rho_{ed} \circ \rho_{fe} = \rho_{fd}$. Sequences of generalized Euclidean spaces, however, might not be set-theoretically unique, so we can define isomorphisms between such sequences. Two sequences $\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\mathcal{R}_2$ of generalized Euclidean spaces are said to isomorphic if: There exists a proper mapping $\varphi : \mathbb{R}_{\geqslant 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geqslant 0}$. For all $d \geqslant 0$, $\mathcal{R}_1(d)$ and $\mathcal{R}_2(\varphi(d))$ are homeomorphic to each other.

2072688,Is indefinite integration largely a heuristic or it can be mechanical too?,"I am sorry for putting multiple questions in the same post, but I think providing answers here will be better. As far as I know, there is no 'product formula' for integrals, like we have for the derivative. Also, I can be wrong, but I think a general class of functions, differing by a constant, have the same derivative. So, ignoring the constant, one might think that such a product formula might exist. So, my first question: Can it be proved that there is no 'product formula' for integrals, or
  is it just that it has not been discovered yet? Let us reduce our case to just rational functions. Partial fractions for integration is a pretty good technique, but I think it can't be used for all rational functions, because not all polynomials have all real roots. So: Is there a technique/algorithm to integrate all rational functions? Another open-ended question, that I think of, is that are there any techniques/formulas for integrals not discovered yet, or are the existence of these techniques/formulas been proven false by some theorem? Answer to any question is suffice. EDIT FROM HERE After reading some of the answers, I felt I need to be more precise. The integration by parts formula, as far as I know, is again a heuristic, and not mechanical. So, there is no scope for integration by parts theorem to be such a product formula. Another user answered that I thought of a formula combining functions in an elementary way, and proposed that it is well known that the sinc function does not have a closed form integral, and so such a formula doesn't exist. But, to add to this, there is also a possibility that such a formula may produce an undefined result, or some weird result, which we can relate to the absence of such a closed-form solution. What I am looking for is a theorem or result which clearly proves the non-existence of such a formula, taking into account all possibilities.","['integration', 'soft-question', 'calculus']"
2072693,"Matrix function converges, how about the eigenvalues?","Suppose I have a matrix function $A(t)$ with $$\lVert A(t) - B\rVert \le ct^\alpha$$ in some matrix norm (this will work for any norm, I guess). So, in a sense $A(t)\rightarrow B$ for $t\rightarrow 0$ in $\mathcal{O}(t^\alpha)$. Plus, we have $A(0) = B$. I happen to know the eigenvalues of $B$, but I don't know a thing about the eigenvalues of $A(t)$. Plus, $A(t)$ does not have any favorable structure, in particular, no symmetry. So, what can you say about the eigenvalues of $A(t)$? In particular: What about the spectral radius of $\lambda_{A(t)}$? Does it converge to the spectral radius of $B$? Do we have $\lambda_{A(t)}\rightarrow\lambda_B$ for $t\rightarrow 0$ for all eigenvalues $\lambda_{A(t)}$ of $A(t)$? And finally: is the speed of convergence $\mathcal{O}(t^\alpha)$ the same for the eigenvalues/spectral radius as for the matrix function? The last question is actually the most important one. If the eigenvalues of $B$ are all zero, the eigenvalues as well as the spectral radius of $A(t)$ would go to zero as $\mathcal{O}(t^\alpha)$... Any help would be appreciated, incl. references to (standard?) textbooks or papers on this matter. Maybe there is a counterexample? So far, in all numerical examples I have seen/done, all properties above do hold. Edit : To provide a bit more background: The matrices $A(t)$ are iteration matrices which depend on a time-step size $t$. They are not this  ugly, but showing convergence of this iteration has proven to be rather difficult. In the simplest case, they look like
$$A(t) = (I-tQ_1)^{-1}(t(Q_2-Q_1)+B)$$
with identity matrix $I$ and some matrices $Q_1,Q_2$, which do not have any particular structure we were able to exploit so far.
Now, if I can make that conclusion about the spectral radius as described above, I can state that the spectral radius is smaller than 1, i.e. the iteration converges, if the time-step size $t$ is small enough. Edit: Does this answer help? Also, this question might be related to perturbation theory for eigenvalue problems (with non-symmetric matrices, though, and $B$ is not diagonalizable).","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'matrices', 'perturbation-theory', 'convergence-divergence', 'linear-algebra']"
2072706,Matrix determinant lemma derivation,"While reading this wikipedia article on the determinant lemma, I stumbled upon this expression (in a proof section):

\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{I}+\mathbf{uv}^\mathrm{T} & \mathbf{u} \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{I} & 0 \\ -\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T} & 1 \end{pmatrix} =

\end{equation} Although I see that this equation ""works"", I'm interested in HOW this thing was invented. For example, why we have $u$ term in a central block matrix of the left side? UPD A little clarification of the question above. Let
\begin{equation}L = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{I} & 0 \\ \mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T} & 1 \end{pmatrix} \end{equation} I see that
\begin{equation}
L^{-1}=
\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{I} & 0 \\ -\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T} & 1 \end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation} and hence the first equation looks like 
\begin{equation}
L\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{I + uv^T} & \mathbf{u} \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}L^{-1} = 
\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{I} & \mathbf{u} \\ 0 & 1 + \mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{u} \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation} I see that $\det(L) = \det(L^{-1}) = 1 $. Hence determinants of RHS and LHS are equal as well. What I do not understand is how we jumped from simple $\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{I + uv^T} & \mathbf{0} \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$ or $\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{I} & \mathbf{u} \\ \mathbf{-v}^T & 1\end{pmatrix}$ to $\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{I + uv^T} & \mathbf{u} \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$ for a central part of LHS.

Now let $\mathcal{F} = \{T_{\alpha}\}$ be the family of topologies on $X$ such that $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{T_{\alpha}}$. Put $\mathcal{D} = \bigcap_{\alpha} \mathcal{T_{\alpha}}$, where $\mathcal{T_{\alpha}} \in \{\mathcal{T_{\alpha}}\}$. By a well known theorem $\mathcal{D}$ is a topology on $X$ (this can be easily proven but I've left it out here to keep the proof as short as possible) , and since $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{T_{\alpha}}$ for every $\mathcal{T_{\alpha}} \in \{\mathcal{T_{\alpha}} \}$,we have $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{D}$. But that is as far as I've got before getting stuck. To show that $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{D}$, I can do one of two things Show that $\mathcal{T} \subset \mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathcal{T}$, and thus that $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{D}$, by showing that each $U \in \mathcal{T} = U \in \mathcal{D}$ Show that $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ both have the same basis $\mathcal{A}$ and thus must be the same topology as every basis generates a unique topology. But in either case I'm not sure how to proceed. For 2, I could assume that $\mathcal{D}$ has some underlying basis $\mathcal{O} \neq \mathcal{A}$, and then  attempt to arrive at some contradiction, but I don't see how I would reach a contradiction here. For 1, I can show that $U \in \mathcal{T}$ can be expressed as the union of basis elements, but for $U \in \mathcal{D}$ all I know is that $U \in \mathcal{T_{\alpha}}$ for every $\alpha$, and that for one $\alpha$ we have $\mathcal{T_{\alpha}} = \mathcal{T}$.

My answer seems too easy to be correct, and I am suspicious that the Monotone and/or Dominated convergence theorems don't make an appearance in my solution.

It seems that the three cases are then $-1<\alpha<0$, $\alpha=-1$, and $\alpha<-1$.

Consider the usual equation of the GBM:

\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu x \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 x \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 0

In order to find the characteristic function, we have to take into account the terminal condition

f(x,T) = \exp(i \omega x)

Substituting $f(x,T)$ inside the PDE yields
$$
\mu x i \omega \exp(i \omega x) - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 x \omega^2 \exp(i \omega x)=0

2073120,Natural line bundle over $\mathbb{P}^n$,"What follows is from the book ""Mirror Symmetry"" by Hori et. al. From the definition of $\mathbb{P}^n$ we see there is a natural line bundle over $\mathbb{P}^n$ whose fiber over a point $l$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ is the line it represents in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. Define $J ⊂ \mathbb{P}^n  \times \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ to be $\{(l,v) : v \in l \}$. $J$ is called the “tautological line bundle.” Suppose we have coordinates $X_k$ on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ with which to describe the point $v$. Then $X_k$ is a linear map from the fiber $J_l$ to $\mathbb{C}$. In other words, $X_k$ is a section of $\text{Hom}(J, \mathbb{C})$, the line bundle dual to $J$. Let us call this $H$. Note that the equation $X_k = 0$ makes sense on $\mathbb{P}^n$, and its solution defines a hyperplane (hence the “$H$”). So here is my confusion : First of all in a local neighbourhood $U \in \mathbb{P}^n$ the bundle should look as $U \times \mathbb{C}^{*}$, since it is a line bundle the rank of the fiber should be $1$ and not $n+1$. Is this correct? Then the line bundle $J$ should look for some trivialisation $i$ as $J = U_i \times \mathbb{C}^{*}$. Is there some mistake in the first two lines of the quoted text? According to the text the tautological line bundle is the one given by $J ⊂ \mathbb{P}^n  \times \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ to be $\{(l,v) : v \in l \}$. Another thing is that the tautological line bundle $\mathcal{O}(-1)$ has sections which are inverses of polynomials of degree $1$. How does one see this from the definition given above? For example if $\{ x_i \}$ are coordinates in $\mathbb{P}^n$ for $i=0,\ldots,n$ then $1/x_i$ is a section and of course when multiplying with a section of the dual bundle gives back a c-number. Therefore, I conclude that their $X_k$ is a coordinate on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ as they say and as a section of the tautological bundle it is just $1/X_k$. Is this a correct way to think about it at least for projective spaces (and their blow ups possibly?) A follow up : Sections of the hyperplane bundle $\mathcal{O}(1)$ at $U_i$ look like $X_i$.

2073264,"Do directional derivatives require direction vectors to have unit length? If so, why?","I have just started studying directional derivative from the book Mathematical Analysis by T.M. Apostol. The directional derivative is the generalization of partial derivative. The partial derivative represents the rate of change of a function due to small change of one of the independent variables involved, whereas the directional derivative represents the rate of change of the function due to the small change of a point in it's domain along any arbitrary direction. The concept of directional derivative is as follows : Let $\mathbf{f} : S \longrightarrow \mathbb R^{m}$ be a vector valued function defined over $S \subset \mathbb R^{n}$ . Suppose we are to find out the rate of change of $\mathbf{f}$ when we move from a point $\mathbf{c}$ of $S$ to a nearby point $\mathbf{c} + \mathbf{u}$ along a line segment. Since each point of the line can be taken as $\mathbf{c} + h\mathbf{u}$ for some $h \in \mathbb R$ , we can take $h$ sufficiently small so that $\mathbf{c} + h\mathbf{u}$ is in $S$ . Then the quantity $$\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac {\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{c} + h\mathbf{u}) - \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{c})} {h}$$ if it exists is called the directional derivative of $\mathbf{f}$ at $\mathbf{c} \in S$ in the direction of $\mathbf{u}$ . I am having some difficulty here. According to my teacher's lecture notes, $||\mathbf{u}|| = 1$ . For this reason the directional derivative of a given function $\mathbf{f}$ at a point along some certain direction may differ. Is there any significance of considering $||\mathbf{u}|| = 1$ ? If the answer to my question is affirmative, then why?","['multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives']"

Some thoughts: suppose that $X$ is a counterexample to this statement, clearly it can contain at most a single isolated point and no intervals, so $X$ is totally disconnected. If $X$ contains no isolated points it can't be closed (or better perfect) because it'll either be homeomorphic to the Cantor set if it's also compact or $X\cap[a,b]$ will be homeomorphic to the Cantor set for some closed interval such that the intersection isn't empty.

  $$ ||f ||_p = \Big \{ \int |f|^p \, d \mu \Big \} ^{1/p}. $$ Proof: Let $(f_n)$ be a Cauchy sequence relative to the norm $|| \, \, || _p$. There exists a sub-sequence $(g_k)$ of $(f_n)$ such that $||g_{k+1} - g_k || _p < 2^{-k}$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Define $g$ by 
  $$ g(x) = |g_1(x) | + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |g_{k+1}(x) - g_k(x) |$$
  so $g : X \rightarrow \bar{ \mathbb{R}}^{+}$ is measurable. By Fatou's Lemma, we have

  $$ \le ||g_1||_p + 1. $$ 
  Hence, if $E = \{x \in X:g(x) < + \infty \},$ then $\color{blue}{ \text{  $E$ is a measurable set and $\mu(X \setminus E) = 0$. } \quad (3) } $ Therefore, $\color{blue}{ \text{ the series in $g(x)$ converges almost everywhere and $g\, \chi_E$ belongs to $L_p$. } \quad (4) } $ My questions regarding (1) : By construction $$g(x) = |g_1(x)| + \lim \sum_{k=1}^n |g_{k+1}(x) -  g_k(x)| $$ $$ =  |g_1(x) | + \lim \inf \sum_{k=1}^n |g_{k+1}(x) - g_k(x) |. $$ Is this right? (2) : If we take the $p^{th}$ root we would obtain, an exponent of $1/p$ outside of the $\lim \inf $. That is, from (1) we should obtain

Let $\mathbf{v}$ be a point in $\mathbb R^{n}$ with $||\mathbf{v}|| < r$, so that $\mathbf{c} + \mathbf{v} \in B(\mathbf{c}; r)$.Then the function $\mathbf{f}$ is said to be differentiable at $\mathbf{c}$ if there exists a linear operator $T_{\mathbf{c}} : \mathbb R^{n} \longrightarrow \mathbb R^{m}$ such that $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{c} + \mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{c}) + T_{\mathbf{c}}(\mathbf{v}) + ||\mathbf{v}|| E_{\mathbf{c}}(\mathbf{v})$ , where $E_{\mathbf{c}}(\mathbf{v}) \rightarrow \mathbf{0}$ as $\mathbf{v} \rightarrow \mathbf{0}$.The linear function $T_{\mathbf{c}}$ is called the total derivative of $\mathbf{f}$ at $\mathbf{c}$. But my question is ''how can the total derivative be linear operator?''In particular if $f$ be a real valued function of real variable then if $f$ is differentiable at $c$ then I have a question. Is $f'(c)$ the total derivative of $f$ at $c$? If the answer is affirmative then how is the real number $f'(c)$ considered to be linear operator i.e. to be function.Please help me in understanding this concept. Thank you in advance.","['multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives']"

2073768,Is a mixture of two uniform distributions more complex than a single distribution?,"I'm a psychologist studying perception of visual ensembles (e.g., lots of lines with different orientations drawn on a screen) that have different underlying probability distributions. One of the reviewer's for our paper has asked us to justify a statement that seems intuitively correct to me but I wasn't able to find a proper reference. The statement in question says that a mixture of two uniform distributions is more complex than a normal or a uniform one. The mixture distribution here consists of two non-intersecting uniform distributions with equal ranges but different means. Intuitively it seems to me that it should be more complex as its probability density function has more parameters than the functions of a single uniform or a normal distribution hence it could be said that it has lower ""description length"". Am I correct in saying that this mixture distribution is more complex? And if so, could you please provide any reference supporting this?","['probability', 'probability-distributions']"
2073867,Find the value of the infinite product: $\prod\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{3^n}\right)$,"I am Anay, here is a problem I am stuck with: $$x = \prod\limits_{n=1}^{\infty }\left ( 1 + \frac{1}{3^n} \right )$$ The task is to find the value of $x$. (obviously, we aren't supposed to have infinite products or sums, etc. in the answer) This is what I have done: We define the sequence $a_{k}$ as, $$a_{k} = \prod\limits_{n=1}^{k }\left ( 1 + \frac{1}{3^n} \right )$$ First, we put some bounds on $a_{k}$, as it is a increasing sequence, we already have the lower bound as $\frac{4}{3}$. Now to get the higher bound, we have the following inequality for all integers $x$ (easily proved through binomial expansion): $$\left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)^{x} < e$$ So, $$(1+x) < e^{\frac{1}{x}}$$ Using this inequality many times, we have, (using the formula for sum of a geometric progression) $$a_{k} < e^2$$ Thus, $$\frac{4}{3}\leq a_{k}< e^2$$ Then, to prove that this sequence is converging we show that it has the Cauchy Property. This can be done as follows: First, we have, $$a_{k} = a_{k-1} + \frac{a_{k-1}}{3^k}$$ So adding such equations for $a_{1}$, $a_{2}$ ..... $a_{k}$, we see that all terms cancel out and the following remains: $$a_{k} = a_{1} + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{k-1}\frac{a_{i}}{3^{i+1}}$$ So, if $m < n$, $$a_{n} - a_{m} = \sum\limits_{i=m}^{n-1} \frac{a_{i}}{3^{i+1}} < a_{n-1}\left(\frac{3^{n} - 3^{m}}{3^{m+n}\times2 }\right)$$ As $a_{k}$ is a increasing sequence, we have used $a_{n-1} > a_{n-2}>....>a_{m} $. And then we use the formula for sum of a geometric progression to get the result. Now we can see that when $m$ and $n$ are large enough, we can have the RHS arbitrarily small as $a_{n-1}$ has a upper bound ($e^2$), thus the sequence has the Cauchy property and it is converging. After this I thought may be the sequence converges to the bound which I established ($e^2$), but it is not so as I checked it through a computer program, it approaches around $1.56$, which is far below $e^2$. So, after this I try many other methods to find where the sequence converges to but I found no luck. Also, I couldn't find any results on Google, so I have come to your help. How do I solve this?

I'm having trouble guessing this function. The only functions I could think of which are $\mathcal{G}$ measurable are $1_B$ or $P(A)1_B$ but neither of these satisfy the expectation property. The problem with the function $1_A$ is even though it satisfies the expectation property, it is not $\mathcal{G}$ measurable.

2074029,Why do we divide by the expected value in the chi squared test?,"Chi squared, $\chi ^{2}$, is calculated using the formula: $$ \chi ^{2} = \sum \frac{{(O_i - E_i)}^{2}}{E_i}$$ $\chi ^{2}$ is used to determine how well a particular model fits some observed data.  The way I justify this formula is that we want a model that resembles the data very closely.  Hence, we will need to check how different the model is to the observed data. We can check how different individual data points are from the expected values by $(O_i - E_i)$.  Thus, $(O_i - E_i)$ is justified. To determine how well the model fits the data as a whole we can sum $(O_i - E_i)$ for all data points.  $(O_i - E_i)$ will need to be squared to remove negative terms in the summation.  Negative terms will lower $\chi ^{2}$ and give a flawed goodness of fit.  Thus, $\sum {(O_i - E_i)}^{2}$ is justified. My question is why do we normalize ${(O_i - E_i)}^{2}$ by $E_i$?  This seems unnecessary to me.","['statistics', 'chi-squared']"
