1841647,What's the explanation for these (infinitely many?) Ramanujan-type identities?,"Define the function, $$F(\beta) := \sqrt[3]{\beta+x_1}+\sqrt[3]{\beta+x_2}+\sqrt[3]{\beta+x_3}\tag1$$ where, $$x_1 =2\cos\big(\tfrac{2\pi }{7}\big),\;x_2 =2\cos\big(\tfrac{4\pi }{7}\big),\;  x_3 =   2\cos\big(\tfrac{8\pi }{7}\big)$$ or the $x_i$ are the roots of the cubic $x^3+x^2-2x-1=0$. We have two nice identities, $$F(0) = \sqrt[3]{5-3\sqrt[3]7}$$ $$F(1) = \sqrt[3]{-4+3\sqrt[3]7}$$ The first one is by Ramanujan.  (See The Problems Submitted by Ramanujan to the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society , p. 9, by Bruce Berndt, et al.) These two (and other pairs) can be explained by the negative and positive cases of $\pm \sqrt{d}$ in this answer . However, davidoff303 found a plethora of others, $$F\Big(\frac{74}{43}\Big) = 2\,\sqrt[3]\frac{7^2}{43}$$ $$F\Big(\frac{5105}{11349}\Big) = 3\,\sqrt[3]\frac{7}{11349}$$ $$F\Big(\frac{-2306997866696}{1047656140569}\Big) = -10980\,\sqrt[3]\frac{7^2}{1047656140569}$$ $$F\Big(\frac{9658771264742899051}{5361029308457632889}\Big)= 13\cdot 127\cdot 1381\sqrt[3]{\frac{7}{5361029308457632889}}$$ and so on. Note that, for general rational $\beta$, then $\big(F(\beta)\big)^3$ is a root of a $9$th deg equation. Q1 : Are there infinitely many rational $\beta$ such that $\big(F(\beta)\big)^3$ is also rational , like the ones found by davidoff303? Is there a formula for $\beta$? $\color{blue}{Update:}$ I formed the $9$th deg equation satisfied by $\big(F(\beta)\big)^3$. Acting on a hunch, it turns out that the $\beta$ used by davidoff303 satisfies the simple relation, $$\beta^3-\beta^2-2\beta+1 =w^3\tag2$$ This can be transformed into an elliptic curve , and it has infinitely many rational points. And the $LHS$ of $(2)$ in fact is a factor of the discriminant of the $9$th deg eqn. Q2 : Is it true that if rational $\beta$ satisfies $(2)$, then $\big(F(\beta)\big)^3$ is also rational?","['radicals', 'galois-theory', 'cubics', 'trigonometry']"
1841652,Maximize sum with no two consecutive variables,"Random variables $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{100}$ are drawn independently from the uniform distribution over $(0,1)$. After knowing the values, we are allowed to choose a subset of them as long as no two consecutive variables are chosen. We want to maximize the sum of the chosen variables. In expectation, how high can we make it? One way to choose is to ignore the values and always choose $x_1,x_3,x_5,\dots,x_{99}$. Since each variable has an expectation of $1/2$, this gives an expected sum of $50$. But it should be possible to do better if we consider the realized values.","['probability', 'random-variables']"
1841654,What is the regularity of the greatest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix?,"Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ be twice continuously differentiable, i.e. $f\in\mathcal{C}^2\left(\mathbb{R}^n\right)$. Define $\lambda_f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ as the function which associates $\vec x$ with the greatest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix of $f$ in $\vec x$. Then what can we say about the regularity of $\lambda_f$? Is it continuous/differentiable? The question came to my mind at todays analysis exam. I have absolutely no idea how one may argue; the definition of $\lambda_f$ doesn't seem to be easily useable. Edit: Or even more generally: is the function $\Lambda_f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ which assignes to $\vec x$ the ordered $n$-tuple (with multiplicities) of the Hessian of $f$ at $\vec x$ (i.e. $\Lambda_f\left(\vec x\right)=\left(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n\right)$ where $\lambda_1≥...≥\lambda_n$ are the eigenvalues of $H_f\left(\vec x\right)$) continuous/differntiable?

1841658,Comparison of entire functions with $f=cg$,"Let $f,g:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$ be holomorphic with $|f(z)|\leq|g(z)|$ for all $z\in\mathbb C$. Show that there is a $c\in\mathbb C$ with $|c|\leq 1$ such that $f=cg$. If $g\equiv 0$ then we trivially have $c=0$. Otherwise, we can write $$|h(z)|:=\frac{|f(z)|}{|g(z)|}\leq 1\,\forall z\in\mathbb C,\,g(z)\neq 0.$$
Since $h$ is bounded it follows from Liouville's theorem that it must be constant with $h(z)=c$ as well as $|h(z)|=|c|\leq 1$ which shows the claim. However, if $g$ has an isolated singularity $z_0$ then Riemann's theorem on removable singularities implies that it can be removed since $h$ is bounded. Therefore there exists an analytic continuation $\hat{h}$ with $$\left.h\right|_{\mathbb C\setminus\{z_0\}} = \left.\hat h\right|_{\mathbb C\setminus\{z_0\}}.$$ Furthermore $\hat h$ is bounded as well and once again Liouville's theorem implies $\hat h(z)=c$ and thus $|\hat h(z)|=|c|\leq 1$ and therefore the claim follows.","['complex-analysis', 'analytic-continuation', 'proof-verification']"
1841660,All nonzero singular values of $A$ are equal to $1$ iff $A^*=A^*AA^*$ and $A=AA^*A$,"I want to show that all the non-zero s-numbers, i.e. singular values $s_j(A):=(\lambda_j(A^*A))^{1/2}$, of A (a bounded linear operator of finite rank acting on a separable Hilbert space $H$) are equal to 1 if and only if $A^*=A^*AA^*$ and $A=AA^*A$. $A$ is an operator of finite rank, hence it is compact. So, I can use the following proposition: If $A:H\rightarrow H$ is a compact operator and $B,C:H\rightarrow H$ are bounded and linear, then
  $$
s_j(BAC)\le \|B\|\|C\|s_j(A).
$$ Thus, $$
s_j(A^*)=s_j(A^*AA^*)\le \|A^*\|^2s_j(A).

1841751,How to improve accuracy when solving calculus questions,"I find calculus to be a really interesting topic to study, and from what I've experienced it simply boils down to applying algebra to more complicated concepts. I understand calculus and can easily formulate proofs for myself as refreshers for things I don't quite remember. However, when it comes to actually solving calculus problems, I really struggle in terms of accuracy. No matter what problem I approach, I always end up making stupid mistakes or miscalculations. For example, today I was doing a practice problem that involved applying integrals to a distance/velocity problem to find the total distance a particle traveled, given the s(t) function that represents position versus time. It took me three lengthy attempts to solve the problem before I got the correct answer, and EACH attempt paradoxically yielded three different answers (the last being the correct). So the one solution I read in another post on Stack Exchange -- to take things slowly -- does not help, because when I solve calculus problems like a snail, I (mostly) do things correctly, but at the cost of time. This means that on timed exams, I may get more than half the questions correct, but I won't have enough time to finish the rest. Others suggest practicing over and over to hone my skills so that I don't trip up and make these mistakes...but that doesn't help either. In fact, I've been practicing what I learned in my AP Calculus AB course for about a year now, and yet I still continue to frequently make miscalculations. Again, what frustrates me is that I fully comprehend introductory calculus topics; it's not the application of calculus concepts or the use of formulas that gives me trouble, but rather it's maintaining accuracy while working quickly and efficiently. Does anyone have suggestions on how I can alleviate my problem? I'm about to take a 2nd semester Calculus course in college when the Fall starts and I'm afraid that my grade will suffer if I continue to make these careless mistakes.","['soft-question', 'calculus']"

1841852,"If $f_n \to f$ and $g_n \to g$ in measure and $\mu$ is finite, then $f_n g_n \to fg$ in measure","This is Problem 3.1.5 in Cohn's Measure Theory , 2nd edition. Let $\mu$ be a measure on $(X, \mathcal A)$ , and let $f, f_1,f_2, \ldots$ and $g,g_1,g_2,\ldots$ be real-valued $\mathcal A$ -measureable functions on $X$ . (a) Show that if $\mu$ is finite, if $f_n \to f$ in measure, and $g_n \to g$ in measure, then $f_n g_n \to fg$ in measure. With some effort, I was able to work out a direct proof, similar to the one outlined in this answer . After re-reading the section, I came up with an alternative argument similar to the one used by Cohn to prove another theorem. It results in a much quicker proof, and almost seems like a magic trick. I want to make sure that my argument is correct. I use the following results, proved by Cohn in this section, for real-valued measurable functions: Proposition 3.1.3: If $f_n \to f$ in measure, then there is a subsequence such that $f_{n_k} \to f$ almost everywhere. Proposition 3.1.2: If $\mu$ is finite and $f_n \to f$ almost everywhere, then $f_n \to f$ in measure. Here is my proof: Let $\{n_k\}$ be any subsequence of $\mathbb N$ . Then $f_{n_k} \to f$ and $g_{n_k} \to g$ in measure, so by Proposition 3.1.3 there is a subsequence $\{n_{k_j}\}\subset \{n_k\}$ such that $f_{n_{k_j}} \to f$ and $g_{n_{k_j}} \to g$ almost everywhere. (To see this, take a subsequence of $\{n_k\}$ that works for $f$ . Then that subsequence has a subsequence which works for both $f$ and $g$ .) Therefore $f_{n_{k_j}} g_{n_{k_j}} \to fg$ almost everywhere. As $\mu$ is finite, Proposition 3.1.2 implies that $f_{n_{k_j}} g_{n_{k_j}} \to fg$ in measure. Now here is the magic part: Suppose that $f_n g_n$ does not converge to $fg$ in measure. Then there is some $\epsilon > 0$ such that $\mu\{|f_n g_n - fg| > \epsilon\}$ does not converge to zero. Thus there is some $\delta > 0$ such that $\mu\{|f_n g_n - fg| > \epsilon\} > \delta$ for infinitely many $n$ . In other words, there is a subsequence $\{n_k\} \subset \mathbb N$ such that $\mu\{|f_{n_k} g_{n_k} - fg| > \epsilon\} > \delta$ for all $n_k$ . Clearly this subsequence cannot have any further subsequence $\{n_{k_j}\}$ for which $f_{n_{k_j}} g_{n_{k_j}} \to fg$ in measure, but this contradicts what we showed above. Consequently, $f_n g_n$ must converge to $fg$ in measure. Is this argument legitimate? It almost seems too easy.","['measure-theory', 'solution-verification']"

1841963,Why do we study the number of homomorphisms/isomorphisms between fields?,"From the first abstract algebra class, we encounter many problems that ask us to find the number of homomorphisms/isomorphism a between two algebra structures (e.g. field). My first question is why do we study homomorphisms? To me, it is much weaker than isomorphisms (although stronger than a mere bijection, of course, so I guess it's better than nothing). My second question is, why are we especially interested in the number of homomorphisms/isomorphisms ? Or is it just something that tests students' understanding of the subject? Update: Was out for some gyoza and wrote on my phone. I have this question because I just graduated and am taking an online course on Galois Theory . The quiz has quite some problems on ""counting morphisms"". One example would be, Given an algebraic extension $F/\mathbb{Q}$, how many homomorphisms $F\to \mathbb{C}$ of fields are there? Another example would be, How many homomorphisms are there from $\mathbb{F}_{p^3}$ to $\mathbb{F}_{p^4}$? I guess I am just not fully understanding the motivation/take away here (which really makes me think it's difficult to learn advanced math without being in a university).

1842054,Does the associated bundle functor have left or right adjoints?,"Let $\mathsf{Prin}_G$ be the category of (right) $G$-principal bundles, with a morphism from the bundle $p: P \to M$ to the bundle $p': P' \to M'$ being a pair of arrows $\chi: P \to P'$ and $\bar{\chi}: M \to M'$ such that $\chi$ is $G$-equivariant and the obvious diagram commutes. We only need to specify the morphism $\chi: P \to P'$ since the corresponding morphism down on the base is uniquely determined by $\chi$. Let $\mathsf{Space}_G$ be the category of (left) $G$-spaces, with a morphism from $S$ to $S'$ being a $G$-equivariant arrow $f: S \to S'$. Let $\mathsf{Bund}$ be the category of fibre bundles, with morphisms from $E \to M$, $E' \to M'$ being a pair of arrows such that we get a commutative square.

Does this functor have any left or right adjoints? Do we need to restrict the target category to get an adjunction? What if instead we fix the other argument (the $G$-space) and let the principal bundle vary? To provide a bit of motivation, I have read that for any fixed principal bundle the associated bundle functor from representations to vector bundles is exact, which leads me to guess that it might have both a left and a right adjoint.","['category-theory', 'principal-bundles', 'fiber-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

1842092,Solved ODE by two different methods; unable to prove the solutions are the same.,"I have a first order ODE: $$\frac{dy}{dx}+\frac{2y}{x}=\frac{e^x}{x^2}\tag{1}$$ Noting that this is in the form $$\frac{dy}{dx}+P(x)y=Q(x)\tag{2}$$ So an integrating factor method can be used. Comparing $(1)$ and $(2)$ we have that $P(x)=\dfrac{2}{x}$ and $Q(x)=\dfrac{e^x}{x^2}$. So I find the the Integrating factor $I$ to be $$I=e^{\int\frac{2}{x}dx}=x^2$$ Now applying the standard formula: $$y=e^{-I}\int Q(x)e^I\,dx+Ce^{-I}\tag{3}$$ I find that $$\fbox{$y=e^{-x^2}\int\frac{e^x}{x^2}e^{x^2}\,dx+Ce^{-x^2}$}\tag{4}$$ The book answer is as follows: Multiplication of $(1)$ by the Integrating factor $x^2$ results in $$x^2\frac{dy}{dx}+2xy=e^x$$ The LHS can be written as the derivative of a product: $$\left(yx^2\right)^{\prime}=e^x$$ So integrating both sides gives $$yx^2=e^x+C$$ or $$\fbox{$y=\frac{e^x+C}{x^2}$}\tag{5}$$ Equations $(4)$ and $(5)$ must be equivalent, but I am struggling to show that $(4)$ and $(5)$ are the same equation.

1842105,"Real Analysis, Folland The Dominated Convergence Theorem","Background Information: Proposition 2.16 - If $f\in L^+$, then $\int f = 0$ iff $f = 0$ a.e. Question: 2.24 The Dominated Convergence Theorem - Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence in $L^1$ such that (a) $f_n\rightarrow f$, and (b) there exists a nonnegative $g\in L^1$ such that $|f_n|\leq g$ a.e. for all $n$. Then $f\in L^1$ and $\int f = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int f_n$. Attempted proof - Suppose $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence in $L^1$ such that (a) $f_n\rightarrow f$, and (b) there exists a nonnegative $g\in L^1$ such that $|f_n|\leq g$ a.e. for all $n$. It is obvious that $f\in L^1$. Now since $f\in L^1$ and $L^1$ is redefined to be the set of equivalence classes of a.e.-defined integrable functions on $X$. Then let $E$ be the set where $f$ is not an integrable function on $X$ thus $\mu(E) = 0$ by definition of a.e. Then $f\in L^1$ for $X\setminus E$. By the Monotone Convergence Theorem $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int_{X\setminus E} f_n = \int_{X\setminus E}f$$ Observe that $\int_{E}f = \int_{X}f\chi_E = 0$ by Proposition 2.16. Similarly, $\int_E f_n = 0$. Thus we have \begin{align*}
\int_{X}f &= \int_{X\setminus E}f + \int_{E}f\\
&= \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int_{X\setminus E}f_n + \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int_E f_n\\
&= \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\left(\int_{X\setminus E}f_n + \int_E f_n\right)\\
&= \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int f_n

$$ both valid for primes $q\equiv3\bmod4$, rely on analysis and that no ""simple or direct"" proof has ever been published. It cites the third edition of Davenport's Multiplicative Number Theory from $2000$, but the second edition from $1980$ that's available online (at archive.org and at Google Books ) only contains the ""simple and direct"" claim and doesn't mention analysis (though it gives Dirichlet's proof, which uses a moderate amount of analysis). Since these inequalities correspond to the rather basic number-theoretic facts that for primes $q\equiv3\bmod4$ the sum of the quadratic residues in $[1,q-1]$ is less than the sum of the non-residues and there are more quadratic residues than non-residues in $[1,(q-1)/2]$, respectively, I found this rather surprising and am wondering whether this claim is correct and up to date. At Evaluate a character sum $\sum\limits_{r = 1}^{(p - 1)/2}r \left( \frac{r}{p} \right) = 0$ for a prime $p \equiv 7 \pmod 8$ , David Speyer gives an elementary proof of the equation in the title, i.e. of the fact that the sums of the quadratic residues and non-residues in $[1,(q-1)/2]$ are equal for $q\equiv7\bmod8$. His proof also yields an elementary proof of the equality of Dirichlet's two expressions for that case (which means an elementary proof of either inequality would also yield a proof of the other for that case), but I don't see how to turn it into a proof of their positivity, even for that case. But the elementary character of his proof of a directly related result adds to my feeling that one shouldn't need analysis to prove the other results. I also found this comment by Terry Tao on MO from 2011 saying that ""a proof that $L(1,\chi)\ne0$ [...] seems to require some nontrivial machinery at some point"" (where $\chi$ is a quadratic character), linking to On elementary proofs of the Prime Number Theorem for arithmetic progressions, without characters by Andrew Granville and apparently referring to the remark at the bottom of the second page. So is it true that there is no proof of these inequalities that doesn't use analysis? Are there new developments in this regard? Or could you provide some insight to someone with a limited number-theoretical background why one might expect these proofs to require analysis?","['dirichlet-series', 'alternative-proof', 'reference-request', 'number-theory', 'quadratic-residues']"

$$ Proof. To see this, I have proceeded as follows. From the general properties of conditional expectation, we have: 
$$
\mathbb E[Z_1+Z_2|Z_1+Z_2] =Z_1+Z_2.
$$ Now, again from the general properties of c.e. (linearity), I can write:
$$
\mathbb E[Z_1+Z_2|Z_1+Z_2] =\mathbb E[Z_1|Z_1+Z_2] +\mathbb E[Z_2|Z_1+Z_2] =2\mathbb E[Z_1|Z_1+Z_2]

The last equality because $Z_1$ has the same distribution as $Z_2$. Putting the two equalities together we find immediately the identity stated in the Claim.

I know that the result is not true if they aren't independent, but I don't see where this conditoin is needed.

Show that $X$ is symmetric if and only if $\mathbb{E}X^k = 0 $ for all positive odd integers $k$. Clearly, if $X$ is symmetric, then $\mathbb{E} X^k = 0$ for all positive odd integers $k$; for the reverse direction, I can show this using Fourier analysis/characteristic functions: Since $X$ is bounded, we know by DCT that $$ \mathbb{E} e^{it X} = \sum\limits_{k = 0}^\infty \frac{(it)^k \mathbb{E} X^k}{k!} = \sum\limits_{j = 0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^jt^{2j} \mathbb{E} X^{2j}}{(2j)!}$$

This is real for real $t$, which then implies that $$\mathbb{E} e^{-itX} = \overline{\mathbb{E} e^{itX}} = \mathbb{E} e^{itX}.$$ Since $X$ and $-X$ have the same characteristic function, they must also have the same distribution. Tao states afterwards that ""it is also instructive to find a 'real-variable' proof that avoids the use of this function,"" but I'm unable to find it.

1843033,"Points at infinity of a conic section and its eccentricity, foci, and directrix?","Background on projective geometry and conic sections; you might want to skip to the actual question A conic section is analytically described as the zero-locus of points $(x,y)$ in the affine plane of a quadratic polynomial in two variables $x$ and $y$, i.e. the solutions to the equation $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0$$ Geometrically, these are the sections obtained by intersecting, in $3$-dimensional affine space , the plane $z=1$ with the cone consisting of the solutions $(x,y,z)$ to the homogeneous quadratic equation $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dxz+Eyz+Fz^2=0$$ From a different point of view, the cone is composed not of points $(x,y,z)$ in $3$-dimensional space, but of lines through the origin $(0,0,0)$ in $3$-dimensional space. This is reflected by the homogeneity of the equation: if $(x,y,z)$ is a solution, then so is $(\lambda x,\lambda y,\lambda z)$ for any scalar $\lambda$. Since any line is determined by two distinct points it passes through, lines through the origin $(0,0,0)$ can be represented by homogeneous coordinates $[x,y,z]$ where not all of $x,y,z$ are zero. Each triple $[x,y,z]$ represents the line going through $(0,0,0)$, but two triples represent the same line if they differ by a scalar: i.e. $[x,y,z]$ and $[u,v,w]$ represent the same line if there exists a (non-zero) $\lambda$ such that $x=\lambda u$, $y=\lambda v$, and $z=\lambda w$. With homogeneous coordinates under our belt, we can define the projective plane to be the space of lines through the origin $(0,0,0)$ in $3$-dimensional affine space. Then we also have a cone in the projective plane given by the solutions $[x,y,z]$ to the homogeneous equation $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dxz+Eyz+Fz^2=0$$ For the purposes of this question, each point in the projective plane, i.e. line through the origin $(0,0,0)$ is one of two types: the lines $[x,y,z]$ with $z\neq 0$ (which intersect the plane $z=1$ in $3$-dimensional space) and the lines $[x,y,0]$ (which are parallel to the plane $z=1$ in $3$-dimensional space). The former can be identified by homogeneity with the lines $[x,y,1]$, so that each line determines a point in the affine plane and conversely each point in the affine plane determines a line. Thus, the conic section we started with is the intersection of the cone in projective space with the affine plane $z\neq0$. The latter points, of the form $[x,y,0]$ form the so-called line at infinity around our affine plane. The reason for this lies in how lines in the affine plane interact with points in projective space. A line in the affine plane consists of the solutions $(x,y)$ to an equation $$ax+by=c$$ Homogenizing this equation gives a homogeneous equation $$ax+by=cz$$ whose solutions $[x,y,z]$ determine a line in the projective plane . The line in the affine plane is the intersection of the line in the projective plane with the affine plane $z\neq0$, i.e., with the points of the projective plane with homogeneous coordinates $[x,y,1]$. On the other hand, the intersection of the line in the projective plane with the line at infinity is the intersections with points of the projective plane with homogeneous coordinates $[x,y,0]$. There is only one such intersection point, and that is the point $[-b,a,0]$ on the line at infinity. Since two lines in the affine plane are parallel if and only if their ratios $a:b$ are the same, we see that all lines in the affine plane parallel to the line given by $ax+by=c$ intersect the line at infinity at $[-b,a,0]$. Hence, the points $[x,y,0]$ on the line at infinity are precisely the point at infinity in which parallel lines intersect! Actual question It is natural to ask where does the conic section $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0$$ intersect the line at infinity? Plugging in $z=0$ in the homogenized equation, we arrive at he solutions $[x,y,0]$ of the homogenized quadratic $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2=0$$ Presuming we are not working in characteristic $2$, we can compute explicitly the solutions. In the case of real coefficients, the discriminant $B^2-4AC$ being positive, $0$, or negative corresponds to having two intersection points at infinity (hyperbola), one intersection point at infinity (parabola), or no intersection points at infinity (ellipse). Furthermore (still in the case of real coefficients), if the intersection points are actually $[1,\pm i,0]$ then the conic has to be circle (these are known as the circular points at infinity ). In particular, this exhibits the fact that all conic sections are uniquely determined by $5$ points as a generalization of the fact that a circle is uniquely determined by $3$ points since a circle is a conic section that has to go through the circular points at infinity. My question is whether we can give a definition of focus, directrix, and eccentricity using only the algbera-geometric structure of the projective plane, and not the usual metric definition. In particular, since the eccentricy governs (for real coefficients) whether the type of conic, it might be computable from the points at infinity.","['conic-sections', 'algebraic-geometry']"

1843309,Dilation convergence in $L^1$,"Below is a question, which I asked before, from Stein's Real Analysis.  I've provided a partial solution, which I think it's pretty along the lines of what needs to be done, however, I have no finished the solution.  If anyone has a hint for the part I'm stuck at, I would very much appreciate it. :) Question:  Prove that if $f$ is integrable on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\delta > 0$, then $f(\delta x)$ converges to $f(x)$ in $L^1$-norm as $\delta \to 1$. My Attempt: Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given and suppose $\delta > 1$ (if not, just take $1/\delta$ in place of $\delta$). Since $f$ is integrable on $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists a function $g$ continuous on $\mathbb{R}^d$ supported on a compact set $k$, with $\|f(x)-g(x)\| < \epsilon/3$.  Applying the triangle inequality, one finds that 
$$
\|f(\delta x) - f(x)\| \leq \|f(\delta x) - g(\delta x)\| + \|f(x) - g(x)\| + \|g(\delta x) - g(x)\|.
$$
With the assumptions on $f$ and $g$, together with the observation that 
$$
\|(f-g)(\delta x)\| = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} |(f-g)(\delta x)| dx = \frac{1}{\delta^d} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} |(f-g)(x)| dx = \frac{1}{\delta^d} \|(f-g)(x)\|
$$
one can estimate $\|(f(\delta x) - f(x)\|$ by 
$$
\|f(\delta x) - f(x)\| < \frac{2 \epsilon}{3} + \|g(\delta x) - g(x)\|.
$$
To complete the proof, it remains only to show that 
$$
\|g(\delta x) - g(x)\| \to 0 \quad \text{ as } \quad \delta \to 1.
$$ Observe that the function $g(\delta x)$ is supported on the set $\delta K$, a compact set; hence, the difference function $g(\delta x) - g(x)$ is supported on the compact set $\delta K \cup K$. Since $g(\delta x)$ is uniformly continuous on $\delta K$ and since $g(x)$ is uniformly continuous on $K$, there exist positive constants $L$ and $M$, with $|g(\delta x)| \leq L$ And $|g(x)| \leq M$; hence writing, 
$$
\delta K \cup K = (\delta K \Delta K) \cup (\delta K \cap K),
$$
a disjoint union, where $\delta K \Delta K = (\delta K \setminus K) \cup (K \setminus \delta K)$, and applying the triangle inequality, it follows that 
$$
\|g(\delta x) - g(x)\| \leq \int_{\delta K \Delta K} |g(\delta x)| dx + \int_{\delta K \Delta K} |g(x)| dx + \int_{\delta K \cap K} |g(\delta x) - g(x)| dx.
$$
Using the definition of the Lebesgue integral, one then finds that 
$$
\|g(\delta x) - g(x)\| \leq 2(L+M) m(\delta K \Delta K) +  \int_{\delta K \cap K} |g(\delta x) - g(x)| dx.
$$
Now, if ${c_n}$ is any sequences of positive numbers such that $\delta = c_1 \geq c_2 \geq \dots$ and $c_n \geq 1$ for all $n$, decreasing to $1$, then the corresponding sequences of compact set $K_n = c_n K \Delta K$ decreases to the empty set, that is, 
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} K_n = \emptyset.
$$
Moreover, since $m(K_1)$ has finite measure, by the continuity of Lebesgue measure, it follows that $m(K_n) \to 0$ as $c_n \to 1$. Hence, there exists $N \geq 1$ with $m(\delta K \Delta K) < \epsilon/12(L+M)$ whenever $n \geq n$ and $\delta \in (c_n, 1]$. 
Thus, 
$$
\|f(\delta x)- f(x)\| < \frac{2\epsilon}{3} + \frac{\epsilon}{6} + \int_{\delta K \cap K} |g(\delta x) -g(x)|dx
$$
whenever $\delta$ is sufficiently close to $1$. Note:  The issue I'm having is dealing with the final integral $\int_{\delta K \cap K} |g(\delta x)-g(x)| dx$.  Any hints would be appreciated. : )","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-measure', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'analysis']"

This question is about terminology. Even though the set of functions with this property is rather narrow, I was wondering whether there's a term or a combination of terms that would describe it.
