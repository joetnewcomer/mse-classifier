307077,Taylor series for logarithm converges towards logarithm,"Is there a way to show that the Taylor series around 0 of $f(x) = \ln(1-x)$ converges towards $f$ on the interval $(-1,1)$, just by considering the remainder from the Taylor polynomial? I'm having a little trouble with this. The series is $ T_n(x) = - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{x^k}{k}$ The convergence on $(-1,0]$ is not a problem, but on $[0,1)$ things start to get a little complicated. Let $0<x<1$. then $|f^{(n+1)}(t)| = \frac{n!}{(1-t)^{n+1}} \leq \frac{n!}{(1-x)^{n+1}}$ for all $t \in [0,x]$. The Lagrange form of the remainder then tells us that $|R_n(x)| \leq \frac{n!}{(1-x)^{n+1} (n+1)!}x^{n+1} = \frac{1}{n+1} \left( \frac{x}{1-x} \right)^n$ But if $x > 1/2$, this goes to infinity. I have tried to use the integral form of the remainder as well, but with no luck. Using the machinery of power series, it's easy to prove the convergence. But is there a way using only theory about Taylor polynomials?","['sequences-and-series', 'taylor-expansion']"

307211,How to tell if a limit of a multi-variable function exists?,"Since I began studying limits of multi-variable functions, I have been baffled with this question: how can one tells if a limit exists or not? I don't know if it's the right way to solve this kind of problem but I've always identified if the limit exists first before trying to approve/disprove its existence. For example, from the exercises I have done, I can see that those functions having this form $\frac{{{x^a}{y^b}}}{{{x^{ma}} + n{y^{mb}}}}$ will never reach a limit as $(x,y) \to (0,0)$.

307218,Is my logic correct?,"The question says there is a function $f(x)$ which maps $R$ to $R$, and $f''(x)>0$ for all x. This means $f'(x)$ is always increasing. And it is given that
$$g(x)=2f\left(\frac{x^2}{2}\right)+f\left(6-x^2\right)$$ We need to check the monotonicity of $g(x)$. I first calculate $$g'(x)=2x\left(f'\left(\frac{x^2}{2}\right)-f'\left(6-x^2\right)\right)=2x(Q)$$
Since both $Q$ and $x$ vary, we need to keep both in mind.
Also, if $$f'(x_1)>f'(x_2)$$
$$x_1>x_2$$
Now comes the step I doubt. I suppose $$Q=f'\left(\frac{x^2}{2}\right)-f'\left(6-x^2\right)=\left(\frac{x^2}{2}-\left(6-x^2\right)\right)R$$
where $R$ is a positive quantity. Then I check where $\left(\frac{x^2}{2}-\left(6-x^2\right)\right)$ and $x$ are positive and negative, and arrive at an answer, which my book says is correct. My logic behind $Q$ and $R$ is that it is $(x_1-x_2)$ that matters which, if negative, makes $Q$ negative.
Is this correct? Does any other ""not-going-over-the-head"" way apply?","['calculus', 'functions']"
307233,How can we tell if a set of axioms uniquely determines an algebraic structure?,"Up to isomorphism. For instance, the group axioms are verified by an infinite number of non-isomorphic algebraic structures. But the Peano axioms, I think (my proof may lack some formality due to my lack of in depth knowledge of logic and foundations, but I think it's rigorous enough that someone more knowledgeable could make it into a formal proof) uniquely determine $\mathbb{N}$: any two structures that satisfy the Peano axioms must be isomorphic. One thing I noted is that the axioms for standard classes of structures (rings, groups etc - all of which have many non-isomorphic instances) are always of the form: $$(\forall a_1...a_n\in A)\ \phi(a_1...a_n) = \psi(a_1...a_n)$$ Where $\phi$ and $\psi$ are functions ""defined in terms of"" the structure operations. On the other hand, the Peano axioms include axioms of other forms, notably the ones governing the successor operations. Could this be relevant? Are there any results describing the relationship between an axiom set, and the number of non-isomorphic structures verifying it?","['logic', 'model-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

307522,To what extent is a scheme morphism determined by its topological map?,"I am just beginning to learn scheme theory. This question is aimed at getting a feel for something so apologies in advance for the lack of precision. I am struck by the following difference from the theory both of varieties and smooth manifolds: In the categories both of varieties and of smooth manifolds, a morphism is completely specified by what it is doing on the topological spaces, since the elements of the structure sheaf (regular functions for varieties, smooth functions for manifolds) are determined by their pointwise values.  But in the category of schemes, to specify a morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ we need to separately specify the underlying topological map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and the sheaf map $f^\#: \mathcal{O}_Y\rightarrow f_*\mathcal{O}_X$. In spite of this, it seems to me that the topological map puts strong constraints on the sheaf map. For example, if $X=\operatorname{Spec}B,Y=\operatorname{Spec}A$ are affine schemes, the morphism is determined by a ring homomorphism $A\rightarrow B$; the topological map is how the primes contract under that ring homomorphism. If I know how all the primes are contracting, this does not leave the homomorphism a lot of room to wiggle. I request help in thinking about exactly how much room there is: ""How many"" different morphisms are possible between schemes $X,Y$ with the same topological map $f:X\rightarrow Y$? ""How different"" can they get? What kinds of conditions on $X,Y$ limit this flexibility? (For example, if $X,Y$ are integral, in which case elements of the structure sheaves are ""determined by their pointwise values"" in the residue fields $\kappa(p)$, does the topological map force a particular sheaf map as it does for varieties and manifolds?)","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'soft-question']"

If you have a quadratic form restricted to the sphere: $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^T\Gamma x + p^T x + c,\, x\in S^{n-1}$ then the covariant first and second derivatives at $x$ take the form: $\nabla f(x) = P_x(\Gamma x + p)$ $\nabla^2 f(x) = P_x\Gamma P_x-(p^Tx+x^T\Gamma x)P_x$ where $P_x = (I-xx^T)$ is the projection operator onto the tangent space at $x$.  Suppose $\Gamma$ is symmetric, $\Gamma p = 0$ and $\mathrm{Tr}(\Gamma) = 0$.  If we know $f, \nabla f$ and $ \nabla^2 f$ at a particular point, can we solve for $p$?  Is the solution unique? Edit After some numerical experimentation I realized the expression I gave for $\nabla^2 f$ is wrong.  Since the second derivative should map one point in the tangent space to another point in the tangent space, the factor of $I$ in the second term should be replaced with $P_x$.  Since $\mathrm{Tr}(P_x) = n-1$, $\mathrm{Tr}(\nabla^2 f) = -(n-1)p^Tx - nx^T\Gamma x$, but now $x^T\nabla^2 f x = 0$ and the argument below fails.

307680,Verification of a proof involving Hausdorff max. principle and collections,"I am given this proposition to prove which is a corollary to HMP(Hausdorff maximality principle). My two concerns are:
1. is my attempted proof correct? and 2. Is HMP applicable even when we're dealing with collections instead of sets? This last point troubles me because after reading Asaf Karagila answer here I try to be more careful when talking about collections. Here is the corollary: Proposition: Suppose $X$ is a non-void set and $A$ is some non-void collection of subsets of $X$, and $S$ is a subcollection of $A$ which is monotonic. Then there exists a maximal monotonic subcollection of $A$ which contains $S$. I have included a proof outline because: 1. I still can't write proofs correctly so my reasoning in the final proof can appear wrong and 2. So that you can figure out where I got things wrong, if i did. Proof outline: First we define a relation $\leq$ on $A$ given by $A_i \leq A_j$  iff $A_i \subset A_j$ for $A_i, A_j \in A$ and we show that $\leq$ is a partial ordering. 
Then we find a subcollection $S$ of $A$ such that the ordering is linear on $S$.
Finally we apply HMP to show the existence of the subcollection asked in the proposition. Proof: Let $\leq$ be a relation on $A$ such that $A_i \leq A_j$  iff $A_i \subset A_j$ for $A_i, A_j \in A$. $\leq$ is a partial ordering since it is:
  1. reflexive : if $A_i \in A$ then $A_i \leq A_i$, 2. anti-symmetric : if $A_i \leq A_j$ and $A_j \leq A_i$ then $A_i = A_j$ and 3. transitive : if $A_i \leq A_j$ and $A_j \leq A_k$ then $A_i \leq A_k$.
  Let $S$ be a subcollection of $A$. Since there is a partial ordering on $A$ then there is a partial ordering on $S$. Furthermore let $S$ be the collections of those sets $S_i$ such that $S_1 \subset S_2 \subset S_3 \subset \dots \subset S_n$, for $S = \{S_1, S_2, S_3, \dots, S_n\}$. We can verify that for any two sets $S_i, S_j \in S$; $S_i \leq S_j$ or $S_j \leq S_i$, therefore $\leq$ is a linear ordering on $S$. By HMP, there exists a set $M$ such that it is maximal and $S \subset M$. And since $M \subset A$ and $A$ is monotonic, $M$ is monotonic as well. $\square$ If this proof is correct (or even if not) is there any other proof(s)? Enlightenment please! UPDATE 1: Here is the statement of HMP I'm using: Any linearly ordered subset of a partially ordered set is contained in maximal linearly ordered subset. UPDATE 2: As per answer by Asaf Karagila bellow and comments, I have a final proof with minor corrections. It appeared better to leave the original proof for future reference without future readers having to go through revision history to understand what was happening. So here we go: Proof: Let $\leq$ be a relation on $A$ such that $A_1 \leq A_2$  iff $A_1 \subseteq A_2$ for $A_1, A_2 \in A$. $\leq$ is a partial ordering since it is:
  1. reflexive : if $A_1 \in A$ then $A_1 \leq A_1$, 2. anti-symmetric : if $A_1 \leq A_2$ and $A_2 \leq A_1$ then $A_1 = A_2$ and 3. transitive : if $A_1 \leq A_2$ and $A_2 \leq A_3$ then $A_1 \leq A_3$.
  Let $S$ be a subcollection of $A$. Since there is a partial ordering on $A$ then there is a partial ordering on $S$. Also since $A$ is monotone, $S$ is monotone as well. We then verify that for any two sets $S_1, S_2 \in S$: $S_1 \leq S_2$ or $S_2 \leq S_1$, therefore $\leq$ is a linear ordering on $S$. By HMP, there exists a set $M$ such that it is maximal and $S \subset M$. And since $M \subset A$ and $A$ is monotonic, $M$ is monotonic as well. $\square$","['alternative-proof', 'proof-writing', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Each observation is composed of the individual being measured, the time the measurement was taken, and the amount of the measurement.  What are each of these called? What is the name for the type of measurement being taken (heart rate or blood pressure in this example)? The collection of individuals is the sample, correct?  If so, what is the term for the collection of observations? Please feel free to revise the question, as my lack of knowledge makes it hard to ask accurately.  I can come up with names myself, but after failing to find anything in some statistical glossaries, I'm curious if there are canonical names for these basic elements.","['statistics', 'terminology']"

307773,The Line with Uncountably Many Origins: Second Countable?,"Motivation: The line with two origins can be constructed via taking two copies of ${\mathbb R}$ and identifying $x$ on the first copy with $x$ on the second copy for each $x\neq 0$.  We note that because this space is separable and first countable, it is also second countable.  What if, instead of two origins, we have uncountably many?  I read a claim that this space was not second countable, but I can't see why. Problem: Define the line with uncountably many origins in the following way: take a disjoint union of uncountably many copies of ${\mathbb R}$; we may index them as ${\mathbb R}\times \{\alpha\}$ for $\alpha\in A$, an uncountable indexing set.  We then define the equivalence class $\sim$ by $(x,\alpha)\sim (x,\beta)$ for $\alpha,\beta\in A$ and for all $x\neq 0$.  Is the resulting quotient space second countable? What I've Done: I know that the somewhat related problem of showing the disjoint union of an uncountable number of ${\mathbb R}$'s are not second countable relies on the fact that (after making it a metric space) one cannot find a countable dense subset --- but in this problem, I think, each open set covering $0\times \{\alpha\}$ will cover all of the other $0\times \{\beta\}$'s as well.  In particular, I don't see why just taking all rational-centered balls with rational radii.",['general-topology']
307796,Analysis proof for repeating digits of rational numbers,"""Every rational number is either a terminating or repeating decimal"". I knew there's a proof for this using number theory's theorems, but I wish to find a purely analysis proof, that is:

If this isn't possible then an analysis proof of a weaker result such as the case when each $a_i$ is either 0 or 1 would be appreciated.

308000,Splitting the action of functionals in duals of Sobolev spaces,"Update: After some more thinking and asking I've come to the conclusion that there is no reasonable way to achieve this for all possible $\varphi$ because of the mixed terms. I believe something useful can only be said under additional assumptions on the behaviour on the boundary both of $g$ and the $\varphi$. Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain (or at most
$C^{1, 1}$) with boundary split in open, disjoint subsets $\Gamma_1, \ldots,
\Gamma_k$ each with Lipschitz boundary as well. Let $g \in H^{- 1 / 2} (
\Gamma)$, the dual of the Hilbert space $H^{1 / 2} ( \Gamma) = W^{1 / 2, 2} (
\Gamma) = \{ v \in L^2 ( \Gamma) : ( v, v)_{1 / 2} < \infty \}$ where the
scalar product is given by $$ ( u, v)_{1 / 2} := \int_{\Gamma} uv + \int_{\Gamma} \int_{\Gamma}
   \frac{u ( x) v ( y)}{| x - y |^n} d x d y. $$ Question: Under what assumptions may I split the action of $g$ in a way like the
  following?
  $$ \langle g, \varphi \rangle_{- 1 / 2, \Gamma} \overset{!}{=} \sum_{i = 1}^k \langle g_i, \varphi_{| \Gamma_i} \rangle_{- 1 / 2, \Gamma_i}, $$
  where the $g_i$ are somehow the ""restrictions"" of $g$, $\varphi$ may be
  taken in $C^{\infty} ( \Gamma)$ and the $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_{- 1 / 2, \Gamma_i}$ are the duality pairings of $H^{- 1 / 2} ( \Gamma_i) \times H^{1 / 2} ( \Gamma_i)$. Using the representation of $g$ with the scalar product of $H^{1 / 2} ( \Gamma)$
has led me nowhere because of the double integral, where mixed terms appear. I know that the $\Gamma_i$ being Lipschitz, there exist continuous embeddings
$H^{1 / 2} ( \Gamma_i) \overset{E_i}{\hookrightarrow} H^{1 / 2} ( \Gamma)$
which allow to define for example $$ \langle g_i, \varphi_{| \Gamma_i} \rangle_{- 1 / 2, \Gamma_i} :=
   \langle g, E_i ( \varphi_{| \Gamma_i}) \rangle_{- 1 / 2, \Gamma}, $$ but I think this doesn't achieve much because the extensions with $E_i$ aren't
extensions by zero. This somehow reflects the same situation as with the
""mixed terms"" in the double integral. Help anyone? Thanks!","['sobolev-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"
308015,Tensor product of reduced $k$-algebras must be reduced?,"Let $A$, $B$ be two reduced $k$-algebras. Then if an element of the form $$\sum a_{i}\otimes b_{j}$$ is nilpotent, we can compose it with any $k$-homomorphism $f$ from $A$ to $k$ to get a homomorphism from $A\otimes B$ to $B$. This map's image is $$\sum f(a_{i})\otimes b_{j}$$must be nilpotent as well. So if we assume $b_{j}$ is linearly independent in the first place, we may reason that $f(a_{i})=0$. This showed that $a_{i}$ are in the Jacobson radical of $A$. However, we only know $\mathrm{Nil}(A)=0$, and it is not clear to me how to pass from the Jacobson radical to the nilradical without using some commutative algebra machinery. Here is what I think that might work. If $A$ is of finite type, then by Nullstellensatz we can assert the above is true. But if $A$ is not of finite type, then I can write $A=k[x_{1},...,x_{n}][X]$, where $n$ is the transcendence degree of $k(A)$ and $k[X]$ is finite over $k$. Then I should be able to pass from $k[X]$ to $A$ by inductive argument on the transcendental degree of $k(A)$, since prime ideals are maximal in a UFD (I am working with $k[x]$ by introducing $[x]$). The proof I have for the case of finite type is not satisfying. Given $I\subset k[X]$, using Nullstellensatz one can show that $$I_{X}V_{X}[I]=\sqrt{I}$$
where $V_{X}[I]$ is the set of all points in $X$ on which $I$ vanishes, and $I_{X}(V_{X}[I])$ be the ideal in $k[X]$ which vanishes on $V_{X}[I]$. Granting this, let $I=(a_{i})$, then we want to show $I=0$, which is $V_{X}[I]=X$. This follows since if $U\subset W$, then $V_{X}[U]\supset V_{X}[W]$. Since $V_{X}[I]\supset V_{X}[m_{x}]$ for all maximal ideal corresponding to points, it must be $X$. This proof is unnecessarily winding by using the ideal-variety correspondence. Ideally I should be able to construct a pure algebraic proof. The thing not clear to me is whether the above strategy really works. Namely I am not sure if I can really induct on the transcendental degree of $k(A)$. To make matters simple assume we showed the statement holds for $A$ with transdental degree $<n$. For $A$ with transdental degree $n$ we can thus write it as $k[A'][x]$. Then any maximal ideal $m'$ of $k[A'][x]$ must correspond to a maximal ideal $m=m'\cap k[A']$ in $k[A']$. But it seems not possible to show that any prime ideal is maximal. Indeed considering the simple example of $k[x,y]$, where $(x)$ is a prime ideal but not maximal since $k[x,y]/(x)=k[y]$ is not a field. The problem is in the inducting process the base ring is not neccessarily a field, and so this strategy cannot work. I am thinking maybe I can show $m'=m[f(x)]$ with $f(x)$ some irreducible polynomial in $k[A'][x]$. Because we know $k[A'][x]$ is noetherian by Hilbert's basis theorem, so in particular $m'$ must have a finite generating set. And we can reduce the number of irreducible polynomial to 1 since $m'$ is a maximal ideal. But I still do not know how to use this to finish the proof.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
