2505317,Sequential characterization of continuity - Is proof by contradiction unavoidable?,"I have a question that's been bothering me lately. Theorem. Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a map between metric spaces. Then $f$ is continuous at $x_{0}$ if and only if $x_{n}\rightarrow x_{0}$ always implies $f(x_{n})\rightarrow f(x_{0})$ . Here is the standard proof that I'm aware of. Proof. $(\implies).$ Let $(x_{n})$ be a sequence in $X$ that converges to $x_{0}$ . Let $\epsilon > 0$ . By continuity of $f$ , there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $$ d(x, x_{0}) < \delta \quad \implies\quad d(f(x), f(x_{0})) < \epsilon.  $$ By convergence of our sequence, choose $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $n\ge N$ implies $d(x_{n}, x_{0}) < \delta$ .
  Then the above implies $$ n\ge N \quad \implies \quad d(f(x_{n}), f(x_{0})) < \epsilon, $$ and so $f(x_{n})\rightarrow f(x_{0})$ . $(\impliedby).$ For this, we will prove the contrapositive. Assume $f$ is not continuous at $x_{0}$ . Then there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that for all $\delta > 0$ , there exists some $d(\tilde{x}, x_{0}) < \delta$ that has $d(f(\tilde{x}), f(x_{0}))\ge \epsilon$ . We use this to construct the following sequence. For $\delta = \tfrac{1}{n}$ we choose $x_{n}$ to be the element such that $d(x_{n}, x_{0}) < \tfrac{1}{n}$ but $d(f(x_{n}), f(x_{0}))\ge\epsilon$ .
  Then we have $x_{n}\rightarrow x_{0}$ but $f(x_{n})\not\rightarrow f(x_{0})$ . $\;\square$ For the backwards direction, we used the contrapositive, which boils down to proof by contradiction, as far as I'm aware. Usually I'm okay with these kinds of proofs, but I find it strange that we need to use proof by contradiction. I can't seem to find a proof that doesn't rely on contradiction here. My Attempt Suppose $x_{n}\rightarrow x_{0}$ always implies $f(x_{n})\rightarrow f(x_{0})$ . Let $\epsilon > 0$ . I want to show that there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $d(x, x_{0})<\delta$ implies $d(f(x), f(x_{0}))<\epsilon$ . Perhaps I can consider the set of all possible sequences $S = (x_{n})$ for which $d(x_{n}, x_{0}) < \tfrac{1}{n}$ . By hypothesis, each sequence $S$ has an index $N_{S}$ for which $n\ge N_{S} \implies d(f(x_{n}),f(x_{0}))<\epsilon$ . By the well-ordering principle, we may take $N_{S}$ to be the least such natural number for $S$ . Let's say I take $\delta = \inf \tfrac{1}{N_{S}}$ (where the infimum is over all those $S$ ). What exactly prevents us from having $\delta = 0$ ? I see that every sequence $S$ has $N_{S}$ , but if there are uncountably many possible $S$ , it feels as though you can choose some contrived sequence that gets closer and closer to $x_{0}$ but has nonetheless an arbitrarily large $N_{S}$ . My Questions My main question is, is the use of the law of non-contradiction unavoidable? Is there a convincing argument one way or the other?","['continuity', 'real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'constructive-mathematics']"
2505377,Tough Combinatorics Question (possibly related to Stirling numbers),"EDIT How can we modify the expression in the case where each object can occur once or twice, but not 0 times, such that the resulting permutation p has size N <= |p| <= 2N? (I feel that this, too, must be in OEIS, but it is escaping me). For this case, I have: $$\sum_{i=0}^N{N!\over i!\,(N-i)!}\ {(i+2(N-i))!\over 2^{N-i}}\ .$$ Can someone verify? (or, is there an obvious search term in OEIS that I'm missing?) I am working on a CS paper, and it would be very helpful to be able to determine the following, which essentially counts the unique ways to make an input for an algorithm. Here is the simplest way I can explain it: We have $N$ people Each person can be not chosen chosen once chosen twice Then we take all of the people who are chosen once or twice and order them in an ordered set. The question is: How many unique ordered sets $S$ (of any length $0\le|S|\le2N$ )  can we make as a function of $N$ ? For example, suppose there are $4$ people named $\{1,2,3,4\}$ Suppose: $1$ is chosen once $2$ is not chosen $3$ is chosen twice $4$ is not chosen Then one unique set might then be the ordered set $\{3,3,1\}$ . Another is $\{3,1,3\}$ . It seems clear that there are $3^N$ unique unordered sets, as for each person we have 3 options (not chosen, chosen once, or chosen twice). The part I find challenging is that a person can be chosen twice , and switching order with oneself in the ordered set does not lead to a different unique ordered set. Can anyone suggest the solution? Instinct suggests that there might be a way to incorporate Stirling numbers of the First Kind to remove these permutation cycles from the total count.","['permutations', 'combinatorics', 'stirling-numbers']"

Prove that $\mathcal{F}=[X]_\equiv$ if $|\mathcal{A}/\equiv|>1$,"$\mathcal{A}$ is field of subsets of $X$ Prove that if $\equiv$ is congruence relation in the structure $<\mathcal{A},\emptyset,X,\cup,\cap,->$ and $|\mathcal{A}/\equiv|>1$, then $\mathcal{F}=[X]_\equiv$ is a filter in $\mathcal{A}$. I am not sure if I understand everything correctly. If $|\mathcal{A}/\equiv|=1$, then for every $A,B\in\mathcal{A}$ we have $A\equiv B$. So we can start by assuming that $\equiv$ is congruent relation and $\mathcal{F}$ is not a filter. Let's pick $A\in\mathcal{F}$. So for example, there exist $B\in \mathcal{A}$ such that $A\subset B$ and $B\notin\mathcal{F}$. That means that either $B\equiv A$ or $B\equiv B'\in\mathcal{F}$.

2505763,Is the pasting lemma also true in case of uniform continuity?,"Let $\left(X, d_X \right)$ and  $\left( Y, d_Y \right)$ be metric spaces; let $A$ and $B$ be (non-empty) closed subsets of $X$ such that $X = A \cup B$; let $f \colon A \to Y$ and $g \colon B \to Y$ be uniformly continuous functions such that $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \in A \cap B$; and, let the function $h \colon X \to Y$ be defined as follows:
$$ h(x) \colon= \begin{cases} f(x) \ & \mbox{ if } \ x \in A, \\ g(x) \ & \mbox{ if } \ x \in B. \end{cases} $$
Then is $h$ also uniformly continuous on $X$?

2505777,"Abusing mathematical notation, are these examples of abuse?","I have often seen notation like this: Let $f:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by $$f(x,y)=x^2+83xy+y^7$$ How does this make any sense? If the domain is $\mathbb{R}^2$ then $f$ should be mapping individual tuples. Therefore I expect a proper representation of the above function would be: $$f(t)=\pi_1(t)^2+83\pi_1(t)\pi_2(t)+\pi_2(t)^7$$ Isn't this more accurate? If the domain is $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}=\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}=\{(x,y):(x\in \mathbb{R})\land (y\in \mathbb{R})\}$ then every element in the domain is a two-tuple $(x,y)$ not some irregular expression composed of two variables seperated by a comma like ""$x,y$"" right? Also when speaking of algebraic structures why do people constantly interchange the carrier set with the algebraic structure itself. For example you might see someone write this: Given any field $\mathbb{F}$ take those elements in our field $a\in \mathbb{F}$ that satisfy the equation $a^8=a$. How does this make any sense? If $\mathbb{F}$ is a field then it is a tuple equipped with two binary operations and corresponding identity elements all of which satisfy a variety of axioms. Thus we should have for some set $S$ that $\mathbb{F}=(S,+,\times,0,1)$ so they would be writing $a\in (S,+,\times,0,1)$ which is gibberish, they should write $a\in S$.

2505915,Version of Hahn-Banach Theorem,"Problem: Let $X$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ and $Y \subset X$ a linear subspace. Let $p: X \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sublinear functional and $f: Y \to \mathbb{R}$ linear with $f \leq p$ on $Y$ (by Hahn-Banach this can be extended of course) Consider now $G \subset \mathcal{L}(X)$ a subset of bounded linear operators $T: X \to X$ with the properties that  id $_X \in G$ and for all $A,B \in G, AB \in G$ and moreover $AB=BA$ . Assume that for all $A \in G$ we have $p(Ax) \leq p(x)$ for all $x \in X, Ay \in Y$ and $f(Ay)=f(y)$ for all $y \in Y$ Claim: There exists $F: X \to \mathbb{R}$ linear with $F_{ \mid Y} =f, F \leq p$ on $X$ and $F(Ax)=F(x)$ for all $x \in X$ and $A \in G$ My approach: I am given the hint to consider $q(x):= \inf_{A_1, \dots , A_n} \frac{1}{n}p(A_1x + \dots + A_n x)$ where the infimum is taken over finitely many $A_i \in G$ , then show that $q$ is sublinear and $f(y) \leq q(y)$ for all $y \in Y$ in order to apply Hahn-Banach. Showing that $q$ is sublinear follows from the fact that all the $A_i$ are linear and $p$ is sublinear by definition. Further for $y \in Y$ and $A_1, \dots , A_n \in G$ we have \begin{align} f(A_1y + \dots + A_ny) &= f(A_1y) + \dots + f(A_ny) =n f(y)  \end{align} But also $f(A_1y + \dots + A_ny) \leq p(A_1y + \dots + A_ny)$ , thus we have $f(y) \leq \frac{1}{n}p(A_1y + \dots + A_ny)$ taking the infimum we get that $f(y) \leq q(y)$ on $Y$ . By Hahn-Banach there exists $F: X \to \mathbb{R}$ linear with $F_{ \mid Y} = f$ and $F(x) \leq q(x)$ for all $x \in X$ . However since $p(A_1x + \dots + A_nx) \leq p(A_1x)+ \dots + p(A_nx) \leq n p(x)$ it also follows that $q \leq p$ on $X$ which takes care of the first claim. I need to show that $F(Ax)=F(x)$ for all $x \in X$ and $A \in G$ holds. It would be good if I could show that $F(Ax) \leq F(x)$ , then the other inequality would follow by linearty of $F$ . \begin{align}F(Ax) \leq q(Ax)&= \inf_{A_1, \dots , A_n} \frac{1}{n} p(A_1Ax + \dots + A_nAx) \\ &= \inf_{A_1, \dots , A_n} \frac{1}{n} p(AA_1x + \dots + AA_nx) \end{align} Here I get stuck. My Question(s) would be if my approach above is correct so far and how I would go on about concluding that $F(Ax)=F(x)$ on $X$ .",['functional-analysis']
2505951,"Using Dominated Convergence Theorem to prove that $\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{\Lambda_n} X \, d\mathbb{P} = 0$","Let $\mathbb{E}\left(\left|X\right|\right) < \infty$ and $\lim_{n\to\infty} \mathbb{P}\left(\Lambda_n\right) = 0$, show that $\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{\Lambda_n} X \, d\mathbb{P} = 0$. I came up with the following proof, which does not use DCT. My friend said that using DCT the proposition is trivial to prove but did not offer further explanation. I honestly don't see how to use DCT for this proof. Do we have a shorter/easier proof using DCT? My proof: Since $\mathbb{E}\left( \left|X\right| \right) < \infty$,  $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}\left( \left|X \right| \ge n \right)$ converges by theorem 3.2.1. This implies that $\mathbb{P}\left( \left|X\right| \ge n \text{ i.o. }\right) = 0$, which is equivalent to $\mathbb{P}\left( \left| X \right| < n \text{ a.s. } \right) = 1$. By definition, this means that $$ \mathbb{P}\left( \left\{\omega\mid \cup_{m=1}^\infty \cap_{n=m}^\infty \left|X(\omega)\right| < n \right\}\right) = 1 $$ This means that there exists a null set $N$, such that for all $\omega \in \Omega - N$, there exists some $K$ such that $\left|X(\omega)\right| < n$ for all $n \ge K$. In particular, $\left|X\right|$ is almost everywhere bounded by $K$. Since $\lim_{n\to\infty} \mathbb{P}\left(\Lambda_n\right) = 0$, for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists some $N(\epsilon)$ such that whenever $n\ge N(\epsilon)$, $\mathbb{P}\left(\Lambda_n\right) < \epsilon$ holds. So we have \begin{align}
\left| \int_{\Lambda_n} X \,d \mathbb{P} \right| &\le \int_{\Lambda_n} \left| X \right| \,d\mathbb{P} \\
&\le K \mathbb{P}\left(\Lambda_n\right) \\
&\le K \epsilon
\end{align} This proves that $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{\Lambda_n} X \, d\mathbb{P} = 0 $$ Update: My original proof is incorrect as @Trevor Gunn pointed out, since I overlooked the fact that bound $K$ depends on $\omega$. The following proof is correct (perhaps unnecessarily verbose). For any $K \in \mathbb{N}$, we have \begin{align}
\left| \int_{\Lambda_n} X \,d\mathbb{P} \right| &\le \int_{\Lambda_n} \left| X \right| \,d\mathbb{P}\\
&= \int_{\Lambda_n} \left|X\right| 1_{\left|X\right| \le K} + \left|X\right| 1_{\left|X \right| > K} \, d\mathbb{P} \\
&\le \int_{\Lambda_n} \left| X1_{\left|X\right| \le K}\right| \,d\mathbb{P} + \int_{\Lambda_n} \left| X 1_{\left|X\right| > K} \right|\,d\mathbb{P} \\
&\le \int_{\Lambda_n} \left| X1_{\left|X\right| \le K}\right| \,d\mathbb{P} + \int_\Omega \left| X 1_{\left|X\right| > K} \right|\,d\mathbb{P}
\end{align} Since $\left| X 1_{\left|X\right| \le K}\right| = \left|X\right| 1_{\left|X\right| \le K} \le K$ almost everywhere on $\Lambda_n$, we have $$ \int_{\Lambda_n} \left| X 1_{\left|X\right|\le K} \right|\,d\mathbb{P} \le K \mathbb{P}\left( \Lambda_n \right) $$ In addition, notice that $\lim_{K\to\infty} \left| X 1_{\left|X\right| > K} \right| = 0$ almost everywhere on $\Omega$, as well as that $\left| X 1_{\left|X\right| < K}\right| \le \left|X \right|$ almost everywhere on $\Omega$. Since $\int_\Omega \left|X\right| \,d\mathbb{P} = 0$, by dominated convergence theorem, we conclude that $$ \lim_{K\to\infty} \int_\Omega \left| X 1_{\left|X\right| > K}\right| \,d\mathbb{P} = 0 $$ Finally, given any $\epsilon > 0$, we can first choose $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\int_\Omega \left| X 1_{\left|X\right| > K } \right| \,d \mathbb{P} < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ whenever $K \ge N$. Having chosen $N$, choose $M$ such that $\mathbb{P}\left(\Lambda_n\right) < \frac{\epsilon}{2N}$ whenever $n\ge M$. Thus, when $n\ge M$, we have $$\left| \int_{\Lambda_n} X  \, d\mathbb{P} \right| \le    N \frac{\epsilon}{2N} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon$$ This proves that $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{\Lambda_n} X \,d\mathbb{P} = 0$$","['alternative-proof', 'probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"

As we know that $\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1}k^2 = (-1)^{n-1}\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2}$, we can replace the first term after the $=$ with this. The equation becomes:
$$=(-1)^{n-1}\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2} + (-1)^{n-1}\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2}$$
The I subsitute $n+1$ for $n$, so that:
$$=(-1)^{n+1-1}\frac{(n+1)(n+1+1)}{2} + (-1)^{n+1-1}\frac{(n+1)(n+1+1)}{2}$$
$$=(-1)^{n}\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} + (-1)^{n}\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$$
$$=(-1)^{n}[\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}+\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}]$$

Because $Y$ is subset of $X$ by definition of induced topology $Y$ is open. It means that $X - Y$ is closed and contains some limit points of $Y$ (definition of closed set).

2506134,A matter of choice of stating the domain of the function in analysis/topology textbooks - narrower or broader at first?,"It is customary to see in mathematical analysis that the domain of the function in definition or theorem would require as ""small"" as possible. For example, recall that the Extreme Value Theorem often phrased like this: Way 1: Let $f:[a,b]\to\Bbb R$ . If $f$ is continuous, then $f$ has a max/min on $[a,b]$ . In contrast, authors usually don't like to state as: Way 2: Let $E\subseteq \Bbb R$ , $f:E\to\Bbb R$ and $[a,b]\subseteq E$ , if $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ , then $f$ has a max/min on $[a,b]$ (Notice that in this case, the domain $E$ of the function in the context can be a ""fragile"" set, such like $(1,5)\cup (10,15)\cup (20,24)$ .) Now, if we have a function $f:(1,5)\cup (10,15)\cup (20,24)\to \Bbb R$ at hand, then does it have a max/min on $[2,4]$ ? Yes, but given different description of theorem, we have different argument. If we adopt the first one, we would say: because $f\vert_{[2,4]}$ is a function that defined on a closed bounded set $[a,b]$ , so by the theorem, $f\vert_{[2,4]}$ has a max/min on $[2,4]$ . However, if we adopt the second one, we would say: since $[2,4]\subseteq\text{dom} (f)$ , by the theorem, $f$ has a max/min on $[2,4]$ (we don't need to make the restriction here, since this precisely suite the theorem itself this time). One more example, in defining Riemann integrability, people always stated the hyphothesis as Let $f:[a,b]\to\Bbb R$ , $f$ is called integrable if ... rather than Let $E\subseteq\Bbb R$ , $f:E\to\Bbb R$ , and $[a,b]\subseteq E$ , $f$ is called integrable on $[a,b]$ if ... Next, below is the definition of analyticity of a point of a function from Terrence Tao's Analysis II . Definition: Let $I$ be an open interval, $c\in I$ and $f:I\to\Bbb R$ . We say that $f$ is analytic at $c$ if there exists $\delta>0$ such that $(c-\delta,c+\delta)\subseteq I$ and there exists a power
  series $\sum a_n(x-c)^n$ with radius of convergence $R\geq \delta$ ,
  such that $f(x)=\sum a_n(x-c)^n$ for all $x\in(c-\delta,c+\delta)$ . If we have a function $f:[0,1)\cup [10,20)\cup [40,50]\to \Bbb R$ , which defines by $f(x)=\sin x$ . Notice that this definition from Tao is similar to the type 1 way, which means he requires the domain of the fuction in interest as minimal as possible. (Though this time it is a definition, rather than EVT, which is a theorem. However, doesn't matter for our discussion here.) 
We all know that $f$ is definitely ""very good"" to be ""analytic"" at every point(interior point). However, rigorous speaking, it seems that we cannot simply say that $f$ is analytic at, say, the point $0.5$ , since this does not suit the exact pattern that the definition just said! If we truly want to say something about the analyticity of $f$ at $0.5$ , we must make a restriction by ourselves first, then say something like $f\vert_{(0.3,0.6)}$ is analytic at $0.5$ , which is very burdensome. And that's why I post this. Is their any better way to say about this? Or should we always adopt the second way to phrase the definitions and theorems?

2506277,What step have I missed in my calculation converting the binary representation of pi to decimal?,"While I was reading this one wikipedia page on floating-point arithmetic , I stumbled upon a calculation that I found interesting. So, I decided just for fun to try and work it out. I used a spreadsheet to do the summing. But following both the text description and the sigma notation verbatim [ to the best of my understanding, anyway ], I wasn't able to arrive at the same solution that the wikipedia page arrived at. Before I ask my questions, here is the snippet from that wikipedia page that describes the calculation: ... The common IEEE formats are described in detail later and elsewhere, but as an example, in the binary single-precision (32-bit) floating-point representation, ${\displaystyle p=24}$, and so the significand is a string of 24 bits. For instance, the number Ï's first 33 bits are: $$11001001\phantom{2}00001111\phantom{2}1101101\underline0\phantom{2}10100010 0.$$ If the leftmost bit is considered the 1st bit [ the MSB ], then the 24th bit is zero and the 25th bit is 1; thus, in rounding to 24 bits, let's attribute to the 24th bit the value of the 25th, yielding: $$11001001\phantom{2}00001111\phantom{2}1101101\underline1.$$
  When this is stored using the IEEE 754 encoding, this becomes the significand ${\displaystyle s}$ with ${\displaystyle e=1}$ (where ${\displaystyle s}$ is assumed to have a binary point to the right of the first bit [ the LSB? ]) after a left-adjustment (or normalization ) during which leading or trailing zeros are truncated should there be any, which is unnecessary in this case; as a result of this normalization, the first bit [ the MSB? the LSB? ] of a non-zero binary significand is always 1, so it need not be stored, saving one bit of storage. In other words, from this representation, Ï is calculated as follows: \begin{align*}
&( 1 + \sum _{n=1}^{p-1}bit_{n} \times 2^{-n}  ) \times 2^{e}\\
&= ( 1 + 1 \times 2^{-1} + 0 \times 2^{-2} + 1 \times 2^{-4} + 1 \times 2^{-7} + \cdots + 1 \times 2^{-23}) \times 2^{1}\\
&= 1.5707964 \times 2\\
&=3.1415928\\
\end{align*} where ${\displaystyle n}$ is the normalized significand's nth bit from the left [ the MSB? ], where counting starts with 1... In-lined inside the square brackets "" [] "" in the above quoted wikipedia page, I'm using MSB to mean "" Most Significant Bit ""; and LSB to mean "" Least Significant Bit "". I've in-lined those remarks to highlight parts of that description that are throwing me off. What's confusing to me is, the description starts off denoting the MSB as "" the first bit "". Then it starts referring to the LSB as "" the first bit "". Looking at the 24 bit binary number given [${\displaystyle11001001\phantom{2}00001111\phantom{2}1101101\underline1.}$], the order of the corresponding bits that appear in the expansion of the summation [${\displaystyle1 + 1 \times 2^{-1} + 0 \times 2^{-2} + \cdots}$] suggest that the calculation starts from the LSB. So starting at the LSB, the first cell of my spreadsheet ( A1 ) has the value 1 . The "" first bit "". In the second spreadsheet cell ( A2 ), I have a formula that multiplies the 1 bit in the binary 2s place, by ${\displaystyle 2^{-1}}$. In the third spreadsheet cell ( A3 ), I multiply the 0 bit in the binary 4s place by ${\displaystyle 2^{-2}}$...and so on consecutively and respectively up to the MSB. So my spreadsheet has a column of 24 cells that correspond to the 24 bits. The first cell simply has the value 1 . The remaining 23 cells have a formula: bit * POWER(2;-n) ( where 'bit' is one of '0' or '1'; and 'n' corresponds to the 'nth bit' specification of the above description - having a range of '1-23' ). The 25th cell in that column has the formula SUM(A1:A24) * POWER(2;1) . The sum I get with that formula when starting my counting at the LSB, is ${\displaystyle3.436558485}$. The sum I get with that formula when starting my counting at the MSB, is ${\displaystyle3.5707962513}$. The sum I get with that formula when starting my counting at the LSB, and excluding ${\displaystyle2^{3}+\cdots+2^{5}+\cdots+2^{6}\cdots}$ from the calculation, is ${\displaystyle3.155308485}$. The sum I get with that formula when starting my counting at the MSB, and excluding ${\displaystyle2^{3}+\cdots+2^{5}+\cdots+2^{6}\cdots}$ from the calculation, is ${\displaystyle3.5082962513}$. Now, here are my questions: What is the correct sigma notation for converting the binary representation of pi to its decimal representation ? Why doesn't the example on the wikipedia page include ${\displaystyle2^{3}+\cdots+2^{5}+\cdots+2^{6}\cdots}$ in its calculation? What do I need to correct in my spreadsheet formula to make it arrive at the same answer that the wikipedia page arrives at? Does that description need correcting in its confusing reference to both the MSB and the LSB as ""the first bit""? Does the sigma notation in that description need correcting to make it clear that ALL of the bits should be included in the calculation? Going by what I described of my spreadsheet calculation, what step(s) or what fundamental mathematical concept have I overlooked or misunderstood?

Let $U$ be the number of unique values seen in the sequence. Given $k$ and $U$ , how to estimate $n$ ? The problem Let $A = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}$ be a set of ""concepts"" that you will have to learn, for example for a university course. As you don't see the big picture of the topic yet, you don't have an idea of how big $n$ is, and you want to estimate $n$ . In a few days, you speak with $k$ different people - each time it's a one-to-one discussion with a friend who studied the topic before, and who is supposed to master all the $n$ concepts perfectly.
Each friend chooses a concept uniformly-randomly in the set $A$ , and speaks to you about it. At the end of the $k$ discussions, you write down $u$ , the number of unique concepts seen. Goal: how to estimate $n$ , as a function of $k$ and $u$ ? Example 1: if among $k=15$ discussions, one concept has been discussed twice (so there's 1 repetition), another concept has been discussed three times (2 repetitions), and all others just once, then the total number of repetitions is $3$ , and the number of unique concepts discussed is $u=12$ .
Then you can imagine that if you'd proceed with even more discussions, there will be many new unseen concepts to appear. Thus $n$ is probably large. Example 2: if among $k=15$ discussions, one concept has been discussed $10$ times, another $3$ times, and two other concepts once each, then $u = 4$ .
As many people spoke about the same concept (however they chose it randomly!), it gives the impression that you probably have seen most of the whole subject. Thus $n$ is not so big. How to estimate $n$ ? Other applications A) You are new in the city, and you don't know how big ( $n$ ) it is. Each time you go to a bar you see new people you haven't seen before => $k \approx u$ => $n$ is probably big.

2506687,"$f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to A$ two functions such that $f\circ g\circ f$ is bijective.

Proof Attempt: We first show that $f$ is an injection. Let $f(x)=f(y)$ then $$g(f(x))=g(f(y))$$
$$f(g(f(x)))=g(g(f(y)))$$
$$(f\circ g\circ f)(x)=(f\circ g\circ f)(y)$$
$$x=y.$$
So it is an injection. Now we will show $f$ is a surjection. Let $y\in B$ then there exists an $x\in A$ such that $(f\circ g\circ f)(x)=y.$ Or in other words for any $y\in B$ there exists an element $x'=g(f(x))\in A$ such that $f(x')=y.$ Hence $f$ is a surjection. Thus $f$ is a bijection. Now we will show that $g$ is a bijection. We know that $f$ is a bijection and hence $f^{-1}$ is a bijection so we have that $f^{-1}\circ f\circ g\circ f\circ f^{-1}$ is a bijection. But this mapping is identical to $g$ and so we have that $g$ is a bijection. Is this a valid proof?","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions', 'proof-verification']"

2507841,Theorem 7.26 in Baby Rudin: The Stone Weierstrass Theorem,"Here is Theorem 7.26 in the book Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin, 3rd edition: If $f$ is a continuous complex function on $[a, b]$ , there exists a sequence of polynomials $P_n$ such that $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} P_n(x) = f(x) $$ uniformly on $[a, b]$ . If $f$ is real, the $P_n$ may be taken real. Here is Rudin's proof: We may assume, without loss of generality that $[a, b] = [0, 1]$ . [I would like to have an explicit argument on how the truth of this result for the unit closed interval $[0, 1]$ would lead to the truth of this result for an arbitrary closed interval $[a, b]$ .] We may also assume that $f(0) = f(1) = 0$ . For if the theorem is proved for this case, consider $$ g(x) = f(x) - f(0) - x [ f(1) - f(0) ] \qquad (0 \leq x \leq 1). $$ Here $g(0) = g(1) = 0$ , and if $g$ can be obtained as the limit of a uniformly convergent sequence of polynomials, it is clear that the same is true for $f$ , since $f-g$ is a polynomial. Furthermore, we define $f(x)$ to be zero for $x$ outside $[0, 1]$ . Then $f$ is uniformly continuous on the whole line. [How is $f$ uniformly continuous? How to show this rigorously?] We put $$\tag{47}  Q_n(x) = c_n \left( 1- x^2 \right)^n \qquad (n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots), $$ where $c_n$ is chosen so that $$ \tag{48} \int_{-1}^1 Q_n(x) \ \mathrm{d} x = 1 \qquad (n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots). $$ We need some information about the order of magnitude of $c_n$ . Since $$ 
\begin{align} 
\int_{-1}^1 \left( 1-x^2 \right)^n \ \mathrm{d} x &= 2 \int_0^1 \left( 1-x^2 \right)^n \ \mathrm{d} x \\
 &\geq 2 \int_0^{1/\sqrt{n}} \left( 1-x^2 \right)^n \ \mathrm{d} x \\
&\geq 2 \int_0^{1/\sqrt{n}} \left( 1- n x^2 \right) \ \mathrm{d} x \\
&= \frac{4}{3 \sqrt{n} } \\
&> \frac{1}{ \sqrt{n} }, 
\end{align}
$$ it follows from (48) that $$ \tag{49} c_n < \sqrt{n}. $$ The inequality $\left( 1-x^2 \right)^n \geq 1-nx^2$ which we used above is easily shown to be true by considering the function $$ \left( 1- x^2 \right)^n - 1+nx^2 $$ which is zero at $x= 0$ and whose derivative is positive in $(0, 1)$ . For any $\delta > 0$ , (49) implies $$ \tag{50} Q_n(x) \leq \sqrt{n} \left( 1- \delta^2 \right)^n \qquad ( \delta \leq \lvert x \rvert \leq 1), $$ so that $Q_n \to 0$ uniformly in $\delta \leq \lvert x \rvert \leq 1$ . [Is this fact really needed in this proof?] Now set $$ \tag{51}  P_n(x) = \int_{-1}^1 f(x+t) Q_n (t) \ \mathrm{d} t \qquad (0 \leq x \leq 1). $$ Our assumptions about $f$ show, by a simple change of variable, that $$ P_n(x) = \int_{-x}^{1-x} f(x+t) Q_n(t) \ \mathrm{d} t = \int_0^1 f(t) Q_n(t-x) \ \mathrm{d} t, $$ and the last integral is clearly a polynomial in $x$ . [How to demonstrate this explicitly?] Thus $\left\{ P_n \right\}$ is a sequence of polynomials, which are real if $f$ is real. Given $\varepsilon > 0$ , we choose $\delta > 0$ such that $\lvert y-x \rvert < \delta$ implies $$ \lvert f(y) - f(x) \rvert < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}. $$ Let $M = \sup \lvert f(x) \rvert$ . Using (48), (50), and the fact that $Q_n(x) \geq 0$ , we see that for $0 \leq x \leq 1$ , $$ 
\begin{align}
& \ \ \  \left\lvert P_n(x) - f(x) \right\rvert \\ 
&= \left\lvert \int_{-1}^1 [ f(x+t) - f(x) ] Q_n(t) \ \mathrm{d} t \right\rvert \\
&\leq \int_{-1}^1 \lvert f(x+t) - f(x) \rvert Q_n(t) \ \mathrm{d} t \\
&\leq 2M \int_{-1}^{-\delta} Q_n(t) \ \mathrm{d} t + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \int_{-\delta}^\delta Q_n(t) \ \mathrm{d} t + 2 M \int_\delta^1 Q_n(t) \ \mathrm{d} t \\
&\leq 4M \sqrt{n} \left( 1 - \delta^2 \right)^n + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
&< \varepsilon
\end{align}
$$ for all large enough $n$ , which proves the theorem. [In the hindsight, I think in the last chain we are better served with a $\delta$ such that $0 < \delta < 1$ .

There are many books where proof of this has been discussed but none of the books I have seen has proof that I feel excited. So, I am trying to produce another proof which I think is most natural. Let $p\in M$ . As $F$ is a map of constant rank, $dF_p:T_pM\rightarrow T_{F(p)}(N)$ is of rank $r$ . A Linear algebra results says that, in this case, there exists basis for $T_pM$ and a basis for $T_{F(p)}(N)$ such that $dF_p:T_pM\rightarrow T_{F(p)}N$ is represented by matrix $\begin{bmatrix}I_r&0\\0&0\end{bmatrix}$ i.e., it is given by $$(v_1,\cdots,v_r,v_{r+1},\cdots,v_m)\rightarrow (v_1,\cdots,v_r,0,\cdots,0).$$ I am almost sure that the basis of $T_pM$ and the basis of $T_{F(p)}N$ that we choose above corresponds to charts around $p$ and $F(p)$ respectively. I will try to elaborate what I said. How do we think of a basis of tangent space at a point? Given $p\in M$ , we take any chart $(U,\varphi)$ around that point given by $\varphi=(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$ and then see that $$\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_p:1\leq i\leq n\right\}$$ is a basis for $T_pM$ . Now I am hoping to trace back. Given a basis of $T_pM$ can we trace back to obtain a chart $(U,\varphi)$ at $p$ . Suppose we could find that charts $(U,\varphi)$ at $p$ and $(V,\psi)$ at $F(p)$ such that the corresponding basis at tangent spaces is the choice of basis that we have made above. Let $(U,\varphi=(x_1,\cdots,x_m))$ be chart based at $p$ . Then $\{\partial/\partial x_i|_p:1\leq i\leq m\}$ is the basis of $T_pM$ that we have mentioned above and similarly $(V,\psi=(y_1,\cdots,y_n))$ be chart based at $F(p)$ and $\{\partial/\partial y_j|_{F(p)}:1\leq i\leq n\}$ is the basis of $T_{F(p)}N$ that we have mentioned above. So, we have $$dF_p(a_1,\cdots,a_m)=(a_1,\cdots,a_r,0,\cdots,0).$$ So, $$dF_p\left(\sum_{i=1}^ma_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_p\right)
