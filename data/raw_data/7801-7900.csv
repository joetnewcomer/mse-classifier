59016,$A\in M_n(\mathbb C)$ invertible and non-diagonalizable matrix. Prove $A^{2005}$ is not diagonalizable,"$A\in M_n(\mathbb C)$ invertible and non-diagonalizable matrix. I need to prove that $A^{2005}$ is not diagonalizable as well. I am asked as well if Is it true also for  $A\in M_n(\mathbb R)$. (clearly a question from 2005). This is what I did: If $A\in M_n(\mathbb C)$ is invertible so $0$ is not an eigenvalue, We can look on its Jordan form, Since we under $\mathbb C$, and it is nilpotent for sure since $0$ is not an eigenvalue, and it has at least one 1 in it's semi-diagonal. Let $P$ be the matrix with Jordan base, so $P^{-1}AP=J$ and $P^{-1}A^{2005}P$ but it leads me nowhere. I tried to suppose that $A^{2005}$ is diagonalizable and than we have this $P^{-1}A^{2005}P=D$
When D is diagonal and we can take 2005th root out of each eigenvalue, but how can I show that this is what A after being diagonalizable suppose to look like, for as contradiction? Thanks",['linear-algebra']
59019,A question on group extensions,"Let $N=\langle x_1, \ldots, x_m; \mathbf{r}\rangle$ and $H=\langle y_1, \ldots, y_n; \mathbf{s}\rangle$ ( $m$ and $n$ can be infinite). Then if we define, $G=\langle x_1, \ldots, y_1, \ldots; \mathbf{r}, \mathbf{s}, x_i^{y_j}=x_i\phi_j\rangle$ where $\phi_j\in Aut(N)$ for all $j=1, \ldots, n$ we get a short exact sequence, $$1\rightarrow \overline{N}\rightarrow G\rightarrow H\rightarrow 1$$ where $\overline{N}=\langle x_1, \ldots, x_m\rangle$ . (Basically, pin two groups together via an automorphism of one of them.) My questions are these: -Is it true that $\overline{N}\cong N$ ? -If $\overline{N}\cong N$ , does it hold that $G=N\rtimes H$ ? -Do the above two questions hold if we stipulate that the $\phi_j$ arise in the natural way from a map $\langle y_1, \ldots, y_n\rangle\rightarrow Aut(N)?$ If these do not hold, does anyone know of a reference which explores when they do or do not?","['group-extensions', 'group-theory']"

59091,Inverse of the Grothendieck group construction?,"Is there an ""inverse"" of the Grothendieck group construction that would generate a (somehow ""simplest"") Abelian semigroup given some (suitably qualified, if necessary) Abelian group?  (I realize that any Abelian group is already an Abelian semigroup, but this is not very satisfying...  I'm trying to get at the ""simplest"" semigroup that will generate a given Abelian group when one applies the Grothendieck construction to it.  So this ""reverse construction"" should, e.g., yield $\mathbf{N}^+$ (i.e. the positive integers) when applied to $\mathbf{Z}$, not simply produce $\mathbf{Z}$  back.) Thx EDIT2: Please read the comments on this post by Theo and Arturo before spending any time on it; it looks like the wording of my question is not right, but I'll need to do some more research to fix it... EDIT: As I wrote in a comment below, this question was motivated by a passing remark I came across about a ""well-known"" one-to-one correspondence between cancellative Abelian semigroups and ordered Abelian groups.  Judging from the brief, informal account I read of this correspondence, it looked to me like the semigroup $\to$ group half was just the construction of the Grothendieck group from the semigroup, although it was not explicitly named as such.  And since this correspondence was described as being bijective, I figured that there may be an inverse construction, which, at least in this special case (partially ordered Abelian group $\to$ cancellative Abelian semigroup), could be construed as a sort of inverse of the Grothendieck group construction.  The citation given for all this is a 1940 paper by Clifford, which I don't have access to (beyond the first page), and even if I did, it may not be of much help to me, since its abstract states that the paper gives no proofs, and instead refers the reader to another paper (which I think is this one ), even further out of my reach, and in German, a language I can read only with a lot of help from the dictionary...","['grothendieck-construction', 'semigroups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

59126,Proof of Green's third identity,"I don't completely understand the proof of the following result, which is also called Green's third identity: Let $D\subset{\mathbb R^m}$ be a bounded domain of class $C^1$ and let $u\in C^2(\bar{D})$ be harmonic in $D$. Then
  $$u(x)=\int_{\partial D}\bigg\{\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}(y)\Phi(x,y)-u(y)\frac{\partial \Phi(x,y)}{\partial\nu}\bigg\}ds(y),\quad x\in D$$

For $x\in D$ choose a sphere $\Omega(x;r):=\{y\in{\mathbb R}^m:|y-x|=r\}$ of radius $r$ such that $\Omega(x;r)\subset D$ and direct the unit normal $\nu$ to $\Omega(x;r)$ into the interior of $\Omega(x;r)$.

Now we have
$$
\int_{\Omega(x;r)}\bigg\{u(y)\frac{\partial\Phi(x,y)}{\partial\nu(y)}-\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}(y)\Phi(x,y)\bigg\}ds(y)=\int_{\partial D}\bigg\{\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}(y)\Phi(x,y)-u(y)\frac{\partial\Phi(x,y)}{\partial\nu(y)}\bigg\}ds(y)

59161,Calculations of angles between bonds in CH₄ (Methane) molecule,"In my high school chemistry class, we talked about the angles between bonds in molecules. One that caught my attention was the CH₄ molecule. I asked my teacher how to calculate this result, he said that I would learn it in my math classes, so I put my curiosity on hold. I am going into my second year of university and I still have not been able to prove it. I tackled the problem in 2 ways: First I tried to view the problem as an optimization problem. In this case, placing four points on a sphere as to minimize their distance. This is not working for me since I am having trouble coming up with the actual function. Secondly, I tried studying a specific case of n points on a circle and generalizing from there. I found an interesting link between representation of roots in the Cauchy-Argand plane and the minimum spacing of n points on a circle, but I could no rigorously prove it. Even if I could, I have no idea how to extend the Cauchy-Argand plane to 3 dimensions. I have a ''hunch'' that manifolds are a natural fit here but I am not sure.

59195,Calculating the Similarity of n-dimensional Vectors,"What's doing guys? I was going to post this on MathOverflow initially, but got scared off by their FAQ, haha. Apologies in advance if I butcher any of the terminology; I majored in math in undergrad but a lot of that knowledge left me like water through a sieve. So, what I've been playing with are similarity calculations for n-dimensional vectors. Specifically, cosine similarity. What I start out with are multiple arrays/matrices/sets. For example: SetN = { red, white, blue }

Set1 = { 30, 25, 25 }
Set2 = { 20, 18, 6 } Where the individual elements represent frequency, e.g. for Set1, there were 30 instances of red, 25 instances of white, and 25 instances of blue, and so on. The examples above are simplified, and the actual sets I'm working with have exponential distributions and other complications. This necessitates other questions which I will save for StackExchange. At the moment though, what I want to figure out is if I am calculating the cosine similarity correctly because with certain sets, I get answers that look plain wrong. SetX = { 20, 0, 0 }
SetY = { 20, 20, 20 }

Norm = |( red, white, blue )| = sqrt( red^2 + white^2 + blue^2 ) Then I use the norm to convert the sets to unit vectors by dividing each element in the set: uvX = { 1, 0, 0 }
uvY = { 1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3), 1/sqrt(3) } Then, I find the dot product to calculate the cosine similarity, and I get 1/sqrt(3). Which comes out to: 57.7%. The thing is, even taking into account that I normalized the vectors to unit vectors, 20 units of red in Set X does not seem like 57.7% of Set Y with 20 red, 20 white, and 20 blue. It seems like the similarity figure is a bit too large. Are my calculations botched? Or is there some kind of mental illusion I'm failing to see here.","['statistics', 'matrices']"

Recently, I've proved the following theorem: If the chain $(\xi_n)_{n\geq 0}$ has the Feller property and the following conditions are satisfied: (i) for all $f\in C(X)$ with bounded support the family $\{U^n f: n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is equicontinuous in each point of $X$, (ii) the family of measures $\{P^n(x, \cdot): n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is tight, for any $x\in X$, (iii) there is a point $z\in X$ such that $\bigwedge\limits_{\delta>0}\, \bigvee\limits_{N\in\mathbb{N}}\,\bigwedge\limits_{x\in X}\,P^N(x,B(z,\delta))>0$, then, there is an unique probabilistic invariant measure for $(\xi_n)_{n\geq 0}$ and $(P^n(x,\cdot))_{n\geq1}$ converges to $\pi$ weakly and uniformly in $x$ from compact subsets of X. I have problems with two things: Does the sequence $(P^n \mu)_{n\geq 1}$ also converge weakly to $\pi$, for any probabilistic measure $\mu$ on $X$? (I know, that the set of point measures is dense in space of all probabilistic measures with weak topology, but I cant use it without the nonexpansivity $P$ in the total variation norm).

59271,Geometrical meaning of automorphisms of cyclic groups,"I'm looking for a geometrical interpretation of the action of automorphisms of cyclic groups. I'll take one particular example to make it clear : I'm taking the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, which has $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ as it automorphism group. Considering the integers modulo 12, the automorphisms are the multiplications by 1, 5, 7 or 11. I'm considering now the action of $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ on a discretized circle of 12 points in a plane (an dodecagon). The action of multiplying by 11 (left figure below) corresponds to a geometrical reflection in the plane, and I recover the dihedral group of symmetries of the dodecagon. However, multiplication by 5 or 7 sends shapes drawn on this circle to different shapes, and I find no obvious geometrical meaning to these. Is there any ? (For example in the right figure above, the action of multiplying by 5 on the purple triangle gives the green triangle, with no obvious relation between them)

Finding alternate references on this topic only seems to add to the confusion as there doesn't

be able to clarify just one simple aspect of this which is as follows: Let $u = \{u_1, \dots, u_n \}$ and and $w = \{w_1, \dots, w_n\}$ be bases for a vector space $V$. Then,
necessarily, there exists a unique linear operator $T:V \rightarrow V$ such that $T(u_i) = w_i$. Now,
the most natural thing in the world to call the matrix of this operator is the change of basis matrix from $u$ to $w$. Give this operator a vector in $u$ and it spits out a vector in $w$. Now, whether it is correct I don't
know, but I've seen the matrix of this operator called the change of basis matrix from $w$ to $u$, reversing the target and source bases. This latter interpretation makes no sense because
because it takes vectors in $u$ and produces vectors in $w$! I've seen this interpretation in more than
one place so it can't just be a fluke. So...which is it?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'change-of-basis']"

59448,"Elementary Group Theory, Sylow Theorems","So it's time for me to post another elementary question. I've been stuck on this exercise for quite some time now, and really can't find a satisfactory solution for this. The section on applications of Sylow theorems in my book is kind of concise, and maybe there is some trivial fact I'm missing. If $G$ is a group of order 60 that has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, prove that $G$ also has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup. Attempts: I'll denote the set of Sylow $p$-subgroups by $S_p$ and the given normal Sylow 3-subgroup by $N$. By Sylow Theorems, we know that $|S_5| = 1$ or $6$. In the first case, Sylow 5-subgroup must be normal, so I've tried to assume that $|S_5| = 6$ and somehow derive a contradiction. Since $N$ is normal in $G$, quotient group $G/N$ exists, and must have order 20. Function $f: G \rightarrow G/N$ is then our homomorphism between $G$ and it's quotient group. By inspection and ordinary counting arguments we can see that $|S_5| = 1$ in $G/N$, so there are only four elements (cosets) of order 5 in $G/N$. Assuming that $|S_5| = 6$, then we have 24 elements of order 5 in $G$. Then $f$ should map these to a coset which s order is dividing the order of 5, but that is only 1 or 5. Because index of $N$ in $G$ is 20, we get that there are 3 elements in each coset. Then we would have space for at most 15 elements in the cosets of order 1 or 5 in $G/N$, yet by assumption $G$ has 24 elements of order 5. Am I on the right way? Is there a trivial way to prove this? I've had no bigger problems with other exercises surrounding this one, so I guess there might be a trivial way of proving this. Attempt 2: If $N$ is the normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then $G/N$ exists and we established there exists a normal Sylow 5-subgroup $T$ of $G/N$. By Correspondence theorem $T$ is on the form $H/N$, where $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ containing $N$. Since $|H| = |H/N||N|$, I deduce $|H|=15$. Since $H/N$ is normal, quotient $(G/N)/(H/N)$ exists and is by third isomorphism theorem isomorphic to $G/H$. So if $G/H$ exists, then $H$ must be normal of $G$. We see, since $|H| = 15$, that it contains a single normal Sylow 5-subgroup. Now since the Sylow 5-subgroup I'm looking for is contained in the normal subgroup $H$, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of $H$ must be same as in $G$ because of the Second Sylow Theorem and normality of $H$. I this the correct solution? edit: Actually I think I've made a mistake in the italic part. $(G/N)/(H/N)$ certainly exists, but does not need to be isomorphic to $G/H$ (?). The theorem I've used assumes normality of H, so I end up in circular logic.","['self-learning', 'group-theory']"

Firstly, in terms of tangencies and intersections, what precisely is a turn? Secondly, can this be seen via inversive geometry in an analogous way to Soddy's hexlet ($r=s=1$, $p=3$, $q=6$)? Inversion preserves tangencies, and sends spheres intersecting the center of inversion to planes, so for Soddy's hexlet we can invert about any tangent point of the first ring of $3$ spheres so that we get two parallel planes and a sphere stuck between them, reducing the problem of finding the interlocking ring of spheres to the annular case, which is equivalent to working with a Steiner chain (or more specifically the kissing number problem ), and the $p=4$, $q=4$ case can be reduced similarly. $\hskip 0.2in$ There doesn't appear to be any reference for this, as MathWorld cites a ""personal communication.""",['geometry']

Following article describes his work in his own words. http://www.amnh.org/nationalcenter/youngnaturalistawards/2011/aidan.html In 1754, a naturalist named Charles Bonnet observed that plants sprout
  branches and leaves in a pattern, called phyllotaxis. Bonnet saw that
  tree branches and leaves had a mathematical spiral pattern that could
  be shown as a fraction. The amazing thing is that the mathematical
  fractions were the same numbers as the Fibonacci sequence! On the oak
  tree, the Fibonacci fraction is 2/5, which means that the spiral takes
  five branches to spiral two times around the trunk to complete one
  pattern. Other trees with the Fibonacci leaf arrangement are the elm
  tree (1/2); the beech (1/3); the willow (3/8) and the almond tree
  (5/13) (Livio, Adler). I'm facing difficulty in understanding highlighted statement. He says fibonacci fraction for 2/5 means that spiral takes five branches to siral two times around the trunk. Implies, Angle between each branch is 720/5 = 144 degrees. But the kid says, The pattern was about 137 degrees and the Fibonacci sequence was 2/5.

59661,Proportion of spanning trees in a network in a social media messaging context,"Consider a graph, such as the following: I'm considering a model of message propagation ( e.g. re-tweeting) in this network, starting from a root node ( e.g. the node 1 in the lower-left). I'm modelling the message propagation in terms of trees rooted at the message source, where a node v is a parent to another node w if w first hears the message from v . The message propagates outward from 1 , in a tree which ""grows"" in an iterative process. In this process, nodes which have been reached are either branching nodes ( i.e. are the parent of some other node), live leaves (nodes which may become branch nodes), or dead leaves . Initially, all the neighbors of node 1 are children of 1 , and are live leaves. The message propagates by iterations, as follows. We consider an arbitrary ordering L = (ℓ 1 , ..., ℓ n ) of the live leaves at the beginning of the iteration. For each 1 ≤ j ≤ n, we do the following: Decide whether the node ℓ j dies (doesn't propagate the message) or becomes a branch node (propagates the message). If all of the nodes adjacent to ℓ j are already in the tree, then it dies by default. If ℓ j becomes a branch node, we attach every neighbor v of ℓ j which is not already in the tree to ℓ j , as a live leaf node for the following iteration. After iterating through the elements of L , we proceed to the next iteration. If there are no more live leaves in the tree, we stop. For the graph above, here are the trees that may be generated by this process: I'm interested in considering how many of the trees which can be generated by this process are spanning trees , i.e. contain every node in the graph. Is there any formula to determine the ratio of the spanning trees to the total number of such trees? N.B. The construction above is similar to a Galton-Watson process. However, there isn't meant to be a probabilistic model underlying the growth; the above is meant only to implicity  describe a recursive process to recognise whether a subtree in the graph is valid in my model. I've added the probability tag just in case there is a useful approach from that direction. Thanks!","['graph-theory', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

59733,definition of a groupoid,"Notation: Underlining $\underline{G}$ denotes a category and $\underline{G}(x,y)$ the class of morphisms from $x$ to $y$. On the Wiki page about groupoids, it is written (I write here my own more concise version): Algebraic Definition: A partial function $f:X\to Y$ is a function $f:A\to Y$ for some $\emptyset\neq A\subseteq X$. A groupoid is a set $G$ with a unary operation $^{-1}:G\to G$ and a partial function  $\ast:G\times G \to G$ that satisfy the following axiomatic properties for arbitrary  $a,b,c\in G$: (associativity) If $a\ast b$ and $b\ast c$ are
defined, then $(a\ast b)\ast c$ and $a\ast(b\ast c)$ are defined and
equal. Conversely, if either of these last two expressions is
defined, then so is the other, and again they are equal. (inverses) $a^{-1}\!\ast a$ and $a\ast
    a^{-1}$ are always defined. (identity) If $a\ast b$ is defined, then $a\ast b\ast b^{-1} \!= a$ and $a^{-1}\!\ast a\ast b = b$.   (1. and 2. already show that these expressions are defined.) In short: $(a\ast b)\ast c = a\ast(b\ast c)$; $\forall a \;\,\exists\, a^{-1}\!\ast a \;\,\exists\, a\ast a^{-1}$; $a\ast b\ast b^{-1} \!= a$ and $a^{-1}\!\ast a\ast b = b$. From these axioms, two easy and convenient properties follow: $(a^{-1})^{-1} \!= a$; If $a\ast b$ is defined, then $(a\ast b)^{-1}\! = b^{-1}\!\ast a^{-1}$. Category-Theoretic Definition: A groupoid $\underline{G}$ is a small category (i.e. its class of objects $\underline{G}$ and its class of morphisms $\mathrm{Hom}_{\underline{G}}$ are sets) in which every morphism is an isomorphism (i.e. is invertible). Thus a groupoid is equipped with the composition $\circ$ and invertion $^-$ of morphisms. Comparing the Definitions: Both definitions are equivalent, as follows. Given a category-theoretic groupoid $\underline{G}$, let $G$ be the set of all morphisms of $\underline{G}$. Then $\circ$ becomes a partially defined operation on $G$, and $^-$ is in fact defined everywhere. Therefore we take $\ast:=\circ$ and $^{-1}:=^-$ and obtain an algebraic groupoid. Conversely, given an algebraic groupoid $G$, define the objects of a category $\underline{G}$ as $\{x\ast x^{-1};\:x\!\in\!G\}$ and define $\underline{G}(x,y)$ as  $\{f\!\in\!G;\:y\ast f\ast x\text{ is defined}\}$. Then $^{-1}$ and $\ast$ break up into several functions on the various $\underline{G}(x,y)$, which may be called $^-$ and $\circ$, respectively. EDIT: the notation in this paragraph is confusing; see answers. Question 1: What are the details of the last paragraph? Why are objects $x\ast x^{-1}$ and not just $x$? How do we compose two morphisms $f$ and $g$, when we know $z\ast g\ast y$ and $y\ast f\ast x$ exist? As $g\ast y\ast f$? Or just $g\ast f$? What are the identity morphisms? Comment: I realise this is an elementary question, but it is surprisingly hard to find anything in the books about groupoids. Almost no Abstract Algebra book contains anything about groupoids. I'm dealing with this notion for the first time. The only book I located that deals with groupoids is Topology and Groupoids by Ronald Brown, but I can't seem to find the algebraic definition in it. Question 2: What is a subgroupoid ? A subcategory that is itself a groupoid? What is a groupoid homomorphism ? An arbitrary functor between groupoids? Question 3: (a too broad question, I know, but anything will be useful) Are there any alternate definitions of a groupoid? I'm aiming for one that is used most often throughout mathematics nowadays. How/in what fields are groupoids most often used? Algebraic topology? Are they given topological structure?

Is it true that also $\operatorname{int}{(tA+(1-t)A)} \neq \emptyset$ for $t \in(0,1)$? It is clear for $t=\frac{1}{2}$? But in general?

59791,Do there exist groups whose elements of finite order do not form a subgroup? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Closed 12 years ago . Possible Duplicate: Examples and further results about the order of the product of two elements in a group I was browsing around, and came across the little exercise that elements of finite order in an abelian group form a subgroup. This was easy enough, but now I'm wondering, are there cases of groups where this is not true? I'm thinking that if there are, these groups are necessarily nonabelian and infinite, since if the group is finite the elements of finite order would be the whole group anyway. I also noticed that if an element $a$ has order $n$, then so does $a^{-1}$, so to find such a group I would need to two elements of finite order whose composition does not have finite order. The two infinite nonabelian groups I could think of off the top of my head were $\textbf{GL}_n(R)$ and $\textbf{SL}_n(R)$, but I had trouble finding a pair of elements satisfying the above property. Does anyone have an example of such a group and a pair of elements which prove it? Thank you.","['big-list', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
59795,Proof of 1 = 0 by Mathematical Induction on Limits?,"I got stuck with a problem that pop up in my mind while learning limits. I am still a high school student. Define $P(m)$ to be the statement: $\quad \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}(\underbrace{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}_{m})=0$ The statement holds for $m = 1$: $\quad \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}=0$. Assume that $P(k)$ holds for some $k$. So put $m = k$: $\quad \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}(\underbrace{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}_{k})=0$. We prove $P(k + 1)$: $\quad \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}(\underbrace{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}_{k+1}) =\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}(\underbrace{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}_{k}+\frac{1}{n})$ $=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}(\underbrace{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}_{k}) +\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}$ $=0+0=0$. It has now been proved by mathematical induction that statement holds for all natural m. If we let $m=n$, then $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}(\underbrace{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}_{n})=0 \tag{*}$. However, $\underbrace{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}_{n}=1 \implies \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}(\underbrace{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}_{n})=1 \tag{$\dagger$}$. Then $(*) \, \& \, (\dagger)$ yield $1=0$? Can anybody explain this? thanks.","['fake-proofs', 'induction', 'limits']"

$$ to the 2001st power. But can't see how without calculating. Any tip? I have the ""feeling"" that given that 1 only changes on its sig then its the same the power of 3 that the power of 2001 but I'm not sure. I'm correct?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

59816,Why is the set of commutators not a subgroup?,"I was surprised to see that one talks about the subgroup generated by the commutators, because I thought the commutators would form a subgroup. Some research told me that it's because commutators are not necessarily closed under product (books by Rotman and Mac Lane popped up in a google search telling me). However, I couldn't find an actual example of this. What is one? The books on google books made it seem like an actual example is hard to explain. Wikipedia did mention that the product $[a,b][c,d]$ on the free group on $a,b,c,d$ is an example. But why? I know this product is $aba^{-1}b^{-1}cdc^{-1}d^{-1}$, but why is that not a commutator in this group?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
