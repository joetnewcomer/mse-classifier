1261756,"Explicit homotopy equivalence of homogeneous spaces $O(2n)/U(n)$ and $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})/GL(n,\mathbb{C})$","Exercise 2.25 of symplectic topology by McDuff and Salamon asks me to prove that $O(2n)/U(n)$ is homotopy equivalent to $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})/GL(n,\mathbb{C})$. They suggest to use the polar decomposition. I guess they mean something like this: if $A=PQ$, with $P$ positive definite, $Q$ orthogonal, then $P=\sqrt{AA^T}$, and $Q=(\sqrt{AA^T})^{-1}A$, so this decomposition is continuous in $A$. The obvious thing to try is then $$\Psi_t(A)=(AA^T)^{-t/2}A$$ This retracts $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$ to $O(2n)$. However, if I multiply $A$ by a matrix $B$, I have $$
\Psi_t(AB)=(ABB^TA^T)^{t/2}AB
$$ Now if $B$ is in $U(n)$ then I see that $\Psi_t(AB)=\Psi_t(A)B$ as $BB^T=1$, so it passes to a homotopy equivalence of the quotients $O(2n)/U(n)$ and $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})/U(n)$. This argument does not work for $B\in GL(n,\mathbb{C})$. What did McDuff and Salamon have in mind? ps: Note that I am not looking for another proof of the statement (see also Inclusion $O(2n)/U(n)\to GL(2n,\mathbb{R})/GL(n,\mathbb{C}) $ ). I think the following argument works: We have a diagram of fibrations $$\begin{array}{ccc} U(n) & \rightarrow & O(2n) &\rightarrow&O(2n)/U(n)\\
\downarrow &  & \downarrow &  & \downarrow & \\
GL(n,\mathbb{C}) & \rightarrow & GL(2n,\mathbb{R}) & \rightarrow & GL(2n,\mathbb{R})/GL(n,\mathbb{C}) \end{array}$$ The first two vertical maps are homotopy equivalences. Now the long exact sequence of homotopy groups, the five lemma, and Whitehead will finish the job. But I am looking for an explicit homotopy equivalence.","['symplectic-linear-algebra', 'lie-groups', 'linear-algebra', 'symplectic-geometry']"

1261779,Must be Bayes' theorem,"A professor gave me the following question a week earlier that he himself was doubtful about. I gave it quite a lot of thought but couldn't come up with any way to solve the question. Here it is:- $Q.$A wallet containing $16$ currency notes - $4$ each of $Rs. 10$, $Rs. 20$, $Rs. 50$ and $Rs. 100$ - is kept on a table in a dark room. The maid of the house steals $2$ notes from the wallet which are apparently not visible to her (i.e. she doesn't know which notes she has taken) and leaves the room. After some time the owner of the wallet comes into the room and draws $2$ notes from the wallet. After coming out of the room, he finds that the amount in his hand is $Rs. 200$. So find the probability that the notes the maid has stolen comprises of two $Rs. 100$ notes. During discussion of this question with my friends one of them said that since two $Rs. 100$ notes are surely left, the probability should be $$P=\frac {\binom 42}{\binom {14}2}=\frac 6{91}.$$ But the answer given is $\frac 1{91}$.

1261849,probability that the $100^{th}$ ball you pick is black given the details inside,"We begin with a bag containing 3 white balls and another 5 black balls.
After each ball is picked, it is returned AND you add to the bag another 4 balls of the same color. For example, the probability that the second ball I pick is black is:

1261862,Independence of sigma algebras of sigma algebras,"I have a bunch of questions all of which more or less fall under the subject in the title. The first one goes as follows. Let $E_1,E_2,\ldots,E_n$ be collections of measurable sets on $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$. Each $E_i$ is a $\pi$-system, i.e. closed under intersection. Suppose
$$P\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i \right) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(A_i)\tag{1}$$ for all $A_1 \in E_1, \ldots, A_n \in E_n$. Show that the $\sigma$-algebras $\sigma(E_1),\ldots, \sigma(E_n)$ are independent. Here is my attempt. I define $$L = \{A_1 \times A_2 \times\ldots\times A_n : A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n \in \mathcal{F} \text{ and (1) holds}  \}$$
My plan is to show that $L$ is a $\lambda$-system. Once I do that I will argue as follows. By hypothesis $L$ contains $E_1\times E_2 \times \ldots \times E_n$. Due to the $\pi-\lambda$ lemma, it must also contain $\sigma(E_1\times E_2 \times \ldots \times E_n)$, which in turn contains $\sigma(E_1)\times\sigma(E_2) \times \ldots \times \sigma(E_n)$. I am stuck at showing that $L$ is a $\lambda$-system. I know the definition of a $\lambda$-system but applying it to products of sets confuses me. The second question looks somewhat obvious but my main claim looks dubious to me.
Let $\{\mathcal{A}_i : i \in \mathcal{I}\}$ be a collection of independent $\sigma$-algebras. Let $\mathcal{I}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{I}_n$ be pairwise disjoint subsets of $\mathcal{I}$. Define $\mathcal{B}_i = \sigma(\mathcal{A}_j: j \in \mathcal{I}_i)$. Show that $\mathcal{B}_1,\mathcal{B}_2,\ldots,\mathcal{B}_n$ are independent. I first claim the following. 
$$B_i \in \mathcal{B}_i \Rightarrow \exists \{A_{i,j}: A_{i,j} \in \mathcal{A}_j, j \in \mathcal{I}_i \text{ and } \cap_{j\in\mathcal{I}_i} = B_i\}$$ 
In words, if a set is in $\mathcal{B}_i$, I must be able to express it as the intersection of some sets coming from the $\sigma$-algebras that generate  $\mathcal{B}_i$. If this is true, then the rest is easy. Measure theoretic stuff can be really counter-intuitive sometimes (or in my case, rather often :) so I don't know if this claim is true.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"

1261868,"If a group G is isomorphic to H, prove that Aut(G) is isomorphic to Aut(H)","If a group G is isomorphic to H, prove that Aut(G) is isomorphic to Aut(H) Properties of Isomorphisms acting on groups: Suppose that $\phi$ is an isomorphism from a group G onto a group H, then: 1. $\phi^{-1}$ is an isomorphism from H onto G. 2. G is Abelian if and only if H is Abelian 3. G is cyclic if and only if H is cyclic. 4. If K is a subgroup of G, the $\phi$(K)={$\phi$(k)|k$\in$K} is a subgroup of H. 5. If L is a subgroup of H, then $\phi^{-1}$L={g$\in$G|$\phi$(g)$\in$L} is a subgroup of G. 6. $\phi$(Z(G))=Z(H) Steps to proving G is isomorphic to H: Define a function $\phi$ from G to H Prove that $\phi$ is one-to-one Prove that $\phi$ is onto Show that $\phi (ab)=\phi (a)\phi (b)$ for all $a,b\in G$ Proof: Suppose that $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ is an isomorphism. Since G is a group, it has elements $a,b\in G$ such that $ab\in G$.$\space \space$H is a group as well.$\space \space$Therefore, $\phi(a)=x\in H$, $\phi(b)=y\in H$, and $\phi(a)\phi(b)=\phi(ab)=xy\in H$.  Thus $\phi$ is one-to-one and operation preserving. For any element $h\in H$, there is a $g\in G$ such that $\phi(g)=h$, so $\phi$ is onto. The isomorphism has an inverse operation $\phi^{-1}:H\rightarrow G$ such that $\phi^{-1}(h)=g\in G$. Similarly, $\psi(a)=r\in G$, $\psi(b)=s\in G$, and $\psi(a)\psi(b)=\psi(ab)=rs\in G$.  Thus $\psi$ is one-to-one and operation preserving. For any element $\bar g\in G$, there is a $g\in G$ such that $\psi(g)=\bar g$, so $\psi$ is onto.$\space \space$So $\psi$ is an automorphism on G.

1261872,Proving exactness of the conormal sequence,"Problem : Let $\phi \colon A \to B$ be a surjective homomorphism of $R$-algebras with kernel $I$. I want to show that the conormal sequence $$
I/I{}^2 \longrightarrow B \otimes_A \Omega_{A/R} \longrightarrow \Omega_{B/R} \longrightarrow 0

is an exact sequence of $B$-modules, where $\Omega_{A/R}$ is the module of Kähler-Differentials (see below for a construction) of $A$ with differential $d$ and the maps are given by $[f] \mapsto 1 \otimes d(f)$ and $b \otimes d(a) \mapsto bd(\phi(a))$ respectively. My Attempt : It's pretty clear that the middle map is surjective, so all that is left to show is
$$ (*) \qquad \ker\left(B \otimes_A \Omega_{A/R} \longrightarrow \Omega_{B/R} \right) = \text{im}\left(I/I{}^2 \longrightarrow B \otimes_A \Omega_{A/R} \right). $$
Construct $\Omega_{A/R}$ as the quotient of the free $A$-module with generators $\widetilde{d}(a)$ for $a \in A$ divided by the submodule  $\text{Rel}_{A/R}$ generated by the elements
$$ \widetilde{d}(a + a') - \widetilde{d}(a) - \widetilde{d}(a'), \qquad \widetilde{d}(r \cdot 1_A), \qquad \widetilde{d}(aa') - a\widetilde{d}(a') - a'\widetilde{d}(a)$$
for all $a,a'\in A$, $r \in R$, let $d$ be the composition $A \to \oplus_{a \in A} \widetilde{d}(a)A \to \Omega_{A/R}$. Using the right-exactness of the tensor product and the same construction for $\Omega_{B/R}$ we get the following commutative diagram with exact rows $$ B \otimes_A \text{Rel}_{A/R} \longrightarrow B \otimes_A \bigoplus\nolimits_{a \in A} \widetilde{d}(a)A \longrightarrow B \otimes_A \Omega_{A/R} \longrightarrow 0 $$

$$ b \otimes d(a) \in \ker\left(B \otimes_A \Omega_{A/R} \to \Omega_{B/R}\right) \iff b \widetilde{d}(\phi(a)) \in \text{Rel}_{B/R}. $$ So we are pretty close to $(*)$. Am I done yet? Is it enough to consider these elementary tensor elements (instead of linear combinations of elements of $B$).

1261891,The sum $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \min_{k\le n}\{\alpha k\}$ for irrational $\alpha$,"Let $\alpha$ be an irrational number. 
For every $n$ let $z_n$ be the integer closest to the number $\alpha n$. Then we can define
$$A(\alpha):= \sum_{n=1}^\infty |\alpha n - z_n|.$$ We can also define somewhat similar quantity
$$B(\alpha):= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\alpha n - \lfloor \alpha n \rfloor \right).$$ $A(\alpha)$ and $B(\alpha)$ are sums of non-negative numbers, so the values can be real numbers of $+\infty$. EDIT: In fact, the above sums are clearly both equal to $+\infty$, since $n \alpha$ will be infinitely often arbitrarily close to and integer (and also to a number of the form $k+\frac12$, $k\in\mathbb Z$). See, for example, Multiples of an irrational number forming a dense subset (and several other posts on MSE). I have missed this obvious fact when posting the question. However the sums $A'(\alpha)$ and $B'(\alpha)$ described below might still be interesting. I left here the part about $A(\alpha)$ and $B(\alpha)$, since some users already posted some comments about these sums. If I edited the first part of the post away, those comments would not make sense. We can also make modifications where we replace the sequence with monotone sequences:
$$
\begin{align*}
A'(\alpha):=& \sum_{n=1}^\infty \min_{k\le n}|\alpha k - z_k|;\\
B'(\alpha):=& \sum_{n=1}^\infty \min_{k\le n} \left(\alpha k - \lfloor \alpha k \rfloor\right).\\
\end{align*}
$$ In some sense, these quantities tell us how far $\alpha$ is from rational numbers. (The monotone versions seem more closely related to question whether $\alpha$ is rational or irrational, since for rational $\alpha$ all but finitely many terms are zero, so the sum must be finite.) My question is: Were the numbers $A'(\alpha)$, $B'(\alpha)$ studied somewhere? Can they be calculated for some specific irrational numbers? For example, can we calculate them for $\alpha=\ln 2$, $\alpha=\sqrt2$, $\alpha=e$, $\alpha=\pi$ or some other well-know irrational numbers? Do we get $A'(\alpha)=\infty$ or $B'(\alpha)=\infty$ for some numbers? If yes, can such numbers be characterized? Are they related to irrationality measure or some other ways to measure how irrational a given number $\alpha$ is? To explain what lead me to these sums: I was thinking about question whether there is a counterexample to Minkowski's theorem for unbounded sets. (Such question was asked here . In the meantime I learned here that such example cannot be found.)
So I was trying to take a line $y=\alpha x$ which does not contain any lattice points. I tried to replace the segments of this line by wider rectangles - this lead me to try to compute how wide rectangles I can add without hitting some lattice point. This is related to the question how far are the points $(n,n\alpha)$ from lattice points.","['sequences-and-series', 'irrational-numbers']"

I essentially can't decide on a useful contour of integration (but also it has been a while since I needed complex analysis). Any help would be greatly appreciated. Edit: I'll take a semicircle around $z$. How would I bound the integral on the semicircular arc? For concreteness I define 
$$L_R = [x-iR, x+iR]\text{ and }C_R = \{x+Re^{iπ t} : t ∈[-1/2 ,1/2] \}$$
$∫_{L_R} \dots \d \xi → ∫_{x-i∞}^{x+i∞} \dots \d \xi$ so I need to show that $$\int_{C_R} \frac{F(\xi)}{\xi-z} \d \xi \xrightarrow[R→\infty]{} 0 $$ My attempt at finishing this:
\begin{align} \left|\int_{C_R} \frac{F(\xi)}{\xi-z} \d \xi \right| &\leq π R ∫_{-1/2}^{1/2} \left|\frac{F(x + Re^{iπ t})}{x+Re^{iπ t} - z}\right| \d t \leq C ∫_{-1/2}^{1/2} | F(x + Re^{iπ t}) | \ \d t

1262291,Analogs to vectors -- *unoriented* line segments,"A real vector can be thought of as an oriented line segment.  Linear algebra and multivariable calculus can be taken pretty far just by considering these types of objects (obviously there are generalizations to other vector spaces, but let's not worry about those). Using these oriented line segments, we can do several important things.  We can describe oriented subspaces of $\Bbb R^n$ build a calculus on them such that derivatives of paths tell you not only the tangent space but also ""which way a particle would move on this path"" in integration, it allows us to find oriented areas/ volumes/ etc Lots and lots more examples exist To me, though, the idea of orientation is just something extra and possibly unnecessary.  $\Bbb R^n$ isn't naturally endowed with an orientation -- we have to add one.  So could we devise a similar set of objects without the orientation?  So you'd just have a line segment, the derivative of a path would just give you the tangent space at a point, and integrals would just give you areas/ volumes/ etc. As I understand it, Descartes described geometry with just line segments.  And later Hermann Grassmann's father thought that a natural product of two line segments is just an area segment (like a bivector but without the orientation). This question partly comes from me thinking it would be nice if we could take integrals and not have to worry about the part of of the function above or beneath the $x$-axis -- we'd just get an area.  And it'd be nice if we didn't have to add an orientation onto a space to use differential area/ volume/ etc elements. And it'd be nice if we could use elementary calculus methods to integrate on non-orientable spaces. So my questions are: Could we develop a consistent system with these properties?  Would it be at all useful (maybe it'd be more complicated and completely subsumed by vector math)?  Has it already been done and I just haven't heard about it (if so, could you provide a source)?","['vectors', 'linear-algebra', 'multivariable-calculus']"

If $ a \leq x \leq b $ we have that $$F(x) = \int_{a}^x f(t) \ dt = \frac{x-a}{b-a}$$ If $ x > b$ the pdf says that $f(x) = 0$ here, so surely the cdf would be $$F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty 0 \ dt = 0 $$ but however it is equal to $1$.

1262322,Solving the probability of independent evnts without the complement,"Suppose that virus transmision in 500 acts of intercourse are mutually independent events and that the probability of transmission in any one act is $\frac{1}{500}$. What is the probability of infection? So I do know that one way to solve this is to find the probability of complement of the event we are trying to solve. Letting $C_1,C_2,C_3...C_{500}$ denote the events that a virus does not occur during encounters 1,2,....500. The probability of no infection is: $$P(C_1\cap C_2 \cap....\cap C_{500}) = (1 - (\frac{1}{500}))^{500} = 0.37$$ then to find the probability of infection I would just do : $1 - 0.37 = 0.63$ but my question is how would I find the probability not using the complement? I would have thought since the events are independent and each with probability of $\frac{1}{500}$ that if I multiplied each independet event I could obtain the value, but that is not the case. What am I forgetting to consider if I wanted to calculate this way?  I'm asking more so to have a fuller understanding of both sides of the coin. Edit: I think I may have figured out what I'm missing in my thinking. In the case of trying to figure out the probability of infection I have to take into account that infection could occur on the first transmission, or the second, or the third,...etc. Also transmission could occur on every interaction or on a few interactions but not all. So in each of these scenarios I would encounter some sort of combination of probabilities like $(\frac{499}{500})(\frac{499}{500})(\frac{1}{500})(\frac{499}{500})......(\frac{1}{500})$ as an example of one possible combination.","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'statistics']"

1263674,Is it possible to prove $g^{|G|}=e$ in all finite groups without talking about cosets? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Is there a way to prove that the order of an element in a group divides the order of the Group, WITHOUT USING LAGRANGE'S (2 answers) Closed 3 years ago . Let $G$ be a finite group, and $g$ be a an element of $G$. How could we go about proving $g^{|G|}=e$ without using cosets? I would admit Lagrange's theorem if a proof without talking about cosets can be found. I have a proof for abelian groups which basically consists in taking the usual proof of Euler's theorem and using it in a group, I do not know if it can be modified to work in arbitrary finite groups. The proof is as follows: the function from $G$ to $G$ that consists of mapping $h$ to $gh$ is a bijection. Therefore $\prod\limits_{h\in G}h=\prod\limits_{h\in G}gh$ but because of commutativity $\prod\limits_{h\in G}gh=\prod\limits_{h\in G}g\prod\limits_{h\in G}h=g^{|G|}\prod\limits_{h\in G}h$. So we have $\prod\limits_{h\in G}h=g^{|G|}\prod\limits_{h\in G}h$. The cancellation property yields $e=g^{|G|}$.

1263724,Two questions about the proof of Proposition V.2.2 in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry,"This proposition on page 370 is to prove any ruled surface over a nonsingular curve $C$ is $\bf{P}(\mathscr E)$, the projective space bundle of a locally free sheaf $\mathscr E$ of rank $2$ on $C$ and vice versa. In the direction that for a given rule surface $\pi:\, X \to C$, $X \cong \bf P(\mathscr E)$ over $C$, the proof uses the fact that $X$ admits a section $\sigma$. So define the divisor $D = \sigma(C)$ on $X$ and define $\mathscr E = \pi_*(\mathscr L(D))$, where $\mathscr L (D)$ is the sheaf on $X$ corresponding to the divisor $D$. Then $\mathscr E $ is locally free of rank $2$ on $C$ from Grauert's theorem and clearly there is a natural map $$\pi^*(\mathscr E) \to \pi^*(\pi_*(\mathscr L (D))) \to \mathscr L (D).$$ But then there are some parts I do not fully understand (here both $X$ and $C$ are defined over some algebraically closed field): To prove this map $\pi^*(\mathscr E) \to \mathscr L(D)$ is surjective, it says ''by Nakayama's lemma, it is enough to check this on any fiber $X_y$''. Here $y$ is any point on $C$. But I can not see how to use Nakayama's lemma in this case to prove the surjectivity provided the surjectivity is proved on any fiber $X_y$. After proving the surjectivity of the above morphism, we can say there is a morphism $g:\, X \to \bf P(\mathscr E)$ over $C$ with $\mathscr L(D) \cong g^*(\mathcal O_{\bf{P}(\mathscr E)}(1))$. I see $g$ is an isomorphism on any fibre because basically  in this case $g$ induces a morphism $g_y:\, \bf P^1 \to \bf P^1$ over any point $y$ in $C$  and since $\mathscr L(D)$ is very ample on any fiber, $g_y$ is a closed embedding hence an isomorphism. But I can not see why $g$ itself is an isomorphism. Maybe it is trivial. Thank you for anyone who can give me clues or details.",['algebraic-geometry']

After thinking about the problem for a moment, I've determined that the surface $z=0$ (the $xy$-plane) fits the bill for the first question. But this seems too easy, so I'm naturally skeptical. Would it be beneficial to come up with a nontrivial example (if one exists)? I don't believe that $D$ is involutive, since
$$
[X,Y]=X(1)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}-Y(1)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-Y(yz)\frac{\partial}{\partial z}=-z\frac{\partial}{\partial z},

1263856,Where did I got wrong with this surface integral,"It appears that I don't quite have surface integrals like I thought I did.  The following is a problem from the back of the book (not homework because it wasn't prescribed but I'm working it to learn).  Here's the problem: Integrate $G(x,y,z) = x + y + z$ over the surface cut from the first octant and the plane $2x + 2y + z = 2$.  This tells me that $S = F(x,y,z) = 2x + 2y + z = 2$ is implicitly given.  Therefore, my integrating formula is $\int \int_S G(x,y,z) d\sigma = \int \int_R G(x,y,z)\frac{\left| \nabla \mathbf{F} \right|}{\left| \nabla \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{p} \right|}$. For this problem, I have $\nabla \mathbf{F} = 2\mathbf{i} + 2 \mathbf{j} + \mathbf{k}$ and since the Region, $R$, I'm projecting onto is in the $xy$ plane, I'm using $\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{k}$.  Thus, $\nabla \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{p} = 1$.  Also, since this surface is given implicitly, I have $z = 2 - 2x - 2y$. Therefore, I have setting things up with $0 \le x \le 1$ and $0 \le x \le 1$: $$
\begin{array}{rcl}
\int \int_R G(x,y,z)\frac{\left| \nabla \mathbf{F} \right|}{\left| \nabla \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{p} \right|} & = & \int_0^1 \int_0^1 x + y + (2 - 2x - 2y)(\frac{\sqrt(3)}{1})dxdy \\

Deeper layers (stacking multiple compositions of these nonlinear activation functions) are known to produce ""more nonlinear"" approximations to the target output. If viewed as iterated maps, these nonlinear activation functions ($\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$) perform a ""squashing/folding"" operation. The forward-propagation of weights from layer to layer is like a ""stretching operation"", where layer activations are summed together to produce larger values. Then they are clamped / folded again, and so on across layers. This reminds me of iterated maps in chaotic systems, which also exhibit mixing behavior. Granted, the mappings from layer to layer are not exactly an iterated map because layers can have different sizes, but suppose that each layer is associated with a bijective function that projects the representation at that layer to a common basis $\mathbb{R}^a$ - then forward propagation is an iterated map. I noticed that each nonlinear activation function is quite unique with respect to how it squashes its input space:  tanh ""pinches"" $\mathbb{R}$ from both positive and negative directions while ReLU holds the right one fixed and pushes everything in from the left.

1264149,How to determine when this two variable transformation is invertible?,"I am given: $$ X= U \cos(V) \tag{1}\\ $$
$$ Y = U \sin V \tag{2}$$ Now, I need to: a) Give the respective ranges for $U$ and $V$ in order that the transformation defined is one to one.
  and b) With the given range found in (a),  find $U$ and $V$ in terms of $X$ and $Y$. I don't know how to answer (a). I've tried sketching $X$ and $Y$ and can see that there are certain ranges for they will not be invertible since $\cos(V)$ and $\sin(V)$ are periodic. But I don't know how to translate this into specific ranges for $U$ and $V$. If I start with $X$, then I can see that $0 \le V \le \pi$ and $U>0$ works because $X$ will be able to take on values from $-U$ to $U$ as defined in $(1)$ but then that will not work for $(2)$ ie $Y$ will not be invertible in that range. So, what is the solution and how should I approach this question? For (b), I tried to solve by following the usual way of solving simultaneous equations and got the following: $$\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{X}{U}\right)=V$$
$$\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{Y}{U}\right)=V $$ and it does not look like this will lead to an answer. What should I do to proceed? I suspect a trig identity may be involved. EDIT: The full question is:","['systems-of-equations', 'transformation', 'algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry']"

1264615,Inverse Rule for Formal Power Series,"I am just really starting to get into formal power series and understanding them.  I'm particularly interested in looking at the coefficients generated by the inverse of a formal power series:
$$\left(\sum_{n\ge 0}a_nx^n\right)^{-1}=\sum_{n\ge 0}b_nx^n$$ I first thought that my approach would be looking at 
$$\frac{1}{\sum_{n\ge 0}a_nx^n}$$ But I'm more thinking that since we know that a series is invertible in the ring if $a_0$ is invertible in the ring of coefficients.  Thus, since if we assume it is, and since the unit series is $\{1,0,0,0,....\}$ then we have $$\left(\sum_{n\ge 0}a_nx^n\right)\left(\sum_{n\ge 0}b_nx^n\right)=1$$ Thus we know that $a_0b_0=1$ and thus $b_0=\frac1{a_0}$.  And for the remaining terms we are just looking at the convolution generated by the Cauchy Product and so $$0=\sum_{j=0}^ka_jb_{k-j}$$
$$-a_0b_k=\sum_{j=1}^ka_jb_{k-j}$$
$$b_k=\frac{-1}{a_0}\sum_{j=1}^ka_jb_{k-j}$$
And thus we have a recursive definition. Is there another approach that defines the numbers $b_k$ without recursive means?  Are you forced to only recursive methods when operating on the ring of formal power series to calculate coefficents?","['power-series', 'ring-theory', 'sequences-and-series']"
