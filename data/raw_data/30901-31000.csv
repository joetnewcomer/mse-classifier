Let $p\in X$ be any point and $q\in Cut(p)$ the nearest cut point (i.e. $d_g(p,q)=d_g(p,Cut(p))$), so I know that $q$ is a conjugate point or I have a closed geodesic $\gamma$ respect to which $p$ and $q$ are 'opposite' (i.e. $d_g(p,q)=\frac{1}{2}length(\gamma)$). Now, I want to show that also in the second case $q$ is a conjugate point of $p$, or in alternative that $length(\gamma)\ge \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{k}}$. In the second case clearly it's enough to prove that if $\gamma$ is the shortest closed geodesic of $X$ then $length(\gamma)\ge \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{k}}$ (in this case one maybe can use Klingenberg's Lemma - see the version in 'Riemannian Geometry' of Gallot-Hulin-Lafontaine, pag.158).

Show that there is a bijection between the irreducible components of $f^{-1}(\eta)$ and the irreducible components of $X$ passing through $f^{-1}(\eta)$ given by $$Z \rightarrow Z \cap f^{-1}(\eta).$$ What I have tried: I basically think I would be able to prove this if I could show that the inverse map (I think it is an inverse at least) $W \rightarrow cl(W)$ where $W$ is an irreducible component of $f^{-1}(\eta)$ and $cl$ the closure, maps irreducible components to irreducible components. I have not been able to show this, or even that it maps irreducible subsets to irreducible subsets. The problem I encounter is of the following type: Let $W \subset f^{-1}(\eta)$ be an irreducible component and suppose that $cl(W) = V_1 \cup V_2$ for $V_1$ and $V_2$ closed. Then $V_1 \cap f^{-1}{\eta} = V_2 \cap f^{-1}{\eta}$ (I think) , but why does this imply $V_1=V_2$ ?

Here, $I$ is identity mapping. For first part, I know that $L^2 + 2L + I = (L+I)^2 = 0$, if $v\in V$ then $(L+I)^2 v = (L+I)(L(v) + v)) = 0$ so $L(v) + v$ is in null space of $L+I$, from here how do I show that $0$ is only in null space of $L$.

290095,Why doesn't this argument show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is normal?,"In proving that a locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ is regular, we can consider the one-point compactification $X_\infty$ (this is not necessary, see the answer here , but bear with me).  Since $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff, $X_\infty$ is compact Hausdorff.  As a result, $X_\infty$ is normal. Imitating the idea in my proof in the link above and taking into consideration the correction pointed out in the answer, let $A,B\subseteq X$ be two disjoint, closed sets in $X$, and consider $X_\infty$.  Since $X_\infty$ is normal, there are disjoint open sets $U,V \subseteq X_\infty$ such that $A\subseteq U$ and $B \subseteq V$.  Then considering $X$ as a subset of $X_\infty$, we can take the open sets $U \cap X$ and $V \cap X$ as disjoint, open subsets of $X$ that contain $A$ and $B$, respectively...or so I thought.  I see from the answers to this question that this does not succeed in proving that a locally compact Hausdorff space is normal, since this is not true. So my question is simply: why does the above proof fail? Thanks.","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

290114,why is each open set an $F_\sigma$?,"In Royden's Real Analysis: On $\mathbb{R}$, a set which is a countable union of closed sets is called an $F_\sigma$. 
  Thus every countable set is an $F_\sigma$, as is, of course, every closed set.

  Since
  $$(a, b)= \cup_{n=1}^\infty [a + 1/n, b - 1/n],$$

Let $A,B \subseteq Y$ be disjoint closed subsets.  Then clearly $\bar{A} \cap B = A \cap B = A \cap \bar{B} = \varnothing$, so by complete normality there are disjoint open sets $U,V \subseteq X$ such that $A \subseteq U$ and $B \subseteq V$.  Taking $U \cap Y$ and $V \cap Y$, we have disjoint open sets in the subspace topology on $Y$ containing $A$ and $B$, respectively, in $Y$.  It follows that $Y$ is normal. $\Leftarrow$ Suppose every subspace of $X$ is normal and let $A,B \subseteq X$ be separated subsets so that $\bar{A} \cap B = A \cap \bar{B} = \varnothing$.  Let $Y$ be a subspace containing $\bar{A}$ and $\bar{B}$.  Since $Y$ is normal, there are disjoint open sets $U,V \subseteq Y$ such that $\bar{A} \subseteq U$ and $\bar{B} \subseteq V$.  Then since $A \subseteq \bar{A}$ and $B \subseteq \bar{B}$, it follows that $X$ is completely normal. Thanks.","['general-topology', 'separation-axioms', 'solution-verification']"

290459,Mistake in Bartle's proof of Hake's Theorem?,"Here is Bartle's proof of Hake's Theorem found in ""A Modern Theory of Integration"". I think there is a mistake in the highlighted line: The Theorem: $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ is gauge integrable if and only if it is gauge integrable in $[a,x]\ \forall x\in [a,b)$ and the limit $\lim_{x\to b}\int_a^xf$ is finite. In that case
\begin{equation}\int_a^bf=\lim_{x\to b^-}\int_a^xf\end{equation} The problem is in the $(\impliedby)$ proof: Let $(c_n)$ be a strictly increasing sequence with $c_0=a$, $c_n\to b$. As $\lim_{n\to +\infty}\int_{c_0}^{c_n}f=\lim_{x\to b^-}\int_a^xf=L\in \mathbb{R}$ and $c_n\to b$, $\exists r\in \mathbb{N}$ so that
\begin{equation}\forall x\in (c_r,b)\ \left|\int_a^xf-L\right|<\epsilon\text{ and }\left|f(b)\right|(b-c_r)<\epsilon\end{equation}
By the integrability in $[c_{n-1},c_n]$, there exists a gauge $\delta_n$ on $[c_{n-1},c_n]$ so that if $\dot{\mathcal{P}}_n<<\delta_n$,
\begin{equation}\left|S(f,\dot{\mathcal{P}}_n)-\int_{c_{n-1}}^{c_n}f\right|<\frac{\epsilon}{2^n}\end{equation}
Without loss of generality,
\begin{align*}\delta_1(c_0)&\le \frac12(c_1-c_0)\tag{i}\\
\delta_{n+1}(c_n)&\le \min\left\{\delta_n(c_n),\frac12(c_n-c_{n-1}),\frac12(c_{n+1}-c_n)\right\}\tag{ii}\\
\delta_n(x)&\le \min\left\{\frac12(x-c_{n-1}),\frac12(c_n-x)\right\}\text{ for }x\in (c_{n-1},c_n)\tag{iii}
\end{align*}
We define a gauge in $[a,b]$ by 
\begin{equation}\delta(x)=\begin{cases}\delta_n(x)&\text{ if, }x\in [c_n,c_{n+1})\\
b-c_N&\text{ if, }x=b\end{cases}\end{equation}
Let $\mathcal{P}=\left\{a=x_0<...<x_m=b\right\}$ partition $[a,b]$ with tags $t_i$ so that $\dot{\mathcal{P}}<<\delta$. 
As $b\not\in\cup_{n=0}^{\infty}[c_n,c_{n+1})=[a,b)$, this forces $b$ to be a tag of $[x_{m-1},b]$. But then, as $t_m=b$,
\begin{equation}c_r=b-\delta(b)<x_{m-1}\end{equation}
Let $s\in \mathbb{N}$ be the smallest integer with $x_{m-1}\le c_s$ so that $r\le s$. If $k=1,...,s-1$ then condition (iii) implies that the point $c_k$ must be a tag of the sub-interval in $\mathcal{P}$ that contains it. ... My argument: Suppose $c_k\in [x_p,x_{p+1}]$. But, $[x_p,x_{p+1}]$ may also contain other points of the sequence (finitely many) . Let $c_{q},c_{q+1},...,c_k,c_{k+1},...,c_l$ be all these points. Suppose $t_p$ is the tag of $[x_p,x_{p+1}]$. If $t_p\neq c_q,c_{q+1},...,c_l$
and $t_p>c_k$ then $t_p\in (c_i,c_{i+1})$ with $c_i\ge c_k$. Condition (iii) and the fact that $\dot{\mathcal{P}}<<\delta$ imply that 
$$c_k> t_p-\delta(t_p)=t_p-\delta_i(t_p)\ge t_p-\frac{t_p-c_i}2=\frac{t_p+c_i}2\ge \frac{c_k+c_k}2=c_k$$
which is a contradiction. Similarly if $t_p<c_k$. What I have shown is that the tag must be a point of the sequence. But why must it be $c_k$ like Bartle says? . This fact is crucial to the proof. Bartle then continues: Using the right-left procedure we may assume $c_0,c_1,...,c_{s-1}\in \mathcal{P}$. That can't be done (I think). Indeed consider the simple case where the only points of the sequence in 
$[x_p,x_{p+1}]$ are $c_k$ and $c_{k+1}$. The tag $t_p$ must be one of $c_k,c_{k+1}$. Suppose it were $c_k$. Then $c_k\in \mathcal{P}$ and $c_{k+1}\in (c_k,x_{p+1})$. How is it then possible to prove $c_{k+1}$ is the tag of $[c_k,x_{p+1}]$?. $c_k$ seems like an equally strong candidate for this. EDIT: I also think there is a gap in ""As $b\not\in\cup_{n=0}^{\infty}[c_n,c_{n+1})=[a,b)$, this forces $b$ to be a tag of $[x_{m-1},b]$."" Why can't a point $c_n$ be the tag?","['calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'gauge-integral', 'real-analysis']"

Is it possible that there exists another way of obtaining a topological space from a metric space that is equally deserving of the label ""canonical""? Perhaps something that no one has thought of yet? To say it in a different way, is there a sense in which the aforementioned functor is unique? Lets assume that the morphisms between metric spaces are precisely the continuous maps, although an answer that considers other morphisms between metric spaces is welcome. Now obviously this is a soft question, as I have neglected to specify what it means for a map to be deserving of the term ""canonical."" For this reason, let me motivate the question a little. At some point in an introductory work on analysis, the author will define the meaning of the expression ""the topological space associated with (or induced by) a metric space."" I'd like to know if this definition is in some sense ""the unique correct definition,"" or whether it is only ""one of many possible."" EDIT: Lets put this another way. Obviously there are many function $\mathsf{Met} \rightarrow \mathsf{Top}$, but most of them are pretty boring. So we can restrict ourselves to functors, where $\mathsf{Met}$ and $\mathsf{Top}$ are viewed as categories (technically we need to make also specify what the morphisms of $\mathsf{Met}$ should be.) Anyway, as Martin points out, we're still going to be left with lots of ""boring"" functors. So I guess the question is, how do we get rid of all the ""boring"" ones? And once we do, is the canonical functor the only one that's left? Obviously I haven't defined ""boring"" so this is a very soft question. Magma suggests the following refinement of the question: does the canonical functor satisfy suitable a universal mapping property? Here's another angle. Suppose we run into an alien species, which studies topological spaces (and calls them topotopos, and what we would call ""an open set of a toplogical space"" they call ""an openopen of a topotopo"").

$ So my interpretation is that there exists a 2-dimensional center manifold which contains the $x-$axis. Is this correct? Do you know a source for a proof? Next if I would like to compute this center manifold? Does power series still apply? This is, can I propose an expression of the form: $
z=\displaystyle\sum_{i,j}a_{ij}x^iy^j

My lecturer keeps saying that this is more of a ""definition"" rather than a formula to work out the curvature, how is it? what does this definition then say/mean? Also, from this definition, somehow we get the formula $$\kappa = \frac{T' \cdot U}{|\gamma '|}$$ where $T' \cdot U$ is the dot product between $T'$ and $U$. How do we get this formula? I thought that we would have to divide by $|\gamma'|$ and $U$ to get $\kappa$, so where does the dot product come from? EDIT: I figured out the last bit. Using the definition, we get $$T' \cdot U = (\kappa |\gamma '| U) \cdot U = \kappa |\gamma ' | (U \cdot U) = \kappa |\gamma '|$$ which we can then rearrange. You get $U \cdot U = 1$ as they are both unit normal vectors (i.e of length 1) and there is a formula that says we can do $| \alpha| = \alpha \cdot \alpha$.","['geometry', 'multivariable-calculus', 'differential-geometry', 'plane-curves', 'curvature']"

290634,A particular ILP where the existence of a relaxed solution implies the existence of an integer solution,"This question emerged from a discussion on my previous question Determining quickly whether this Integer Linear Program has any solution at all , which I would like to elaborate separately.

A\mathbf{x} &\geq \mathbf{b} &\text{where}\quad
\mathbf{x} &\in \mathbb{Z}^m,\ \mathbf{x}\geq\mathbf{0},\ \\

$$
I postulate that in this particular case, if a solution exists for the relaxed constraint $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^m,\ \mathbf{x}\geq\mathbf{0}$, an integer solution always exists as well. The proof would go somewhat like this: $A\mathbf{x}$ spans a pointed convex cone $C_a$ from the origin.  The criterion $\mathbf{y} \geq \mathbf{b}$ implies a cone $C_b$ originating at $\mathbf{b}$, with the particular trait that if the two cones intersect, every ray in $C_a$ which intersects $C_b$ will intersect exactly one side of $C_b$, i.e. it will enter $C_b$ but never leave it.  This should, in turn, imply that there must exist an $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^m,\ \mathbf{x}\geq\mathbf{0}$ so that $A\mathbf{x} \geq \mathbf{b}$. Obviously that is not a proof, and anything but formal. But maybe someone could enlighten me on how such a formal proof could be constructed – or maybe, in case I'm altogether wrong, provide a counterexample?

The way I see it, I need to show that $f$ is complex differentiable at every point in $\Omega=\mathbb{C}\setminus(-\infty,0]$. So, if we take any $z_{0}$ different than $1$, our function is the quotient of two complex differentiable functions on $\Omega$, so is complex differentiable ($Log(z_{0})\neq0)$. Now, if we take $z_{0}$ to be $1$, than if $f$ is continous at that point, we could use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to check whether $u_{x}(1,0)=v_{x}(1,0)$ and $u_{y}(1,0)=-v_{x}(1,0)$ with $f=u+iv$. My question is: Is this the fastest way to show complex differentiability at $1$? I mean, how do I get to differentiating $u$ and $v$ if I don't know them explicitly?

My attempt: By the previous question, provided that g is in G, then $\langle g \rangle$ is a subgroup of G. $\langle g\rangle$ is not the identity nor is it G itself unless G = $\langle g \rangle$ (in which case G is cyclic). So we can write $G = ${$e,g,g^2,...,g^{o(g)-1}$}.  If G is cyclic, it's order may be prime or non prime. For the purposes of the question, say |G| is nonprime. Then we can write a subgroup as {$g^n$}, where $0<n<o(g)$ so as to exclude the trivial case. Done (I think). If |G| ≠ |$\langle g \rangle$|, and in particular, |G| < |$\langle g \rangle$| by Lagrange, then |G| is not prime (since it is not equal to it's cyclic group) and so $\langle g \rangle$ qualifies as a subgroup.$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\blacksquare$ Is it okay?
