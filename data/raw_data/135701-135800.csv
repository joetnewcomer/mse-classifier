2149434,"If$f_n$ a sequence of integrable functions on a set of finite measure which converge to f uniformly, then the limit and integral can be swapped. [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Lebesgue integral uniform convergence (2 answers) Closed 7 years ago . Hello I came across this problem and tried to prove it, I would just like to confirm that my proof is correct please as I think there is something wrong with it. The problem says the following: Suppose $(f_n)$ is a sequence of integrable functions on a set A of finite measure. Show that if the sequence is uniformly convergent on A, then $\lim_{n\to \infty} \int_{A} f_n dm= \int_{A} \lim_{n\to \infty} f_n dm$. My attenpt: Let $\epsilon>0$ be fixed but arbitrary. Then by uniform convergence,there exists an N s.t. $|f_n-f|<\epsilon$ for all n>N. Then $0\leq \int_A |f_n-f| \leq \epsilon m(A)$ for all n>N. Now since $\epsilon>0$ arbitrary and $m(A)<\infty$ then $\int_A |f_n-f| \to 0$ which implies $0<|\int_{A} (f_n-f)| \leq \int_{A} |f_n-f|$ and now taking the limit gives the desired result. Could someone verify my proof? I am not sure when steps like since epsilon is arbitrary work.Also where did I use integrability of the $f_n$ ? Thanks.","['lebesgue-integral', 'lebesgue-measure', 'analysis']"

2149530,Zero-sum game with positive expectation?,"Suppose $A$ and $B$ are playing the following game. They each possess a fair coin, and individually flip their own coins until they get a tail. Whomever had a longer sequence of consecutive tosses that came up heads wins, and the loser has to pay the winner an amount that depends on the number of heads the loser flipped. If they tossed an equal number of heads before their respective first tail, there is a tie. That is, denote the number of heads flipped by $A$ before the first tail by $a$, and call the number of heads flipped by $B$ before the first tail $b$. Then $A$'s payoffs in monetary terms from this game is given by $$ p(a,b) =
\begin{cases}
4^b & \text{if }a>b \\
0 &\text{if } a=b \\
-4^a &\text{if }a<b 
\end{cases} $$ Straightforward calculations show that $$ \operatorname{E}[p(a,b)] = \frac{1}{2} $$ How can a zero-sum game have positive expected payoff? In other words, how can both players expect to gain from playing this game when the amount that one player wins is exactly the amount that the other loses? To see the expected value calculation, note that $$ \operatorname E\left[4^b \vert a>b, b \right] \cdot \Pr (a>b \vert b) = 4^b \cdot \frac{1}{2^{b+1}} =\frac{1}{2}\cdot2^b $$
$$ \operatorname E\left[4^a \vert a<b, b \right] \cdot \Pr (a<b \vert b) = \sum_{k=0}^{b-1}4^k\cdot \frac{1}{2^{k+1}} = \frac{1}{2}\left(2^b - 1 \right) $$ Which means that $\operatorname E [p(a,b)\vert b] = \frac{1}{2}$.

2149565,Maximum mean absolute difference of two iid random variables,"Suppose $X$ is any random variable taking values in $[0,1]$, and let $Y$ be an iid copy of $X$. What is the maximum possible value of $\mathbb{E}|X-Y|$, over all possible $X$'s? I suspect that $\mathbb{E}|X-Y| \leq 1/2$ for any $X$, but I don't see an easy proof of this. The value $1/2$ is attained if $X$ has distribution Bernoulli(1/2), i.e. $\mathbb{P}(X = 0) = \mathbb{P}(X = 1) = 1/2$. I can prove that $E|X-Y|^2 \leq 1/2$ for any iid variables $X$ and $Y$, as follows: just write $\mathbb{E}|X-Y|^2 = EX^2 + EY^2 - 2E(XY) = 2(EX^2 - (EX)^2) \leq 2(EX - (EX)^2) \leq 1/2$, since the quadratic $s(1-s)$ has maximum value $1/2$. (Here I used the fact that $X$ takes values in $[0,1]$ to bound $EX^2 \leq EX$.) The bound on $\mathbb{E}|X-Y|^2$ is tight, again with $X$ having the Bernoulli(1/2) distribution. (Edit 1) There is an easy way to get a bound of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, using Jensen: $\mathbb{E}|X-Y| \leq \sqrt{\mathbb{E}|X-Y|^2} \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, since we showed above that $\mathbb{E}|X-Y|^2 \leq \frac{1}{2}$ always. Edit: Thanks to @Sergei Golovan for a nice solution. I am now wondering if this can be generalized to other moments. Is it true that $\mathbb{E}|X-Y|^\alpha \leq 1/2$ for all $\alpha > 0$? As before, since a Bernoulli variable is 0-1 valued, it achieves the value 1/2. I don't think the given solution for $\alpha = 1$ will generalize. I wonder if there is a way to think about this using characteristic functions / moment generating functions of $|X-Y|$.","['statistics', 'probability', 'measure-theory']"

Does that mean there is no strictly increasing (or decreasing) subsequence of any particular length for any such sequences? I read the theorem over and over again but it does seem like that the theorem is applicable to a very limited set of sequences i.e. sequences whose length can be written in form $n^2+1$.

2149678,Why is there a separate symbol for partial derivatives? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : The notation for partial derivatives (2 answers) Closed 7 years ago . The concept of a partial derivative is very simple: for a multivariate function $f$, the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to a single variable $x$ is computed by treating the other variables as constants and differentiating $f$ with respect to $x$. As a student of Calculus I, I do not fully understand the need for a $\partial y / \partial x$.  As far as I know, the special “partial” $\partial$ does not change the process of the computation.  In addition, I have become confused as the calculus of my physics course increases in difficulty. Take a three-dimensional position vector $\vec r = \vec x + \vec y + \vec z$ and an electric field vector $\vec E$ that varies with $\vec r$.  If $V$ denotes electric potential, then $\Delta V = -\int \vec E\cdot d\vec r$. On a review sheet that my teacher created, he expanded this, saying $$\begin{align}
E_x &= -\partial V / \partial x \\
E_y &= -\partial V / \partial y \\
E_z &= -\partial V / \partial z
\end{align}$$ Given the standard setup of a partial derivative, I see no issue with this.  However, our standard formula chart reads that $$E_x = -\frac{dV}{dx}$$ and this genuinely confuses me since our calculations of field potential are almost always expanded to multiple dimensions. What is the need for a $\partial f / \partial x$ notation, and why are sources (at least in physics, the only application of partial derivatives I encounter during the course of the school day) inconsistent?","['multivariable-calculus', 'partial-derivative', 'notation']"

2149812,The two-daughter-problem [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : In a family with two children, what are the chances, if one of the children is a girl, that both children are girls? (21 answers) Closed 7 years ago . When hearing about the two-daughter problem, I first thought it to be quite clear (after, of course, at first falling into the trap like many of us), but on the second glance, I encountered some serious problems with my understanding. The original problem seems to be quite easy: Assume that the only thing you know about a man with two kids is that at least one of the kids is a daughter. What is the probability that the other kid is a daughter as well? (Boys and girls are assumed to be born equally often.) After the first impulse (""1/2 of course!""), it becomes clear that it is only 1/3. The problem can be mapped to a situation where from the multitude of families with two children, only those with M/M are ruled out, while the equally often cases F/F, F/M and M/F remain, making F/F only one third of all remaining cases. But now, meet Mr. Smith. I don't know much about him (except that he has two children), but when he approached me, he told me: ""I am so happy! Victoria just got the scholarship she wanted!"" Now what is the probability that Victoria has a sister? Since I only know that Mr. Smith has two children, and one is obviously a girl, I am tempted to map this onto the two-daughter-problem, leading to the answer ""1/3"". But wait! What if I ask Mr. Smith first, if Victoria is his elder daughter? Assume his answer is yes (and ignore any problems with twins - even then one is typically a few seconds ""older"" than the other). So now I know that from the cases (F/F, F/M, M/F), M/F also drops out. And now, the probability for F/F just rose to 1/2. Okay, but what if his answer is no? Then Victoria is the younger one, and F/M drops out. Again, the probability rises to 1/2. So I'm going to just ask him: ""Well, Mr. Smith, is Victoria your elder daughter? Wait - don't answer, because whatever you may answer, it doesn't matter. The probability just rose from 1/3 to 1/2."" Or, even better, I do not even have to ask him, just thinking about the question will shift probabilities to 1/2, which means that the original probability for Victoria having a sister must already have been 1/2. But then the mapping to the two-daughter-problem is obviously false. Where is my error? Making things worse, I could also create a setup where Mr. Smith just tells me: ""I have two kids, and at least one of them is a girl."" I then ask him: ""Oh, can you give me a name of a daughter of yours?"" and he answers: ""Sure. Victoria."" (Side note: I have a gut feeling that this has something to do with how to assume probability distributions behind situations, similar to the Two envelopes problem , but I can't figure this out completely yet.) -------- UPDATE -------- It seems that my error is that the question ""Is Victoria the older child?"" does not change the probabilities. If I know for sure that Mr. Smith was picked from an equally distributed (M/F, F/M, F/F) sample, then the knowledge that Victoria is the older child does not change anything, as was pointed out  here, and the probability for her having a sister is 1/3. But it is very interesting that solely from the sentence ""Victoria just got the scholarship she wanted!"" I can NOT infer that Mr. Smith is indeed chosen from this uniform distribution. Imagine that all kids have the same chance to get a scholarship, and the happy father will tell us if it is the case. Then it is actually twice as probable that Mr. Smith will tell us about his daughter's success if he has two girls, so the weighting of the four possibilities (M/M, F/M, M/F, F/F) is (0, 1, 1, 2). And in this case, the probability of Victoria having a sister is 1/2. So another problem in my reasoning is the mapping of Mr. Smith's statement to the two-daughter-problem. Simply put, without knowing more about the circumstances that led to Mr. Smith telling me about Victoria, I simply can't say if the probability is 1/3 or 1/2. Now I've got a headache...",['probability']
2149938,Change of domain of a function to change variable in the limit,"I am trying to prove the following statement:
$$ \lim_{x\to 1} \frac{\sin(x^2-1)}{x^2-1} = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\sin(h)}{h}$$
It might seem obvious but I have trouble going from one variable to the other. Please note that I do not know what the derivative is therefore I cannot use it to solve this problem. Now, the way I tried to complete this problem is shown next. Assume that $\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\sin(h)}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0} f(h)$ exists and is equal to $\alpha$. Then I know that for each $\epsilon > 0 $ there is $\delta > 0$ so that if $0 < \vert h \vert < \delta$ then $\vert f(h) - \alpha \vert < \epsilon$. In general it is assumed that the domain of the function are all of the $h$ for which $f(h)$ makes sense. I want to use locality of limit. Therefore, I want to change domain of function $f(h)$ from $\mathbb{R} \setminus\{0\}$ to $(-1 ; +\infty)\setminus\{0\}$. Then, for each $\epsilon > 0 $,  I just take $ \delta ' = \mathrm{min} (1, \delta)$ so that if $0 < \vert h \vert < \delta '$ then the function is both defined and $\vert f(h) - \alpha \vert < \epsilon$. Now, because of my new domain, I want to say that every $h$ can be written as $h = x^2 - 1$ by finding some $x$. To make $x$ unique, I require that $x \geq 0$. Then, for each $\epsilon > 0 $ I can find $\delta' > 0$ so that if $0 < \vert x^2-1 \vert < \delta'$ then $\vert f(x^2-1) - \alpha \vert < \epsilon$. Now, I notice that if $\vert x^2-1 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert \vert x+1 \vert < \delta'$ then it must be true that $\vert x-1 \vert < \frac{\delta '}{\vert x+1 \vert} \leq \delta '$. Therefore I can say that for each $\epsilon > 0 $ I can find $\delta' > 0$ so that if $0 < \vert x-1 \vert < \delta'$ then $\vert f(x^2-1) - \alpha \vert < \epsilon$. But that is equivalent of saying that $\lim_{x\to 1} f(x^2-1) = \alpha$. Therefore, I think I have proved what I wanted. Questions : 1) Please can someone check my solution and justify all of the steps.
2) Maybe there is an easier solution?

Let's say I have a topological space $(X,\tau)$ and a sequence $\{x_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \subset X$ which has a limit point $a$ but no subsequence converging to $a$. If I regard $\{x_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ as a net over $\mathbb{N}$ directed with the standard order I know there must be a subnet converging to $a$, however I don't quite understand how this can happen. I know there are subnets of $\{x_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ that are not subsequences, and I have in mind the following example:
$$\{x_{\left \lfloor{r}\right \rfloor}\}_{r \in \mathbb{R}}$$ This subnet has uncountably many terms but for any $j \in \mathbb{N}$ all the terms of the subnet between $x_j$ and $x_{j+1}$ are equal to $x_j$. That is, the subnet above consist of all the terms of the original sequence but there are uncountably many copies of each one before reaching the next term (of the original sequence). Ok, that was a particular case of a subnet of a sequence (which seems to be useless if we are seeking for a subnet converging to a limit point of a sequence which has no subsequence doing that job), but I can't see how different can be any other subnet of the sequence, taking into account that the subnet can't add new elements to the image of the original sequence nor change their order. I mean, what else can the subnet do, appart from adding copies of some of the original terms (just like the subnet of the example above)?

One thing that hasn't been explained in the book and to which I cannot find answers within the bounds of my understanding through research, is why exactly Riemann thought his hypothesis was true. From what I understand, Bernhard Riemann was a very intuitive mathematician so it's quite possible that although he did not have a proof for his hypothesis, it made sense to him intuitively.

2150656,How to find a good strategy for tackling change of variables in multivariable calculus,"I'm in the process of learning multivariable calculus, and I've been having trouble with the process of changing variables in order to perform an easier integration. I know how to compute the Jacobian and analyze the region once it is given to me, but the problem of actually determining what my substitution should be has been giving me headaches. It's particularly difficult when the equations aren't linear. For example, here's a question I've come across and managed to solve: Use a change of variables to set up (but do not evaluate) a double integral
(one only) for the area of the region in the first quadrant bounded by the curves $xy = 1$, $xy = 4$, $y = x$, and $y = 2x$. My first instinct was to set $u=xy$, so that my two equations for $u$ become $u=1$, and $u=4$. However, I wasn't sure about what my substitution for $v$ should be, so I eventually set it to $v=x$. In my transformation $uv$-space, I then had the curves $v=\sqrt{u}$ and $v=\sqrt{\frac{u}{2}}$ (the positive components, so my space looked like this (sorry, I can't post images yet): Transformed space From there, I calculated the Jacobian to be: $$\frac{\partial (u,v)}{\partial (x,y)} = v$$ Therefore, the inverse Jacobian (the one I want), was $\frac{1}{v}$. I could then set the integral up as the following: $$\int_{1}^{4} \int_{\sqrt{\frac{u}{2}}}^{\sqrt{u}} \frac{1}{v} \,dv \,du$$ This is indeed the correct answer, but when I look at the solution, my professor provided, he used the substitutions $u=xy$ and $v=\frac{y}{x}$. The transformed space he created is then a simple rectangle, which is simpler to integrate. It looked like this: $$\int_{1}^{4} \int_{1}^{2} \frac{1}{2v} \,dv \,du$$ In the end, both approaches worked (as they should), but I was wondering if there were some general guidelines or suggestions that could be given when choosing what substitution should be used? Are there any tricks or strategies for transforming regions like these into rectangles? Any help would be appreciated! P.S.

In $\mathsf{Vect}_K$ the end is $\{(k \cdot -) : k \in K\}$ - the set of uniformly scaling linear maps, and if we take the end of the internal $\operatorname{hom} : \mathsf{Vect}_K^{op} \times \mathsf{Vect}_K \to \mathsf{Vect}_K$, we get the vector space of those maps (isomorphic to $K$). Intuitively, the end of $\operatorname{Hom}$ seems to be the set of morphisms (or rather morphism families parameterised by the domain object) that can be applied to any object, $\{x \mapsto x\}$ in $\mathsf{Set}$ and $\{(x \mapsto k\cdot x) | k \in K\}$ in $\mathsf{Vect}_K$. Continuing the line of thought the end of $\operatorname{Hom}$ in $\mathsf{FinGrp}$ and likely $\mathsf{Grp}$ too, is $\{(x \mapsto x^i) | i \in \mathbb{Z}\}$.

You can say ""it is just a logical concept"" (which is what I think Russell was getting at). And you can say ""it is a physical concept, but not physically inside — we link them together with pointers"" (like in computer programming). Taking this further into Russell's paradox : ""The set of all sets that don't contain themselves,"" when talking about computer programming, is a relatively easy concept to implement (within the domain of the sets in a computer program). I'm guessing there is a philosophical difference between sets in Java and Russell's sets. (I imagine there must be a name for Russell's sets, but I don't know what they are called.)

$$(I+K)\cap (J+K) = I\cap J +K $$ Motivation: There is an extended version of the classical chinese remainder theorem in number theory which goes as follows: Generalized Chinese Remainder theorem. If $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ and $m_1,m_2,..,m_n$ are integers such that $a_i \equiv a_j \,\text{mod} \gcd(a_i,a_j)$ for all $i,j\in \{1,\dots,n\}$ then the system of equations

    \end{cases}$$
  Has a solution which is unique $\text{mod}\, \text{lcm}(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ The usual CRT has a general version in a commutative ring setting, and we can do the same for the generalized CRT: Generalized CRT: Commutative Rings. Let $R$ be a commutative ring (with identity) and $I_1,\dots,I_n$ ideals of $R$. Then the canonical map
  $$\varphi : R \rightarrow R/I_1\times R/I_2\times \cdots R/I_n $$
  has kernel $I_1\cap\dots\cap I_n$ and has image precisely all the $(\overline{a_1},\dots,\overline{a_n})$ with $a_k = a_l \,\text{mod}\, (I_k+I_l)$ for all $k,l \in \{1,\dots,n\}$ The case where $n=2$ is proven quite easily in the general case but when translating the proof of $\mathbb{Z}$ for $n\geq 3$ we make use of the fact that $$(I_1+I_n)\cap(I_2+I_n)\cap\dots\cap(I_{n-1}+I_n) = I_1\cap\dots\cap I_{n-1} + I_n$$
Which is true for ideals in $\mathbb{Z}$ but not in general! In fact, I noted that this is also a necessary condition: for a commutative ring $R$ the generalized CRT holds if and only if for all ideals $I,J,K$ of $R$ we have $$(I+K)\cap (J+K) = I\cap J +K$$ So knowing how to handle this last condition might be interesting. Thoughts so far The proof in $\mathbb{Z}$ boils down to the fact that $$\text{lcm}(\gcd(a,c),\gcd(b,c)) = \gcd(\text{lcm}(a,b),c)$$ for all integers $a,b,c$ which can be checked by looking at the exponents of the prime powers. Hence, since every PID is a UFD the equality holds for every PID with the same proof. However, I know from this question that there exists counterexamples, even in the UFD $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ which is already quite disturbing. Does the equality hold in Dedekind rings, local rings?

My assumption was that there are no commutative rings that have an odd amount of units. This is because if $a$ is a unit, then there is a $b \in R$ such that $ab = ba = 1$. But, wouldn't this imply that $b$ would have to be a unit as well? And also, I know that if $a$ is a unit, then $-a$ is a unit as well. So, this would imply that units have to come in pairs and thus, we can never have an odd amount of units. However, this person has constructed a ring with an odd amount of units. So, I guess my question is why can I not have $5$ units in a commutative ring? What about the commutativity gives me the fact that I cannot have $5$ units?","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory']"

2151868,Distributing pebbles,"The rules to this ""game"" are simple, but after checking 120 starting positions, i can still not find a single pattern that consistantly holds. I am grateful for the smallest of suggestions. Rules: You have two bowls with pebbles in each of them. Pick up the pebbles from one bowl and distribute them equally between both bowls. If the number of pebbles is odd, place the remaining pebble in the other bowl. If the number of distributed pebbles was even, repeat the rule by picking up the pebbles from the same bowl. If the number of pebbles was odd, repeat the rule by picking up the pebbles from the other bowl. Continue applying the previous rules until you have to pick up exactly 1 pebble from a bowl, at which point you win. There are some starting positions, however, for which you will never be able to win. If the number of pebbles in the bowls are 5 and 3 respectively, you will cycle on forever. Question: Depending on the number of pebbles in each bowl at the starting position, can you easily predict if that position will be winnable/unwinnable? Edit: Here is some python code i wrote to generate answers for given starting values: http://codepad.org/IC4pp2vH Picking up $2^n$ pebbles will guarantee a win.

2151889,Backwards stability of QR vs SVD,"I've been reading Trefethen & Bau's book on Numerical Linear Algebra, and they have this one question whose answer does not entirely make sense to me.  In particular, they imply that the SVD algorithm (the computation of the SVD, not the solution of $Ax = b$ by SVD) is not backwards stable.  The suggestion is that this has to do with the fact that SVD maps from an $m\times n$ matrix into the space of triples of $m\times m$, $m\times n$, and $n\times n$ for $U$, $\Sigma$, and $V$.  They have a comment, with regards to the outer product computation, that since that, too, maps from a smaller dimensional space into a larger one, the computation should not be expected to be backwards stable.  At the same time, Householder triangularization ($QR$), is backwards stable, but this too maps from a smaller dimensional space into a larger dimensional space.  Is Householder just an exceptional case, or is there more to this?","['numerical-linear-algebra', 'linear-algebra']"

What I have done is the following: i) is it a reflexive relation? $\forall x,x \in \mathbb{Z}, \quad x \mathscr{R} x \iff x\cdot x = x^2 > 0 $
since a square is always $> 0$ the relation is reflexive. ii) is it a symmetrical relation? $\forall x,z \in \mathbb{Z}, \quad x \mathscr{R} z \iff x \cdot z > 0$ by hypothesis, since the operation of multiplication is commutative on $\mathbb{Z}$ the following is true: $\forall x,z \in \mathbb{Z}, \quad z \mathscr{R} x \iff z \cdot x > 0$ hence, the relation is symmetrical. iii) is it a transitive relation? $\forall x,z \in \mathbb{Z}, \quad x \mathscr{R}z \iff x \cdot z > 0$ by hypothesys, if we take another ordered pair $\forall z,m \in \mathbb{Z}, \quad z \mathscr{R} m \iff z \cdot m > 0$ hence, if $x \mathscr{R}z, \quad z \mathscr{R} m \Rightarrow x \cdot m > 0$ i.e. if $x \cdot z > 0, \quad z \cdot m > 0 \Rightarrow x \cdot m > 0$ so the relation is transitive. iv) is it a anti-symmetrical relation? No. Because it is not true that $z \mathscr{R}x \iff x=z$, as we have seen in the symmetrical relation. v) is it a order relation? No. Because it is not anti-symmetrical. vi) is it a equivalence relation? Yes, because it is reflexive, symmetrical and transitive. What do you think about it?

2151988,Regarding locally integrable functions as distributions,"I am currently studying distribution theory, with an eye towards PDEs, and have a question on regarding locally integrable functions as distributions. Suppose $u\in L^1_{\mathrm{loc}}(\Omega).$  Then we can map $u$ to the space of distributions $D'(\Omega)$ by $$T(u)=I_u\in D'(\Omega),$$
where the  distribution $I_u$ is defined by $$\langle I_u,\phi\rangle:=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\!f(x)\phi(x)\ \mathrm{d}x.$$  Given this definition, it is technically not correct to say $u\in D'(\Omega).$  Nonetheless, many textbooks consider $u$ to be a distribution.  Salsa (PDEs in Action, pp. 375) even goes as far as to say $L^1_{\mathrm{loc}}(\Omega)\hookrightarrow D'(\Omega)$, which seems to assume $L^1_{\mathrm{loc}}(\Omega)\subset D'(\Omega)$.  Furthermore, this would imply $$|| u||_{D'(\Omega)}\le C ||u ||_{L^1_{\mathrm{loc}}(\Omega)},$$
but what meaning can be assigned the the left hand side of the above equation if $u\not\in D'(\Omega)$? As far as I can tell, when one writes $L^1_{\mathrm{loc}}(\Omega)\hookrightarrow D'(\Omega)$, to mean that the mapping $T:L^{1}_{\mathrm{loc}}(\Omega)\to D'(\Omega)$ is injective, and $\mathrm{im}(T)\hookrightarrow D'(\Omega)$? The only thing I can think of is that this is just an abuse of notation, tolerated so one can write $$\Delta u=f,$$ and understand $u$ as a distribution.  This would be more comfortable and convenient than writing $$\Delta I_u=f.$$ Am I thinking along the right lines? Am I crazy?  I have done some searching, but most sources just seem to brush this off by saying they ""regard"" (?) $u$ as a distribution.
