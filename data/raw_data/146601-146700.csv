2402454,Reference Request: Algebraic Topology and Geometry with External Motivation,"Taking a year off before beginning JD/PhD studies.  Planning to review/extend my understanding of modern math.  Despite being able to successfully and contentfully work problems from Rudin, Folland, etc., I have always struggled to learn from the canonical algebra and geometry books (Dummit, Hatcher, etc.). The problem doesnt seem to be ""local:""  there are no specific tricks on particular pages that I can point to that I ""dont get.""  It seems ""global:""  when reading on analytic topics, thoughts on applications -- if even indirect ones (that is, applications of a collection theories to a more applied branch of mathematics) -- are integral to my efforts; I tend to struggle to find direct and indirect applications of apparent import in algebra and topology. I believe one way to remedy that fact in learning about algebra proper is to focus on linear algebra and its generalizations:  books by hoffman, artin, maclane, etc. seem, after only a cursory look though, much more intriguing to me; it is easier for me to get excited about working the exercises therein.  I would like to ask your help in finding suitable perspectives from which to study algebraic topology and geometry, along with reference requests. I have the suspicion that focusing on the differential aspects of things might be the right direction, but it is tough to find comprehensive advice about what such a curriculum would look like.  Based on some cursory reading and comments below, 3 options present themselves so far:  spivaks DG1 then narishmans complex analysis, lees manifolds and geometry, or tus manifolds and forms.  May I ask your help in comparing those 3 options (coverage? exposition quality?  typo quantity?), or recommending additional resources? In a comment I was a bit more succinct/explicit about what I am looking for: a motivated introduction to a bit of modern geometry, whereby motivated I mean either A) something where I can point directly to an area of mainstream physics or economics and say, ""this will be useful here,"" or B) something where I can point indirectly to an area of mathematics where A obviously holds (differential equations, probability theory, etc.). ANSWER: From the answers, comments, and elsewhere, it seems that some mix of John Lee and Loring Tu's books have a sufficient smattering of the algebraic side of things to get a feel for modern geometry, with enough grounding in the differential side of things so that the usefulness of the material in applied math is readily apparent.  Given the time constraints and the level of difficulty of the available suggestions, algebraic geometry will be omitted (this includes even things like several complex variables by Narishman which discuss the topic tangentially) as will traditional graduate algebraic topology (hatcher, rotman, etc.).","['algebraic-topology', 'reference-request', 'differential-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2402520,Proof that the set of transference plans is closed in the weak topology,"I am reading Villani's Optimal transport: Old and new . Theorem 4.1 concerns the existence of an optimal coupling between any two Polish probability spaces $(\mathcal{X}, \mu)$ and $(\mathcal{Y}, \nu)$. The proof begins as follows (note that $P(\mathcal{X})$ denotes the set of probability distributions on $\mathcal{X}$, and $\Pi(\mu, \nu)$ the set of all joint distributions on $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$ with marginals $\mu$ and $\nu$ respectively): Since $\mathcal{X}$ is Polish, $\{\mu\}$ is tight in $P(\mathcal{X})$; similarly, $\{\nu\}$ is tight in $P(\mathcal{Y})$. By Lemma 4.4, $\Pi(\mu, \nu)$ is tight in $P(\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y})$, and by Prokhorov's theorem this set has a compact closure. By passing to the limit in the equation for marginals, we see that $\Pi(\mu, \nu)$ is closed, so it is in fact compact . I am trying to understand the last claim (""By passing to the limit..."") - it is unclear what ""equation for marginals"" is referred to here. Essentially, the thing I want to show is that $\Pi(\mu, \nu)$ is closed in the weak topology. The best I can do is as follows: suppose we have $\pi_k \to \pi$ in the weak topology, with each $\pi_k \in \Pi(\mu, \nu)$. Then for any $\mu$-measurable $A$, we have $\pi_k(A \times \mathcal{Y}) = \mu(A)$ (and similarly for $\nu$), so we would be done if we have $\pi_k(A \times \mathcal{Y}) \to \pi(A \times \mathcal{Y})$. However, as far as I understand, weak convergence of $\pi_k$ to $\pi$ only ensures  $\pi_k(B) \to \pi(B)$ when $\pi(\partial B) = 0$ (with $\partial B$ denoting the boundary of $B$). Presumably there will be $A$ such that $A \times \mathcal{Y}$ does not satisfy this, for instance. Can anyone see how to make sense of this ""passing to the limit"" step, or how else to obtain this result?","['weak-convergence', 'probability-theory', 'optimal-transport', 'weak-topology']"

2402558,"Matrix algebra: The ""magical inverse"" trick","In relation to my Master' Thesis, I made an observation that has bothered me for some time now, and I come here hoping that some of you guys can shed some light on it. In my project I work with a complex block matrix on the form $$\begin{equation}
B = \begin{bmatrix}
u & v \\
w & x
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation},$$ where the four submatrices $u$, $v$, $w$ and $x$ are complex square matrices of the same size (and thus $B$ itself is also a square matrix). These submatrices fulfill the following three relations: $$\begin{align}
& uu^\dagger - vv^\dagger = I \tag{1}\\
& xx^\dagger-ww^\dagger = I \tag{2}\\
& uw^\dagger = vx^\dagger \tag{3}
\end{align}$$ Here, I use dagger to represent the conjugate transpose. Now using just the three equations above, we can construct the following block matrix equation:
$$\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
u & v\\
w & x
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
u^\dagger & -w^\dagger\\
-v^\dagger & x^\dagger
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
I & 0\\
0 & I
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{a}
\end{equation}$$ The only thing here slightly non-trivial is the lower left equation, which reads
$$wu^\dagger = xv^\dagger \tag{4},$$
but this is quickly seen to be the conjugate transpose of equation (3) above. Equation (a) implies that our $B$ has an inverse, namely
$$B^{-1} =
\begin{bmatrix}
u^\dagger & -w^\dagger\\
-v^\dagger & x^\dagger
\end{bmatrix}.$$ And because square matrices have equal right and left inverses, we then get the following additional block matrix equation:
$$\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
u^\dagger & -w^\dagger\\
-v^\dagger & x^\dagger
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
u & v\\
w & x
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
I & 0\\
0 & I
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{b}
\end{equation}$$ Deconstructing this, we suddenly end up with four new equations:
$$\begin{align}
& u^\dagger u - w^\dagger w = I \tag{5}\\
& x^\dagger x - v^\dagger v = I \tag{6}\\
& u^\dagger v = w^\dagger x \tag{7}\\
& v^\dagger u = x^\dagger w \tag{8}
\end{align}$$ The equations (5) to (8) followed directly from the equations (1) to (4), through the trick with the inverse of $B$. So far, so good. My problem here is that I can't find any way through normal operations to get the equations (5) to (8) from the equations (1) to (4)! It seems very odd to me (and to people I've spoken to) that we need to introduce these large block matrices $B$ and $B^{-1}$ to transfer between the two equivalent sets of matrix equations. Shouldn't I also be able to do this just by performing ""normal"" algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction and matrix multiplication, as well as maybe complex conjugation? Or should this ""magical inverse trick"" be considered a natural part of your toolbox when handling matrix equations? I understand that matrix algebra behaves differently than normal scalar algebra, so it might very well be the case – I have just never heard of anything like it before. If anyone could give me some insight on this, it would save the day for both me and many of my fellow students! Thanks. EDIT: Thanks for your replies! It is now clear to me that the inverse trick $AB = I \Longleftrightarrow BA = I$ is a natural part of the matrix algebra toolbox, because as Omnomnomnom points out under, there is no way of proving this equivalence through normal matrix algebraic means. Still, to me, there is something else going on here as well. In order to get from equations (1)–(4) to equations (5)–(8) we actually construct the larger block matrices $B$ and $B^{-1}$ and do the inverse trick on them – so in some sense, we use the inverse trick ""in a higher dimension"" than the dimension of the original equations. I find it very strange that the equations cannot be rewritten just through matrix equations in the same dimension. Or do you think there is a way of getting from equations (1)–(4) to equations (5)–(8) without constructing $B$ and $B^{-1}$, but just by somehow using the inverse trick on the original equations?","['matrices', 'matrix-equations', 'linear-algebra', 'inverse']"

My confusion is the following: the central extensions are in 1-to-1 correspondence with the second group cohomology group $H^2(\mathbb Z_3; \mathbb Z_3)$. According to the groupprops wiki , we have $H^2(\mathbb Z_3; \mathbb Z_3) = \mathbb Z_3$. But that implies there must be at least three distinct groups of order nine...

2402709,Why solution is nonzero in the outer region,"Consider this equation in the limit of $A\rightarrow\infty$, $A$ is a positive real number.
$$
y^{(4)} + i A (y''- y) = e^{-\sqrt{-i A} x}.
$$ 
Boundary conditions are homogeneous: $y(0) = y(1) = y'(0) = y'(1) = 0$. $i$ is the imaginary unit. Edit Start A similar problem, but without the complex number is ($A$ is still positive and real and approaches the positive infinity)
$$
y^{(4)} - A (y''- y) = e^{-\sqrt{A} x}.
$$ 
Boundary conditions are homogeneous: $y(0) = y(1) = y'(0) = y'(1) = 0$. I suggest to start from this equation instead--and I will consider the question as answered :-) Edit End Note that $-\sqrt{-i} = -1/\sqrt{2}+i/\sqrt{2}$. Apparently the RHS decreases faster and faster as $A$ increases, and is nonzero only within a thin layer next to $x=0$. For this reason I expect a boundary layer behavior of the RHS. Because RHS is the source term, I expect boundary layer behavior of the solution $y(x)$ as well. Define $\epsilon = \frac{1}{\sqrt{A}}$ to convert the ODE into a singular perturbation problem.
$$
\epsilon^2 y^{(4)} + (i ) (y''- y) = \epsilon^2 e^{-\sqrt{-i} x/\epsilon}
$$ Outer solution The RHS is exponentially small thus varnishes as $\epsilon\rightarrow0$, so the ODE in the outer region is simplified:
$$
\epsilon^2 y^{(4)}_o + (i ) (y_o''- y_o) = 0
$$
Because the (outer) boundary conditions at $x = 1$ are homogeneous, the outer solution is identically zero. As an example, I calculated the solution numerically using bvp4c for $A = 4000$, the figure for the real and imaginary parts of $y(x)$, and of $rhs(x)$ are shown below. The boundary layer behavior is there for $rhs(x)$, but both $real(y)$ and $imag(y)$ appear to vary linearly in the outer region , you need to scale $imag(y)$ in $y$ to see its linear behavior. It also appears $y(x)$ has a boundary layer at $x = 1$ as they change pretty quickly there, but I am not sure. This puzzles me a lot and any help is appreciated.

However, when checking against what the internet said, I found that a local homeomorphism is a map $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ such that each $x\in X$ has an open neighborhood $U$ such that $f(U)$ is open in $Y$ and $f$ restricted to $U$ is a homeomorphism.
I suppose saying that $X$ and $Y$ are locally homeomorphic is supposed to mean that there exists such a local homeomorphism $X\longrightarrow Y$.

2402730,Why does the Taylor expansion of $e^x$ satisfy exponential properties?,"Suppose I knew nothing about the function $e^x$. If I wanted to find a power series that was its own derivative, I would logically start with the constant term, and first start by setting it to $1$. Then, the next term should be the antiderivative of the first term, giving me $x$. Doing this again would give me $\frac{x^2}2$. Repeating this process over and over again, I would get
$$1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+\ldots=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^k}{k!}$$
Graphing a few terms of this, I might notice that this looks more and more like an exponential the more terms I graph. If I prove that this function satisfies the exponential relationship $f(x+y) = f(x)f(y)$, I would be able to prove that this series is an exponential function. How would I prove this? After this, how would I prove that the base of this exponential function is $e$, which is defined as $\displaystyle{\lim_{n \to \infty}} (1+\frac1n)^n$?

2402890,Please help me check my proof that the transcendental numbers are dense in $\mathbb{R}$,"I need to prove that the set of all transcendental numbers is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, and to that end, I have written the following proof: Let $\mathbb{T}$ denote the set of transcendental numbers in $\mathbb{R}$. First, notice that $\mathbb{T} \subset \mathbb{R}\setminus \mathbb{A}$, where $\mathbb{A}$ denotes the algebraic numbers in $\mathbb{R}$. Next, since $\mathbb{A}$ is a field, it is closed under multiplication and $\forall a \in \mathbb{A}$, $a \neq 0$, $\exists a^{-1} \in \mathbb{A}$ such that $a^{-1}a = aa^{-1} = 1$. Thus, $\forall t \in \mathbb{T}$, $a \in \mathbb{A}$ s.t. $a \neq 0$, $x=ta \in \mathbb{T}$; otherwise, $t = xa^{-1}$ would be algebraic, when we assumed it was transcendental. Since $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{A}$, it suffices to show that the rational multiples of transcendental numbers (or, at the very least, the rational multiples of a subset of the transcendental numbers) are dense in $\mathbb{R}$. To that end, consider $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ s.t. $a<b$. Then, $\displaystyle \frac{a}{\pi},\frac{b}{\pi}\in \mathbb{R}$, and $\displaystyle \frac{a}{\pi} < \frac{b}{\pi}$. By the density of the rational numbers in the reals, $\exists\, q \in \mathbb{Q}$ s.t. $$ \frac{a}{\pi} < q < \frac{b}{\pi}. $$
  Multiplying through by $\pi$, a transcendental number, we obtain $$ a < \pi q < b. $$
  Since $a,b$ were arbitrary real numbers, and $\pi q \in \mathbb{T}$, we can conclude that $\exists$ a transcendental number between any two reals; i.e., $\mathbb{T}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$. What I am asking here is whether someone could tell me if this proof is correct. I have seen a lot of proofs of the density of the transcendentals in $\mathbb{R}$ that involve countability. However, in this case, I would prefer a proof that does not resort to a countability argument. Thank you.","['abstract-algebra', 'rational-numbers', 'transcendental-numbers', 'proof-verification']"

Let's call a set $B\subset \{0,1\}^n$ balanced if its center of mass is the center of the cube; that is, the average of all vectors contained in $B$ is
$(1/2,\dots,1/2)$. What is the smallest possible diameter of a nonempty balanced subset of $\{0,1\}^n$? Partial results Let $d_n$ be the aforementioned smallest diameter, and let $B$ be a balanced set that realizes it. Without loss of generality, $B$ contains the zero vector $(0,\dots,0)$. To be balanced, it must also contain some vector with more $1$s than $0$s. Hence
$$
d_n \ge \left\lceil \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rceil \tag{1}

The Cartesian product of two balanced sets is balanced, and its diameter is the sum of diameters of its factors. Therefore, the sequence $(d_n)$ is subadditive:
$$
d_{m+n} \le d_m+d_n \tag2
$$

where the columns form a balanced set of diameter $2$, showing $d_3\le 2$. (By the way, this is a tetrahedron inscribed in a cube.) For $d_5$, the bounds $(1)$-$(2)$ give $3\le d_5\le 4$.

Prove that $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{f(x-\sqrt{n})}{\sqrt{n}}$$ converges almost for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$. My tactic here (which of course might lead me to nowhere) is to express this series as an integral or sum of integrals and use in some way  the fact that $f$ is integrable along with a convergence theorem of course. From integrability of $f$ we know that $f$ is finite almost everywhere which I believe would help me in my proof. But I don't know exactly how to start with this.

Consider the sequence $(x^0_k,x^1_k,\cdots,x^n_k,\cdots)$ of $k$ th coordinates of the sequence $(x^n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ . Let $\epsilon>0$ . Since $(x^n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is Cauchy, there exists $n_0\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $$\forall m,n>n_0,\|x^m-x^n\|_\infty<\epsilon.$$ Therefore for each $m,n>n_0$ we have $$|x^m_k-x^n_k|<\epsilon.$$ So the sequence $(x^0_k,x^1_k,\cdots,x^n_k,\cdots)$ is Cauchy. Therefore it converges to some $y_k\in\mathbb{F}\ $ ( $\mathbb{F}$ is complete). Let $y=(y_k)_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ . Since $(x^0_k,x^1_k,\cdots,x^n_k,\cdots)$ is Cauchy it is bounded. Choose $M>0$ such that for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , $|x^n_k|<M$ . But since $$y_k=\lim_{n\to\infty}x_k^n,$$ we have $|y_k|\leq M$ for each $k$ . Therefore, $y\in l^\infty$ . Fix $m>n_0$ . Then we have $\|x^m-x^n\|_\infty<\epsilon.$ Therefore $\|x^m-y\|_\infty<\epsilon$ as $n\to\infty$ . Therefore for each $m>n_0,\ \|x^m-y\|_\infty<\epsilon$ . Hence $(x^n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges in $l^\infty$ and the proof is complete. Could someone please tell me if the above proof is alright?

2403350,Equalizers in CRing,"This is a follow-up to this question of Martin Brandenburg. Let $B$ be a ring (in this post ""ring"" means ""commutative ring with $1$"") and $A$ a subring. We say that $A\subset B$ is an equalizer if there are two morphisms of rings from $B$ to $C$ which coincide precisely on $A$. (One also says that $A\subset B$ is a kernel , or that $A\to B$ is regular , but I find the phrase ""is an equalizer"" more descriptive.) As pointed out by Martin, this is equivalent to the condition that $b\in B$ and $b\otimes 1=1\otimes b$ in $B\otimes_AB$ imply $b\in A$. As also pointed out by Martin, $A\subset B$ is an equalizer if $B$ is faithfully flat over $A$. (This follows from Proposition 13, Chapter 1, Section 2, Subsection 11, and from Proposition 13, Chapter 1, Section 3, Subsection 6 in Nicolas Bourbaki, Algèbre commutative: Chapitres 1 à 4 , Masson, Paris 1985. Subquestion: are there better proofs?) The following question seems unavoidable: Is $A\subset B$ an equalizer if and only if the functor $B\otimes_A-\ $ reflects exactness? The phrase ""$B\otimes_A-\ $ reflects exactness"" means: If $M\to N\to P$ is a complex of $A$-modules and if $B\otimes_AM\to B\otimes_AN\to B\otimes_AP$ is exact, then $M\to N\to P$ is exact. Here is a nano-answer: Assume that all maximal ideals of $A$ are principal, that $B$ is flat over $A$ and that $A\subset B$ is an equalizer. Then $B$ is faithfully flat over $A$. Proof. If $B$ was not faithfully flat, by Tag 00HP in the Stacks Project, there would be a maximal ideal $(a)$ of $A$ such that $aB=B$, that is, $a$ is a unit of $B$. In $B\otimes_AB$ we would get 
$$
1\otimes a^{-1}=a^{-1}a\otimes a^{-1}=a^{-1}\otimes aa^{-1}=a^{-1}\otimes1.
$$ (Subquestion: If all maximal ideals of $A$ are principal, does it follow that $A$ is a principal ideal ring?) To get an example of an equalizer $A\subset B$ where $B$ is not flat over $A$, consider the inclusion $\mathbb Z\subset\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z/(2)$. It is clear that $(\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z/(2))\otimes_{\mathbb Z}-\ $ reflects exactness. The co-equalizers in CRing are precisely the surjective epimorphisms. For instance $\mathbb Z\to\mathbb Q$ is a monomorphism and an epimorphism, but is neither an isomorphism, nor an equalizer, nor a surjection, nor a co-equalizer. Moreover $\mathbb Q$ is flat, but not faithfully flat, over $\mathbb Z$, and $\mathbb Q\otimes_{\mathbb Z}-\ $ does not reflect exactness. EDIT.

let's assume that $f_{n}$ converges pointwise to a continuous function
$f$. Prove that $f_{n}$ uniformly converges to $f$. Here is my attempt: $f\colon$$\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function,
therefore from Cantor's Theorem we can say the it is uniformly continuous.
That means that there is $\delta>0$ such that for all $x,y\in\left[0,1\right]$
that are close enough $\left|x-y\right|<\delta$ it follows that $\left|f(x)-f(y)\right|<\frac{\varepsilon}{3}$.
Now for each $x\in\left[0,1\right]$ let $U_{x}$=$\left(x-\delta,x+\delta\right)$.
From the Hiene-Borel Theorem we can conclude that there is a finite
set $\left\{ x_{0},\ldots,x_{M}\right\} \subset\left[0,1\right]$
such that $\left[0,1\right]\subset\bigcup_{i=0}^{M}U_{x_{i}}$. From pointwise convergence we know that for every $0\leq i\leq M$
there is a number $N_{i}$ such that for all $n>N_{i}$ it follows
that $\left|f_{n}(x_{i})-f(x_{i})\right|<\frac{\varepsilon}{3}$. Lets define $N=\max\left\{ N_{0},\ldots,N_{M}\right\} $. All I
can conclude for now is that for all $n>N$ and for all $x\in\left[0,1\right]$
there is $0\leq i\leq M$ such that $x\in U_{x_{i}}$ and therefore:
$$

I think the idea of functional is kind of extended from the idea of function. I think a function can only be a mapping from numbers to a number, while a functional can be a mapping from any vectors in vector space to a number. Those vectors can themselves be functions, thus someone calls functional as function of function .

For a lack of a better name, it can be called min-norm . Intuitively, it is reasonable to consider in some applications where, for example, two objects $x, y$ are deemed to be 'close' if they are 'close' at least in one of the coordinates. It is fairly easy to see that min-norm is not actually a norm, because it violates the definitiveness constraint: $\vert\vert x\vert\vert_{-\infty}=0$ does not imply $x=0$. On the other hand, min-norm still satisfies the two other norm axioms, the triangle inequality and positive homogenity.

2403716,How many similar disjoint drawings can be done in $\mathbb{R}^2$?,"Long ago I encounter the following question: How many disjoint similar $0$'s can be drawn in $\mathbb{R}^2$? Answer is simple, it just suffices to draw $0$'s centered at the origin making them with increasing diameter over the real numbers. They all are disjoint and there are not enumerable ones of them. How many disjoint similar $8$'s can be drawn in $\mathbb{R}^2$? This case is more interesting. Every disjoint $8$ can be uniquely mapped to a pair of elements in $\mathbb{Q}^2$, where the first one is in the upper half of the $8$ and the second one in the lower half. There are only enumerable of those. A similar technique could be used to proof that there are enumerable $X$'s or $H$'s. However, I cannot figure out the condition that the letter (or drawing) must have in order for its disjoint similar drawings to be enumerable in $\mathbb{R}^2$. I have been thinking about this with letters and numbers, but I am sure it can be generalized to more interesting (even discontinuous) figures and more interesting deformations of the figure than just rotating or increasing its size maintaining its proportions.","['real-numbers', 'elementary-set-theory', 'geometry', 'combinatorics', 'general-topology']"

One goal of PCA is to find the ""best approximation"" of the data cloud in a $k$ dimensional subspace of $R^n$ .
This best approximation is introduced in various geometric way: We look for a projection $P_{E_k}$ such that the sum of the  distance between the  ""projected person"" would be maximum. Similar to ""least square""method we look for an ""orthogonal projection"" which would minimize the sum of distance between the points and their projected. We look for the maximum ""inertie"" or Variance of the projected cloud which geometrically give the total distance between the projected cloud and his bartcenter. Finally a non geometric approach lead us to look for the ""best"" low rank (rank $k $ ) approximation of $X $ (cf. Eckart-Young theorem.

First let's do some translations: $\bullet$ $∪!\mathcal F = \{x | ∃!A(A ∈ \mathcal F ∧ x ∈ A)\}$. $\bullet$ $∃!A$ means that ""there exists a unique $A$ such that..."" thus ""$x ∈ ∪!\mathcal F$"" which we will use later is equivalent to $∃A(A ∈ \mathcal F ∧ x ∈ A) ∧  ∀B((A ∈ \mathcal F ∧ x ∈ A) \Rightarrow B = A)$. $\bullet$ A family of sets $\mathcal F$ is said to be pairwise disjoint if $∀A ∈ \mathcal F∀B ∈ \mathcal F(A \neq B → A ∩ B =∅)$. And now here's my proof of it: Proof. ($\rightarrow$) Suppose $∪!\mathcal F = ∪\mathcal F$ i.e. $x ∈ ∪!\mathcal F \iff x ∈ ∪\mathcal F$ i.e. $x ∈ ∪!\mathcal F \Rightarrow x ∈ ∪\mathcal F$ and $x ∈ ∪!\mathcal F \Leftarrow x ∈ ∪\mathcal F$. Let $A$ and $B$ be arbitrary elements of $\mathcal F$. Now we prove the contrapositive and suppose $A ∩ B \neq ∅$ which means $∃x(x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B)$. We can now choose some $x_0$ such that $x_0 ∈ A$ and $x_0 ∈ B$. Since $A$ was an arbitrary element of $\mathcal F$ then from $x ∈ ∪\mathcal F$, we have $x ∈ ∪!\mathcal F$. Since $B$ was an arbitrary element of $\mathcal F$ and $x_0 ∈ B$, then from $x ∈ ∪!\mathcal F$: particularly from $∀B((A ∈ \mathcal F ∧ x ∈ A) \Rightarrow B = A)$, we get $B = A$. Since $A$ and $B$ were arbitary then $\mathcal F$ is pairwise disjoint. Therefore if $∪!\mathcal F = ∪\mathcal F$ then $\mathcal F$ is pairwise disjoint. Here are my questions: Is my proof of the forward direction valid? What about the backward direction? Isn't the statement $∪!\mathcal F = ∪\mathcal F$ kind of self-explanatory (i.e. each side kind of prove the other side)? In other words I cannot see a way to use $∀A ∈ \mathcal F∀B ∈ \mathcal F(A \neq B → A ∩ B =∅)$ to prove those conditional-existential statements (they seem to sufficiently rely on each other for their existence)!

2404045,Definition of eigenvalue for Sturm-Liouville problem.,"I am familiar with the notion of an eigenvalue/eigenvector pair for a linear operator. Explicitly:
If $V$ is a vector space over a field $K$, and $T$ is a linear operator on $V$, then we call $\lambda \in K$ an eigenvalue if there exists a non-zero vector $v \in V$ such that $Tv = \lambda v.$ I am now studying differential equations and am learning about Sturm- Liouville problems. There we define a linear differential operator 
$$L[y] = -[p(x) y']' + q(x)y$$
for some functions $p(x)$ and $q(x)$, and $y$ is a function in some appropriate function space (which function space is not entirely clear, but I do not think that is too relevant to my question).
We then consider the Sturm-Liouville problem:
\begin{equation}\tag{1} \label{SL} 
L[\phi] = \lambda r(x) \phi 
\end{equation}
for some function $r(x)$, subject to some boundary conditions. My confusion comes from this $r(x)$.
Most sources say if $\lambda$ is some complex number for which there exists a non-trivial solution $\phi$ to \ref{SL}, then 
$\lambda$ is an eigenvalue and $\phi$ the associated eigenfunction.
But I would expect the problem to be
\begin{equation}\tag{2} \label{expected}
L[\phi] = \lambda \phi .
\end{equation} 
How can the notion of an eigenvalue/eigenvector pair jive with this $r(x)$? Is this just a difference in definitions for Sturm-Liouville theory?
Is it a notational convenience? Because we could just define
$$L[y] = \frac{1}{r(x)}\left( -[p(x) y']' + q(x)y \right),$$
and then things are how we expect them in \ref{expected}.","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'sturm-liouville', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'eigenfunctions']"

Furthermore, suppose that there exists a natural number $k$ such the order$(a_i) = k$ for all $i \in \{1, \ldots, m\}.$ Immediately, we know that for any $g \in G$ that $kg = 0$ as we can simply distribute. Additionally, that gives us that $\text{order}(g) \mid k.$ $\textbf{Question:}$ Is it possible to $\textbf{claim}$ that $$\text{order}(g) = \frac{k}{\gcd(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m, k)}?$$ $\textbf{Reasoning:}$ Since $\gcd(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m, k)$ will divide every $\lambda_i$, we simply get that every coefficient for each $a_i$ in the sum $$\left( \frac{k}{\gcd(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m, k)} \right) g = \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{\lambda_i}{\gcd(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m, k)} k a_i$$ is a multiple of $k$. Hence, $$\left( \frac{k}{\gcd(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m, k)} \right) g = 0$$ as $ka_i = 0$ for every $i.$ That shows that $$\text{order}(g) \leq \frac{k}{\gcd(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m, k)}.$$ I feel like the uniqueness of how we write the elements of $G$ in terms of $A$ should restrict a smaller order than the claim.
