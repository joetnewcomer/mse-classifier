368413,Counting The Number Of Ways To Seat People At A Table,"How many ways are there to seat six people around a circular table where two seatings are considered the same when everyone has the same two neighbors without regard to whether they are right or left neighbors? I have tried three different methods to solve this problem, all of which failed. I did find this solution on the internet, but I don't quite understand it. Could someone help me? Solution: We choose a distinguished person. Then, there are 5 people left. Hence there are 5! ways to seat these people. However, since we do not consider the diﬀerence between right and left neighbors, each way we counted appears twice. Once for the counter clockwise arrangement and once for the clockwise arrangement. Hence, there are 5!/2 = 60 ways to seat the 6 people.","['discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

368516,Algebraic definition of Tangent space of manifold.,"Given a smooth manifold $M$ and a point $m\in M$ denote by $\tilde F_m$ the set of germs of smooth functions at $m$. The tangent space at $m$ (denoted by $M_m$)is defined as the space of linear derivations on the algebra $\tilde F_m$. An isomorphism can then be established between $M_m$ and the space $(F_m/F_m^2)^*$, where $F_m$ is the ideal defined by $F_m:=\lbrace f\in\tilde F_m|f(m)=0\rbrace$. Here comes my question. Since the derivations on $F_m$ are precisely those linear functionals vanishing on $F_m^2$ and at germs of constant functions, it seems more natural to me to define the tangent space as $(\tilde F_m/(F_m^2\oplus C))^*$ where $C$ denotes the subalgebra of germs of constant functions.

368546,A question on the uniformization theorem,"Wikipedia reads, on the uniformization theorem: In mathematics, the uniformization theorem says that every simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one of the three domains: the open unit disk, the complex plane, or the Riemann sphere. In particular it admits a Riemannian metric of constant curvature . My question is, does it follow so easily? Let's consider a conformal map $F$ between two Riemannian 2-manifolds $(A,g)$ and $(B,g_1)$, where the notation means (manifold, metric). If we consider a conformally related metric to $g_1$, say $g_2 := e^{2u}g_1$, where $u \in C^\infty(B)$, the map $F$ remains conformal, but the curvature of $g_2$ is changed! I would put it like that: curvature is not a conformal invariant. I think you need a little bit of effort to achieve the statement in bold.

We also know that the outer measure of an interval is just its length. So, then I get stuck by wondering if $\bar{U} - U$ is always at most countable, which at the moment I cannot think of a case where it's not true.

368627,"Smallest subset of $\{1,2,...,4n\}$ with a certain property","Fact 1 : Let $A\subseteq\{1,2,...,2n\}$. If $n+1\leq |A|$, then there exists 2 elements $a,b\in A$ such that $a+b=2n+1$. Proof : This can be shown by writing $\{1,2,...,2n\}$ as the union of $n$ disjoint sets $\{i,2n+1-i\}$ where $1\leq i\leq n$. Since $n+1\leq|A|$, we know that $|A\cap \{i,2n+1-i\}|=2$ for some $i\in\{1,2,..,n\}$. Now we're done because $i+2n+1-i=2n+1$. One also knows that the bound of fact 1 is sharp because $\{1,2,...,n\}$ does not have 2 elements which add up to $2n+1$. Definition : Let $f(n)$ be the smallest number such that:
$$\forall A\subseteq\{1,2,...,4n\}[|A|>f(n)\rightarrow \exists a,b,c,d\in A [a+b+c+d=2(4n+1)] ]$$ Question : What are good upper bounds on $f(n)$ ? Fact 2: $f(n)\leq 3n+1$ Proof : We repeat the idea of the proof of fact 1. Let $A\subseteq\{1,2,...,4n\},|A|\geq 3n+1$. It can be shown that $\{1,2,...,4n\}$ can be written as the union of disjoint sets:
$$\{1,2,...,4n\}=\cup_{i=1}^{n}\{i,2n+1-i,2n+i,4n+1-i\}$$
(It can also be shown that $\land_{i=1}^n[i,2n+1-i,2n+i,4n+1-i \,are\, distinct\,]$ )
Since $|A|\geq 3n+1$, we know that $|A\cap\{i,2n+1-i,2n+i,4n+1-i\}|=4$ for some $i\in\{1,2,...,n\}$. Now we are done because:  $$i+2n+1-i+2n+i+4n+1-i=2(4n+1)$$
Thus $f(n)\leq 3n+1$. Unlike fact 1, I am not sure if the bound of fact 2 is sharp. I think there might be more clever ways of using the pigeon hole principle to obtain better upper bounds on $f(n)$. Question : Are there better bounds for $f(n)$ other than those given by fact 2 ? My main intrest is about seeing the more clever ways of using the pigeon -hole principle being applied to this problem and not the problem itself.

368807,Finite Vertex-Transitive Planar game of Civilization?,"If you have played games in the Civilization series, you will have noticed that the Earth is represented in a simplified and profoundly unsatisfying way. It is wrapped around the curve of a cylinder with impenetrable barriers in the north and south. This is appealing in its simplicity, but very much unlike real geography. For example, here is a thread discussing the problem and possible solutions . Unfortunately, that thread misses the core of the problem. The real world is homeomorphic to a sphere and all places on the globe are pairwise effectively equivalent. If one has that, then any approximation should be good enough, no matter how distorted the globe becomes. In a strategy game, only the graph truly matters. Therefore, what I think I want are simple finite vertex-transitive planar graphs. It seems to me that any graph that can be embedded in the surface of a 2-sphere can be embedded in a plane, so focusing on planar graphs seems to make my problem easier. Unfortunately, I have some other goals that aren't as easy to define, such as being able to generate a graph for any given number of vertices, and being able to imagine the vertices distributed roughly evenly over the surface of a sphere with edges connecting nearby vertices. Unfortunately I have no precise way to express that second goal, but I imagine it could be captured by some upper bound on the diameter of the graph. At least I know that I prefer small diameter graphs over large diameter graphs. Here is an excellent article I found: https://eudml.org/doc/29561 It only deals with degrees 4 and 5, but I find it hard to imagine how it could be much easier for other degrees. There is only one way to create finite vertex-transitive planar graphs of arbitrary size in that article, and it is effectively lining up vertices along two parallels and connecting them with triangles spanning the equator. Graphs like that would have diameter proportional to the number of vertices and wouldn't cover a sphere well. The article also supplies many other graphs, but each one seems to be individual, with no apparent pattern and so unless I am missing something each would need to be treated as a special case when finding a visually appropriate planar embedding. The planar embedding provided in the article are not appropriate because they are roughly circular instead of allowing vertices on the left side to connect to vertices on the right as one expects in most map projections such as those found in an atlas. So what I would really like is an algorithm with parameter $n$ that produces a planar embedding of some simple vertex-transitive small-diameter graph with $n$ vertices, where $n$ is allowed to be many possible numbers, and where the embedding is suggestive of a map projection in an atlas. In addition to that, there are some smaller problems that would surely be useful toward the greater goal: What is the smallest possible diameter for vertex-transitive planar graphs with $n$ vertices? Or what is the largest diameter known to be smaller than the smallest possible diameter? Given $n$, how can one construct a vertex-transitive planar graph with $n$ vertices that has approximately the smallest possible diameter? Assuming there is no answer for the second question, how could one construct a list of all finite vertex-transitive planar graphs for the purpose of searching for graphs with desired properties?","['geometry', 'graph-theory', 'graph-isomorphism']"

368897,"""Inverse problem"" for Brauer groups","This question is really just a curiosity, but I'm really interested in the answer. Given a field $K$, we can form the set$^*$ $Br(K)$ consisting of equivalence classes of finite-dimensional central simple $K$-algebras which split over some Galois extension of $K$, modulo ""are Morita-equivalent"" (I hope I have that right, it's been a while). This set is actually a group, in a natural way: the tensor product over $K$ is well-defined on the equivalence classes, and has identity (the equivalence class of $K$ as an algebra over itself) and inverses (given by $R\mapsto R^{op}$). Actually $Br(K)$ turns out to be a second cohomology group, in a natural and useful way, but I don't really have a good understanding of that part. My main question is, what groups are the Brauer group of some field? I know a couple trivial bits of the answer to this: $Br(K)$ is always abelian, and of cardinality at most $\aleph_0\times\vert K\vert$; and can be trivial (e.g., if $K$ is algebraically closed), or $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ ($Br(\mathbb{R})$, by Frobenius' Theorem on division algebras over $\mathbb{R}$). I also recall that $Br(K)$ is torsion, although I can't seem to find a reference for that right now. Is there a known list of properties which are necessary and sufficient for a group to be $\cong Br(K)$ for some $K$? Now, there are many possible variations/elaborations of this question, which may not have deep significance but seem kind of interesting. For example, leaving the context of fields for a moment, there is an analogous notion of Brauer group for groups: is there a group which is its own Brauer group? Going back to the context of fields, given a field $K$, what groups are $Br(H)$ for some $K\le H\le \overline{K}$? My second question is just: is there a good resource for this type of question, that is, for constructing Brauer groups to specification? I imagine the opposite direction (finding Brauer groups of fields we already care about) is much more useful, but I'm personally interested in this direction. $^*$ Size issues don't arise here: since we specify ""finite-dimensional,"" there are at most $\aleph_0\times\vert K\vert$ many such algebras up to isomorphism; using Scott's trick then lets us represent these equivalence classes in perfectly fine way.","['homology-cohomology', 'reference-request', 'abstract-algebra']"

Use Lagrange multipliers to prove that the greatest distance of a point in $M$ to the origin is the smallest eigenvalue of $A$ raised to $-1/2$. $A$ is too general, so I tried using that there is an invertible matrix $P$ such that $D\triangleq PAP^{-1}$ is diagonal to solve the problem with $D$ and then go back to the original problem. For simplicity, I'm maximizing the squared distance, so, with $\tilde x$ being the critical distance, the system of equations is

 blocks $x^a \sin(x^{-b})$ are not good either. For the derivatives of these blocks to be in $L^1$ one needs $a>b$, but then blocks are in $BV$, and probably also the resulting function... Are there other natural examples to test with?","['bounded-variation', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

But I am really confused on the difference between $A'$ and $\bar{A}$. For example, Let $A=\{(x,y)∈ \mathbb{R}^{2} ∣x^2+y^2<1\}$, certainly $(1,0) \in A'$, but shouldn't $(0,0)∈A'$ too? In this way it would seem that $A \subseteq A'$. The definition of a limit point is a point $x$ such that every neighborhood of $x$ contains a point of $A$ other than $x$ itself. Then wouldn't $(0,0)$ fit this criterion? If I am wrong, why?

369432,Short proof of Hall's theorem,"Studying the proof of Hall's theorem in my book I started to wonder if there is a shorter way to prove it. Following is an attempt that I think works but (being short) makes me wonder if I made a mistake. Can someone double check? For a collection of sets $S_1,\ldots,S_m$ we say that they have a
  collection of distinct represenatives if there exists distinct
  elements $x_1,\ldots,x_m$  such that $x_i \in S_i$ for $i = 1,\ldots, m.$ We say that our  collection of sets satisfies Hall's criterion if $$ \left |\bigcup_{i \in I} S_i \right | \geq |I| \quad \mbox{for all } I \subseteq \{1,\ldots,m\}.$$ Claim. If $S_1,\ldots,S_m$ satisfy Hall's criterion then they have a set of distinct representatives. Proof. We prove the claim by induction on $m.$ For $m=1$ the claim is obvious so suppose the claim holds for all $m < k$ for some $k$ and let $S_1,\ldots,S_m$ be a collection of sets satisfying Hall's criterion. Let $\{x_1,\ldots,x_{m-1}\}$ be the set of distinct representatives for $S_1,\ldots,S_{m-1}$ guaranteed by the indcution hypothesis. If $\{x_1,\ldots,x_{m-1}\} \ne S_m$ then we are done. If $\{x_1,\ldots,x_{m-1}\} = S_m$ that then $ \left |\bigcup_{i=1}^{m-1} S_i \right | > m-1$ since otherwise $S_1,\ldots,S_m$ do not satisfy Hall's criterion. But this implies that for some $i$ there exist a $x_i' \in S_i$ such that $x_i' \not \in S_m$ and hence we can take $\{x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1}, x_i',x_{i+1},\ldots,x_{m-1},x_i\}$ as our set of distinct representatives. $\square$ Anyone happens to see a flaw in the above proof?","['discrete-mathematics', 'proof-writing', 'combinatorics']"

What is the probability that I get a strictly increasing sequence of numbers. My initial thought is as follows: we condition on R1 (the first roll) being a 1, 2, or 3 (which happens with probability 1/2). Now, we look at R2 - there is a 1/6 probability that R1 = R2 and 5/6 probability that R2 is different from R1. In the case that R2 is not equal to R1, by symmetry we get that R2>R1 with a probability of 1/2. Therefore, the probability that R2>R1 is 5/12. Continuing in the same manner... There is a probability of 2/6 that R3 will be equal to R1 or R2. Therefore, there is a 4/6 probability that it is different. Using the same argument as above, there is a 1/6 probability that R3 > R2 > R1. Continuing similarly, P(R4 > R3 > R2 > R1) = (1/2) * (5/12) * (4/36) * (3/144) However, I have a feeling that I am doing something terribly wrong.

369587,How to calculate distance on a sphere with an earth-like coordination system?,"This is probably a too simple question for this site, but I would really appreciate any answers. Lets say I've got a sphere with radius $r = 70$ meters. This sphere has an Earth-like reference system in which coordinates are given as: (longitude, latitude). The coordinate system is exactly like the Earth's, so zero degrees latitude is on the ""equator"" of the sphere with $90$ degrees being the top or ""North pole"" of the sphere, and $-90$ degrees being the bottom or ""South pole"" of the sphere. Also, I've got one vertical line on which positive numbers go ""East"" and negative numbers go ""West"". On this sphere I've got two points with their location, both depicted in degrees: $$
\begin{gather}
    (1, 1)\\
    (3, 3)
\end{gather}
$$ Both points are drawn in the image I've drawn below. In this image, I've also drawn some ""help-lines"". I now need to find the length of $d$ (the distance between the two points). So far I can calculate the variables $a$ and $b$ , and I know that $D$ (the corner opposite of $d$ ) is 90 degrees. To calculate the distance of $d$ I use the Spherical law of cosines ( wiki here ): $$
\cos(d) = \cos(a) * \cos(b) + \sin(a) * \sin(b) * \cos(D)
$$ Since we are using an Earth like reference system, however, the latitude range is $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ instead of $[0, \pi]$ and the longitude range is $[-\pi, \pi]$ instead of $[0, 2\pi]$ . I read that we therefore need to translate this law to the following: $$
\cos(d) = \sin(a) * \sin(b) + \cos(a) * \cos(b) * \cos(D)
$$ Since the spherical law of cosines needs all variables in radians but our points on the sphere are given in degrees, I first transform the degrees to radians: $$
\begin{align}
    a &= (3 - 1) * \frac{\pi}{180} = 0.0349065850399\\
    b &= (3 - 1) * \frac{\pi}{180} = 0.0349065850399\\
    D &= 90 * \frac{\pi}{180} = 1.5707963267948966
\end{align}
$$ Filling this into the formula I get the following: $$
\begin{gather}
    \cos(d) = \sin(a) * \sin(b) + \cos(a) * \cos(b) * \cos(D) = 0.00121797487009\\
    d \text{ in radians} = 1.56957835162\\
    \text{distance in meters} = d * 70 = 109.870484614
\end{gather}
$$ The python code with which I calculate this can be found here: http://pastebin.com/U3qvXxRZ The answer I get here seems to be incorrect though. First of all, a distance of 109 meters between two points which are only two degrees apart on a sphere with a diameter of 140 meters seems like a lot to me. Second of all, if I move the points closer to each other, the distance_in_meters seems to increase. Thirdly, I found this little piece of python code ( here ), in which they seem to do it differently. They simply take the latitude of the first and second point as the variables 'a' and 'b', instead of the difference between the latitudes as 'a'. So my question. What am I doing wrong here?

We show that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_G$ . Define a one-to-one function $\phi: G \to S_G$ such that $\phi(xy)=\phi(x) \phi(y)$ for all $x,y \in G$ . For $x \in G$ , let $\lambda_x: G \to G$ be defined by $\lambda_x (g) = xg$ for all $g \in G$ . The equation $\lambda_x (x^{-1} c) = x(x^{-1} c) = c$ for all $c \in G$ shows that $\lambda_x$ maps $G$ onto $G$ . If $\lambda_x (a) = \lambda_x (b)$ , then $xa=xb$ so $a=b$ by cancellation. Thus $\lambda_x$ is also one to one, and is a permutation of $G$ . We now define $\phi: G \to S_G$ by defining $\phi(x) = \lambda_x$ for all $x \in G$ . To show that $\phi$ is one to one, suppose that $\phi(x) = \phi(y)$ . Then $\lambda_x = \lambda_y$ as functions mapping $G$ into $G$ . In particular $\lambda_x (e) = \lambda_y (e)$ , so $xe=ye$ and $x=y$ . Thus $\phi$ is one to one. It only remains to show that $\phi(xy) = \phi(x) \phi(y)$ , that is, that $\phi_{xy} = \lambda_x \lambda_y$ . Now for any $g \in G$ , we have $\lambda_{xy} (g) = (xy)g$ . Permutation multiplication is function composition, so $(\lambda_x \lambda_y)(g) = \lambda_x (\lambda_y (g)) = \lambda_x (yg) = x(yg)$ .

Show that $\sum_{k=1}^n \cos k$ is bounded. After a bit of floundering, I realized that the key is to
write this as the real part of

$\sum_{k=1}^n \cos(ak)$ and
$\sum_{k=1}^n \sin(ak)$ are also bounded
for any real $a$ not a multiple of $2\pi$,
since the denominator of the expression that results
is $e^{i a}-1$, and this is nonzero for any such $a$. So I wondered if there is a generalization

$\int_0^p f(x)\, dx = 0$,

is $\sum_{k=1}^n f(qk)$  bounded? If this is false, are there any additional conditions

Show that (3) $\phi(x_0)=0$ implies $T(\phi)(x_0)=0$. Pick a positive function $\phi_0\in \mathcal{S}$, and apply this to $\phi(x_0)\phi_0-\phi_0(x_0)\phi$ to show there exist a function $c(x)$ so that $(T\phi)(x)=c(x)\phi(x)$ for all $\phi\in \mathcal{S}$. Use relation (1) to show that $c(x)$ is a constant $c$. Take $\phi=e^{-|x|^2}$ to determine $c$ and derive the inversion formula for $\mathcal{S}$. I understand why (3) holds by application of (2) but I don't see how to make an inversion-formula. I can also show $c= \frac{T(\phi_0)}  {\phi_0}$,and why it is a constant. But i don't quite understand how to show (1),(2). Thanks for help and/or suggestions.","['distribution-theory', 'fourier-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
369723,The genus of a curve with a group structure,"I'm reading Milne's Elliptic Curves and came across this statement: If a nonsingular projective curve has a group structure defined by polynomial maps, then it has genus 1.
In this question a similar question was asked, and an answer given there (the one that was not accepted) someone backs this up using machinery/notation that I do not understand. Can someone give or direct me to a proof of this statement? It doesn't have to be very formal; this isn't homework. Also, in the affine case this statement clearly breaks down - the affine line has the group structure of addition, for instance. Is there some sort of correction or does the group structure bear no relation to the genus in this case?","['algebraic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves']"
369725,"If $f: X \to Y$, when do we have $\beta Y \supset \overline{f(X)} = \beta X$?","Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are Tychonoff spaces, denote by $\beta X$ and $\beta Y$ their Stone-Čech compactifications and let $f:X\to Y$ be a continuous map. Using the embedding $Y\hookrightarrow\beta Y$ we can regard $f(X)$ as a subset of $\beta Y$ and therefore take its closure $\overline{f(X)} \subset \beta Y$ . Under which conditions do we have $\overline{f(X)} = \beta X$ ? Let us regard $\beta X$ as the Gelfand space to $C_b(X)$ , i.e., for every element $x \in \beta X$ there is a net $(x_i) \subset X$ , such that we can regard $x$ as the multiplicative functional $\varphi \mapsto \lim_i \varphi(x_i)$ on $C_b(X)$ . Analogously with $\beta Y$ . Then it seems that there is a natural map $j: \beta X \to \beta Y$ by pulling back bounded continuous functions from $Y$ to $X$ via the map $f$ , i.e., $j(x)(\varphi) := x(f^\ast \varphi)$ , where $\varphi \in C_b(Y)$ and $x \in \beta X$ . If $(x_i) \subset X$ is a net with $x_i \to x$ in $\beta X$ , then we have $x(f^\ast \varphi) = \lim_i \varphi(f(x_i))$ . So $f(x_i) \to j(x)$ in $\beta Y$ and that means $j(\beta X) \subset \overline{f(X)}$ . Now we want to define a map $i: \beta Y \supset \overline{f(X)} \to \beta X$ with $i = j^{-1}$ . The only way I see is to assume that $Y$ is a normal space, $f$ is an embedding and $f(X) \subset Y$ is a closed subset. Then, given a function $\psi \in C_b(X)$ , we can ""push it forward"" via $f$ to a continuous function $f_\ast \psi$ on $f(X) \subset Y$ and extend it arbitrarily to the whole of $Y$ via the Tietze extension theorem. Call this extended function $\widetilde{f_\ast \psi} \in C_b(Y)$ . Then we define $i(y)(\psi) := y(\widetilde{f_\ast \psi})$ for $y \in \overline{f(X)} \subset \beta Y$ and $\psi \in C_b(X)$ . Since $y \in \overline{f(X)}$ , this map $i$ is well-defined, i.e., independent of the extension of $f_\ast \psi$ to $\widetilde{f_\ast \psi}$ . Is the above reasoning right, i.e., do we have $\overline{f(X)} = \beta X$ via the above maps $j$ and $i$ under the conditions that $Y$ is normal, $f$ an embedding and $f(X) \subset Y$ closed? What about the converse? Assume that we have $\overline{f(X)} = \beta X$ . Can we conclude that $f$ must be an embedding or that $f(X) \subset Y$ is closed or that $Y$ must be normal?","['general-topology', 'compactification', 'compactness']"
