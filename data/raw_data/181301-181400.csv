3305117,Expectation of maximum of n i.i.d random variables,"I have $n$ i.i.d. random variables, $X_1,..., X_n$ which follow some arbitrary distribution. Based on experiments in Python with various distributions, it seems that $\mathbb{E}(\max(X_1,...,X_n))$ is a linear (or seemingly close to linear) function of $\mathbb{E}(X_i)$ . It is indeed linear for some examples where it is possible to get a closed form solution for $\mathbb{E}(\max(X_1,...,X_n))$ or a good approximation. Expected value of $\max\{X_1,\ldots,X_n\}$ where $X_i$ are iid uniform. Expectation of the maximum of i.i.d. geometric random variables I wonder if this is the case more generally? Is there some way to prove it?","['expected-value', 'probability-distributions', 'order-statistics', 'probability']"
3305131,Possible Jordan Canonical Forms: Intuition,"As I was reviewing linear algebra before I head off to grad school in the fall, I came across a question about Jordan Canonical Forms. It reads:
""Suppose that A is a square complex matrix with characteristic polynomial $c_A(x) =
(x−1)^4(x+ 3)^5$ .
Assume also that $A−I$ has nullity 4 and $A+3I$ has nullity 1, where $I$ is the identity matrix of the same size as $A$ . Find, with justification, all possible Jordan
canonical forms of $A$ , and give the minimal polynomial for each."" I believe that there will be 2 Jordan Blocks, for each eigenvalue of $A$ . Since the rank of the null space of the linear operator $A-I$ is 4, then the dimension of the eigenspace $E_1$ will be four. So there will be four linearly independent eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1. Thus there will one 4 by 4 Jordan Block with no ones in the super-diagonal. Since the dimension of the null space of $A+3I$ has rank 1, then there is only one linearly independent eigenvector with eigenvalue -3. If $K_{-3}$ is the generalized eigenspace, then $dim(K_{-3})=5$ . Does this implies that there are 5 linearly independent generalized eigenvectors with corresponding to -3? Is so, then there will be one 5 by 5 Jordan block for the eigenvalue -3 with ones in the superdiagonal. So we get \begin{bmatrix}
     1& 0 &0 &0 &0 &0 &0 &0 &0   \\
 0& 1 &0 &0 &0 &0 &0 &0 &0  \\
 0& 0 &1 &0 &0 &0 &0 &0 &0   \\
 0& 0 &0 &1 &0 &0 &0 &0 &0   \\
 0& 0 &0 &0 &-3 &1 &0 &0 &0   \\
 0& 0 &0 &0 &0 &-3 &1 &0 &0   \\
 0& 0 &0 &0 &0 &0 &-3 &1 &0   \\
 0& 0 &0 &0 &0 &0 &0 &-3 &1   \\
0& 0 &0 &0 &0 &0 &0 &0 &-3 
  \end{bmatrix} How do I determine the minimal polynomial? Are there any other options for the Jordan blocks corresponding to the eigenvalue -3? Is it possible for a different linear transformation with the same characteristic polynomial to have the dimension of the null space of $A-3I$ to be 2,3 or 4? Is so, how does this affect the Jordan form and why?","['matrices', 'jordan-normal-form', 'linear-algebra']"
3305139,Where do we need absolute values when solving $u'(t) = \frac{u^2(t) - u(t)}{t}$,"Solve the differential equation $$
u'(t)
= \frac{u^2(t) - u(t)}{t}
$$ and then solve the initial value problem with $u(1) = \frac{1}{2}$ . I know the general solution is given by $u(t) = \frac{1}{c_1 t + 1}$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$ and some $c_1 \in \mathbb{R}$ determined by the initial condition, which is not always positive. My problem is that when I integrate $\frac{1}{t}$ when using separation of variables, is my result $\ln|t|$ or just $\ln(t)$ ? Here's what I've done so far:
We exclude the constant solutions $u :\equiv 0$ and $u : \equiv 1$ Then our differential equation is equivalent to $$
\frac{u’(t)}{u^2(t) - u(t)} = \frac{1}{t}.
$$ Integrating and substituting gives \begin{align*}
\int_{u(t_0)}^{u(t)} \frac{1}{s(s - 1)} ds
= \int_{t_0}^{t} \frac{1}{s} ds
\implies & \int_{u(t_0)}^{u(t)} \frac{1}{s - 1}  - \frac{1}{s} ds
= \ln\left| \frac{t}{t_0} \right| \\
\implies & \ln\left|\frac{u(t_0) ( u(t) - 1 )}{u(t) ( u(t_0) - 1)} \right|
= \ln\left| \frac{t}{t_0} \right| \\
\implies & \frac{| u(t) |}{|u(t) - 1|}
= \frac{|t_0| |u(t_0)|}{|t| | u(t_0) - 1|}

3305337,Is there a natural example of a divisible torsioned (= periodic) abelian group?,"The following are easy to verify: (I) Every ordered group is torsion-free. (II) Every non-trivial torsion-free group is infinite. Also, if $G$ is a non-trivial divisible group of a finite order $n,$ then for a non-zero element $a\in G$ we can not find an element $b$ with $a=\underbrace{b+\ldots+b}_{n-times}.$ Because, using Lagrange's theorem, the element $\underbrace{b+\ldots+b}_{n-times}$ would be equal to zero for any $b\in G.$ Hence, we also have the following: (III) Every non-trivial divisible group is infinite. Using a compactness argument from model theory and the fact that every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is isomorphic to some $\mathbb{Z}^{n},$ we also have that: (IV) Every torsion-free abelian group is orderable. Hence, in the realm of abelian groups torsion-free coincides with orderable. The following are some typical examples for the aforementioned notions in the realm of abelian groups: 1- $\langle\mathbb{Z},+,0\rangle$ is non-didivisible torsion-free. 2- $\langle\mathbb{Q},+,0\rangle, \langle\mathbb{R},+,0\rangle, $ and $\langle\mathbb{C},+,0\rangle$ all are divisible torsion-free. 3- For any $n,$ the group $\langle(\mathbb{Z}_{n})^{\omega},+,0\rangle$ is infinite non-divisible and torsion (=periodic). The situation remains almost unchanged if you consider the above examples with their natural multiplications: 1- $\langle\mathbb{Z}^{+},.,1\rangle$ is not a group at all! 2- $\langle\mathbb{Q}^{+},.,1\rangle$ and $\langle\mathbb{R}^{+},.,1\rangle$ are torsion-free but non-divisible: there is no element like $a$ with $-1=a.a.$ 3- $\langle\mathbb{C}^{+},.,1\rangle$ is torsion-free and divisible since, as a consequence of being an algebraically closed field, for every $a,$ the equation $x^n=a$ has always a solution in $\mathbb{C}^{+}.$ 4- $\langle\mathbb{Z}^{+}_{n},.,1\rangle$ is a group if and only if $n$ is prime. In this case also, $\langle(\mathbb{Z}^{+}_{p})^{\omega},.,1\rangle$ is torsioned non-divisible. Now, my question is if there exists a divisible torsioned(=periodic) abelian group built using numerical examples? In fact, due to some decidability concerns, I am more interested in additive examples.","['model-theory', 'logic', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'abelian-groups']"

3305380,$N$ successive integers are linearly independent if they are large compared to $N$,"Is it true for any $N\geq 1$ , there is a value $f(N)$ such that for any integer $x\geq f(N)$ the integers $x+1,x+2,x+3,\ldots ,x+N$ are always multiplicatively independent (i.e. the relation $(x+1)^{e_1}(x+2)^{e_2}\ldots (x+N)^{e_N}=1$ with the $e_k\in{\mathbb Z}$ is possible only when all of the $e_k$ 's are zero). I have checked this for $N=2,3$ . Let $f(N)$ be the smallest such thing described above. We have $f(2)=1$ because $x$ and $x+1$ are always coprime. For $N=3$ , we have $f(3)=2$ . This can be checked as follows : Suppose that $x$ is even. Let $2^t$ be the largest power of $2$ that divides $x+2$ . Then $x+1,\frac{x+2}{2^t},x+3$ are mutually coprime odd integers and the result follows. Next, suppose that $x\equiv 1 \ ({\mathsf{mod}}\ 4)$ . Let $2^r$ be the largest power of $2$ that divides $x+3$ . Then $r\geq 2$ , $\frac{x+1}{2},x+2,\frac{x+3}{2^t}$ are mutually coprime odd integers and the result follows.

3305412,Can speed be defined for a parametrized but irregular curve in a Riemannian manifold?,"My book is Connections, Curvature, and Characteristic Classes by Loring W. Tu (I'll call this Volume 3), a sequel to both Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology by Loring W. Tu and Raoul Bott (Volume 2) and An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring W. Tu (Volume 1). I refer to Section 2.1 , Section 2.2 , Volume 1 Section 8.6 (Part 1) and Volume 1 Section 8.6 (Part 2) . Use $t$ to denote the standard coordinate on $[a,b]$ , and use $t_0$ to denote a point in $[a,b]$ . Let $x$ be the standard coordinate on $[0,l]$ . The speed of a curve $c: [a,b] \to M$ into a Riemannian manifold $M$ at a point $t_0 \in [a,b]$ is defined $\|c'(t_0)\| := \sqrt{\langle c'(t_0), c'(t_0) \rangle_{t_0}}$ . Then we can define speed as a map by $\|c'\|: [a,b] \to [0, \infty), (\|c'\|)(t_0) := \|c'(t_0)\|$ . Here , it seems to be claimed that this map $\|c'\|$ is the derivative of arc length function $s$ of $c$ . Question : In the first place, is $c$ supposed to be assumed regular/an immersion for the definition of speed $\|c'\|$ , arc length $l$ or arc length function $s$ , and why/why not? My thoughts: If $c$ is regular/an immersion, then $\|c'\|$ is smooth by this , but I think it's possible to define $\|c'\|$ , $l$ and $s$ for continuous $\|c'\|$ . I can't think of a condition on $c$ to make $\|c'\|$ continuous but not necessarily smooth (see thought (2) below). 1.1. Edit: I actually didn't mention earlier : Observe that in the paragraph before Proposition 2.3 , Tu uses the fundamental theorem of calculus. Based on the version of FTC on Wikipedia , I think the rule behind FTC is something like ""continuous $\mathbb R$ -valued functions defined on a closed interval $[a,b]$ of $\mathbb R$ are Riemann integrable on $[a,t]$ for any $a<t\le b$ "" Without such rule, I don't think we can define the "" $F$ "" in the version of FTC on Wikipedia . With such rule, if $\|c'\|$ (the ""f"") were continuous, then we could define $s$ (the ""F"") and thus define $l$ . If $c$ is regular/an immersion, then $\|c'\|$ is smooth and thus continuous. If $c$ were irregular/not an immersion, then $\|c'\|$ is not necessarily smooth, I think (see thought (2) below). But we can still define $s$ (and thus define $l$ ) by the rule if $\|c'\|$ is somehow at least continuous. It could be possible $\|c'\|$ is actually continuous or even smooth for an irregular/a non-immersion, but still smooth, $c$ because in this question, Paulo Mourão can prove the smoothness part without immersion . Update : I think we can still define $\|c'\|$ , $l$ and $s$ for an irregular/a non-immersion $c$ because there's this exercise: Exercise 2.6 , which asks for the arc length of a parametrized curve that was shown in Example 2.2 (see here ) to be irregular/not an immersion. At the very least $l$ and $\|c'\|$ are defined. Not sure if $s$ is. Context: Does a curve parametrized by arc length have unit speed and its parameter starting at 0 even if not regular/not an immersion? If a curve $c$ can be reparametrized by arc length, then is $c$ regular?","['riemannian-geometry', 'proof-verification', 'manifolds', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

The question is the standard problem, to solve for x in: $3 \sin x - 4 \cos x = 2$ I solve this first dividing both sides by 4 (to make everything ≤1 to be easier to work with) and continue by procedure, described in the book and here: Solving trigonometric equations of the form $a\sin x + b\cos x = c$ I get something like: $x = \arcsin(\frac{2}{5})-\arctan(-\frac{4}{3}) \approx 1.339$ , which is correct, as given in the book answer. However, the book gives 2 answers. The second is $\approx-2.626$ and I am unable to obtain it. I understand $\arcsin$ and $\arctan$ functions can give two different values, so tried different variations of it, which are: $\arcsin$ to give the angle in the 2nd quadrant, by $x_2=\pi-\arcsin(\frac{2}{5})$ $\arctan$ to give the angle in the 2nd quadrant (my calculator gives $\arctan(-\frac{4}{3})\approx -0.927$ ) by adding a $\pi$ However, neither of these combinations work to give me the required $-2.626$ . So my questions are: How would you obtain the required second answer? Why other combinations from $\arcsin$ and $\arctan$ wouldn't work? How could I solve this (if at all) without dividing primarily by the highest coefficient, in this case 4? It somehow just didn't work in my head.

conjugate transpose of $A$ . I want to compute $\det[M]^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ . I know that for a real symmetric matrix $\Sigma$ we can represent its determinant as a gaussian integral with real variables $x_i$ : $$
\frac{1}{|\Sigma|^{1 / 2}}=\int \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{n / 2}} \exp \left(-\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{x}^{T} \Sigma\mathbf{x}\right)\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}.$$ However in my case $M$ has complex values. I was wondering if we could extend this integral representation to Hermitian matrices.
Among the feedback I got, these are the candidates: \begin{equation}
    \det[M]^{-\frac{1}{2}}=\int \left ( \prod_{i} \frac{\mathrm{d} x_i}{\sqrt{2 \pi / i}}\right ) \exp \left\{-\frac{\mathrm{i}}{2} \sum_{i j }x_i\left (\sum_k\left(\omega \delta_{i k}-A_{i k}\right)\left(\omega^* \delta_{k j}-A_{k j}^T\right)\right ) x_j\right\}.

 \det[M]^{-\frac{1}{2}}=\int\left(\prod_i \frac{d^{2} z_{i}}{\pi}\right) \exp \left\{-\sum_{i, j, k} z_{i}^{*}\left(\omega^{*} \delta_{i k}-J_{i k}^{T}\right)\left(\omega \delta_{k j}-J_{k j}\right) z_{j}\right\}
\end{equation} The second one involving complex variables seems intuitively the best suited. However I do not know whether this is correct, and I could use a simpler integral then I would prefer very much so. Why would not this work: $$
    \det[M]^{-\frac{1}{2}}=\int \left ( \prod_{i} \frac{\mathrm{d} x_i}{\sqrt{2 \pi }}\right ) \exp \left\{-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i j }x_i\left (\sum_k\left(\omega \delta_{i k}-A_{i k}\right)\left(\omega^* \delta_{k j}-A_{k j}^T\right)\right ) x_j\right\}.

But I don't know how to calculate that residue, since the pole is of the 10th order. Is there another approach I should take, maybe find the Laurent series of the function?

3305668,Residual separability of birational morphisms,"My goal is to use a ""normal Bertini"" theorem (see https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs000130050213 ) More specifically, let $k$ be a field (you may assume that k is infinite but it should be irrelevent). Let $f:X \rightarrow Y$ be a birational morphim between normal projective varieties over $k$ . I would like to show that $f$ is residually separable, that is if $x \in X$ , the extension $\kappa (x)/\kappa (f(x))$ is separable. Obviously everything happends in the exceptional locus, so we have to deal with infinite extensions. What I'm able to show is that $\kappa(f(x))$ is algebraically closed in $\kappa(x)$ (which would at least be necessary). To do this, pass to the completions (which are normal using Zariski main theorem) of $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{Y,f(x)}$ . Then use Hensel's lemma. 1) Is that sufficient ? I would like to use the Mac-Lane separability criterion (see Bourbaki algebra V.15). 2) If not is there a way around ?

3305696,Hard system in integers related to natural number representations,"Update: Observing a necessary condition, and ""unbalanced"" variation A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a number to be a solution to this Diophantine system (Representing ""balanced"" triple palindromes ) presented in the "" The problem-system "" section of this question, is for it to be a solution of the following linked Diophantine System (Representing ""balanced"" double palindromes ). Number is a triple (double) palindrome if it is palindromic in three (two) consecutive number bases. Double and triple palindromes are ""balanced"", if they have the same number of digits in all of their consecutive palindromic bases. Otherwise, they are unbalanced. Unbalanced variation of this problem is not known if it has solutions or not , at all; Does there exits an ""unbalanced"" triple palindrome ? I suspect that there are finitely many ""unbalanced"" double palindromes for every fixed case of digits? - where it is also not known if an unbalanced triple palindrome exists. This conjecture was motivated by the fact that the opposite is true for ""balanced"" double palindromes : It is known that there exists infinitely many ""balanced"" double palindromes for every fixed case of digits . Update on $d\ge 5$ cases The case $d=5$ is now proven computationally. But the case is still referenced as conjectured in the text below. - A human solution would still be very useful if possible. ( Can we bypass the 2-palindrome step and solve directly for 3-palindromes? ) The solutions for 2-palindromes from this answer's $d=5$ case are extendable computationally to base $b-2$ and yield the conjectured $d=5$ solutions presented here. I'm not sure if it is possible to do the similar thing with $d\ge 7$ . - The obstacle being the limitations of using a CAS to solve the given system of equations. Table of contents This post will be a bit longer than usual, so here is a table of contents: Problem and progress : Stating the problem and presenting known solutions so far. Questions on possible ways to continue making progress? Context of the problem and some basic stated theory used to prove $d=3$ solutions. Going over the proof of $d=3$ , can we extend it to conjectured $d=5,7,\dots$ solutions? Related problems and the generalized system-problem, motivation In short, progress in this helps solve problems related to special numbers  that depend on representations in multiple number bases, especially ones that deal with the digits of the number. Such as the two linked questions on existence of a $4$ -palindrome and finding $3$ -palindromes. Problem and progress The problem-system Let $a_i,A_i,B_i,o_i,h_i,b,d\in\mathbb N_0,i\in\{1,\dots,d\}$ be non-negative integers. Can we solve: $$
0 \le a_i\lt b,a_1\ne0 \\
0 \le A_i=A_{d-i+1}\lt b-1,A_1\ne 0\\
0 \le B_i=B_{d-i+1}\lt b-2,B_1\ne 0
$$ If it is given $d\gt 1$ , and: $$
a_{j}=a_{d-j+1},j\in\{1\dots d\} \\
A_i=\sum_{k=1}^{i}\binom{d-k}{i-k}a_k + o_{i} - o_{i-1} (b-1) \\
B_i=\sum_{k=1}^{i}\binom{d-k}{i-k}2^{i-k}a_k + h_{i} - h_{i-1} (b-2)
$$ For all $(a_1,\dots,a_d;b),o_i,h_i$ that satisfy these conditions? Where also note that $o_i,h_i=0$ for $i=0,d$ . These equations in short, arise from: $$
\sum_{k=1}^d a_kb^{d-k}=\sum_{k=1}^d A_k(b-1)^{d-k}=\sum_{k=1}^d B_k(b-2)^{d-k}
$$ By writing $A_k,B_k$ in terms of $a_k$ , and using $o_i,h_i$ to regularize the equations - which is explained in the context of the problem part of this post. When the equations are regularized by $o_i,h_i$ , the $a_k,A_k,B_k$ can be viewed as digits of a number in bases $b,b-1,b-2$ that are required to be palindromic by the problem-system . Progress so far $(0)\space$ If solution exists: $(a_1,\dots,a_d;b)$ for some $d$ , then $o_i,h_i$ that allow it are unique. $(1)\space$ If $d$ is even, the system has no solutions. $(2)\space$ If $d=3$ , I have all the solutions. $(3^*)\space$ For $d=5,7$ , I conjecture I have all the solutions. $(4^*)\space$ For $d\ge 9$ , I suspect there are no solutions, or at most finitely many solutions. I do not have yet any examples (counterexamples) for this. $(\infty)\space$ Mathematica can solve any $d$ case for $(a_1,\dots,a_d)$ , but for one fixed $b$ at a time. Observation: If there are families of infinitely many solutions, they will appear periodically among consecutive values of $b$ . Otherwise, only a finite number of solutions could exist, for small enough values of $b$ . This observation can be used to computationally solve individual $d$ cases - but I have no ways of proving there aren't any more solutions, because I do not know how to set up any upper bounds, even thought they should clearly exist in the context of periods and the smallest base after which all periods should be visible. Known infinite families of solutions For $d=3,5,7$ , I strongly conjecture I have all such solutions. For $d=3$ only, I managed to actually prove it by exhausting all $o_i,h_i$ cases (by going over all regularized expressions ) systematically ( which is explained by the end of this post ). For convenience, lets write the the solutions in terms of the smallest one $+$ increment for $a_i$ terms, and $b$ in terms of a constant $+$ period of the solutions in the family. Also, since $a_i=a_{d-i+1}$ , we can write solutions by writing only the first $\frac{d+1}{2}$ values of $a_i$ . Then: We have for $k\in\mathbb N_0$ the families with infinitely many solutions: $$
(a_1+c_1k,\dots,a_{(d+1)/2}+c_{(d+1)/2}k)=(a_i)+(c_i)k

$$ Notice solutions for $d=3,5,7$ have (largest) periods $p=2,4,12$ . For $d=9,11$ , if infinite solution families exist, period is greater than $500,300$ respectively. (Checked bases $b$ from $10^9$ to $10^9+p$ ), which seems unlikely - That is, it seems unlikely that these cases have solutions at all- And this would be an unexpected result for me. Known finite sets of solutions We have for $d=3$ the $(3,6;9)$ solution, for $d=5$ none, for $d=7$ we have $12$ solutions among $b$ from $11$ to $51$ . For $d=9,11$ there also seem to be none so far. Question - Possible ways to make progress? Fully solve the system? $Q_1:$ Is it possible to solve this problem-system for general
  expressions in terms of $b$ ? I can do it for one fixed $b$ at a time like mentioned in $(\infty)$ claim, then find general expressions in terms of $b$ by observing consecutive $b$ values. For example, like I did for $d=3,5,7$ . But I have no ways of proving there aren't any more solutions I have missed. If it is not possible to directly find (prove all) solutions in terms of $b$ for given $d$ , an alternate way that could attack this problem, partially instead: Start partially solving cases of $d$ ? $Q_2:$ Can we give an upper bound on the period $p$ for solutions of
  the infinite families, and an upper bound for the value $b$ after
  which no new families can exist? For example, for $d=3,5,7$ , these periods are exactly $p=2,4,12$ , and such $b$ are exactly $b_p=8,47,291$ . (True for $d=3$ , conjectured for $d=5,7$ ). If we can find such upper bounds, the lower bounds can be increased computationally using $(\infty)$ claim, until reacing or surprassing the upper bounds, and thus we can start proving all solutions for one case of $d$ at a time. Computationally solve (prove) cases of $d$ ? $Q_3:$ Is it possible to generalize the approach used to prove $d=3$ ,
  and make a CAS use it to prove individual cases of $d$ systematically? But I'm having trouble figuring out how to systematically go over all regularized expressions for given $d$ in an effective and usable way. - Which $o_i,h_i$ combinations make sense to verify for solutions and which ones can we disprove (prove yield no solutions)? Context of the problem and theory for proving $d=3$ case The context of the system The context in which this problem-system arises is, the problem of finding all $3$ -palindromes. - Numbers palindromic in three consecutive number bases. We are also requiring them to have $d$ digits in those number bases. Lets define a number representation in base $b$ , but also allow the irregular representations - that the digit are $\in\mathbb Z$ or $\ge b$ . Every number $n\in\mathbb N$ has infinitely many irregular expressions in base $b$ , and one unique expression  - the standard regular representation in a number base. $$n=\overline{a'_1a'_2\dots a'_{d'}}=(a_1,\dots,a_d)_{b}=\sum_{k=1}^{d}a_kb^{d-k}$$ For example: $100=(1,0,0)_{10}=(1,2,1)_{9}=(2,-7,1)_{9}=(11,1)_{9}=\dots$ Where the first two expressions are regular , and the other two are irregular . From here, we can get the inequalities by definition for some $n\in\mathbb N$ : $$n=(a_i)_b=\sum_{k=1}^{d}a_kb^{d-k}=\sum_{k=1}^{d}a_k((b-1)+1)^{d-k}=\sum_{k=1}^{d}A_k(b-1)^{d-k}=(A_i)_{b-1}$$ Where you expand $a_k((b-1)+1)^{d-k}$ by binomial theorem to get the expressions for $A_i$ , which are given at the beginning if you ignore the $o_i$ parameters. In this case, the representation given by $A_i$ is irregular , unless $A_i<b-1$ for all $i$ , but in that case, we cannot have a palindrome in $b-1$ (observe the formula for $A_i$ without $o_i$ parameters). This means we are working with irregular expression for $A_i$ if we want to find solutions. Regularizing the representations This is where $o_i$ parameters come into place. To actually check for the digits $A_i$ to make a palindrome in base $b-1$ , they need to be a part of the regular expression. This means we need to regularize these $A_i$ expressions so they make up a regular representation in number base $b-1$ . Only then we can actually verify whether $n$ can be palindromic in $b-1$ . By definition, you can borrow ""from"" or ""to"" neighbouring digits, without changing the value of $n$ , like so: $$
n=(\dots,a_t,a_{t+1},\dots)_b=(\dots,a_t+o_{t},a_{t+1}-o_{t}b,\dots)_b
$$ For $o_i\in\mathbb Z$ . But since we have observed that $A_i\lt b-1$ does not work assuming $(A_i)_b$ is regular for all $o_i=0$ , and since $A_i\gt 0$ , we need to reduce the $A_i$ digits to get to a regular representation. Thus, we can work with $o_i\in\mathbb N_0$ . Similar story with $B_i$ and base $b-2$ , and ""borrowings"" to regularize the expression with $h_i$ . If we were working with $b,b+1,b+2$ instead of $b,b-1,b-2$ , then $o_i,h_i$ could also be negative, which gives a harder system to analyse. Claims $(0)$ and $(1)$ From the uniqueness of the regular expression and definition of $o_i,h_i$ , the $(0)$ follows easily. The $(1)$ is true (for the presented system at the beginning), since it can be shown that if a number is palindromic in number base $b$ and has an even number of digits, then it is divisible by $b+1$ . This means if we have a palindrome with $d=2l$ digits in base $b-1$ , then it cannot be palindromic in base $b$ , because of divisibility it should end with $0$ , and we have that $a_1,A_1\ne0$ . Solving the system for $d=3$ - proving $(2)$ claim. Here, the system presented at the beginning is based on bases $b,b-1,b-2$ and works in terms of $o_i,h_i$ . By using the definition of irregular expressions , we can avoid writing down $o_i,h_i$ and the system explicitly. We will first find all $2$ -palindromes then extend to $3$ -palidnromes. We will do this, by finding all possible regularized expressions for base $b-1$ by going over $o_i$ parameters. Then we will go over $h_i$ just for the now found $2$ -palindromes, to again find and check all regular expressions for being a palindrome. We have that: $$n=(a_1,a_2,a_1)_b=(A_1,A_2,A_3)_{b-1}=(a_1,2a_1 + a_2,2a_1+ a_2)_{b-1}$$ We will observe two cases: $1.)\space a_1 \le a_2$ , That is, we can parameterize: $a_2 = a_1 + r_1,r_1\in\mathbb N_0$ . Now we can also parameterize the number base: $$b=\max\{a_1,a_2\}+t=a_2+t=a_1+r_1+t,t\in\mathbb N$$ Like this, since $a_1,a_2$ need to be $<b$ , since $(a_1,a_2,a_1)_b$ is a regular expression. Now we have: $$
(A_i)_{b-1}=(a_1,3a_1 + r_1,3a_1+ r_1)_{a_1+r_1+t-1}
$$ If we assume $b-1\gt 3a_1+r_1$ , then we have a regular expression, but it can't be a palindrome since $A_1=a_1\lt A_3=3a_1+r_1 \implies A_1\ne A_3$ . Thus, $b-1\le 3a_1+r_1$ . Now we have an irregular expression. Lets regularize it: $$
(a_1,3a_1 + r_1,3a_1+ r_1)_{b-1} \\
=(a_1+1,3a_1 + r_1-(b-1)+1,3a_1+ r_1-(b-1))_{b-1} \\
=(1+a_1,2-t+2 a_1,1-t+2 a_1)_{a_1+r_1+t-1} \\
$$ By applying the first case of $o_i$ parameters - By using the ""borrowings"" to satisfy regularization under $b-1\le 3a_1+r_1$ condition. Now this is either regularized or not. If you assume not, and continue going for other cases of $o_i$ and regularizing in all other possible ways, you'll every time reach a case with no solutions for $A_1=A_3$ . Thus lets assume this is now regularized. Thus we need to solve: $$
A_1=A_3\iff 1+a_1=1-t+2 a_1\iff t=a_1
$$ If you also look at the conditions under which this is regularized, you'll get: $$
(c_1):\space (1 \le a_1 \le 3 \land r_1 \ge 4 - a_1) \lor (a_1 \ge 4 \land r_1 \ge 0)
$$ We have now solved case $1.)$ for $2$ -palindromes. That is, we have solutions: $$
(a_1,a_2;b)=(a_1,a_1+r_1;2a_1+r_1),a_1,r_1\in\mathbb N\land(c_1)
$$ Or in the context of $2$ -palindromes: $$
(a_1,a_1+r_1,a_1)_{2a_1+r_1}=(1+a_1,2+a_1,1+a_1)_{2a_1+r_1-1}
$$ Now we need to check the expression in base $b-2$ and go over all regular expressions by going over $h_i$ combinations. After now checking these for $B_i$ conditions for base $b-2$ , you can show that the final solution to the $d=3$ for case $1.)$ is: $$ (a_1,a_2;b)=(a-2,a+2;2a),a\ge 4 \lor  (a_1,a_2;b)=(3,6;9) $$ Or in $3$ -palindrome context (the first part, the second part is just number $n=300$ in bases $9,8,7$ ): $$
(a-2,a+2,a-2)_{2a}=(a-1,a,a-1)_{2a-1}=(a,a+1,a)_{2a-2},a\ge 4
$$ Now, in a similar way, you can handle the $2.)\space a_1\gt a_2$ case, and find all $2$ -palindromes in bases $b,b-1$ . But when checking for $B_i$ as well, for base $b-2$ , there will be no final solutions for $3$ -palindromes. That is, for $2.)\space a_1\gt a_2$ , we can show there aren't any solutions after doing a similar process for $A_i$ and then finally considering $B_i$ conditions as well. Thus, we can show the final solution for $d=3$ is: $$ (a_1,a_2;b)=(a-2,a+2;2a),a\ge 4 \lor  (a_1,a_2;b)=(3,6;9) $$ Which agrees with solutions given in $(2)$ claim. Generalizing the proof for $(2)$ claim? Is it possible to implement this process in a CAS? To solve for any given $d$ in general? I've tried in Mathematica , but I'm not sure how to properly go over
  all regular expression. My idea was to go over all $\frac{d+1}{2}!$ cases of permuting $a_i$ in $a_1\le a_2\le \dots\le a_{(d+1)/2}$ . Now we can parameterize the base $b=\max\{a_i\}+t,t\in\mathbb N$ , and every digit in terms of $r_i\in\mathbb N_0$ and $\min\{a_i\}$ . Then, what is left, is to go over all regular expressions in each of these cases, and then solve just the system of equalities $A_i=A_{d-i+1}$ now. This will give all $2$ -palindromes. What is left then, is to apply the same process but now only for these $2$ -palindromes, and in base $b-2$ . We will be again solving just a system of equalities $B_i=B_{d-i+1}$ in every case, for every regular expression in that case. But I had trouble going over all regular expressions and of keeping track of $o_i,h_i$ that make sense to consider (Not all need to be considered, depending on the sizes and conditions so far on $b,A_i,B_i$ ), and also getting duplicate solutions for $2$ -palindromes in supposedly different regularized expressions. And on top of that, it was running extremely slowly to find the next set of $2$ -palindrome solutions for $d\gt 3$ . So I'm not sure how to implement this process properly, or if it can actually work for a general case of $d$ in current CAS that are avaliable? Generalized system and related problems This system of inequalities and palindromic equalities , is related to the a bit more general similar system - where there can be more $A_i,B_i$ expressions instead of exactly $d$ such expressions. The general problem The generalized inequalities also allows $A_i,B_i$ for $i\le 0$ , where then they are just given as: $$
A_i=o_{i} - o_{i-1} (b-1) \\
B_i=h_{i} - h_{i-1} (b-2)
$$ And if $i_A$ is the smallest such $i$ for which $A_i$ is not zero, and if $i_B$ is the smallest such $i$ for which $B_i$ is not zero, then the system we are solving changes to: $$
A_{i_A}=A_d,A_{i_A+1}=A_{d-1},\dots \le b-1,A_{i_A}\ne 0 \\
B_{i_B}=B_d,A_{i_B+1}=B_{d-1},\dots \le b-2,B_{i_B}\ne 0 \\
$$ Such that the equalities stay palindromic. And now these along with given $a_i=a_{d-i+1}$ , actually represent equations for digits of a number $n\in\mathbb N$ in number bases $b,b-1,b-2$ , which are required to be palindromic in all of those three number  bases, which is the context this system was found in. Find all numbers palindromic in three consecutive number bases? That have $d$ digits in number base $b$ . In the general problem , number of digits does not need to be equal in all number bases as implied by $i_A,i_B$ - just in the base $b$ , where $b-1,b-2$ could have more digits. If $i_A,i_B=1$ , that is, the problem-system in this post is given, then number of digits, is required to be equal in all bases $b,b-1,b-2$ and is exactly $d$ . Related problems Even thought related problems imply the generalized system , all infinite families of solutions that are known so far, are given by the problem-system, $i_A=i_B=1$ . Also note that in the related problems (of mine), it is considered $b,b+1,b+2$ instead of $b,b-1,b-2$ , and it is talked in context of palindromes themselves, as those posts predate this system and the $b,b-1,b-2$ approach. - Which is equivalent to $b,b+1,b+2$ in terms of solutions, but easier to work with in the terms of the problem-system. The related problems and motivation: The motivation behind searching for these so called $3$ -palindromes, is to answer the question, whether there exists a $4$ -palindrome ? The solutions from $(2),(3^*)$ were already mentioned in a question that is asking about $3$ -palindromes in that context, without setting up a system. Note that as those questions predate this system and the ability to solve for any fixed $b$ using it in Mathematica - I used to have to run an optimized brute force search in c++ instead, which was exponentially slower and was impossible to be used on bases like $10^9$ which now take similar time as bases $10^2$ . - Now the computations are still exponentially related to $d$ , but near constant time related to $b$ , where they used to be exponentially related to both in a brute force search. Motivation Similar systems could be set up for problems that depend on digits of numbers in number bases - or for diophantine equations that can be related to such problems.","['number-theory', 'diophantine-equations', 'palindrome', 'computer-algebra-systems', 'inequality']"

3305797,Showing that the conformal Laplacian is a conformally covariant operator,"Consider a Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\geq3$ . Consider the conformal Laplacian \begin{equation*}

P_{\tilde{g}}&=e^{-(\frac{n}{2}+1)f}P_g \,e^{(\frac{n}{2}-1)f}\\
&= e^{-(\frac{n}{2}+1)f}\Delta_g \,e^{(\frac{n}{2}-1)f}+\frac{n-2}{4(n-1)}R_g\,e^{-2f} \tag{1}

\Delta_{\tilde{g}}=e^{-2f}\Delta_g-(n-2)e^{-2f}g^{ij}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}.
\end{equation*} For the scalar curvature, one can make the substitution $e^{2f}=\varphi^{4/(n-2)}$ (where $\varphi$ is positive) to get \begin{equation*}
R_{\tilde{g}}=\varphi^{-(n+2)/(n-2)}\bigg(4\frac{n-1}{n-2}\Delta_g \varphi + R_g\varphi\bigg)

For example $f_1(x)$ would be the solution to $f_1(x)=x$ . $f_2(x)$ would be the solution to $f_2(f_2(x)) = x$ . For $f_1(x)$ , the only solution is $f_1(x)=x$ .

3305950,"How to describe explicitly the equivalence relation generated by $R=\{(f(x),x):x\in X\}$?","Context: This is part of Exercise 5.2.22(a) . The problem is to describe explicitly the equivalence relation $\sim$ generated by $R=\{(f(x),x):x\in X\}$ as well as the quotient map, where $f:X\to X$ is a function of sets. I suppose I should use the explicit description of the equivalence relation generated by a set from here . If we write $x\to x'$ for $(x,x')\in R$ , then the description says that $\sim$ is equal to the  set $\tilde{R}$ of pairs $(x,x')$ such that either $x=x'$ or there exist $x_0=x,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1},x_n=x'\in X$ with either $x_{k-1}\to x_k$ or $x_{k-1}\gets x_k$ , for $k=1,2,\dots,n$ (with $n\ge1$ ).

Then, by the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem, it holds that there exists a subsequence $\{ (u_{k}(\cdot,t) , \phi_{j} ) \}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ which converges uniformly to some function on $[0,T]$ . We also have the following inequality on $u_{m}$ : $||u_{m}(t)||^2 + \int^{t}_{0} ||\nabla u_{m}(\tau)||^2 \text{d}\tau \leq M_{T}$ , for all $0 \leq t < T$ , where $M_{T}$ is a constant independent of $m, t$ . Problem In the paper I am reading, it is stated that from these two facts, we can use ""the usual diagonal argument"" to show that: There exists a subsequence $\{u_{k}\}$ such that $u_{k}(t)$ converges to some $u(t)$ uniformly on $[0,T]$ , in the weak topology of $L^{2}_{\sigma}(\Omega)$ . I understand, and have been able to confirm my self, that the sequence $\{ (u_{k}(\cdot,t) , \phi_{j} ) \}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ does converge uniformly to a function on $[0,T]$ , but how do I show from this that the functions $u_{k}$ converge weakly in $L^{2}_{\sigma}$ ? Is it possible to show that there exists some $u \in L^{2}_{\sigma}$ such that $\{ (u_{k}(\cdot,t) , \phi_{j} ) \}_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \rightarrow \{ (u(\cdot,t) , \phi_{j} ) \}$ , for all $\phi_{j}$ ? If we could show this, then we definitely have weak convergence of $u_{k}$ . Attempted Answer Due to the definition of $\{\phi_{j}\}_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ , we can show that $\{ (u_{m}(\cdot,t) , f ) \}_{m \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges uniformly with respect to $t \in [0,T]$ to some function in $L^{2}$ , for arbitrary $f \in L^{2}(\Omega)$ . We claim that this limit is of the following form: $\{ (u_{m}(\cdot,t) , f ) \}_{m \in \mathbb{N}} \rightarrow \{ (u(\cdot,t) , f ) \}$ for some $u \in L^{2}_{\sigma}$ . In which case, it is clear that $u_{m}$ converges to this $u$ weakly in $L^{2}_{\sigma}(\Omega)$ . We consider $u_{m}(\cdot, t)$ as a function $(u_{m}(\cdot, t), \cdot)$ in the dual space $(L^{2})^{\ast}$ . Since $\{ (u_{m}(\cdot,t) , f ) \}_{m \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges uniformly with respect to $t \in [0,T]$ , for all $f \in L^{2}(\Omega)$ , we conclude that $(u_{m}(\cdot, t), f)$ converges pointwise with respect to $f$ to some function $u_{t}(f)$ . Is it possible from this to conclude that the function $u_{t}(f)$ is in fact in $(L^{2})^{\ast}$ ???","['weak-convergence', 'real-analysis', 'functions', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

After that i tried using $\delta = 1$ : $\iff |x-1| \lt 1 \implies |3x^2-3| \lt \varepsilon$ $|x-1| \lt 1 \iff  -1 \lt x-1 \lt 1 \iff 1 \lt x+1 \lt 3$ $\implies -3 \lt x+1 \lt 3 \iff |x+1| \lt 3$ With $|x-1| \lt 1$ and $|x+1| \lt 3 \iff 3|x+1| \lt 9: $ $3 |x-1||x+1| \lt \varepsilon \implies 9 |x-1| \lt \varepsilon \iff |x-1| \lt \frac{\varepsilon}{9}$ . So $\delta = \frac{\varepsilon}{9}$ should satisfy, but i used the fact that $\delta = 1.$ How can i proceed here?.

Let $X$ a set, $\mathcal{C}\subseteq 2^X$ an elementary family such that $\emptyset\in\mathcal{C}$ and $\nu$ a measure on $\mathcal{C}$ . Then exists a unique measure $\mu$ on the minimal algebra $\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$ such that $\mu_{|\mathcal{C}}=\nu.$ Proof. Denote with $\mathcal{U}_0(\mathcal{C})$ the family of the finite disjoint unions of $\mathcal{C}$ elements. I've already proved that $$\mathcal{U}_0(\mathcal{C})=\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C}).$$ Hence for each $E\in\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$ exists $E_1,\dots, E_n\in\mathcal{C}$ disjoint such that $E=\cup_{k=1}^n E_k.$ We define an application $\mu\colon\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})\to\overline{\mathbb{R}}_+$ in the following way $$\mu(E):=\sum_{k=1}^n\nu(E_k)\quad\text{for each}\quad E\in\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C}).\tag1$$ Obviously $\mu_{|\mathcal{C}}=\nu.$ First step. Definition $(1)$ is well placed. The proof is clear. Second step. $\big[$$\mu$ is a measure on $\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$$\big]$ . Let $\{F_l\}\subseteq\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$ a sequence of disjoint subsets such that $F:=\bigcup_{l=1}^{\infty} F_l\in\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C}).$ We must prove that $$\mu(F)=\sum_{l=1}^{\infty} \mu(F_l).\tag2$$ Since $F\in\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$ , exists $B_1,\dots, B_m\in\mathcal{C}$ disjoint such that $F=\sum_{k=1}^{m} B_k.$ Therefore, $$B_k=B_k\cap F=\bigcup_{l=1}^\infty (B_k\cap F_l),\quad k=1,\dots, m.$$ Similarly, for each $F_l\in\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$ exists a disjoint finite family $\{E_{jl}\}\subseteq \mathcal{C}\quad(j=1,\dots, n_l)$ such that $F_l=\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_l} E_{jl},\;l\in\mathbb{N}.$ Then $$B_k=\bigcup_{l=1}^{\infty} (B_k\cap F_l)=\bigcup_{l=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_l}(B_k\cap E_{jl}).$$ Moreover, $$F_l=F\cap F_l=\bigcup_{k=1}^m\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_l} (B_k\cap E_{jl}),$$ hence $$\mu(F_l)=\sum_{k=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^{n_l}\nu(B_k\cap E_{jl}),$$ for $(1).$ Now, $$\nu(B_k)=\nu\bigg(\bigcup_{l=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_l}(B_k\cap E_{jl})\bigg)\color{RED}{=} \sum_{l=1}^{\infty}\sum_{j=1}^{n_l}\nu(B_k\cap E_{jl})$$ Question Is the equality in red true? I know that $B_k\in\mathcal{C}$ and $\nu$ is a measure on it, therefore $\nu$ is $\sigma$ - additive but I'm used to having only one union in the argument of $\nu$ , in this case how does it work? How I feel about it I think that equality is correct, because fix $l=1, l=2$ and consider $A_{n_1}:=\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_1} (B_k\cap E_{j1})$ and $A_{n_2}:=\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_2} (B_k\cap E_{j2})$ , we must prove that $A_{n_1}\cap A_{n_2}=\emptyset$ . We know that $\{E_{j1}\}_{j=1}^{n_1}$ is disjoint and that $F_1=\cup_{j=1}^{n_1} E_{j1}$ , moreover $\{E_{j2}\}_{j=1}^{n_2}$ is disjoint and that $F_2=\cup_{j=1}^{n_2} E_{j2}$ . Therefore, since $F_1\cap F_2=\emptyset$ , we have that $$\bigg[\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_1} (B_k\cap E_{j1})\bigg]\cap\bigg[ \bigcup_{j=1}^{n_2} (B_k\cap E_{j2})\bigg]=\emptyset,$$ hence $$\nu\bigg(\bigcup_{l=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_l}(B_k\cap E_{jl})\bigg)=\sum_{l=1}^{\infty}\nu\bigg(\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_l} (B_k\cap E_{jl})\bigg).$$ At this point we can use the finite additivity of $\nu$ , since the sequence $\{E_{jl}\}_{j=1}^{n_l}$ for each fixed $l\in\mathbb{N}$ is disjoint. Thus obtaining the thesis. It's correct? Thanks!","['measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"

What if $\frac{\partial y_{1}(\vec{x})}{\partial{y_3}(\vec{x})} \ne 0$ ? If the trick doesn't always work, what is the general method to do this? Update: add an example Example ( Unit simplex transform or Stick breaking transform ) Let $\vec{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_{K})$ be a point on the probability simplex: $0 \le x_{n} \le 1$ $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... x_{K} = 1$ The transformation $\vec{z} = (z_{1}, \ldots, z_{K-1}) = f^{-1}(\vec{x})$ maps from the probability simplex to a hypercube: $z_{l} = \log(x_{l}) - \log(x_{l+1} + ... + x_{K})$ For ease of derivation, I define the following: Let ${b_{l} = [1 + \exp(z_{l})]^{-1}}$ Let $c_{l} = 1 - b_{l} = [1 + \exp(-z_{l})]^{-1}$ Then, $$ x_{m} = \begin{cases}
c_{1} & \text{if } m = 1 \\
\prod_{l=1}^{K-1} b_{l} & \text{if } m = K \\
c_{m} \prod_{l=1}^{m-1} b_{l} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$ For $K = 3$ , $$ J = \left[ \begin{matrix} 
a_{11} & a_{12} & 0  \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & 0  \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & 1  \\
\end{matrix} \right]$$ where $a_{ij} = \frac{\partial x_{i}}{\partial z_j}$ Since $a_{12} = 0$ , $ \det(J) = a_{11}a_{22}$ For higher K, only the diagonal terms contribute to the determinant. $-\log[\det(J)] = \sum_{l=1}^{K-1} (K-l)\log[b_{l}] + \log[c_{l}]$ By testing over many randomly selected values, I verify that the above expression is equivalent to the expression in section ""Absolute Jacobian Determinant of the Unit-Simplex Inverse Transform"" in Stan , which mentioned the Jacobian is triangular.

Prove that the Fourier series of $f$ converges to $f(x)$ , by completing the following outline: It is enough to consider the case $x=0$ , $f(0)=0$ . The difference between the partial sums $s_n(f;0)$ and the integrals $$\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(t)\frac{\sin nt}{t}\:dt$$ tends to $0$ as $n\to\infty$ . The function $f(t)/t$ is in $L^1(T)$ . Apply the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma. More careful reasoning shows that the convergence is actually uniform on $T$ . I already know how to prove the result as in Lipschitz Continuity and Hölder Continuity helps Fourier series to converge . However, I don't understand Rudin's outline. When he says that it is enough to consider the case $x=0$ , $f(0)=0$ , is it simply because it changes almost nothing to the proof? Since we can prove that $s_n(f;0)$ tends to $0$ by proving that $f(t)\cot(t/2)$ is in $L^1$ , it seems to me that Rudin's outline is only better if it is easier to prove that $f(t)/t\in L^1$ and that the difference between $s_n(f;0)$ and the integrals tends to $0$ . But I don't see any easy way to do the latter. Why is the convergence uniform and why does it matter?

3306712,Variational inference: Does the natural gradient follow geodesics locally?,"Amari's natural gradient descent is a well-known optimisation algorithm from information geometry that is well-suited for finding optima of functionals on statistical manifolds. It consists of preconditioning the gradient descent update rule with the inverse of the Fisher information metric tensor. The objective function I am concerned with is the variational free-energy, or evidence lower bound, in the context of approximate Bayesian inference (i.e. variational Bayes). The metric on the statistical manifold is the Fisher information metric.  Also, the particular problem I am working on is categorical inference -- the statistical manifold is the standard simplex and the information length is proportional to the Euclidean metric after a suitable change of coordinates (diffeomorphism onto a quadrant of sphere) -- this might be a special case where my question holds true, but I would also like to know the answer in general. My intuition for the natural gradient is that it follows (locally) the direction of greatest change of the objective function in information space -- just like normal gradient descent follows the direction of greatest change in Euclidean space. This leads me to ask whether, at the limit where the step-size tends to zero, natural gradient descent follows geodesics locally on the manifold, according to the Fisher information metric. If this is the case, could you explain how? If not, could you explain why not to help me improve my understanding?","['statistical-inference', 'calculus-of-variations', 'numerical-optimization', 'information-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

I found this integral representation of S: $$S=2\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x}{1-x^2}\left(\frac{\pi^2}{2}-2\arcsin^2(x)\right)dx$$ Sketch of a proof: Recall the integral representation of the harmonic numbers: $H_n=\displaystyle\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1-x^n}{1-x}dx$ By plugging it into the definition of S and interchanging the order of summation between $\displaystyle\sum$ and $\displaystyle\int$ (justified by the uniform convergence of the function series $\displaystyle\sum\left(x\to\frac{4^n}{n^2{2n\choose n}}\frac{1-x^n}{1-x}\right)$ , because $\forall x\in[0,1],\frac{1-x^n}{1-x}<n$ ), we get: $$S=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{1-x}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{4^n(1-x^n)}{n^2{2n\choose n}}dx$$ $$=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{1-x}\left(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{4^n}{n^2{2n\choose n}}-\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(4x)^n}{n^2{2n\choose n}}\right)dx$$ $$=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{1-x}\left(\frac{\pi^2}{2}-\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(4x)^n}{n^2{2n\choose n}}\right)dx$$ Using the result $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{4^n}{n^2{2n\choose n}}=\frac{\pi^2}{2}$ . At that point, we will rely on the taylor series expansion of $\arcsin^2$ : $$\arcsin^2(x)=\frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{4^n}{n^2{2n\choose n}}x^{2n}, |x|<1$$ Out of which we get $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(4x)^n}{n^2{2n\choose n}}=2\arcsin^2\left(\sqrt{x}\right)$ So, $$S=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{1-x}\left(\frac{\pi^2}{2}-2\arcsin^2\left(\sqrt{x}\right)\right)dx$$ Which, through the substitution $u=\sqrt{x}$ , gives the integral representation above.

So I rewrote that equation like this: $$H=\sec \frac{2\pi}{7}+\sec \frac{2\times 2\pi}{7}+\sec \frac{3\times 2\pi}{7}$$ One method which I tried was to transform the multiples of each angle into their equivalents as a single one as shown below: $$\cos^{2}\omega=\frac{1+\cos 2\omega}{2}$$ $$\cos 2\omega= 2 \cos^{2}\omega - 1$$ $$\cos^{3}\omega=\frac{1}{4}\left(3cos\omega+\cos 3\omega \right)$$ $$\cos 3\omega = 4 \cos^{3}\omega - 3 cos\omega$$ Therefore by plugin these expressions into the above equation would become into (provided that secant function is expressed in terms of secant): $$H=\frac{1}{\cos \frac{2\pi}{7}}+\frac{1}{2\cos^{2}\frac{2\pi}{7}-1}+\frac{1}{4\cos^{3}\frac{2\pi}{7}-3\cos\omega}$$ But from here on it looks convoluted or too algebraic to continue.

First example, if I choose $\sqrt{\,}$ to denote the branch defined on $(-\pi,\pi)$ : $a = e^{\frac{2}{5}\pi i}$ and $b = e^{\frac{2}{3}\pi i}$ I get that $a\sqrt{b} \ne \sqrt{a^2b}$ , because: $$a\sqrt{b} = e^{\frac{2}{5}\pi i} \cdot e^{\frac{1}{3}\pi i} = e^{\frac{11}{15}\pi i}$$ $$\sqrt{a^2b} = \sqrt{e^{\frac{4}{5}\pi i}\cdot e^{\frac{2}{3}\pi i}} = \sqrt{e^{\frac{22}{15}\pi i}} = \sqrt{e^{\frac{-8}{15}\pi i}} = e^{\frac{-4}{15}\pi i}$$ notice the step in the end of the last line where I need to fix the exponent by subtracting $2\pi$ so that the exponent will be between $-\pi$ and $\pi$ . If I didn't ""fix"" it, I would've got the result I wanted. Well this obviously didn't work. so my question is what failed and for which branches the common rules for powers work like for real-valued roots and powers? Second example, which is related but a bit more complicated: Calculate: $$ \int_{|z|=5} \frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+11}} dz$$ where $\sqrt{\,}$ denotes the branch for which $\sqrt{36}=-6$ . Firstly, it is not obvious to me if $\sqrt{z^2+11}$ is even meromorphic, because $z^2+11$ has roots in the interior of the contour, so why is this integral defined correctly? Secondly, the solution I saw was as follows: $$ \int_{|z|=5} \frac{1}{\sqrt{z^2+11}} dz \overset{w=\frac{1}{z}}{=} \int_{|w|=\frac{1}{5}} \frac{1}{w^2\sqrt{\frac{1}{w^2}+11}} dw = \int_{|w|=\frac{1}{5}} \frac{1}{-w\sqrt{1+11w^2}} dw $$ Now I'm supposed to understand that $\sqrt{1+11w^2}$ is analytic in the interior of the contour, which is reasonable because $w$ is close to $0$ , so $1+11w^2$ is close to 1 and we can remove a ray from the origin. Is this the right explanation? After agreeing with the last claim, the integrand only has a simple pole at 0 and from the residue theorem the answer will be: $$ 2\pi i \cdot Res_0\left(\frac{1}{-w\sqrt{1+11w^2}}\right) = 2\pi i \cdot\frac{1}{-\sqrt{1+11\cdot0}} = 2\pi i \frac{1}{-\sqrt{1}} = 2\pi i$$ Another question about this example arises from the first example. why is it correct to move the $w$ inside the root like so (and multiplying by $-1$ ) and is it correct that if $\sqrt{a^2}=-a$ for a single real $a>0$ , then the same rule applies to all complex numbers? I'm missing a lot of formality in this subject and I'd like to understand the reasoning behind those certain steps and also how in general I could understand those definition or maybe translate them to a problem with branches of log, which I'm more comfortable with (although not so much).","['complex-analysis', 'contour-integration', 'branch-cuts']"

3306917,How many essentially different Drive Ya Nuts Puzzles exist?,"In the Drive Ya Nuts puzzle, we are given $7$ hexagonal nuts, whose edges have been numbered from $1$ to $6$ .  Each nut uses all $6$ numbers.  The aim of the puzzle is to place all the nuts in a hexagonal grid, so that touch sides are numbered the same.  In the marketed puzzle, there is a unique solution, provided that solutions arising from rotations of the entires grid are regarded as identical.  (This is easy to confirm.  There are only $7$ ways to place the nuts in the grid, and since rotations don't matter, we can assume the central hexagon has the $1$ on the north.  There is then only one possible orientation for each of the outer hexagons, and we just have to check if they lead to a solution.) I wonder how many possible puzzles of this type have the attractive property of having a unique solution.  That is, how many sets  of $7$ different numbered hexagons  give a puzzle with a unique solution?  We can represent a hexagon by listing it numbers in clockwise order.  Since rotating a nut gives the same nut, we always start with the $1$ .  Also, since permuting all the labels does not essentially change the puzzle, we may assume that $123456$ , which I will call the ""unit"", for want of a better term, is always one of the nuts. I'm confident that I can find all such essentially different sets.  We may assume that the central hexagon is the unit, oriented with $1$ on top.  Now if we look at the $6$ edges radiating out from vertices of the unit, each is constrained to have one of $4$ possible labels, or we would have a hexagon with two sides labeled the same. For the same reason, no two consecutive ""spokes"" can have the same label.  Brute force calculation shows there are $1144$ possible labelings.  Once we have such a labeling, each of the outer hexagons has $3$ unlabeled sides, which may be labeled in $3!$ ways, so we have $$1144\cdot6^6=53,373,464$$ positions with at least one solution.  Many of these will be relabelings of other such positions, so by generating the positions, keeping track of the ones seen, and rejecting isomorphs, I think testing them all will be quite feasible.  (Obviously, I will use backtrack rather than generating all $5040$ positions.) My problem is relating this answer to the number of possible puzzles.  The possible number of nuts is $5!$ =120, so the possible number of nut sets is $${119\choose6}=3,470,108,187$$ However, this ignores the, fact that some of these are just relabelings of others.  We are only interested in permutations of the numbers that result in a set containing the unit.  If we pick any of the nuts, we can replace any of its labels by $1$ , the next label in clockwise order by $2$ , and so on.  This gives $42$ possible permutations for a given nut set. My problem is figuring out what nut sets are invariant under which permutations.  By what has gone before, the only permutations that might leave a nut set invariant are $6$ -cycles or $5$ -cycles.  My instinct is that no $5$ -cycle will work, but I don't know how to prove it.  Part of what confuses me is that we have to take account of the canonical forms.  Let us apply the permutation $$\sigma={1\,2\,3\,4\,5\,6\choose2\,3\,4\,5\,6\,1}$$ to the hexagon $\tau=132465$ .  We get successively $$\begin{align}\tau&=132465\\
\sigma\tau&=243516\\
\sigma^2\tau&=354321\\
\sigma^3\tau&=465132
\end{align}$$ Notice that $\sigma^3\tau$ is just a rotation of $\tau$ , so $\sigma^3\tau=\tau.$ I've thought of Polya's theory of counting, of course, but I can't see how to apply it.  I feel that there is probably a simple way of attacking this problem, but I just don't see it.  Alternatively, am I making things difficult by requiring that the unit be part of the set?  Would it somehow be easier to remove this requirement? I can of course, compute the orbits of all $5$ - and $6$ -cycles Any direction or assistance will be appreciated. EDIT I can prove that no $5$ -cycle leaves any nut set invariant. The length of an orbit must divide the order of a cycle, so that the orbits of a $5$ -cycle $\sigma$ have length $1$ or $5$ .  If an orbit has length $1$ , say $\tau=\sigma\tau$ then $\sigma$ rotates $\tau$ , but this is impossible, since $\sigma$ leaves an element fixed.  It is impossible to account for all $7$ elements of the nut set using only orbits of length $5$ .","['polya-counting-theory', 'combinatorics']"
3306935,Countable order-dense subset in a linear order,"I ended up posting an answer to my own question, and I believe I knew this answer before I posted this question, but forgot about it.  At any rate, here it is for the record. My question is inspired by the following one by @lu_sin. Is there a countable order-dense family of open subsets of $(0,1)$? While I answered the above question (and my answer was accepted), the question remains open under a slightly different definition of order-dense, as indicated in the comments over there. While trying to answer the modified version of the question (which I believe ought to have something to do with $(0,1)$ being hereditarily Lindelöf and hereditarily separable), I came up with the following question. Let $(X,<)$ be a linear (same as total) order. Assume that: $(*)\ \ \ $ $X$ has no uncountable well-ordered subset (under the order induced by $<$ ), and no uncountable reverse well-ordered subset. Call a set $D\subseteq X$ order-dense in $X$ if whenever $\{x,y\}\subseteq X$ with $x<y$ then there is $z\in D$ such that $x\le z\le y$ . (Note that under this definition the integers are order-dense in themselves, which would not be the case if we required that $x<z<y$ . In that other question I find the version with $\le$ more difficult to answer, which is the reason I use $\le$ here.) Question . Assuming condition $(*)$ as above, is there a countable set $C$ which is order-dense in $X$ ? I could answer it under a certain ""local"" assumption, as explained below (but I think this assumption makes the answer rather easy, and I do not know the answer in general). 
(On third reading I realized that I have a gap in the construction below, but I will leave  it as is for now, perhaps it illustrates some of the ideas I was thinking about.) Call an $x\in X$ $r$ -good (for right-good) if either (a) $x=\max X$ (if it exists), or (b) there is $x^+>x$ and a countable set $D=D(x,x^+)$ that is order-dense in $[x,x^+]$ . Analogously, call an $x\in X$ $l$ -good if either (a) $x=\min X$ (if it exists), or (b) there is $x^-<x$ and a countable set $D=D(x^-,x)$ that is order-dense in $[x^-,x]$ . If each $x$ in $X$ is good (i.e. both $r$ -good and $l$ -good) then the answer to the above question is yes. 
Indeed starting with any $x_0\in X$ we could get an increasing countable transfinite sequence $S=\{x_\alpha:\alpha<\gamma\}$ for some $0<\gamma<\omega_1$ such that $\sup S=\sup X$ , and for each $\alpha$ there is a countable $D_\alpha$ order-dense in $[x_\alpha,x_{\alpha+1}]$ (except only if $x_\alpha=\max X$ ). Similarly, there 
is a decreasing countable transfinite sequence $T=\{y_\alpha:\alpha<\delta\}$ for some $0<\delta<\omega_1$ such that $\inf T=\inf X$ , $y_0=x_0$ , and for each $\alpha<\delta$ there is a countable $C_\alpha$ order-dense in $[y_{\alpha+1},y_\alpha]$ (unless $y_\alpha=\min X$ ). Then we could let $C$ to be the union of all $D_\alpha,\alpha<\gamma$ , and 
all $C_\alpha,\alpha<\delta$ (also throw in $S$ and $T$ and the endpoints of $X$ , if any). 
There is a gap in the above argument, I was implicitly assuming that if $\alpha>0$ is limit then $x_\alpha=\sup_{\beta<\alpha}x_\beta$ (and similarly $y_\alpha=\inf_{\beta<\alpha}y_\beta$ .) If $\alpha>0$ is limit and $\sup_{\beta<\alpha}x_\beta$ is a gap of $X$ (i.e. $\sup_{\beta<\alpha}x_\beta$ does not exist in $X$ because $X$ is not complete) then I do not know how I want to define $x_\alpha$ . The answer is likely to be known, I would be grateful for a reference too. Extra comments on condition $(*)$ . 
For the record, condition $(*)$ was first stated as follows. 
For every $Y\subseteq X$ there is a countable (finite allowed) $Z\subseteq Y$ such that $\sup Y=\sup Z$ and there is a countable $W\subseteq Y$ such that $\inf Y=\inf W$ . (Note that we may replace $Z$ with $Z\cup W$ and require, equivalently, that for every $Y\subseteq X$ there is a countable $Z\subseteq Y$ such that $\sup Y=\sup Z$ and $\inf Y=\inf Z$ .) It seems we could drop the requirement that $Z\subseteq Y$ and $W\subseteq Y$ . Just require that for every $Y\subseteq X$ there is a countable (finite allowed) $Z$ such that $\sup Y=\sup Z$ and there is a countable $W$ such that $\inf Y=\inf W$ . Then I edited it as I realized: 
I may have made things more complicated than necessary, will think, perhaps I should have just said that $X$ has no subset that is order-isomorphic to $\omega_1$ , or reverse order-isomorphic to $\omega_1$ . One example of a set that satisfies condition $(*)$ is the open unit interval $(0,1)$ with the usual order $\le$ . Another example (related to the question that was linked): If $X=\mathcal V$ where $\mathcal V$ is a nested collection of open subsets of $(0,1)$ (i.e. a linear order under set-inclusion), then $\mathcal V$ satisfies condition $(*)$ , which could be shown (I believe) using that $(0,1)$ is hereditarily Lindelöf and hereditarily separable. I realize I could have stated my question in yet another different, and apparently more general way (closer to the statement of the linked question). Suppose $P$ is a partial order and $X$ is a subset which is a chain, i.e. a linear order (under the induced order from $P$ ). Call a set $D\subseteq P$ dense in $X$ (where we do not require that $D\subseteq X$ ) if whenever $\{x,y\}\subseteq X$ with $x<y$ then there is $z\in D$ such that $x\le z\le y$ . Question. If $X$ satisfies condition $(*)$ above, is there a countable set $C\subseteq P$ which is order-dense in $X$ (where we do not require that $C\subseteq X$ )?
I tend to believe that the two versions of the question are equivalent, but did not attempt to verify all details. Here is a related example, let $\mathcal V=\{(-x,x):0<x<1\}$ , a nested collection of open sets in $(-1,1)$ . Let $D=\{(-r,r):0<r<1, \ r\in\Bbb Q\}$ , where $\Bbb Q$ denotes the rational numbers. Then $D$ is countable and order-dense in $\mathcal V$ (under either definition). This question is such a mess ... I feel like I have not done my homework, but I will leave it as is for now, perhaps come back to it later.","['ordinals', 'reference-request', 'order-theory', 'general-topology', 'set-theory']"

3306953,Sum of exponential growth and decay,"Suppose we have the equation: $$y(t_i) = C_0 + C_1 e^{-\lambda_1 t_i} + C_2 e^{\lambda_2 t_i}$$ where $C_0$ , $C_1$ , $\lambda_1$ , $C_2$ , and $\lambda_2 \ge 0$ This is equivalent to the summation of an exponential decay curve with that of exponential growth. Thus, one can see that $C_0$ is equivalent to the sum of the asymptotic value for the decay part as $t \rightarrow \infty$ and the asymptotic values for the gowth part as $t \rightarrow -\infty$ $y(0) = C_0 + C_1 + C_2$ If I have a sample of n observations, what are some good starting approximations for the estimates of $C_1$ , $\lambda_1$ , $C_2$ , and $\lambda_2$ which I can then pass into a non-linear optimization algorithm.  I've explored ODE solutions to these types of equations, but cannot find a good ""least squares"" type function of the observed data. I am considering partitioning the observations close to the position of the inflection point in the data, and estimating the $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ from the least squares solution to the log transform of the data points to the left and the right, and then solving for $C_0, C_1,$ and $C_2$ after substituting $\hat{\lambda_1}$ and $\hat{\lambda_2}$ into the above equation. Any alternative solutions would be greatly appreciated. UPDATE: @JJacquelin gave an excellent answer.  I worked out the solution myself to confirm that the equations hold.

The answer is $\frac{9}{10}$ because state 0 is one tenth of the way from $−1$ to $9$ . Unfortunately, I used a different and rather clumsy way to approach this question. My attempt was not successful but I was wondering if there is anyone who can tell me how to go further with it and arrive at the solution. My attempt:
I drew it out like birth and death process with 11 states. With $-1$ and $9$ having the probability of returning to itself as 1 (absorbing state).
Let's $P(X_i)$ be probability to reach $-1$ before reaching $9$ , starting from $i$ .
