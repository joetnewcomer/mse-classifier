84560,a conjecture on norms and convex functions over polytopes,"Suppose one has a convex, bounded polytope P $\subset R^n$ and a strictly convex function $f$ defined everywhere on $R^n$. $f$ has a unique minimum; and suppose this minimum occurs somewhere strictly outside P, at a point x $\in R^n$. Let's define two points on the boundary of P, which are in general distinct. The first point, N, is the projection of x onto P, by which I mean that N is a point on P's boundary which minimizes the distance (in any norm, but say $l_2$) to x. The second point, M, is the point on P's boundary which minimizes the function $f$ when restricted to P. I think that N and M are always on the same facet of P. (By ""on a facet"" I include the (lower dimensional) ""edges"" of the facet.) My question is: is this true in general? Here is an illustration of the following concrete example. Suppose we are in $R^2$, with $f(a,b) = a^2 + 4(b-4)^2$. Suppose that P is given by the four half-planes $a+b \le 7$, $2b-a \le 4$, $a \gt 0$, $b \gt 0$. This looks like: Here's a picture of this situation: The minimum of $f$ occurs at x = (0,4). In this case, we see that N and M are indeed on the same facet of P. Is this relationship true in general?","['geometry', 'normed-spaces', 'polytopes', 'convex-optimization']"

84581,Jar of candies: Minimum subset size to satisfy a condition,"Here is a problem my son was trying to solve: A bowl contains 100 pieces of candy: 48 green, 30 red, 12 yellow and 10 blue. They are all wrapped in a foil, so the color of no candy is visible. How many pieces should be picked at a minimum to ensure 15 candies of the same color are picked? I could intuitively guess, it will take picking all the colors that do not satisfy 15 (12 yellow + 10 blue), and then picking 14 of each possible color (14 green + 14 red) and then one more to ensure 15.

84598,Is there a discrete-time analogue of Doléans-Dade exponential?,"For a continuous martingale $X$, we have the Doléans-Dade exponential :
$$\epsilon(X)_t=\exp\left(X_t-\frac{1}{2}[X]_t\right)$$ What is the ""correct"" analogue, if one exists, for some discrete-time martingale $M$? (Unfortunately in discrete time this is no longer a (local) martingale.) The motivation is as follows. On page 68 of these notes , the author proves the Exponential Martingale Inequality (EMI) (quoted in my words): Let $X$ be a continuous local martingale with $X_0=0$. Then for all
  $x>0$,$u>0$, $$\mathbb{P}\left[\sup_{t\geq 0}~ X_s\geq x, [X]_t\leq u\right]\leq
 \exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{2u}\right)$$ This reminded me of the Azuma-Hoeffding Inequality , which states: Let $M_n$ be a martingale with $M_0=0$ and $|M_i-M_{i-1}|\leq c_i$ for all $i$. Then, for $x>0$
  $$\mathbb{P}\left[\sup_{k\leq n}~M_k\geq x\right]\leq \exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{2\sum_{k=1}^nc_k^2}\right)$$ Well, we have $[M]_n\leq \sum_{k=1}^nc_k^2$, so the former inequality would imply the second if only it were true for discrete-time (discontinuous) martingales (setting $u=\sum_{k=1}^nc_k^2$). To prove EMI, we apply the optional stopping theorem to $\epsilon(\theta X)$ at the time when the $X$ first hits $x$. This gives a set of bounds parameterized by $\theta$ for the probability we want to bound, and optimizing over $\theta$ gives the result (see notes). For an appropriate definition of $\epsilon(M)$, would the same argument would work in discrete time (and give a proof of Azuma-Hoeffding)?

84736,How to do a change of variable in an ODE,"I asked something related to this and this was a secondary question, after some answers. So I prefer to ask this in a new post because this question is extensive. Sorry for ask this simple things. )= If I have an ODE, let's say of second order, and has the form 
$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = f \Big( {\frac{dy}{dx},y,x} \Big),
$$
where clearly $y$ is a function that depends on $x$. There are two important kinds of change of variable. The second complains me, but I put i) also in case someone notes an error. In fact if someone know if this can be writted in a optional hide, but I don't know how to do it. i) If I use some change of the form $s=g(x)$, then I have to compute $\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2}, \frac{dy}{dx}$ with the new variable. I know how to do it.
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{ds}\frac{ds}{dx}.
$$
Then for the second, we have 
$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} 
= \frac{d}{dx} \Big( \frac{dy}{dx} \Big) 
= \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{dy}{ds} \frac{ds}{dx} \right) 
= \frac{ds}{dx} \cdot \frac{d}{dx} \Big( \frac{dy}{ds} \Big) + 
\frac{dy}{ds} \cdot \frac{d}{dx} \Big( \frac{ds}{dx} \Big)
.$$
For the first term we have 
$$
\frac{ds}{dx} \cdot \left( \frac{d}{dx} \Big( \frac{dy}{ds} \Big) \right) 
= \frac{ds}{dx} \cdot \left( \frac{d}{ds} \Big( \frac{dy}{ds} \Big) \cdot \frac{ds}{dx} \right) 
= \frac{d^2 y}{ds^2} \Big( \frac{ds}{dx} \Big)^2 ,
$$
and the second is obviously equal to 
$$
\frac{dy}{ds} \cdot \frac{d^2 s}{dx^2}.
$$
So we have that 
$$
\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} 
= \frac{d^2 y}{ds^2} \Big( \frac{ds}{dx} \Big)^2  
+ \frac{dy}{ds} \cdot \frac{d^2 s}{dx^2}
$$ ii) Here is my problem, a change of variable of the form $s= g(y)$.
Here the technique is different because, in the other I start with $\frac{dy}{dx}$ and changed with the chain rule, but here is different because in a way it clearing in an indirect way. I start differentiating the equality with respect to $x$, I have 
$$
\begin{align*}
s &= g(y) \\ 
\frac{ds}{dx} &= \frac{dg}{dy} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}

84744,Image of closed ball under degenerate integral operator is a closed set,"I will be putting a bounty on this problem as soon as it lets me. For those who want to understand where the problem came from I encourage reading the edits, as I cut out several failed attempts and no longer relevant definitions from the problem statement to avoid clutter. Consider the integral operator $K: C([0,1])\to C([0,1])$ $$Kf(x) = \int_0^1k(x,y)f(y)dy$$ where $k(x,y) = x^2+2xy+y^2$. Show that the image $I:=K(\overline{B}(0,1))$ of the closed unit ball in $C([0,1])$ using the supremum (maximum) norm $\left\Vert \cdot \right\Vert_\infty$ is closed. Any of the following will be rewarded the bounty: Proof that $I$ is sequentially closed by showing if $Kf_n(x) \to F(x) \in C([0,1])$ then there is a formula for $f \in C([0,1])$ with $\left\Vert f \right\Vert_\infty\leq1$ such that $Kf(x) = F(x)$. Proof that $I$ is sequentially closed by showing if $Kf_n(x) \to F(x) \in C([0,1])$ then there there exists $f\in C([0,1])$ with $\left\Vert f \right\Vert_\infty\leq1$ such that $Kf(x) = F(x)$, i.e. a nonconstructive proof (perhaps one could apply the Baire Category Theorem?). Proof that $I$ is closed by showing that $C([0,1])\setminus I$ is open. Proof that $I$ is compact. Proof that $I$ is sequentially compact. Proof that $I$ is closed by some more clever method I haven't thought of. Things I have proven which may or may not be useful to help you help me solve this: $C([0,1])$ with the maximum norm is a Banach space. If $f\in C([0,1])$ then $Kf \in C([0,1])$. If $Kf_n(x) \to F(x) \in C([0,1])$ then the convergence is uniform. If $Kf_n(x) \to F(x) \in C([0,1])$ this does not necessarily imply $f_n$ has a convergent subsequence (counterexample $f_ n(x)=\sin(nx)$). $K(\overline{B}(0,1))$ is bounded by $\overline{B}(0,7/3)$, hence $K$ is a continuous linear operator. If $Kf_n(x) \to F(x) \in C([0,1])$ then $F(x) = a+bx+cx^2$ for some $a\in[-1/3,1/3],b\in[-1,1],c\in[-1,1]$. If $Kf_n(x) \to F(x)=a+bx+cx^2$ then there is a function $f\in C([0,1])$ such that $Kf(x) = F(x)$, but it does not necessarily satisfy $\left\Vert f \right\Vert_\infty \leq 1$. The function is given by $$f(x)=(30a -18b+9c)+(-180a+96b-36c)x+(180a-90b+30c)x^2$$ and an example of when it fails then norm condition is if $$f_n(x)=e^{-x^{5+1/n}}.$$ Thank you all for the help.

84779,Fractal behavior along the boundary of convergence?,"The complex power series $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n^2}}{n^2}$$ has radius $1$ (Ratio Test) and is absolutely convergent along $|z|=1$.  Recalling something that my calculus professor (Ray Mayer, emeritus of Reed College) showed me 15 years ago, I started looking at a ""graph"" of this function. More precisely, here are plots of the images of $z$ with constant magnitude under this power series. (The mapped curves are the images of $|z|=1$, $|z|=0.9$, and $|z|=0.8$.  At the far right you can see $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac1{n^2}=\frac{\pi^2}{6}$.) So... what the heck is going on with the fractal behavior of the image of the boundary?  Is there any understanding of this kind of behavior from power series?  For instance, rotating $z$ by some angles might leave you with roughly the original series after a bit of rotation, scaling and translation.  But I haven't been able to see how that would all come together. I have a hunch that the ""berries"" along the inside of the leaf happen around values of $z$ with interesting arguments, but I haven't sat down to map out what those arguments might be. EDIT: Indeed, the ""leaftips"" and ""berries"" seem to happen at regular $z$ values.  Starting at the largest leaftip in quadrant I and moving clockwise, the leaftips are the images of $\exp\left(\frac{\pi}{2}i\right), \exp\left(\frac{\pi}{4}i\right), \exp\left(\frac{\pi}{6}i\right)$,... Similarly, starting from the largest berry and moving clockwise the ""seeds"" of the berries are the images of $\exp\left(\frac{\pi}{3}i\right), \exp\left(\frac{\pi}{5}i\right), \exp\left(\frac{\pi}{7}i\right)$,... It appears that the ""arc"" from the large berry in quadrant IV to the large berry in quadrant I is parametrized by $\exp(it)$ with $t\in\left(-\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{\pi}{3}\right)$.  Further, that the large leaf in quadrant I that crosses into quadrant II is parametrized by $t\in\left(\frac{3\pi}{7},\frac{3\pi}{5}\right)$.

84870,How to show that a set of discontinuous points of an increasing function is at most countable,"I would like to prove the following: Let $g$ be a monotone increasing function on $[0,1]$.

Let $A$ be the set of points where $g$ is not continuous. Then for any $x\in A$, there is a rational, say, $f(x)$ such that $g(x^-)\lt f(x)\lt g(x^+)$. For $x_1\lt x_2$, we have that $g(x_1^+)\leq g(x_2^-)$. Thus $f(x_1)\neq f(x_2)$ if $x_1\neq x_2$. This shows an injection between $A$ and a subset of the rationals.

84994,Nets - preoredered sets or posets?,"Question: Usually net is defined as a function from a directed
preordered set to a topological space. What would we lose or gain
if we worked with partially ordered directed sets only? Background and motivation For me, one of the most important property of nets in
topological spaces is the following: Let $X$ be a topological space, $x\in X$ and $A\subseteq x$ .
Then $x\in\overline A$ if and only if there exists a net $(x_d)_{d\in D}$ such that $x_d$ converges to $x$ and $x_d\in A$ for each $d\in D$ . The above property means that topology of $X$ is uniquely
determined by convergence of nets. The above property would be true also if we worked only with nets
on directed posets. Indeed, let $x\in\overline A$ . Let $\mathcal N_x$ be the set of all open
neighborhoods of $x$ . Then $D=(\mathcal N_x,\supseteq)$ is a
poset, which is directed. For any $U$ choose one element $x_U\in
A\cap U$ . Then the net $(x_U)_{U\in\mathcal N_x}$ converges to $x$ . So, if I did not make a mistake in this proof, the above property
is true also if we work only with nets on posets. In some constructions it is useful that we are allowed to work with nets on preordered sets. One of them is constructing a net corresponding to a given filter $\mathcal F$ such that this net converges to $x$ if and only if the filter $\mathcal F$ does. Here the net on the set $\{(A,a); a\in A\in \mathcal F\}$ preordered by $$(A,a)\le (B,b) \Leftrightarrow A\supseteq B$$ is used, and this is indeed a preordered set, not a partially ordered set. See the part on correspondence of nets and filters in P. L. Clark's notes on convergence for more details and other related constructions. In fact, P. L. Clark writes here that this ""justifies our willingness to entertain directed quasi-ordered sets"". (This answers to some extent my question. But I guess that the authors working with posets also have some reasons to do so.) Another possible viewpoint: For any class $\mathcal C$ of directed sets we can define the
class of topological spaces defined by the property: $V$ is closed in $X$ if and only if $V$ is closed w.r.t. limits
of nets on directed set from $\mathcal C$ . If $\mathcal C$ = all directed sets, then we get all topological spaces. If $\mathcal C=\{\mathbb N\}$ , then we get sequential spaces If $\mathcal C=$ well-ordered sets or $\mathcal C=$ linearly ordered sets, then we get pseudoradial spaces So in this context we can view this question as the question what we get if $\mathcal C$ =directed posets (which seems quite natural, after seeing that several classes of spaces arise in this way). Going through literature and also quick google searches bellow shows that quite a few authors use posets and not preordered sets. topology net preordered topology net preorder topology net poset topology net ""partially ordered"" I could mention a few books which use posets: Munkres: Topology, Supplementary Exercises after Chapter 3, p. 187 in 2nd edition.

(iii) $f'(x)$ exists almost everywhere on $[0,1]$ and $f(x)=\int_0^x f'(t)\,\mathrm{d}t$, provided that $f(0)=0$. Attempt: (i) Let $\varepsilon \gt 0$. Choose $\delta=\varepsilon /M$. Then for any collection $\{[x_i,y_i]\}$ of non-overlapping intervals with total length $\sum |x_i-y_i|\lt \delta$, we have $$\sum|f(x_i)-f(y_i)|\lt M\sum|x_i-y_i|\lt \varepsilon.$$ Hence $f$ is absolutely continuous. (ii) For this, can I simply use the fact that an absolutely continuous functions is of bounded variation or I would have to prove it formally? (iii) I also know that if $f$ absolutely continuous $\implies$ $f$ is of bounded variation $\implies f'(x)$ exists a.e. and $$ f(x)=f(0)+\int_0^x f'(t)\,\mathrm{d}t. $$ Thus, $f(x)=\int_0^x f'(t)\,\mathrm{d}t \text{ if } f(0)=0.$ Can I use these known facts to prove (ii) and (iii)?

85021,Some questions on hyperelliptic compact Riemann surfaces,"For genus > 1 hyperelliptic Riemann surface the definition guarantees that there is a degree 2 map from that to $\mathbb{P}^1$. Under this map the inverse image of the ""point at infinity"" has to be two distinct points - why? Why couldn't it be that the map has a double pole? (..as wanted that would also not have the injectivity and hence biholomorphism crisis..) Is the canonical map on a compact Riemann surface holomorphic? (..for the hyperelliptic compact Riemann surfaces one knows that it factors as a composition of the definition guaranteed degree 2 map (to $\mathbb{P}^1$) and the rational canonical curve and hence its not holomorphic..) The above question is motivated from my difficulty in piecing together the argument that all compact Riemann surfaces at genus 2 are hyperelliptic. 
To prove that one wants to show that there the canonical curve is not injective. 
For a genus 2 compact Riemann surface the canonical map is a map to  $\mathbb{P}^1$ (which is genus 0) which if were injective then something absurd would have to happen. But what? One possibile way I can think of the argument is if the canonical map were holomorphic then one could say that this map is surjective - since continuous image of a compact surface is compact and hence its closed in $\mathbb{P}^1$ and but its also open by being the image of a holomorphic map and hence by the connectedness of $\mathbb{P}^1$ it is surjective. So the canonical map for genus 2 Riemann surface would be a bijective holomorphism and which would in turn imply that topologically we have a homeomorphism from genus 2 to genus 0 and which is impossible. Hence proved by reductio absurdum. But I am not at all sure of the above argument! 4       One knows how the canonical map for hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces factors (as stated in question 2) and one also knows as to how they occur as normalizations of the algebraic curve $\{y^2 - \prod _{1}^{2g+2} (x-a_i) = 0\} U [0,0,1]$ (as a subset of $\mathbb{P}^2$) (..where the $a_i$ are distinct complex numbers..) From the above two facts how does it follow that if all these $a_i$ are permuted or affected by some $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ then the compact Riemann surface up there doesn't change?","['differential-geometry', 'riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'complex-analysis']"

$$B=\{b\in S\mid b\notin f(b)\}$$

We figured out that for positive $x$, assuming $f$ exists and is differentiable, $f$ is monotonically increasing.  (Differentiating both sides gives $f'(x)*[\text{positive stuff}]=2x$).  So $f$ is invertible there.  We also figured out that f becomes arbitrarily large, and we guessed that it grows faster than any linear function.  Plugging in $f{-1}(x)$ for $x$ gives $x+f(x)=[f^{-1}(x)]^2$.  Since $f(x)$ grows faster than $x$, $f^{-1}$ grows slower and therefore $f(x)=[f^{-1}(x)]^2-x\le x^2$.

Then, the problem asks me to show there is a measure $m$ on $M\times N$ which is invariant under $F$, such that $\pi_*m=\mu$, where $\pi : M \times N \to M$ is the projection map. For each $x\in M$, I try to define an invariant measure $\nu_x$ which is invariant for $g_x(y)=g(x,y)$, and then glue all these measures together. But I can not proceed any further, partially due to the fact that since $f$ is not invertible, it is very difficult to make the measure thus constructed really invariant globally. I was told that the following theorem should be used. A set of probability Borel measures on X, $\Gamma$, is called tight, if for any $\varepsilon$, there is some compact subset $K$ such that $\mu(K)>1-\varepsilon$ for any $\mu\in \Gamma$. The theorem asserts that if $\Gamma$ is tight, then any sequence of measures $\mu_n$ in $\Gamma$ admits some convergent subsequence, with respect the weak$^*$ topology. So what we need is to find a sequence of measures which are ""quasi invariant"", and then to take the limit to make things work. But I am still stuck here. Could anyone help me with this?

85233,Can all maths be represented in geometry?,"I'm aware that many maths problems can be expressed and understood in geometry, for example, complex numbers can be expressed in 2 dimensions, that can be useful for some problems. Maths started in geometry. My question is, can you map all of mathematics to geometry and solve all problems using geometry and geometric reasoning? Secondly, is that worthwhile? Thirdly, why not? I'm aware that people don't do that, they use sets, or they use other mathematical systems defined by the rules of the system. I only have basic 1st year university math understanding. My question comes from a few problems I've had over the time I have been a programmer and I found many solutions using geometry, for example for representation of dates and times, if they are represented with dates in the x axis and times in the y, its easier to find contained items using geometry. Many other problems seemed to map to geometry well. One reason why I ask this question is that I had a creative though that it would be nice is there was a kind of web browser which could browse geometric structures and do reasoning in geometry and if all data was represented in this browser as geometry, graphs, charts, lines, circles, etc. As a ""human"" I find it easy to think about spacial relations, for example when I was programming 200,000 lines of code in a team, it was easier to imagine it spatially than in any other way. I would image the shape of the text and the logical connections. Also there is the science fiction book Neuromancer which visualized the web as a network which integrated with the though processes of the person, it wasn't ""web pages"" but the idea fits well with a geometry based web. As I said that's a creative idea, not a maths idea, but one motivate is that if I wanted to make such a ""browser"" I wonder if maths could fit inside it in some way.","['geometry', 'soft-question']"

Since $f$ is of bounded variation, we can write $f(x)=g(x)-h(x)$ where $g$ and $h$ are monotone increasing functions on $[a,b]$. Thus $f'(x)=g'(x)-h'(x)$ a.e.  Furthermore, $|f(x)|\leq |g'(x)|+|h'(x)|=g'(x)+h'(x)$. So $$ \begin{align*} \int_a^b|f'(x)|~dx &  \leq \int_a^b g'(x) + \int_a^b h'(x)\\

Question: Is there one standard definition of what it means for $V$ to be ordinary, and if so, what is it? The reason I ask is that I have seen a few different definitions that don't seem to quite coincide (and perhaps this is just the state of things). For example, in Ralph Greenberg's Iwasawa Theory for $p$-adic Representations , he requires there to be a filtration $$\cdots \subseteq F^{i+1}V\subseteq F^iV\subseteq\cdots$$ of $V$ by $G_L$-stable subspaces satisfying the following conditions: (i) $F^iV=0$ for $i \gg 0$ (ii) $F^iV=V$ for $i \ll 0$ (iii) the inertia group of $G_K$ acts by $\chi_p^i$ on $F^iV/F^{i+1}V$, where $\chi_p^i$ is the $p$-adic cyclotomic character I guess it is implicit in (iii) that any jump in the filtration gives a $1$-dimensional quotient. Greenberg proves in this paper (at least for $L=\mathbf{Q}_p$) that such a representation is Hodge-Tate, but in his proof, it seems that he is not requiring $F^iV/F^{i+1}V$ to be $\leq 1$ dimensional, because he calls this dimension $h_i$ and proves that this quotient, when tensored up to $\mathbf{C}_p$ (completion of $\bar{\mathbf{Q}}_p$) is isomorphic to $\mathbf{C}_p(i)^{h_i}$ (at least I think this is what he does). This definition seems to me (unless I'm missing something which is entirely possible) to differ slightly from the one given in Tom Weston's Iwasawa Invariants of Galois Deformations (where he takes $L$ to be a finite extension of $\mathbf{Q}_p$). He calls $V$ nearly ordinary if there is a composition series $$0=V^0\subsetneq V^1\subsetneq\cdots\subseteq V^n=V$$ of the $\mathbf{Q}_p[G_L]$-module. He says that if $V$ is Hodge-Tate, then for each $i$, there is an open subgroup of inertia and an integer $m_i$ such that the open subgroup acts on $V^i/V^{i-1}$ by $\chi_p^{m_i}$. He then calls $V$ ordinary if $m_1\geq m_2\geq\cdots\geq m_n$. It seems to me that if the Hodge-Tate weights (the $m_i$) are distinct, and I can take the open subgroup for each $i$ to be the entire inertia group, then Weston's definition of ordinary implies Greenberg's, but if there are the $m_i$ are not all distinct, then it doesn't seem to work. Does Greenberg's definition force the Hodge-Tate weights to all appear with multiplicity one? Finally, I'm pretty certain I've seen a $2$-dimensional $V$ (at least when $V$ is attached to a $p$-ordinary modular form) called ordinary if it has a $1$-dimensional unramified $G_L$-quotient (if I'm not mistaken Greenberg's definition, in the $2$-dimensional case, reduces to the existence of one-dimensional $G_L$-quotient that is a Tate twist of an unramified character). This use of the term ""ordinary"" makes sense to me because it is satisfied by the $p$-adic representation attached to an elliptic curve over $L$ with good, ordinary reduction (and perhaps this is the origin of the term). I apologize if there are mistakes in the above, or if I've failed to see some obvious equivalences. I'm sort of just learning some of this stuff.","['representation-theory', 'number-theory']"

85565,Motivation behind the definition of GCD and LCM,"According to me, I can find the GCD of two integers (say $a$ and $b$) by finding all the common factors of them, and then finding the maximum of all these common factors. This also justifies the terminology greatest common divisor . However, the general definition used is that $d$ is said to be a GCD of $a$ and $b$ if $d$ divides both $a$ and $b$; and, If $d'$ also divides both $a$ and $b$, then $d'$ divides $d$. My question is that why do we usually accept the second definition over the first. To me the first one seems very intuitive and simple, and does justice to the terminology. The same query goes for LCM as well. Looking forward to your response. Thank you!","['motivation', 'number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'gcd-and-lcm']"
85569,A sequence of measures on a sigma algebra,"Let $X$ be a set and $\mathcal{A}$, a sigma algebra of subsets of $X$. Let $\{\mu_n\}$ be a sequence of measures of $\mathcal{A}$ such that $\mu_{n+1}(E)\geqslant \mu_n(E)$ for every $E\in \mathcal{A}$. Let $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \mu_n(E) = \mu(E)$. I want to show that $\mu$ is a measure on $\mathcal{A}$. Would the conclusion still be true if $\mu_{n+1}(E)\leqslant \mu_n(E).$ My Attempt: Let $E_n$ be a sequence of pairwise disjoint sets in $\mathcal{A}$. Then, I have to show $$\mu\left(\cup_n E_n\right)=\sum_n \mu(E_n),$$  where the $E_n$ are pairwise disjoint. Let $E=\cup_n E_n$. Then $\mu(E)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mu(E_n)$. For one inclusion, we have that $$\begin{align*}
\mu(E) & \geqslant \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty}\sum_{n=1}^N \mu_k(E_n)\\ 
& =\sum_{n=1}^N\mu(E_n). \\
\end{align*} $$ But this holds true for any $N$. Thus $\mu(E)\geqslant \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(E_n)$. Is the above inclusion okay? I can't can up with a way to tackle the other inclusion. Perhaps someone will be kind enough to give a hint?",['measure-theory']
85577,Find the PDF of $X+2Y$ given the PDFs of $X$ and $Y$,"Let $X$ and $Y$ be two independent continuous random variables each uniformly distributed between $[0,1]$ (i.e., $f_x (a)=f_y (a)=1,0\leq a \leq 1$). Please find the density function of the sum of the random variables $X$ and $2Y$, i.e., $f_{X+2Y} (a)$. Am I doing this right? :[ As you can see, I get a little confused at the bottom, and I'm just kind of stuck. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you. My work. Cumulative distribution function of $X+ 2Y$:
$$
\begin{align*}
F_{X+2Y} (a) 
&= P(X+2Y \leq a)
\\ &= \iint_{x+ y \leq a} f_X(x) f_Y(y) ~ dy ~dx
\\ &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{a - 2y} f_X(x) f_Y(y) ~ dx ~dy
\\ &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{a - 2y} f_X(x)  ~ dx\ f_Y(y) ~dy
\\ &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F_X(a-2y)  f_Y(y) ~dy

$$ The probability density function:
$$
\begin{align*}
f_{X+2Y}(a) &= \frac{d}{da} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} F_X(a-2y) f_Y(y) ~ dy 
\\ &= \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{d}{da} F_X(a-2y) f_Y(y) ~ dy
\\ &= \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f_X(a-2y) f_Y(y) ~ dy
\end{align*}
$$ For $[0,1]$:
$$
f_X(a) = f_Y(a) = \begin{cases} 1, & 0 \lt a \lt 1, \\ 0, &\text{otherwise}. \end{cases}
$$ $$
f_{X + 2Y}(a) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f_X(a-2y) f_Y(y) ~ dy \quad \text{for } 0 \lt a \lt 1.
$$ $$
f_{X + 2Y}(a-2) = \int_0^a dy = a.
