Expanding the first equation: $$\lim \left(1+\frac{1}{\frac{n}{2}}\right)^{2\cdot\frac{n}{2}}=\lim \left(1+\frac{1}{\frac{n}{2}}\right)^{\frac{n}{2}}\cdot\lim \left(1+\frac{1}{\frac{n}{2}}\right)^{\frac{n}{2}}$$ I'd say that those two factors converge against $e$, just not as fast. My explanation would be, that the sets $\mathbb N$ and $\{\frac{n}{2}:n\in \mathbb N\}$ have infinitely many elements in common. So is it enough to just (state that and) add

803683,Integral Domain with exactly two Prime Ideals,"I am not looking for someone to give me an explicit example. I want to work this out myself if possible. Trying to learn schemes by reading The Geometry of Schemes by Eisenbud and Harris. Problem I-5 is to play with $X=\{0,1\}$ and two topologies (1) $\tau=\{\emptyset,\{0\},\{1\},\{0,1\}\}$
(2) $\tau=\{\emptyset,\{0\},\{0,1\}\}$ The main problem is not difficult but as an aside, it is stated that both topologies can be realized as $\mbox{Spec}\,R$ for some ring $R$. For the first topology, I think $\mathbb{Z}_6$ works. I cannot find an example for the second topology. My thinking: the easiest example would be an integral domain with exactly two prime ideals, then the zero ideal would give $\{0,1\}$ as a closed set and the elements of the other ideal would give $\{1\}$ as a closed set. Since a finite integral domain is a field, the example I am looking for is infinite. Then I realized that I don't know too many examples, all the integral domains I know do not work. Questions: Am I on the right track? If I am on the right track, is the example one that is obtainable (even for non-experts?)

803703,Proof of Infinite Primes in the form $10^{\lceil k \log_{10}(n) \rceil }+n^{k-1}$,"Let $k$ be any positive integer then how to prove that the sequence
$$Q_k=10^{\lceil k \log_{10}(n) \rceil }+n^{k-1}$$ Contains infinitely many primes? It seems like because if you look at some small values of $k$ we can think of infinude of primes

If false then how many terms are prime in the general $Q_n$ sequence? Where this came from: Consider the sequence of of numbers formed by concatenating (keeping side by side) $n$ and $n^k$ . For $k=2$. The numbers would be $11 ,24,39,416,525,636 ,749,864 \cdots$ Let they form a sequence $s(n,k)$ . Thus  $$s(n,2)= \{ 11 ,24,39,416,525,636 ,749,864 \cdots \}$$ Similarly 
$$s(n,3)=\{11,28,327,464,5125 \cdots \}$$
We can easily see that $$s(n,k)=n \cdot 10^{\lceil k \log(n) \rceil }+n^k$$

803722,For which real numbers $c$ is $\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2} \le e^{cx^2}$ for all real numbers $x$?,"This question comes from the 1980 Putnam exam. My work is shown below. For all integers $n \ge 1$, \begin{align}
(2n)!&=n!\cdot\underbrace{(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)\cdots(2n-2)(2n-1)(2n)}_{n \text{ terms}} \\ 
&\ge n! \cdot \underbrace{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2\cdots 2\cdot2 \cdot 2}_{n \text{ terms}} \\ &=2^nn! \\ \implies \frac{1}{(2n)!} &\le \frac{1}{2^nn!}.\end{align} So we have \begin{align}
\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2} = \cosh(x) &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!} \\ &\le \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}  \frac{x^{2n}}{2^nn!} \\ &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}  \frac{\left(\frac{x^2}{2} \right)^n}{n!} \\ &= e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}

803746,$C_c(\mathbb{R})$ is dense in $L^1(\mathbb{R}) \cap L^2(\mathbb{R})$... right?,"The intersection $L^1(\mathbb{R}) \cap L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is (allegedly) a Banach space for the norm $\|f\| = \|f\|_1 + \|f\|_2$.  Is it also true that $C_c(\mathbb{R})$ is dense with respect to this norm? I think it's reasonably clear that simple functions are dense... It's enough to show you can approximate any nonnegative $f \in L^1(\mathbb{R}) \cap L^2(\mathbb{R})$. But, for such $f$, it's not difficult to produce a monotone increasing sequence of simple functions $s_n$ converging pointwise to $f$ from below, and then check $\|f-s_n\|_1 \to 0$ and $\|f-s_n\|_2 \to 0$. OK, so this means we just need to prove that the simple functions are approximable by compactly supported functions in the norm $\| \cdot \|$. Thus, it is enough to take a measureable set $E$ with finite measure and show its characteristic function $\chi_E$ can be approximated. So, I guess, my question reduces to: Question: If $E \subset \mathbb{R}$ is measureable with finite Lebesgue measure, and $\epsilon > 0$, is there always an $f \in C_c(\mathbb{R})$ such that $\| f - \chi_E\|_1 < \epsilon$ and $\|f - \chi_E\|_2 < \epsilon$?","['lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory']"

Notice that both $X$ and $Y$ are also Erlang distribution since $m,n$ are positive integers. My attempt First, I searched for well-known results about gamma distribution and I got: (1) If $\lambda = \mu$ , the sum random variable is a Gamma distribution $\sim \Gamma(m+n, \lambda)$ (See Math.SE ). (2) $\Gamma(m, \lambda)$ (or $\Gamma(n, \mu)$ ) is the sum of $m$ (or $n$ ) independent exponential random variables each having rate $\lambda$ (or $\mu$ ). The hypoexponential distribution is related to the sum of independent exponential random variables. However, it require all the rates distinct . (3) This site is devoted to the problem of sums of gamma random variables . In section 3.1, it claims that if $m$ and $n$ are integer numbers (which is my case), the density  function can be expressed in terms of elementary functions (proved in section 3.4). The answer is likely buried under a haystack of formulas (however, I failed to find it; you are recommended to have a try) . Then, I try to calculate it: $$f_{X+Y}(a) = \int_{0}^{a} f_{X}(a-y) f_{Y}(y) dy \\ = \int_{0}^{a} \frac{\lambda e^{-\lambda (a-y)} (\lambda (a-y))^{m-1}}{\Gamma(m)} \frac{\mu e^{-\mu y} (\mu y)^{n-1}}{\Gamma(n)} dy \\ = e^{-\lambda a} \frac{\lambda^m \mu^n}{\Gamma(m) \Gamma(n)} \int_{0}^{a} e^{(\lambda - \mu) y} (a-y)^{m-1} y^{n-1} dy$$ Here, I am stuck with the integral and gain nothing ... Therefore, How to compute the density function of $\Gamma(m,\lambda) + \Gamma(n,\mu)$ with integer numbers $m \neq n, \lambda \neq \mu$ ?

804117,Can monsters of real analysis be tamed in this way?,"Consider the Weierstrass Function (somewhat generalized for arbitrary wavelengths $\,\lambda > 0$ ):
$$
W(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sin\left(n^2\,2\pi/\lambda\,x\right)}{n^2}
$$
$W(x)$ is an example of a function that is everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable (Or, for the nitpickers among us: differentiable only on a set of points of measure zero). We seek to remove the pathological character of the function $W(x)$ in  very much the same way as has been tried with removing singularities in Could this be called Renormalization? ,
namely by convolution with a ""broadened"" Dirac-Delta function, in our case a Gaussian:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{^\infty} W(\xi) \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x-\xi)^2/\sigma^2}\,d\xi =\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{^\infty}
\frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x-\xi)^2/\sigma^2}\left[e^{i\,n^2\,2\pi/\lambda\,\xi}-e^{-i\,n^2\,2\pi/\lambda\,\xi}\right]}{2\,i\,n^2}
$$
Exponents are rewritten as follows:
$$
-\frac{1}{2}(x-\xi)^2/\sigma^2 \pm i\,n^2\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\xi =
- \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\xi}{\sigma}\right)^2 + \frac{x}{\sigma}\frac{\xi}{\sigma}
\pm i\,n^2\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\sigma\frac{\xi}{\sigma} - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x}{\sigma}\right)^2 =
-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{\xi}{\sigma}-\left(\frac{x}{\sigma} \pm i\,n^2\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\sigma\right)\right]^2
-\frac{1}{2}\left(n^2\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\sigma\right)^2 \pm i\,n^2\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}x
$$
Giving for the convolution integral:
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty
\int_{-\infty}^{^\infty} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left[\xi/\sigma-(x/\sigma \pm i\,n^2\,2\pi/\lambda\,\sigma)\right]^2}\,d(\xi/\sigma)\times\sigma\times\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\;(=1)\\
\times e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(n^2\,2\pi/\lambda\,\sigma\right)^2}\frac{e^{i\,n^2\,2\pi/\lambda\,x} - e^{-i\,n^2\,2\pi/\lambda\,x}}{2i\,n^2}\qquad \Longrightarrow \\ \overline{W}(x) =
\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(n^2\,2\pi/\lambda\,\sigma\right)^2}\frac{\sin\left(n^2\,2\pi/\lambda\,x\right)}{n^2}
$$
The idea is that a monster function which is ""smoothed"" in this way might be differentiable as well as continuous. A possible argument is that the derivative of the convolution integral can also be calculated in the following way:
$$
\frac{d}{dx} \int_{-\infty}^{^\infty} W(\xi) \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x-\xi)^2/\sigma^2}\,d\xi =
\int_{-\infty}^{^\infty} W(\xi) \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \left(-\frac{x-\xi}{\sigma^2}\right) e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x-\xi)^2/\sigma^2}\,d\xi
$$

I want to find what the ramification index at infinity is. If we let $s = (d,n)$ then I am pretty sure the ramification index would be $n/s$. Here is some reasoning: We can write $f(x) = (1/x)^{-d}u$, where $u$ is a unit. Then $\sqrt[n]{f(x)} = (1/x)^{-d/n}u^{1/n} = (1/x^{s/n})^{-d/s} u^{1/n}$. Hence $ord_{P_\infty}(\sqrt[n]{f(x)}) = -d/s$. So $ord_{P_\infty}(f(x)) = -nd/s = n/s* ord_{1/x}(f(x)) $. Thus $e=n/s$. My question is, is this correct? Why would $P_\infty$, the prime lying over $1/x$, be $1/x^{s/n}$ and not $1/x^{1/n}$? Further, I think whether the prime splits or is inert is captured in the leading coefficient of $f(x)$ (i.e. whether it is a $n^th$ root or not). Is this true? What are the exact conditions?

  characterized by $O=(1,1,1)$ as origin and $B=(c_1,c_2,c_3)$ as its
  basis, which is the canonical. Now, lets define a new referential system $R'$ characterized by
  $O'=(0,1,1)$ as its origin and
  $B'=\left\{(0,1,-2),(1,1,1),(1,0,1)\right\}$ as its basis. I'd like to find the expression to go from one system to another, that is, to find the coordinates of a point in $R'$ by knowing the ones in $R$, and viceversa. As far as I know, that is achieved by the formula $X'=X_0+M\cdot X$, where $X,X'$ are the coordinates of a point in $R,R'$, respectively, and $X_0$ are the coordinates of $O$ in $R'$. And $M$ is of course, the transformation matrix to go from $B$ to $B'$. Now, since we are going from the canonical to another basis, its easy to form $M$ since its just the matriz that contains the vectors of $B'$, that is: $M = \begin{pmatrix} 0&1&1\\ 1&1&0\\ -2&1&1 \end{pmatrix}$ Now, to find the coordinates of $O$ in $R'$, I have to find the coordinates of $\vec{O'O}$ in $B'$. In $B$, they are $(1,1,1)-(0,1,1)=(1,0,0)$. Then I can use $M$ as follows: $X_0=\begin{pmatrix} 0&1&1\\ 1&1&0\\ -2&1&1 \end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 0\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 0\\ 1\\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ Now, I have theoretically everything I need to be able to get points from one referential system to another. To make sure everything went properly, I checked whether the formula works for the origins themselves. So, to get $O$ in $R'$ I would do: $O'=\begin{pmatrix} 0\\ 1\\ -2 \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} 0&1&1\\ 1&1&0\\ -2&1&1 \end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 1\\ 1 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 0\\ 1\\ -2 \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} 2\\ 2\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 2\\ 3\\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ Which is wrong!

804655,"Integral $I(a,b)= P\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{d\theta}{a-b\cos\theta}$","Hi I am trying to calculate this integral
$$
I(a,b)= P\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{d\theta}{a-b\cos\theta},\quad 0
<a<b,\quad a,b\in \mathbb{R}.
$$
We can first write
$$
I(a,b)=\frac{1}{2} P\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\frac{d\theta}{a-b\cos\theta}
$$
since integrand is even.  Now we will use $z=e^{i \theta}$, $dz=ie^{i\theta} d\theta$, $d\theta=dz/(iz)$.  We can write the $\cos$ function as
$$
\cos \theta=\frac{1}{2}(z+z^{-1}).
$$
We can now write the integral as
$$
I(a,b)=\frac{1}{2i}  P \oint_{|z|=1} \frac{dz}{z(a-\frac{b}{2}(z+z^{-1}))}=\frac{1}{i} P\oint_{|z|=1} \frac{dz}{2az-bz^2-b}=-\frac{1}{ib} \oint_{|z|=1} \frac{dz}{z^2-2z\frac{a}{b}+1}.
$$
But I am starting to get stuck here.... We can define $\gamma= a/b < 1$ and now calculate the poles of the integrand.  The poles are given by
$$
z^2-2\gamma z+1=0 , \ z_{\pm}=\gamma +\frac{1}{2} (4\gamma^2-4)^{1/2}=\gamma \pm i(1-\gamma^2)^{1/2}.
$$
If we take the squared magnitude of roots we obtain
$$
|z_{\pm}|^2=\gamma^2 + (1-\gamma^2)=1 
$$
thus we can see that $z_{\pm} \in |z|=1$. 
How can we proceed , it seems we just have simple poles?  Thanks","['residue-calculus', 'calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'complex-analysis']"

I'm inclined to consider that another part of the same item on the list rather than a separate item, but I'm glad I also know this argument.); exercises like finding the limit of the above when $x\to0$ is changed to $x\to\infty$, or ascertaining the convergence or divergence of a series by doing something involving finding limits of that sort, etc.; where all of this is not subsequently used to derive other results; showing that there are functions that are differentiable everywhere but whose derivatives have discontinuities; Various things in probability, possibly the most prominent of which is the proof of the weak law of large numbers.  I'm adding this bullet point after writing the "" PS: "" below. an argument that I wrote.  Here are some specifics: Let
$$
N = \text{number of persons whose income strictly exceeds }x;
$$
$$
M = \text{total income of all whose income strictly exceeds }x.
$$
Doing a continuous approximation to discrete variables, we pretend these vary continuously as functions of $x$.  Although they may be non-one-to-one functions of $x$, they are easily seen to be one-to-one functions of each other.  I demonstrated this proposition: Lemma: Except when $x$ is within a closed interval on which $M$ and $N$ are constant as functions of $x$, we have $\dfrac{dM}{dN}=x$. This is readily shown by squeezing: If $\Delta x>0$ then $x<\dfrac{\Delta M}{\Delta N}\le x+\Delta x$ and if $\Delta x<0$ then $x+\Delta x<\dfrac{\Delta M}{\Delta N} \le x$. Quite possibly there are other uses that I know of very well but that don't come to mind.  If you were to say to me ""How do you prove $P$?"" I might instantaneously know that it's by squeezing, but if I ask myself ""What things are done by squeezing?"", perhaps most of them don't come to mind. So my question is: How shall we extend this bulleted list of applications of squeezing, listing items in order of their importance in the work of the generic working mathematician, including, but not limited to, uses in research, scholarship, pedagogy, and applications of mathematics to other fields ? PS: I'd forgotten this item, which might be what made me think of asking this question in the first place: Independent, random variables with equal distribution satisfy: $\lim_{n \to \infty}\mathbb{P}\left(X_{n+1} > \sum_{i = 1}^{n}X_i\right) = 0$","['big-list', 'real-analysis']"

804802,Uses of averaging an operator over the elements of a finite group?,"In my so far brief journey into group theory, I've encountered a few different situations where it is helpful to average some operator over the elements of the group. For example: To classify finite subgroups of the isometry group of the plane, we pick a point $a$ and define $c = \frac{1}{|G|} \Sigma_{T \in G} T(a)$. Then $c$ is the centroid of $a$ - the average of the vectors in the orbit. Since this is a fixed point, and since $G$ is finite, it is easy to show that $G$ is either a dihedral group or a cyclic group, depending on whether or not it contains orientation reversing isometries. In order to prove Mashke's theorem in representation theory, we produce an inner product compatible with a group action, in the sense that it will give us a $G$-invariant complement to a $G$-invariant subspace. Given any Hermitian form $\langle, \rangle$, we define this new inner product by $\langle \langle x,y \rangle \rangle = \frac{1}{|G|} \Sigma_{g \in G} \langle gx, gy \rangle$. Similarly, given a map $\phi: V \to W$, $V$ and $W$ representations of a finite group $G$, we can average $\phi$ to obtain a $G$-linear map. $\phi(x) = \Sigma_{g \in G} g \phi (g^{-1} x)$ The number of orbits of the action of a finite group on a finite set is given as the average of the permutation character.

An element $a$ of a ring $R$ is called nilpotent if $a^n=0$ for an $n \in \mathbb{N}$.  Show that if $u$ is a unit and $a$ is nilpotent in $R$, then $u+a$ is a unit. My proof: Let $a^n=0$.  The equality $$(u+a)^na^{n-1}=u^na^{n-1} \tag{1}$$  results from expanding $(u+a)^n$ together with the property that $a$ is nilpotent. Let $u_1$ be the left inverse of $u$.  Then by multiplying both sides of (1) on the left by $u_1^n$, the resulting equality is $u_1^n(u+a)^na^{n-1}=a^{n-1}$.  This is where I am nervous.  I thought that you could then write $u_1^n(u+a)^n=1$ by the property of the multiplicative identity in an associative ring with unity and setting the coefficents equal to each other, but I feel like this looks like applying a cancellation to the $a^{n-1}$ on both sides, which I do not mean to be doing. The last part is to rewrite the resulting equality as $(u_1^n(u+a)^{n-1})(u+a)=1$ to show the existence of a left inverse of $u+a$ and then do a similar thing starting from (1) to show the existence of a right inverse.

Use this fact to show that $-1 \leq \rho_{12} \leq 1$. I know that $\rho_{12} = \frac{(E(X_1X_2) - E(X_1)E(X_2))}{ \sqrt{(E(X_1^2) - E(X_1)^2)(E(X_2^2) -E(X_2)^2)}}$ But I am stuck from this point on. I believe I need to show that the denominator is always smaller than the denominator, which would show that it would never be greater than 1. Squaring the whole thing gives me some $E(X_1^2)E(X_2^2)$ and $[E(X_1X_2)]^2$ terms in the numerator, which were mentioned in the inequality, but the rest gets really ugly. Any suggestions on where to go from here?","['statistics', 'covariance']"
805023,How to prove $\frac{1+\sin{6^\circ}+\cos{12^\circ}}{\cos{6^\circ}+\sin{12^\circ}}=\sqrt{3}$?,"I found this interesting result. Show that $$\dfrac{1+\sin{6^\circ}+\cos{12^\circ}}{\cos{6^\circ}+\sin{12^\circ}}=\sqrt{3}.$$
See this Wolfram Alpha output . My attempt is very ugly. We know that
$$\sin{6^\circ}=\dfrac{1}{8}(-1-\sqrt{5})+\dfrac{1}{4}\sqrt{\dfrac{3}{2}(5-\sqrt{5})}$$ $$\cos{6^\circ}=\dfrac{1}{4}\sqrt{\dfrac{1}{2}(5-\sqrt{5})}+\dfrac{1}{8}\sqrt{3}(1+\sqrt{5})$$
$$\sin{12^\circ}=2\sin{6^\circ}\cos{6^\circ}$$$$\cos{12^\circ}=2\cos^2{6^\circ}-1$$ and it is very ugly, maybe there exist simple methods. Thank you.",['trigonometry']
805037,Normal Approximation to Binomial Distribution using Moment Generating Functions,"We're told not to use the central limit theorem to show that the normal approximation is suitable for a binomial distribution when n tends to infinity. I've managed to show the answer, but it involves some messy infinite series. Eg: $$M_Z(T) = M_{\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}} = e^{-\frac{t\mu}{\sigma}}[1 + \theta(e^{\frac{t}{\sigma}} - 1]^n$$
$$ \mu =  n\theta \ and \ \sigma = \sqrt{n\theta(1-\theta)}$$ Then without putting it all here, I take logarithms, use the infinite series of $ e^{\frac{t}{\sigma}}$ and then the infinite series of $ln(1+x)$, collect some terms and show that a lot tend to zero as n tends to infinity, leaving us with the Normal MGF. It's quite ugly, and I'm wondering if there is a clearer method (but still using MGFs)?","['statistics', 'moment-generating-functions']"

805088,Why there is much interest in the study of $\operatorname{Gal}\left(\overline{\mathbb Q}/\mathbb Q\right)$?,"Let's start for a simple quote from wikipedia: ""No direct description is known for the absolute Galois group of the
  rational numbers. In this case, it follows from Belyi's theorem that
  the absolute Galois group has a faithful action on the dessins
  d'enfants of Grothendieck (maps on surfaces), enabling us to ""see"" the
  Galois theory of algebraic number fields."" What does  wikipedia mean exactly  by ""a direct description"" of $\operatorname{Gal}\left(\overline{\mathbb  Q}/\mathbb Q\right)$? It seems that the absolute group of rationals is very important in mathematics, in fact there are several tools from algebraic geometry whereby we try to study it (I'm measuring the importance of an object simply estimating the amount of forces invested on investigations about its nature). But why to give  this importance  to this particular object? For example why $\operatorname{Gal}\left({\overline K}/K\right)$, where $K$ is a generic field, is not ""beautiful"" as $\operatorname{Gal}\left(\overline{\mathbb  Q}/\mathbb Q\right)$?
