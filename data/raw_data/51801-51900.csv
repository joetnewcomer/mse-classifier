538754,Tate Circles in Motivic Homotopy Theory,"First off, this is a vague question about a survey which is, I guess, meant to be vague. So bear with me In Morel's ""Motivic Homotopy Theory"" survey he mentioned the following fact in motivating the Tate circles. One notes that $\mathbb{P}^1$ is equivalent to $S^1 \wedge \mathbb{G}_m$ while, if we follow our topological intuition, $\mathbb{P}^1$ ought to be $S^2$ which is equivalent $S^1 \wedge S^1$. So we need to keep track of this difference between the ""usual"" topological situation and count the number of $\mathbb{G}_m$'s. Now Morel justified the first equivalence by saying that $\mathbb{A}^1$ is invertible in the the unstable homotopy category. With just this information, is there an ""intuitive"", or maybe ""geometric"" (i.e. without going to the details of the motivic unstable category)  way to see how this fact leads to the equivalence above? Any other comments about these two-circles phenomena are much appreciated!","['algebraic-geometry', 'homotopy-theory']"

The domain is: $(-\infty,-17) \cup (-17,-8] \cup [8,17) \cup (17,\infty) $ The value inside the square root can't be negative, so I set up: $$x^2-64 \geq0$$ $$(x-8)(x+8) \geq0$$ Then I found the roots, $x=8$ and $x=-8$, which are the only places where the function may change sign.

538959,Class group and factorizations,"There is a common characterization of the class group ${\rm Cl}(R)$ as a kind of measure of how badly factorization fails to be unique. The most obvious justification for this sentiment is that the order of the class group of $R$ determines if it has unique factorization or not: $$h=1\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad {\rm PID}\quad \Rightarrow \quad {\rm UFD}. \tag{$\star$}$$ This is very unsatisfying though because the exact size of $h$ (not even to mention all of the group structure that ${\rm Cl}(R)$ has in general) is not used, and ""UFD / not UFD"" doesn't in any sense measure the extent to which $R$ fails to be a UFD, only if it does. Plus, the converse, UFD $\Rightarrow$ PID, is specific to when $R$ is Dedekind, so this is only a partial justification. There are a number of answers exposing specific ideas in How does a class group measure the failure of unique factorization? (which is basically my question here, but I am resurrecting it because I am not satisfied) and Class number measuring failure of unique factorization at MO. PLC and BD cite Carlitz ($h=2$ iff factorization lengths are invariant), PLC notes that $h$ can yield arithmetic obstructions to certain paths like in FLT, and BD cites a theorem of Kaczorowski which goes from factorization information to an exact isomorphism class characterization of the class group (which is reverse of the desired order: going from class group to factorization information). Kevin has the strongest skeptical vibe among the responses in his conclusion: Unfortunately, you can see we lose a lot of information in passing to the class group, and in particular it doesn't tell us anything at all about which elements are obstacles to unique factorization. The intuition, rather, is that a more complicated class group implies we're further from unique factorization. I am not sure how the mentioned intuition translates into concrete facts, but I do get the impression that $\rm Cl$ doesn't have the right ""type"" of information to talk about factorizations. Rather, I think the more direct description for $\rm Cl$ is as a measure of how ideals fail to act like numbers. Here is my own crack at ""measuring"" factorization's failure to be unique. Let $\Gamma(R)$ be the set of all associates classes of irreducible elements. (Suppose $R$ is a factorization domain, so all elements have some factorization if not a unique one, and $K$ is $R$'s fraction field.) The group of principal fractional ideals is essentially $K^\times/R^\times$, and it is generated by irreducible elements. Thus there is a surjective map $\Bbb Z^{\oplus \Gamma(R)}\to K^\times/R^\times$, and the kernel is comprised of all relations satisfied between irreducibles under multiplication. These relations are precisely the inequivalent factorizations into irreducibles that occur in $R$. Our knowledge so far can be put into a diagram: $$\{{\rm relations}\}\to\Bbb Z^{\oplus \Gamma(R)}\to K^\times/R^\times\to I(R)\to{\rm Cl}(R).$$ Observe this has two subsequences which are short exact, the first ending and the second beginning with $K^\times/R^\times$. (Can we determine if $\rm relations$ is infinitely generated or not?) One thing to notice is that in such a sequence $A\to B\to C\to D\to E$, the exact sequence $C\to D\to E$ generically is expected to have little control over the exact sequence $A\to B\to C$, which at face value seems like good evidence that ${\rm Cl}(R)$ does not influence factorization very much, but in fact $(\star)$ says $|{\rm Cl}|=1$ implies $\{\rm relations\}=0$, so this diagram does not fully capture the situation. So, my questions: What direct , specific relationships exist between elemental factorizations and ideal classes? (In particular, beyond Kaczorowski's theorem.) Why is it useful to think of ${\rm Cl}(R)$ as measuring the failure of unique factorization, as opposed to being only indirectly related (i.e. by measuring the failure of ideals to act like numbers)? What properties of ${\rm Cl}(R)$ definitively don't say anything specific about factorizations, and conversely what properties of factorizations are definitively not captured by ideal classes?

539166,"Perturbation in characteristic p, or Why, really, does Lie's theorem fail?","While recalling some basics of Lie theory, I found a funny proof of the main lemma in Lie's theorem on triangularity of representations of solvable Lie algebras. It turns out that this proof has a very clear and intuitive idea (I wonder why they don't explain it to students), which I present below in a nonrigorous way. My question is: how, exactly, can you see from the idea that its formalization requires characteristic 0 (or not less than the dimension, or whatever)? What goes wrong with the suggested geometric picture in characteristic $p$? Or what should be added to the informal language I use to make this explicit? Of course I also have a formal version of it, involving characteristic polynomials, and it does spit out some constants that have to be nonzero in the end, but I'm asking for a geometric explanation. So here it goes. Let $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}$ be an ideal in a Lie algebra, let $V$ be a finite-dimensional representation of $\mathfrak{g}$, and let $\lambda$ be a weight of its restriction to $\mathfrak{h}$. Then the corresponding weight space $V_\lambda$ is $\mathfrak{g}$-invariant. ""Proof"". Clearly everything boils down to showing that $\langle \lambda, [g,h] \rangle = 0$ for all $g \in \mathfrak{g}, h \in \mathfrak{h}$. Now let $\langle \lambda, h\rangle$ be an eigenvalue of $h$ of multiplicity at least $m$, for all $h \in \mathfrak{h}$. Let's extend our ring of scalars by a nilpotent $\epsilon^2 = 0$ to make an infinitesimal perturbation. On the one hand, $h + \epsilon [g,h]$ is still in $\mathfrak{h}$ (or rather in its extension), since it is an ideal. So it has an eigenvalue $\langle \lambda, h \rangle + \epsilon \langle \lambda, [g,h] \rangle$ of multiplicity $\ge m$. On the other hand, $h + \epsilon [g, h]$ is conjugate to $h$ (i.e. $h + \epsilon [g, h] = (1 + \epsilon g) h (1 + \epsilon g)^{-1}$), thus it must have the same spectrum as $h$ does. Therefore, in addition to having an eigenvalue $\langle \lambda, h \rangle + \epsilon \langle \lambda, [g,h] \rangle$ it also has an eigenvalue $\langle \lambda, h \rangle$, both of multiplicity $\ge m$. Therefore, either $\langle \lambda, [g, h] \rangle = 0$ for all $h$ (in which case there is nothing left to prove), or $h$ must have had the eigenvalue $\lambda$ with multiplicity $\ge m+1$. Moreover, this actually happens for all $h$. Now run the same argument for $m+1$ instead of $m$, and at some point you will exceed the dimension.","['linear-algebra', 'lie-algebras', 'infinitesimals', 'positive-characteristic']"

539244,How to think of the pullback operation of line bundles?,"Recall that give a map $f : (X,\mathcal{O}_X) \to (Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)$ of ringed spaces and a sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $Y$ we can form the pullback $f^\ast \mathcal{F} := f^{-1}\mathcal{F}\otimes_{f^{-1}\mathcal{O}_Y} \mathcal{O}_X$. Now the pullback of sheaves appears in both chapters 2.5 and 2.7 of Hartshorne. In particular, it is used to define a correspodence between line bundles $\mathcal{L}$ on a scheme $(X \to \operatorname{Spec} A)$ and maps to projective space $\Bbb{P}^n_A$. More explicitly, for any morphism $\varphi : X\to \Bbb{P}^n_A$ we have $\varphi^\ast \mathcal{O}(1)$ being a line bundle generated by the linear polynomials $x_0,\ldots,x_n$. Conversely given $n+1$ global sections $s_0,\ldots,s_n$ of a line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ on $X$, we have a unique morphism  $\varphi : X \to \Bbb{P}^n_A$ such that $\varphi^\ast(x_i) = s_i$. Problem 1: My first problem I have with $\varphi^\ast$ is say I have the $x_i$'s as above. What are the ""canonical induced sections"" $s_i \in \varphi^\ast\mathcal{O}(1)$? All I can say now is that each $x_i$ gives a map from $\mathcal{O}_{\Bbb{P}^n_A} \to \mathcal{O}(1)$ but how does this give us our $s_i$? Is there a more concrete description of what these actually are? Problem 3: Can we see explicitly ""in coordinates"" what the map $\varphi : X\to \Bbb{P}^n_A$ determined by these sections is? Problem 2: My second problem with the definition of this $\varphi^\ast$ is getting hold of its global sections. From the definition I gave in the beginning of the pullback, it seems that definition is not much help in practical situations! Say I want to compute global sections of $\varphi^\ast \mathcal{O}(1)$ where $\varphi$ is the closed immersion of the conic $ V(xy - z^2)$ in $\Bbb{P}^2$. How can I do this? What about computing global sections of the bullback bundle by say $\varphi: \Bbb{P}^n\setminus V(x_0,x_1,x_2) \to \Bbb{P}^2$? Last and finally, is there a way to think of this pullback operation that can significantly enhance my feel for it? Let me give an example of what I mean by this. When I first learned about the tensor product of sheaves I was very fearful because I didn't know how the sheaf behaved (for example what on earth are the global sections?). However if we tensor two quasi-coherent sheaves , then on an affine I know exactly what the tensor product is: it behaves just like a module!",['algebraic-geometry']

Define $$Pf(x)=\int_{X} f(y)\,P(x,dy)\;\;\; (f\in C(X), x\in X),$$
where $C(X)$ is the space of bounded continuous functions $f:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. We say that $P$ has the Feller property if $Pf \in C(X)$ for all $f\in C(X)$. My question is: how to prove the following theorem (Proposition 6.4.2, Meyn and Tweedie, Markov chains and stochastic stability : http://probability.ca/MT/Chap6.pdf ): Assume that $P$ has the Feller property, and that there exists a unique probility measure $\pi$ on $\mathcal{B}(X)$ such that for every $x\in X$: $$P^n(x,\cdot)\stackrel{w}{\rightarrow} \pi\;\;\;(n\to\infty).$$
  Then the family $\{P^n f: n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is equicontinuous on compact subsets of $X$ whenever $f\in C(X)$ ($\stackrel{w}{\rightarrow}$ denotes the weak convergence). The authors claim that it follows directly from Ascoli's Theorem. However I can not see this. In order to be able to apply Ascoli's theorem we need to know that for each compact set $C$ at least some subseqence $(P^{k_n} f)_{n}$ is uniformly convergent on $C$. Since $C$ is compact we may choose $x_n \in C$ such that $$|P^n f(x_n)-\pi(f)|=\max_{x\in C} |P^n f(x)-\pi(f)| \;\;\;(n\in\mathbb{N}),$$ where $\pi(f)=\int_X f(y)\,\pi(dy)$. So it suffices to show that there exists a strictly increasing sequence $(k_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $$P^{k_n}f(x_{k_n})\to \pi(f)$$ but I have a problem in this place.

This polynomial have only one zero inside the open unit disk. Therefore the only root that exist in unit disk must be a real one. Because complex roots exist only in pairs.

539539,"Why is the shift the optimal plan between $[0,1)$ and $[1,2)$ (with distance-squared cost function)?","Example 1.3 of Optimal and Better Transport Plans reads Consider the task to transport points on the real line (equipped with the Lebesgue measure) from the interval [0, 1) to [1, 2) where the cost of moving one point to another is the squared distance between these points ($X = [0, 1)$, $Y = [1, 2)$, $c(x, y) = (x − y)^2$, $\mu = \nu = \lambda$). The simplest way to achieve this transport is to shift every point by 1. This results in transport costs of 1 and one easily checks that all other transport plans are more expensive. Why are all other transport plans more expensive? I.e., given a transport plan $P$ (which is a measure on $[0,1) \times [1,2)$ such that $P \circ \pi_{1}^{-1} = \mu$ and $P \circ \pi_{2}^{-1} = \nu$, where $\pi_i$ is the projection onto the $i$-th coordinate) why is it true that
$$
\int_{[0,1) \times [1,2)} (x-y)^2 \, dP \geq 1 ?
$$ What I tried initially. By writing $(x-y)^2 = x^2 -2xy + y^2$ and using the fact that integrating a function of $x$ with respect to $P$ is the same as integrating with respect to $\mu$ (and similarly for $y$ and $\nu$) gives $$
\begin{align*}
\int_{[0,1) \times [1,2)} (x-y)^2 \,dP &= \int_{0}^{1}x^{2} \,dx - 2\int_{[0,1) \times [1,2)} xy \,dP + \int_{1}^{2} y^{2}\, dy \\
&= 8/3 - 2\int_{[0,1) \times [1,2)} xy \,dP,

so it suffices to show that $\int_{[0,1) \times [1,2)} xy \,dP \leq 5/6$. I don't see how to show this. Addendum. I'm not sure if what I tried above was leading to a solution, but I think I have the answer, based on @Niels Diepeveen's hint.
As noted in my comment to Niels' answer, it suffices to show that the 'diagonal' transport plan $P_{o}$ on $[0,1)\times [0,1)$ is optimal for the cost function $c(x,y+1) = (x-y-1)^{2}$ ('diagonal' here means that $P_{o}$ is supported by $\{(x,y):x=y\}$. As noted by Niels, it is clear that $P_{o}$ is optimal for the cost function $c(x,y)=(x-y)^{2}$. But $c(x,y+1) = c(x,y) -2(x-y)+ 1$, so if $P$ is any transport plan,
$$
\begin{align*}
\int_{[0,1)^{2}} c(x,y+1)\, dP &= \int_{[0,1)^{2}} (c(x,y) - 2(x-y) + 1) \, dP \\
&= \int_{[0,1)^{2}} c(x,y) \, dP - 2\int_{[0,1)^{2}} x \, dP + 2\int_{[0,1)^{2}} y \, dP + 1  \\
&= \int_{[0,1)^{2}} c(x,y) \, dP - 2\int^{1}_{0} x \, d\lambda + 2\int^{1}_{0} y \, d\lambda + 1  \\
&= \int_{[0,1)^{2}} c(x,y) \, dP +1 \\

539553,Cauchy distribution instead of Coulomb law?,"A recent question by alexv - 
and his comment that the answer will eventually be used in Gravity modeling - 
has triggered the following in my mind. It's about Electric modeling instead of Gravity modeling, but the inverse square law is similar. The energy density in the electric field of a point charge $q$ is
given by $ \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 E^2 $ where the electric field $E$
at a distance $r$ is: $$ E = \frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2} $$ The total energy
in the field is thus given by the integral:
$$ U = \int_0^\infty\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0 \left(\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2}
\right)^2 4 \pi r^2 dr \ =
\frac{q^2}{8 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_0^\infty \frac{dr}{r^2} = 
   \frac{q^2}{8 \pi \epsilon_0} \left[ \frac{1}{r} \right]_0^\infty = \infty $$
Hence there is an infinite outcome for de self energy of the electron. As is
well known, this is quite a serious problem in classical electrodynamics. It is
shown below how this problem can be resolved by sort of renormalization ,
as understood by this author. Replace $r^2$ by $(r^2+\sigma^2)$ where $\sigma$
is interpreted as the ""size"" of the electron.
Such a Cauchy distribution is in agreement with Coulomb's law at reasonable
distances from the origin. At the same time the singularity at the origin is
effectively removed, because we have the following extremely simple result:
$$
U = \frac{q^2}{8 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_0^\infty \frac{r^2\,dr}{(r^2+\sigma^2)^2}
  = \frac{q^2}{8 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{4}\frac{\pi}{\sigma}
  = \frac{q^2}{32\,\epsilon_0\sigma}$$
The outcome must be equal to $m_0 c^2$,  hence we calculate for the electron radius:
$$
  \sigma = \frac{q^2}{32\,\epsilon_0 m_0 c^2} = \frac{\pi}{8} r_e

$$ \int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{(1+y)(1+x^2y)} \, dx \, dy$$ It was in August-September 's issue of the American Mathematical Monthly. Anyway, I was able to follow most of  it upto the last step where he switches integral and summation. $$\int_0^1 \frac{\ln x}{x^2-1} dx = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \int_0^1 -x^{2n} \ln x\,dx$$ I think I grasp how uniform convergence of a series can allow you to switch infinite sums and integral signs. But from what I can see $\sum_{n=1}^\infty -x^{2n} \ln x$ doesn't uniformly converge on $[0,1]$. It may be uniformly convergent on $[0,k]$ if $k \in (0,1)$? Is that enough to justify the switch? Alternatively, the partial sums are strictly increasing and bounded. But how do you prove they converge to the integral on the left side? Edit: Is there a theorem that says: if $f_n \to f$ pointwise on $[a,b]$ and $f_n$ is uniformly bounded then, $\int_a^b f_n(x) \, dx \to \int_a^b f(x) \, dx$? Is the following a proper proof?

Since $\displaystyle \int_0^k f(x)\, dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_0^k f_n(x)\,dx$ by uniform convergence on $[0,k]$. It remains to show that if $k$ is chosen properly then $\displaystyle \left| \int_k^1 f(x)\,dx-\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_k^1 f_n(x)\,dx \right| < \epsilon$, a contradiction. $f_n$ being uniformly bounded implies $$ \left| \int_k^1 f(x)\,dx - \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_k^1 f_n(x)\,dx \right| < (1-k)M$$ So let $1-\frac{\epsilon}{M}<k<1$ so that $(1-k)M < \epsilon$.","['calculus', 'real-analysis']"

Define the LHS as the limit of proper integrals, and show it converges. My attempt so far: It seems fairly easy to tackle the last part of the question...$\cos{(\alpha x)}$ will keep picking up the same area in alternating signs, and $x$ will continue to grow, so we're basically summing up a constant times the alternating harmonic series. I've never actually heard the phrase ""change of contour"". I assume what they mean is to choose a contour on one, and then use a change of variable (which will then change the contour...e.g. as $z$ traverses a certain path $z^2$ will traverse a different path). The right hand side looks ripe for subbing $z^2$ somehow...but then that would screw up the exponential. We need something divided by $\beta$ to get rid of the $\beta$ in the exponential on the RHS, leaving $\cos{(\alpha x)}$ as the real part of the exponential. I also thought of trying to use a keyhole contour on the RHS and multiplying by $\log$, but it seems we'd have problems with boundedness in the left half-plane. Any ideas or hints?

539823,Are there Groups of Strictly Primes,"Motivation Since Euclid's proof of the infinitude of the primes, the structure and properties of primes has always fascinated mathematicians. This lead to great work in their properties and distribution, such as the Prime Number Theorem. However, much of the study of the structure of primes is done via Analytic Number Theory where much of the work is done using the tools of Analysis. I am aware of Algebraic Number Theory (it is my goal to have this be my field of expertise so forgive me if perhaps this question comes from my ignorance), but I have not seen groups comprised strictly of primes. Rather, one sees the structure of primes$-$or even number fields in general rather$-$studied through use of Algebraic Geometry, algebraic number fields, Iwasawa Theory, group cohomologies, et cetera. However, these employ notions far ""broader"" such as fields (larger special rings that add more structure than just the notion of a group). One doesn't see a group consisting strictly of prime numbers. My Attempts For example, in my research into absolute primes (also known as permutation primes), cyclic primes, and palindromic primes , often I am forced to long calculations with big $O$'s and large scale modular arithmetic (some of the more basic tools of Analytic Number Theory). It would be nice to form a group out of these primes and work with them from a group perspective instead. For those that don't know, absolute primes are primes whose digit permutations are also prime and cyclic primes are those whose cyclic permutations of digits remain prime. Even with this added structure of permutations acting on primes, I have never been able to find an operation on the set of such primes that creates a group$-$nevertheless a ring (in any nontrivial way that focuses on the primes at hand and does not end up reflecting more the structure of $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, or $\mathbb{R}$). When I took a step back and tried to make a group out of the primes in general, any structure I attempted to create failed either with closure under the operation or under inverses. Consulting the literature has yielded nothing. For example, attempting to create a group of primes under ordinary multiplication lacks closure. Moreover, would would inverses look like? Then adding ""primes"" of the of the form $\frac{1}{p}$ really doesn't give one anything useful. Switching or even adding ordinary addition creates $\mathbb{Q}$ which of course is nothing new. Obviously, I have found people studying primes using groups, rings, and fields. However, the groups, rings, or fields they employ do not consist ""primarily"" of primes. Using such objects seems like a great way to approach primes. As Alexey Sosinsky put it, ""The notion of a ""group"", viewed only 30 years ago as the epitome of sophistication, is today one of the mathematical concepts most widely used in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and mathematics itself."" Question To avoid an unanswerable question or one that would require years of research, my question is this: are there examples of groups consisting of only primes in the literature? This could mean a set $G=\{p \mid p \text{ prime}\}$ under some natural operation or a natural operation on a set like this $G=\{\frac{1}{p}\mid p \text{ prime}\}$. Examples of rings or fields out of ""mostly"" primes would also be great. To clear up the possible lack of rigor of ""mostly primes"", say the group, ring, or field must have only finitely many elements that are not of prime form. Meaning they are primes, something of the form $\frac{1}{p}$ where $p$ is prime along with the ordinary primes, et cetera. (basically, they ""look"" like a prime in some form as in the sets $G$ above). If you can produce such an example in the literature, please be explicit in its construction or provide a citation. Thank you.

Since the unit interval is uncountable, the Cantor set must be uncountable as well. I am stuck on one word here: After showing that for each $p\in \mathfrak{C}$  none of its digits can equal 1, we then define a function $f : C \to [0, 1]$ by taking the number not
consisting entirely of the digits $\{0, 2\}$ (why not entirely?) and replacing each occurrence of $\{2\}$ by $\{1\}$ in its representation. To show that $f$ is surjective, consider any element in  $a\in[0, 1]$.
Represent $a$ in its binary form, and then replace each occurrence of  $\{1\}$ digit by
a $\{2\}$. This new number, which we label $b$, satisies  $f(b) = a$. As a result, $f$ is
surjective. And then it follows that  follows that $|[0,1]|=|\mathfrak{C}|$. I can't seem to see the necessity of the word entirely I can't see why the numbers  $1=0.2222...$ and $0=0.000...$ would hurt anything, and $0,1\in\mathfrak{C}$, so if $f$ doesn't consider those numbers then it is an inconsistent mapping from $\mathfrak{C}$ to $[0,1]$.

What is the minimum number of coins that must be drawn to make sure that we have at least $10$ coins of any type?","['discrete-mathematics', 'contest-math', 'arithmetic', 'pigeonhole-principle', 'combinatorics']"
539974,Reflexivity of a Banach space without the James map,"The reflexivity of a Banach space is usually defined as having to be enforced by a particular isometric isomorphism.  Namely the map that takes each element to the evaluation, which is already an injective linear isometry from a Banach space to its double dual.  It just isn't necessarily surjective. Are there examples of when a space is isometrically isomorphic to its double dual, but is not reflexive?  If $X$ is reflexive, is the same true of the $k^{th}$ dual of $X$? (Or maybe this property moves backwards instead?  As in maybe if the dual is reflexive then so is the original.  Separability does this too, but I'm not sure how to intuit when a property should pushforward and when it should pull back under the operation of taking a dual.)  Does being reflexive, or at least isometrically isomorphic to its double dual capture any information about the ""size"" of the space or any other intuitive concepts that are easy to picture?","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces', 'analysis']"
540001,Iterative method for matrix differential equation,"Let $A$ and $X(t)$ be $n\times n$ matrices. I want to solve the matrix differential equation $$\dfrac{dX}{dt}(t)=AX(t)$$ with $X(0)=I$ (the $n\times n$ identity matrix) using the Picard iterative process . So I want $X_0(t)=I$ for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$, and $$X_k(t)=I+\int_0^tAX_{k-1}(s)ds$$ So I compute $X_1(t)=I+\int_0^tAds=I+tA$. Iterating, I have $X_2(t)=I+\int_0^tA(I+sA)ds=I+At+\dfrac{A^2t^2}{2}$. Iterating once more, I have $X_3(t)=I+\int_0^tA(I+As+\dfrac{A^2s^2}{2})ds=I+At+\dfrac{A^2t^2}{2}+\dfrac{A^3t^3}{6}$ Then the limit will eventually be $X_\infty(t)=I+\sum_{k=1}^\infty\dfrac{(At)^k}{k!}$. And it seems to be a solution of the original equation. How do I know that the iterative method is guaranteed to work in a case like this though? Is there some general theorem to verify that?","['matrices', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'real-analysis']"
540005,Convergence of exponential matrix sum,Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix. Consider the infinite sum $$B=\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{A^kt^k}{k!}$$ Each term $\dfrac{A^kt^k}{k!}$ is an $n\times n$ matrix. Does the sum $B$ always converge? (i.e. does the sum for each of the $n^2$ entries always converge?),"['matrices', 'exponentiation', 'convergence-divergence']"

540027,Extensions of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ by $\mathbb{Z}$,"Given that $H^2(\mathbb{Z}_n,\mathbb{Z})=\mathbb{Z}_n$, it follows that up to equivalence there should be $n$ extensions of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ by $\mathbb{Z}$, one for each cohomology class.  I'd like to write them down with as much detail as possible. Using the standard resolution, an extension is obtained by a function $f:\mathbb{Z}_n\times\mathbb{Z}_n\to\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying $f(0,a)=f(a,0)=0$ for all $a\in\mathbb{Z}_n$, and satisfying the cocycle condition: $$f(b,c)-f(ab,c)+f(a,bc)-f(a,b)=0$$ for all $a,b,c\in\mathbb{Z}_n$.  The extension is then constructed as the set $E=\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ with group law $$(a,b)\cdot(c,d)=(a+c+f(b,d),b+d)$$ with inclusion $a\mapsto (a,1)$ and projection $(a,b)\mapsto b$. I have two related questions: What are the $n$ different functions $f$ which give rise to the $n$ different extension classes, and what are the short exact sequences that arise from each $f$? Using the resolution for cyclic groups in which each module is free of rank $1$, I can view the cohomology classes of $H^2(\mathbb{Z}_n,\mathbb{Z})$ as equivalence classes of maps $\varphi:\mathbb{Z}G\to\mathbb{Z}$, where the class of $\varphi$ is the class of $\varphi(1)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_n$.  What is the correspondence between these representatives of cohomology classes and the functions $f$ from question $1$?  Perhaps the answer to this question will be obvious once question $1$ is answered.","['homology-cohomology', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-cohomology', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

540049,Conditional Probability - Two methods,"There are two methods, A and B, to finish a work. Method A succeeds with probability $1/3$ , but if it fails one tries method B with probability $3/4$ or method A again with probability $1/4$ . Method B succeeds with probability $1/4$ , but if it fails one tries method A with probability $2/3$ or method B again with probability $1/3$ . Successive choices are made according to the scheme above until success. What is the probability that success will be made by method A if a) one starts with method A ?. b) one starts with method B ?. I thought the problem was dealing with a markov chain, but i think it's more related to conditional probability now. Still stuck! Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much!","['probability-theory', 'probability']"
