1352052,"Computing ${\mathcal Ext}^i_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{O}_D, \mathcal{O}_X)$, where $D\subset X$ is a divisor","Let $X$ be a smooth scheme and $D\subset X$ be a divisor on $X$. I want to compute the sheaves ${\mathcal Ext}^i_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{O}_D, \mathcal{O}_X)$. Actually it is quite easy. We have the following locally free resolution of $\mathcal{O}_D$:
$$0\to\mathcal{O}_X(-D)\stackrel{\varphi}\to\mathcal{O}_X\to\mathcal{O}_D\to0.$$
Applying ${\mathcal Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\_,\mathcal{O}_X)$ to the complex
$$0\to\mathcal{O}_X(-D)\stackrel{\varphi}\to\mathcal{O}_X\to0$$
we obtain the complex
$$0\to\mathcal{O}_X\stackrel{\varphi^*}\to\mathcal{O}_X(D)\to0,$$
so ${\mathcal Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{O}_D,\mathcal{O}_X)=\text{ker}\,\varphi^*$, ${\mathcal Ext}^1_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{O}_D, \mathcal{O}_X)=\mathcal{O}_X/\text{im}\,\varphi^*$. Now, to finish the computations, how can I prove the injectivity of $\varphi^*$? As Mariano Suárez-Alvarez suggested I can check it locally. Let $\varphi:I\to A$ be an inclusion of an ideal to the ring, where $I$ is prime ideal of codimension one. I have a map $$\varphi^*:Hom_A(A,A)→Hom_A(I,A)$$ which acts by sending $f\in Hom_A(A,A)$ to $\varphi^*(f):=f\circ\varphi∈Hom_A(I,A)$. To prove that $\varphi^*$ is an injection we need to check that $f\circ\varphi=0$ implies $f=0$. The condition $f\circ\varphi=0$ gives that $f(I)=0$. The last condition implies that $I\cdot a=0$, where $a=f(1)$. Thus $I\subset\text{ann}(a)$. What should I do next?","['algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-cohomology']"

1352098,Probability of drawing white ball after transferring to new urn n times,"I am in a probability theory course and could not find the solution to this question anywhere. The assignment is already turned in, and I am asking this for my knowledge and for others who are also curious. (Sorry for the messy math typing. Doing this off of a phone.) There are $n$ urns in a line that all have $a$ white balls and $b$ black balls. Now, a ball is selected at random from the first urn and transferred to the second urn. Then a ball is transferred from the second urn to the third urn. This process continues until the $n$th urn. What is the probability P(W) that you will choose a white ball from the nth urn? One way of thinking that I came to was:
$$P(W) = P(W_{n-1})P(W_n|W_{n-1}) + P(B_{n-1})P(W_n|B_{n-1})$$ In this method I know that n = 2 works, but unsure if n= 3, 4, etc works as well. And another possible one that I thought of as I was typing is:
You are left with either $\frac{a+1}{(a+1) + b}$ or $\frac{a}{a + (b+1)}$ so placing a weight on these two can lead to the probability of a white ball being chosen.",['probability-theory']

1352132,Does the Russell Set exist?,"I am currently reading ""Naive set Theory"" by Paul Halmos. In the second chapter, on the axiom of specification we show that the Universal Set does not exist. The proof is the following: Lets define $R$ as: $R=\{x \in A\mid x \notin x\}$ Lets suppose that $R \in A$, there are two options: $R \in R$. We reach an immediate contradiction, since, if $R \in R$ then $R \not\in R.$ $R \not\in R$. And again we reach a contradiction since, if $R \not\in R$, and $R \in A$, then $R \in R$. We can conclude therefore that $R \not\in A$. And since the set $A$ is completely arbitrary, we conclude that no set contains everything, because no set contains $R$. Therefore, there is no universe. But, if we suppose that $R$ does exist, and assuming the existence of the empty set, with the Axiom of Pairing, I should be able to create a set in which both $R$ and $\emptyset$, belong to. Let's call this new set $U$. But since we said that $R$ can not be a member of any set, then $R$ can not be a member of $U$. The only solution to this problem I can think of, would be to restrict the Axiom of Pairing, such that it could be expressed as: For any two sets $X$, $Y$, if $X$ is a member of a set $N$, and $Y$ is a member of a set $M$, then there exists a set $U$, such that both $X$, $Y$ are members of it. And since $R$ is not a member of any set, it wouldn't be a valid choice for the Axiom of Pairing. Is the solution correct? Have I maybe completely misunderstood the axiom of Pairing? And even if we define the axiom of Pairing as above, $R$ is not a member of any set, but does it exist? Because if we conclude that it doesn't, we can ignore our proof that the Universe does not exist.","['paradoxes', 'elementary-set-theory', 'axioms']"

1352150,Number of Solutions to Polynomials in Finite Fields,"Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a finite field and
  $f_i\in\mathbb{F}[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n]$ be polynomials of degree $d_i$,
  where $1\leq i\leq r$, such that $f_i(0,\ldots,0) = 0$ for all $i$.
  Show that if $n>\sum_{i=1}^r d_i$, then there exists nonzero solution
  to the system of equations: $f_i = 0$ for all $1\leq i \leq r$. Hint: Let $q = \left|\mathbb{F}\right|$ and $p = \operatorname{char}\mathbb{F}$. The number of integral solutions is congruent to the following
  number modulo $p$ $$\sum_{x\in\mathbb{F}^n}\prod_{i=1}^r(1-f_i(x)^{q-1}).$$ Indeed, $x$ is a solution to the system of equations if and only if $\prod_{i=1}^r(1-f_i(x)^{q-1}) = 1$ because if $0 = a\in\mathbb{F}$, then $a^{q-1} = 0$; if $0\neq a\in\mathbb{F}$, then $a^{q-1} = 1$. In addition, the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}$ is $p$. Thus, the hint is proved. But I cannot see how to manipulate the value of $\sum_{x\in\mathbb{F}^n}\prod_{i=1}^r(1-f_i(x)^{q-1})$. Since algebraic geometry studies the common zeros of $S$, a subset of $k[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$, where $k$ is a field, I classify this question into algebraic geometry.

1352181,Is a pathwise-continuous function continuous?,"Suppose that $X$ is a locally connected and simply connected space and $f:X\to Y$ is a function such that for every path $\phi:[a,b]\to X$ the composition $f\circ\phi$ is continuous. Does it follow that $f$ is continuous? Here is a proof using countable choice if we additionally assume that $X$ is first-countable and locally path connected: Assume that $f$ is not continuous at $x\in X$, and let $(U_n)$ be a local base at $x$ which forms an inclusion chain $U_{n+1}\subseteq U_n$. Then there is a neighborhood $V$ of $f(x)$ and a sequence of points $(x_n)$ such that $x_n\in U_n$ and $f(x_n)\notin V$. Let $\phi_n:[\frac1{n+1},\frac1n]\to U_n$ be a path from $x_n$ to $x_{n+1}$, and take $\phi$ to be the union of these, extended to $[0,1]$ by setting $\phi(0)=x$. Now $\phi$ is continuous on $(0,1]$ by the pasting lemma, and it is continuous at $0$ because every neighborhood of $x$ contains some $U_n\supseteq \phi([0,\frac1n])$. Thus $\phi$ is a path, so $f\circ\phi$ is continuous, and then there is an $n$ such that $f\circ \phi([0,\frac1n])\subseteq V$, which is a contradiction because $f\circ \phi(\frac1n)=f(x_n)\notin V$. Is it necessary to assume first-countability here? If it helps, the application I want to use this theorem for is the claim that a covering map $p:Y\to Z$ lifts paths $f:X\to Z$ uniquely (given a basepoint $p(y_0)=f(x_0)$) to $\tilde f:X\to Y$ when $X$ is simply connected and locally connected. If I define $\tilde f$ such that $\tilde f(x)=\tilde \phi(1)$ for any path $\phi:[0,1]\to X$ from $x_0$ to $x$ (I have already shown that liftings exist for $X=[0,1]$ and $X=[0,1]^2$), then I can show that this defines a function which is ""pathwise continuous"" in the sense above, and I want to conclude that $\tilde f$ is the desired (continuous) lifting.","['homotopy-theory', 'continuity', 'covering-spaces', 'general-topology']"

1352264,An algorithm for filling a moving truck,"I was recently helping a friend move. I stood in the moving truck as other people brought boxes and furniture pieces from inside the house. My job was to arrange these items in an efficient way inside the truck. I had no idea what the size or shape of the next object would be. But as more objects came, I had a rough idea of the average shape and size of the boxes and containers in the house, and I could develop an expected size and shape for the next object. I wonder, is there an algorithm for this type of problem. Formally, I think the problem would be worded like this: Let $X$ be a set of $m$-dimensional geometric objects of unknown size and shape, and let $S\subset\mathbb R^m$ be bounded. Suppose that $n-1$ objects are randomly selected from $X$, and arranged in a non-overlapping manner in $S$. Suppose that an $n^\text{th}$ object is randomly selected from $X$ (so that this object's size and shape are now known). What is the optimal way to place this object in $S$ so that as many randomly selected objects from $X$ may be placed in $S$ as possible in the future? If this problem is far too general, it may be assumed that all of the geometric objects are rectangular prisms, and that $m=3$. I am not familiar with solving this type of problem. Is there a theorem, algorithm, or technique which relates to this situation?","['geometry', 'packing-problem', 'algorithms']"

(A) $\{f_n(x)\} $ converges pointwise to a function $f$ on $[0,\infty)$ but does not converge uniformly on $[0,\infty)$. (B) $\{f_n(x)\} $ does not converge pointwise to any function on $[0,\infty)$. (C) $\{f_n(x)\} $ converges uniformly on $[0,1]$. (D)  $\{f_n(x)\} $ converges uniformly on $[0,\infty)$. I found that, $$f_n(x)=\frac{1}{2}\left[x-\frac{1}{2}\sin(x+1/n)+\frac{1}{2}\sin(1/n)\right].$$ So, $f(x)=\lim_{n}f_n(x)=\frac{x}{2}-\frac{1}{4}\sin x$. Now, $|f_n(x)-f(x)|\le 3/4$. So, by M-test, $f_n(x)$ is not uniformly convergent, but point-wise convergent. So option (A) is correct..Am I right??","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'uniform-convergence']"

1352632,Change from one cartesian co-ordinate system to another by translation and rotation.,"There are two reasons for me to ask this question: I want to know if my understanding on this issue is correct. To clarify a doubt I have. I want to change the co-ordinate system of a set of points (Old cartesian coordinates system to New cartesian co-ordinate system). This transformation will involve Translation as well as Rotation. This is what I plan to do: (Kindly refer to the image attached here ) With respect to this image I have a set of points which are in the XYZ coordinate system (Red). I want to change it with respect to the axes UVW (Purple). In order to do so, I have understood that there are two steps involved: Translation and Rotation. When I translate, I only change the origin. (say, I want the UVW origin at (5,6,7). Then, for all points in my data, the x co-ordinates will be subtracted by 5, y by 6 and z by 7. By doing so. I get a set of Translated data.) Now I have to apply a rotation transform (on the Translated data). The Rotation matrix is shown in the image. The values Ux, Uy and Uz are the co-ordinates of a point on the U axis which has unit distance from origin. Similarly, the values Vx, Vy and Vz are the coordinates of a point on the V axis which has a unit distance from origin. (I want to know if I am right here.) Given this information, how can I calculate the value of Wx, Wy and Wx (a point lying on the W axis with unit distance from the origin)? I will know the co-ordinates of the origin {Obviously, (0,0,0), and I have the co-ordinates of points lying at unit distance from origin on the U and V axes. Also, U, V an W are orthonormal.} How can I calculate the 3rd row of rotation matrix R? Is my approach correct? My ultimate goal is to transform the co-ordinate system. I can calculate points on the U and V axes, but not on the W axis. Keeping this in mind, please provide me with inputs. (As far as I know, with the Point U (Ux, Uy, Uz), Point V (Vx, Vy and Vz) and the origin, I can define a plane. With this, I can find a point which is at unit distance from (0, 0, 0) in a direction along the plane's normal. How should I do this?)

Show that such a function $f$ cannot exist. The exercise is taken from Apostol Calculus Vol. 2. I am a beginner in the subject so I want to ensure that my arguments and understanding are absolutely clear. Here is my solution: By definition, $$f'(a;y)=\lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{f(a+hy)-f(a)}{h}$$ and by assumption, as $f'(a;y)>0$ , we have $$\lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{f(a+hy)-f(a)}{h}>0$$ Taking $-y$ instead of $y$ we have $f'(a;-y)>0$ by assumption, hence, $$\lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{f(a-hy)-f(a)}{h}>0$$ . Taking $t=-h$ and noting that $h\to0$ implies $t\to0$ , we can say that $$\lim_{t\to0}\dfrac{f(a+ty)-f(a)}{-t}>0\implies \lim_{t\to0}\dfrac{f(a+ty)-f(a)}{t}<0\implies f'(a;y)<0$$ which is an obvious contradiction.

I'm confused about the case when one equation can be represented by some linear combination of other equations in the systems. This would make it dependent and can be removed without affecting the solution, but I can't wrap my head around why the process of, for example, adding two equations together results in a dependent equation.

Let $I\subset \mathbb{C}[x_1,...,x_n]$ be an ideal such that for each $i$, some power $x_i^{m_i}\in \left\langle \text{LT}(I) \right\rangle$. Show that the number of points of $V(I)$ is at most $m_1m_2...m_n$. The notation $\left\langle \text{LT}(I) \right\rangle$ means the ideal generated by the leading terms of polynomials in $I$. Hint : Use the following two facts: $k[x_1,...,x_n]/I$ is isomorphic as a $k$-vector space to $S=\text{span}(x^{\alpha}: x^{\alpha}\notin \left\langle \text{LT}(I) \right\rangle)$; Let $G$ be a Groebner basis for $I$. Then with the assumption in the problem, we know that there exists some $k_i\leq m_i$ such that $x_i^{k_i}=\text{LM}(g_i)$ for some $g_i\in G$. My attempt : The monomials in $S$ could only be $x_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots x_n^{\alpha_n}$ where $\alpha_i<m_i$. Consider $[x_i^j]$ in $\mathbb{C}[x_1,...,x_n]/I$ where $j=0,1,...,m_i$. They have to be linearly dependent. (I know this is wrong now.) So
$$\sum^{m_i}_{j=0}c_j[x_i^j]=\left[\sum^{m_i}_{j=0}c_jx_i^j\right]=[0]$$ Thus $$\sum^{m_i}_{j=0}c_jx_i^j\in I$$ Since this is a polynomial with degree $m_i$ in $\mathbb{C}[x_i]$, it has at most $m_i$ roots. This is true for each coordinate, so $V(I)$ contains at most $m_1\cdots m_n$ points. Question : This was my first attempt. Then I realized that $[x_i^j]$ do not have to be linearly dependent. One of them could depend on some other monomials with other variables. I still think I need to end up with one variable function and use the linear dependence to show the number of roots is bounded by $m_i$. But I couldn't find them. Or is there another approach?

Please can someone check my proof that I posted below? I had actually already solved the question! I was just wondering if anybody could write out a fully rigorous proof so I can check if mine works. Basically, the problem is easy if the order of $a$ is infinite, but in the case where the order of $a$ is finite, a bit more care needs to be taken. Anyway, here's how I did it: We will prove that $⟨a^{lcm(m,n)}⟩ = H$. Firstly, note that $a^{lcm(m,n)} \in G_1, G_2$ so $⟨a^{lcm(m,n)}⟩ \subseteq H$. Now assume $a^k \in H$. If $a$ has infinite order, $m|k$ and $n|k$, implying that $lcm(m,n)|k$, so $a^k \in ⟨a^{lcm(m,n)}⟩$. If $a$ has finite order, say $r$, then there exists an integer $x$ such that $r|k-mx$ as $a^k \in G_1$. Thus $gcd(m,r) | k$. Similarly $gcd(n,r) | k$. So $lcm(gcd(m,r), gcd(n,r))|k$. It is not hard to show that this big lcm expression equals $gcd(lcm(m,n), r)$, so $gcd(lcm(m,n), r) | k$. Now let $lcm(m,n)=dp, r=dq$ for coprime $p,q$. Then $d|k$ so write $k=de$ for an integer $e$. We would like to find an integer $s$ such that $r|k-slcm(m,n)$, but this is equivalent to $dq|de-sdp$ iff $q|e-sp$, and such $s$ can be found as $p,q$ are coprime! Hence $a^k \in ⟨a^{lcm(m,n)}⟩$ and we are done.

Since $B$ is a basis, $a$ has a $B$ basis representation $a=\sum_{v\in B}a_vv$, and since $V$ is a TVS for fixed $n$ there is a neighborhood $U'\subseteq K$ of zero such that all $n$-element sums from $U'$ are in $U$. Then since $f(b)_a=\sum_{\alpha\in B}\sum_{\beta\in B}a_\alpha b_\beta f(\beta)_{\alpha}$ is a finite sum, choosing $n\ge|\{\alpha\in B:a_\alpha\ne0\}||\{\beta\in B:b_\beta\ne0\}|$ we have $$\bigcap_{\alpha\in B:a_\alpha\ne0}\bigcap_{\beta\in B:b_\beta\ne0}\{f:a_\alpha b_\beta f(\beta)_{\alpha}\in U'\}\subseteq \{f:f(b)_a\in U\}.$$ Does either of (1) or (2) hold the claim of being the ""natural"" topology for $GL(V)$?

1352905,Understanding tensors,"Locally in a chart, a tensor field looks like $$T= T^{i_1,...i_n}_{j_1,...,j_m} dx^{j_1} \otimes...\otimes dx^{j_m} \otimes \partial_{i_1} \otimes ... \otimes \partial_{i_n},$$ where $T^{i_1,...i_n}_{j_1,...,j_m}$ are smooth functions. Now, I want to see that this is then a $C^{\infty}$ multilinear map  $T: \Omega_1(M) \times... \Omega_1(M) \times \Gamma(TM) \times... \times \Gamma(TM) \rightarrow C^{\infty}(M,\mathbb{R}).$ The converse direction is actually clear to me. Now assume we would plug in a vector field multiplied by a function in the first component of the local tensor field representation (which corresponds to a tensor $dx^{j_1}$, then there would be a term $dx^{j_1}(f \partial_i)$, since $\partial_i$ is a locally a basis of tangent spaces and $f$ is here a smooth function. Now, how is this $C^{\infty}$ linear? Or is this defined to be $f dx^{j_1}(\partial_i)$?  The thing is that I don't think so, i.e. $\partial_i$ is of course not(!) $C^{\infty}$ linear (as it is a derivative), so $\partial_{i_k}(f dx^{i})\neq f \partial_{i_k}(dx^{i})$ as far as I know. By the way: I know that $dx^i$ is just the dual basis element to $\partial_i$, but I don't get this $C^{\infty}$ linearity. Edit: Thinking about it, I feel as if a pointwise argument could save me here: $\partial_{i_k}(f dx^{i})|_p = \partial_{i_k}|_p(f(p)dx^{i}(p)) = f(p) \delta_{i_k,i}$ for all points $p \in M$. So it holds for the smooth function. Is this the trick? If so, then this notation is totally confusing in this case. But maybe somebody could still explain why the vector field $\partial_{i_k}$ does in this case not act on $f$, cause I still feel as if I have not understood what I am doing here.?","['differential-topology', 'analysis', 'differential-geometry', 'tensors']"

Then $K_2=K\backslash \cup_{i=1}^{2}\{\frac{1}{i}\}$ also. And we can proceed this process. It is clear that $\cap_{i=1}^{\infty}K_i=\{0\}$. It is clear that $0\in G_{\alpha}$ for some $\alpha$.

Then there are coefficients $a_i\in\mathfrak{a}$ such that $\phi^n+a_1\phi^{n-1}+\dots+a_n=0$. This theorem can be proved by using elementary linear algebra in the context of rings. As a corollary, we find the following two versions of Nakayama's Lemma: NAK1: Let $A$ be a commutative ring, $M$ a finitely generated $A$-module and $\mathfrak{a}\subseteq A$ an Ideal such that $\mathfrak{a}M=M$. Then there is an $x=1\mod\mathfrak{a}$ such that $xM=0$. Proof. One just sets $\phi=\operatorname{id}$ and plugs in $x=1+a_1+\dots+a_n$. It follows: NAK2: Let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module, $\mathfrak{a}$ an ideal contained in the Jacobson radical of $A$. Then $\mathfrak{a}M=M$ implies $M=0$. Proof. Indeed, $xM=0$ for an element $x\in 1+\mathfrak{a}\subseteq 1+J(A)$, which is a unit, hence $M=0$. However, one can prove Nakayama's Lemma avoiding linear algebra: Alternative proof of NAK2 : Let $u_1,\dots,u_n$ be a generating system of $M$. $u_n\in M=\mathfrak{a}M$, so $u_n=a_1u_1+\dots+a_nu_n$. Subtracting, $(1-a_n)u_n=a_1u_1+\dots+a_{n-1}u_{n-1}$. But $1-a_n$ is a unit, since $a_n\in J(A)$, hence $u_n\in\langle u_1,\dots,u_{n-1}\rangle$. Iterating, we see that all $u_i$ have been zero. Alternative proof of Nak1 : Let $S=1+\mathfrak{a}$. Then $S^{-1}\mathfrak{a}\subseteq J(S^{-1}A)$. If $M=\mathfrak{a}M$, then $S^{-1}M=S^{-1}(\mathfrak{a}M)=(S^{-1}\mathfrak{a})(S^{-1}M)$, thus Nak2 implies $S^{-1}M=0$. As $M$ is finitely generated, there is an $x\in S$ such that $xM=0$.

The multiplication of both matrices becomes y hat, which is theoretically supposed to be equal to y. We want to minimize the squared error given by this equation by changing w. w can be solved by a derivation of the function to w, and setting the equation to zero. The question is, what does it intuitively mean? I know that in derivative, we are trying to find the rate of change. BUT what does it mean the rate of change = 0 intuitively?",['derivatives']

1353471,"The covering map lifting property for simply connected, locally connected spaces","I wish to prove the following statement: Let $X$ be a simply connected and locally connected space, and let $p:Y\to Z$ be a covering map. Then given $f:X\to Z$ continuous, $x_0\in X$, $y_0\in Y$ such that $p(y_0)=f(x_0)$, there is a unique continuous function (a ""lift"") $\tilde f:X\to Y$ such that $p\circ\tilde f=f$ and $\tilde f(x_0)=y_0$. This question has gone through many iterations here on MSE. So far, I have shown that a lift is unique if it exists , and I have proven the theorem in the case $X=[0,1]$ and $X=[0,1]^2$ . This general version was also attempted but specialized to an incorrect lemma. Here is what I have so far: Define $\tilde f$ such that $\tilde f(x)=\tilde \phi(1)$ for any path $\phi:[0,1]\to X$ from $x_0$ to $x$ (where the lifting sets $\tilde\psi(0)=y_0$). To show that $\tilde f$ is well-defined, suppose that $\phi$ and $\psi$ are paths from $x_0$ to $x$. Then they are path-homotopic by simple connectedness, and the homotopy $h$ lifts to $\tilde h$; since $\tilde h(0,x)$ is a lift of $\phi$ and $\tilde h(1,x)$ is a lift of $\psi$, uniqueness of lifts implies $\tilde\phi(x)=\tilde h(0,x)$ and $\tilde\psi(x)=\tilde h(1,x)$, so $\tilde\phi$ and $\tilde\psi$ are path-homotopic and in particular have the same endpoint $\tilde\phi(1)=\tilde\psi(1)$. It is easy to check that $p\circ\tilde f=f$ and $\tilde f(x_0)=y_0$, and so the main remaining task is the proof that $\tilde f$ is continuous. ""Following my nose"" leads to the following proof skeleton: Take a point $x\in X$ and $\tilde f(x)\in U\subseteq Y$ open; we wish to show that there is a neighborhood $x\in V\subseteq X$ with $\tilde f[V]\subseteq U$. By the covering map property and since $f(x)=p(\tilde f(x))\in p[U]$ is open ($p$ is an open map), there is a neighborhood $f(x)\in A\subseteq p[U]$ that is evenly covered, so suppose that $W$ is the slice of $Y$ that contains $\tilde f(x)$, such that $p\restriction W$ is a homeomorphism onto $p[W]=A$. We also know that $X$ is locally connected, so there is an $x\in M\subseteq f^{-1}[A]$ that is open and connected. My guess is that $M$ is the desired open set, but I don't see how to make the connection. There is a puffy cloud at this point, but let's suppose that we could find a $V\ni x$ (probably $M$ or a subset) such that $\tilde f[V]\subseteq W$. Then since $V$ is a neighborhood of $x$ it is sufficient to show that $\tilde f\restriction V:V\to W$ is continuous in the subspace topology, which is to say $(f\restriction V)^{-1}[W']$ is open in $V$ for every open $W'\subseteq W$: \begin{align}
(\tilde f\restriction V)^{-1}[W']&=(\tilde f\restriction V)^{-1}[(p\restriction W)^{-1}[(p\restriction W)[W']]]\\
&=((p\restriction W)\circ(\tilde f\restriction V))^{-1}[(p\restriction W)[W']]\\
&=(p\circ(\tilde f\restriction V))^{-1}[(p\restriction W)[W']]\\
&=((p\circ \tilde f)\restriction V)^{-1}[(p\restriction W)[W']]\\
&=(f\restriction V)^{-1}[(p\restriction W)[W']].

One way (Method A) I thought could work is to do individual linear regression for each predictor and combine the linear models into one. However I don't really know how to combine them. One possible way is to use the correlation coefficient (r^2/sum of all r^2) as the weight for each predictor, but I don't know whether there's a better way. Another way (Method B) - I feel is better - is to use individual linear regression for the continuous variables, and just a mean/variance analysis for the discrete variables (like ANOVA), then combine the models using the some transform of the standard variation f(sigma) as the weight for each discrete variable, and f(r^2) as the weight for the continuous variable. Therefore, my questions are: If I use method B, what should be the f(sigma) and f(r^2)? (How should I combine the individual models?) Is there a better way?","['statistics', 'regression']"
1353498,Noncyclic Abelian Group of order 51,"The problem is to prove or disprove that there is a noncyclic abelian group of order $51$. I don't think such a group exists. Here is a brief outline of my proof: Assume for a contradiction that there exists a noncyclic abelian group of order $51$. We know that every element (except the identity) has order $3$ or $17$. Assume that $|a|=3$ and $|b|=17$. Then I managed to prove that the subgroups generated by $a$ and $b$ only intersect at the identity element, from which we can show that $ab$ is a generator of the whole group, so it is cyclic. Contradiction. So every element (except the identity) has the same order $p$, where $p$ is either $3$ or $17$. If $p=17$, take $a$ not equal to the identity, and take $b$ not in the subgroup generated by $a$. Then we can prove that $a^kb^l$ where $k,l$ are integers between $0$ and $16$ inclusive are distinct, hence the group has more than $51$ elements, contradiction. If $p=3$, take $a$ not equal to the identity and take $b$ not in the subgroup generated by $a$. Then we can prove that $a^kb^l$ where $k,l$ are integers betwen $0$ and $2$ inclusive are distinct. This subgroup has $9$ elements so we can find $c$ that's not of the form $a^kb^l$. Then we can prove that $a^kb^lc^m$ where $k,l,m$ are integers betwen $0$ and $2$ inclusive are distinct. Then this subgroup has $27$ elements so we can find $d$ that's not of the form $a^kb^lc^m$. Then we prove that $a^kb^lc^md^n$ where $k,l,m,n$ are integers between $0$ and $2$ inclusive are distinct, this being $81$ elements.

The set $X$ of all numbers of the form $2^{-n} + 5^{-m}$ where $m,n = 1,2,\ldots$ . Claim: The set of accumulation points is the following: $$\left\{\frac{1}{2^n}: n \in \mathbb{N} \right\} \cup \left\{\frac{1}{5^n}: n \in \mathbb{N}\right\} \cup \{0\}.$$ Let $n \in \Bbb{N}$ and $r>0$ , and consider the open neighbourhood $B\left(\frac{1}{2^n},r\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2^n} - r,\frac{1}{2^n} + r\right)$ . For the given $r$ we can find $m$ large enough such that $5^{-m} < r \implies \frac{1}{2^n} + \frac{1}{5^m} < \frac{1}{2^n} + r$ , and $\frac{1}{2^n} - \frac{1}{5^m} > \frac{1}{2^n} - r$ ; therefore $5^{-m} + 2^{-n} \in B\left(\frac{1}{2^n},r\right)$ . A similar argument shows that each element of $\{5^{-m}: m \in \mathbb{N}\} \cup \{0\}$ is an accumulation point of $X$ . Now consider $y \in X$ . $B(y,r)$ isn't a subset of $X$ since for all $r > 0$ , $B(y,r) \subset (\mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q}) \not\subset \Bbb{Q}$ , hence $B(y,r) \not\subset X$ .","['proof-verification', 'real-analysis', 'general-topology']"

1353575,Asymptotics in differential equations,"While learning about Bessel functions I've came up with the following argument: Since the Bessel equation is $$y''+\frac{1}{x} y'+ \left(1-\frac{\alpha^2}{x^2} \right) y=0, $$
  one might expect that in the limit $x \to \infty$ we have $y''+y \approx 0$, which is the equation modelling simple harmonic motion (aka linear combinations of sines and cosines) of period $2 \pi$. Thus, we should have $y \approx C_1 \cos x+ C_2 \sin x$ for large $x$. I'm aware that there is a branch of mathematics, called asymptotics (?) that deals with such ideas. Nonetheless I have several questions: How can you know what terms are to be omitted as $x$ gets large? perhaps $y'$ grows faster than $\frac{1}{x}$ decays (so that the middle term cannot be omitted). Looking at the graph of the Bessel function $J_0(x)$ one can see that the amplitude of the oscillation decays. Is there a way to predict that, and know the rate at which $C_1,C_2$ decay? In general, is there a rigorous statement of the form: If $y' \approx G(x,y)$ is an approximation of the differential equation $y'=F(x,y)$ at the point $x_0$, with a solution $y=\varphi$, then the original equation has a solution $y$ which is $\approx \varphi$ near $x_0$?

\xi T = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \\
