1141224,McLain's characteristically simple group,"Given a field $\mathbb{F}$, one can construct the free $\mathbb{F}$-module over the set of rational numbers.  Assume that $(v_x)_{x \in \mathbb{Q}}$ is a basis of this linear space (indexed by the rational numbers). For each pair of rational numbers $x <y$ consider $e_{xy}$ the linear transformation that maps $v_x$ to $v_y$, and maps the other elements of the basis to $0$. Now we define the McLain group $M=\operatorname{M}(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{F})$ to be the group generated by all the linear transformations of the form $1+ae_{xy}$ , $x<y$ and $a \in \mathbb{F}$ (note that all of these transformations are invertible). A description of such a group is in  Robinson's ""A course in the Theory of Groups"", 12.1.9 or in the paper of Philip Hall or in the original work of McLain or in Robinson's ``Finiteness Conditions and Generalized Soluble Groups'', Vol. 2, p.14. I was trying to prove that the McLain group is directly
  indecomposable, but I cannot succeed. Let's say that $M=H\times K$ ($H$ and $K$ both non-trivial and normal subgroups of $M$) with $[H,\, K]=1$, I know that in each normal subgroup one can find a generator $1+ae_{xy}$ but I cannot see how to relate these two normal subgroups. Any idea will be appreciated. Note that the fact that $M$ is directly indecomposable is just a guess of mine, so I can be wrong.","['examples-counterexamples', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
1141235,Area of ellipse not in xy-plane,"I've got a problem in which I'm trying to find the area of an ellipse which is given by the intersection of an elliptic cylinder with a plane. Nothing here is parallel to the coordinate axes, which is making it kind of annoying to work with. The plane is given by the equation $x+ay+a^2z=0$, and the cylinder is given by $(x-a^2z)^2-a(x-a^2z)(y-az)+a^2(y-az)^2=L^2$. I can think of some complicated ways to do it with integrals, and I'm wondering if there's something simpler that I'm missing. If I could transform into some coordinates in the plane I'm trying to work with, and I knew that the coordinate transformation would preserve areas, then I would be good, because I know how to get the area of an ellipse in the form $Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2=1$. I'm really not sure how to do this transformation, though, and whether this is even the best way to proceed. Maybe I should be using Langrange multipliers with two constraints to just obtain the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes? That sounds like a pain, but doable. At least we're centered at the origin. Thanks in advance for any assistance. Edit: If I take $u=(x-a^2z)$ and $v=(y-az)$, then my cylinder becomes $u^2-auv+a^2v^2=L^2$, which is pretty great, but then I've basically cut the cylinder with a plane parallel to $z=0$. In that case, my given plane becomes $u+av+3a^2z=0$, and I'm not sure how that's helpful.","['analytic-geometry', 'multivariable-calculus', 'conic-sections']"
1141238,When a set of consecutive numbers can be covered by differences between distinct integers?,"I will start with an example. Suppose that I would like to cover the set $\{1,2,3\}$ by differences between three integers $m_1,\ m_2$ and $m_3$ in the following sense:
$$
\{1,2,3\}=\{m_2-m_1,m_3-m_2,m_3-m_1\}.
$$
This is possible by taking $m_1=1,m_2=2$ and $m_3=4$. I take another example: the equality
$$
\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}=\{m_2-m_1,m_3-m_1,m_3-m_2,m_4-m_1,m_4-m_2,m_4-m_3\}
$$
is satisfied for $m_1=1,m_2=2,m_3=5,m_4=7$. Now I can formulate the problem to which, hopefully, someone can help me to arrive to the solution: (a) Find the set of all positive integers $n\ge 2$ (or, at least, an infinite subset) for which there exist integers $m_1,\dots,m_n$ such that 
$$
\{m_j-m_i\}_{1\le i<j\le n}=\Bigl\{1,2,\dots,\frac{(n-1)n}{2}\Bigr\}.
$$ . As regarding the case $n=5$, I was able to prove that it is not possible to find a sequence of $5$ integers such that their differences cover the set $\{1,2,\dots,10\}$. It turns out that in this case the best possible scenario is to cover the set from $1$ to $11$ in which $6$ is missing:
$$
\{1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11\}=\{m_j-m_i\}_{1\le i<j\le 5}.
$$
A solution here is: $m_1=1,m_2=2,m_3=5,m_4=10,m_5=12$. This last remark led to the second question: (b) For each $n\ge 2$ find an increasing finite sequence $m_1,\dots,m_n$ of integers such that the set $\{m_j-m_i\}_{1\le i<j\le n}$ has $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ elements (the differences are distinct) and $m_n-m_1$ is minim. I realize that these problems can be very difficult. I will be satisfied with partial solutions or, at least, ideas on how to proceed.

1141247,Is $\Bbb Q$ homeomorphic to $\Bbb Q^2$? [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Why this two spaces do not homeomorphic? (1 answer) Closed 9 years ago . It's an easy excercise in set theory to exhibit a bijection $\Bbb Q \cong \Bbb Q\times \Bbb Q$. However, none of the bijections I'm aware of respect the topologies on $\Bbb Q$ and $\Bbb Q^2$, inherited from their respective embeddings into $\Bbb R$ and $\Bbb R^2$. Therefore, I'm asking whether there exists a homeomorphism $\phi: \Bbb Q^2 \to \Bbb Q$. I don't believe that there is any such map, but since the standard techniques of algebraic topology don't enable one to discern between $\Bbb Q$ and a discrete space, I wasn't able to prove it. Maybe Cech cohomology provides a means to attack this problem, but I haven't even got the slightest Iiea how to calculate $H^1(\Bbb Q,\Bbb Z)$.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'rational-numbers']"

1141296,The expected time until reaching a specified set in a Markov chain,"I am reading an article in which they discuss a specific Markov chain in an example, and it turns out I need to sharpen up my Markov knowledge. First the setup. I have a continuous time Markov chain $(Y(t))_{t\geq 0}$ with discrete state space $S$. I have some subset $B\subset S$, and I have a point $x_0\not\in B$, such that the chain $Y$ starts at $x_0$. Let $0\leq T_1\leq T_2\leq\cdots$ be the jump times of this Markov chain, and let $T_0=0$. Define the discrete skeleton Markov chain $(X_j)_{j\in\mathbb{N}}$ by $X_j=Y(T_j)$, and define then the stopping time $\tau_B$ by
$$\tau_B = \inf\{j>0\ |\ X_j\in B\},$$
so that $\tau_B$ is the first index of $X$ for which $X$ enters the set $B$. Define also the time $\widetilde{\tau}_B$ until we reach the set $B$ as
$$\widetilde{\tau}_B = \sum_{j=0}^{\tau_B-1}(T_{j+1}-T_j) = T_{\tau_B}.$$
Now, let $\Delta_j = \mathbb{E}[T_{j+1}-T_j|X_j]$, so that $\Delta_j$ is the expected time in state $X_j$. Notice that this is a random variable. My first question is the following. The article notes that $\Delta_j$ is the inverse of the jump rate out of the state $X_j$, but I don't know what this means. Perhaps if $T_{j+1}-T_j|X_j=x$ has an exponential distribution with distribution function $F(t) = 1-\exp{(-\lambda_x)}$, I get something that has mean value equal to $\frac{1}{\lambda_x}$, and if $\lambda_x$ qualifies as the ""jump rate"", I guess I am done. But what is really the jump rate of a Markov chain, and why (if true) is the difference $T_{j+1}-T_j$ exponentially distributed given $X_j$? Do I need extra assumptions on the chain for this to be true? Furthermore, the article gives the following expression for the mean value until first reaching $B$:
$$\mathbb{E}[\widetilde{\tau}_B]=\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{j=0}^{\tau_B-1}\Delta_j\right].$$
My second question is, how did this equality occur?
My thoughts so far are:
$$\mathbb{E}[\widetilde{\tau}_B] = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{j=0}^{\tau_B-1}T_{j+1}-T_j\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{j=0}^{\tau_B-1}T_{j+1}-T_j\ |\ X_0,X_1,\ldots,X_{\tau_B}\right]\right].$$ Since $\tau_B$ is determined by the chain up until time $\tau_B$, I can move the sum outside of the inner expectation, so that
$$\mathbb{E}\left[\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{j=0}^{\tau_B-1}T_{j+1}-T_j\ |\ X_0,X_1,\ldots,X_{\tau_B}\right]\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{j=0}^{\tau_B-1}\mathbb{E}\left[T_{j+1}-T_j\ |\ X_0,X_1,\ldots,X_{\tau_B}\right]\right].$$
Now, if I could remove every step of the chain except for the $j$th one in this last expression, I would be done. Can I do this, and why? I can probably remove the past steps $X_0,X_1,\ldots,X_{j-1}$ (why? this is not precisely the Markov condition), but can I also remove the future steps $X_{j+1},\ldots$? EDIT: It is example 1 on page 3 of this article: http://www.irisa.fr/armor/Rare/Publis/split.pdf Best regards.","['probability-theory', 'markov-chains', 'markov-process', 'stopping-times']"
1141300,Monotone Class Theorem for Functions,"Suppose $\mathcal F$ is a collection of real-valued functions on $X$ such that the constant functions are in $\mathcal F$ and $f + g$, $fg$, and $cf$ are in $\mathcal F$ whenever $f, g \in \mathcal F$ and $c \in \mathbb R$. Suppose $f \in \mathcal F$ whenever $f_n \to f$ and each $f_n \in \mathcal F$. Define the function $$\textbf1_A(x) = \begin{cases} 1, & x \in A;\\ 0, & x \notin A. \end{cases}$$ Prove that $\mathcal A = \{A \subseteq X : \textbf 1_A \in \mathcal F\}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. I have the following result at my disposal: Monotone Class Theorem : Suppose $\mathcal A_0$ is an algebra, $\mathcal A$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal A_0$, and $\mathcal M$ is the smallest monotone class containing $\mathcal A_0$. Then $\mathcal M = \mathcal A$. Notes : here are some observations I've made: $\emptyset \in \mathcal A$ since $\textbf 1_\emptyset = 0$ is constant and $\mathcal F$ contains all constant functions, similarly $X \in \mathcal A$. If $A \in \mathcal A$, then $\textbf 1_A \in \mathcal F$; notice that $1 - \textbf 1_A = \textbf 1_{A^c} \in \mathcal F$ since finite sums are of elements in $\mathcal F$ are in $\mathcal F$, hence $A^c \in \mathcal A$. Let $A_1, A_2 \in \mathcal A$, then $\textbf 1_{A_1}, \textbf 1_{A_2} \in \mathcal F$. Observe that $\textbf 1_{A_1 \cap A_2} = \textbf 1_{A_1} \cdot \textbf 1_{A_2} \in \mathcal F$. By mathematical induction if $A_1, \ldots, A_n \in \mathcal A$, then $\bigcap_{i = 1}^n A_i \in \mathcal A$. Since we have finite intersections and complements, we get finite unions: $\bigcup_{i = 1}^n A_i \in \mathcal A$. So $\mathcal A$ is an algebra. At this point we can choose to make $\mathcal A_0 := \mathcal A$ our algebra. The problem with showing the result directly comes down to showing if $A_i \in \mathcal A$, then $\bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty A_i \in \mathcal A$. I'm guessing I want to show that $\mathcal M := \mathcal A_0$ is a monotone class. Once we've done this, since $\mathcal A_0 = \mathcal M$, $\mathcal M$ is obviously the smallest monotone class containing $\mathcal A_0$. By the monotone class theorem $\mathcal M = \sigma(\mathcal A_0)$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, correct? ( Question 1 ) So let's try to show that $\mathcal M$ is a monotone class. Let $A_k \in \mathcal M$ with $A_k \nearrow A$. In particular, we have that $A_1 \subseteq A_2 \subseteq \cdots$ and $A := \bigcup_{k = 1}^\infty A_k$. Observe that (by hypothesis), $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \textbf 1_{A_n} = \textbf 1_{\bigcup_{k = 1}^\infty A_k}$$ and hence $\bigcup_{k = 1}^\infty A_k \in \mathcal A$. Is this step valid? It seems obvious, but I'm not sure if I've made an assumption here that I shouldn't have ( Question 2 ) Let $A_k \in \mathcal M$ with $A_k \searrow A$. In particular, we have that $A_1 \supseteq A_2 \supseteq \cdots$ and $A := \bigcap_{k = 1}^\infty A_k$. Observe that (by hypothesis) $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \textbf 1_{A_n} = \textbf 1_{\bigcap_{k = 1}^\infty A_k}$$ and hence $\bigcap_{k = 1}^\infty A_k \in \mathcal A$. If the reasoning in the above two steps is valid about the limit being correct, then can I skip having to use the monotone class theorem and just observe the following? ( Question 3 ) Let $A_k \in \mathcal A$, then $\textbf 1_{A_k} \in \mathcal F$. Define $B_n = \bigcup_{k = 1}^n A_k \in \mathcal A$ since we've already established that it is an algebra and algebras have finite unions. Define $f_n = \textbf 1_{B_n}$ and notice that $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \textbf 1_{B_n} = \textbf 1_{\cup_{k = 1}^\infty A_k} \in \mathcal F$ by hypothesis. Hence $\bigcup_{k = 1}^\infty A_k \in \mathcal A$. Conclude by definition that $\mathcal A$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. If my reasoning fails somewhere, I would appreciate any hints/full proofs that establish the result using the monotone class theorem, if just because I feel I lack understanding of how to use it and I think this is a good example where it's usable.","['monotone-class-theorem', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

1141342,Lie Subgroup Example - Explanation?,"I'm currently working through Jeff Lee's 'Manifolds and Differential Geometry'. He defines a Lie Subgroup, $H$, to be an abstract subgroup of a Lie Group $G$, such that the inclusion map $H\hookrightarrow G$ is an immersion. He then lists an example of a Lie Subgroup which I am trying to understand. Defining $S^1$ to be the unit circle in $\mathbb{C}$, he writes: 'The image in the torus $T^2=S^1\times S^1$ of the map $\mathbb{R}\rightarrow S^1\times S^1$ given by $t\mapsto (e^{2\pi i t},e^{2\pi i a t})$ is a Lie Subgroup. This map is a homomorphism. If $a$ is rational, then the image is an embedded copy of $S^1$ wrapped around the torus several times depending on $a$. If $a$ is irrational, then the image is still a Lie subgroup but it is now dense in $T^2$. I am struggling to understand this example at all. I can see why the map is a homomorphism, but I do not understand his argument about the rationality/irrationality of $a$. I also wouldn't know how to show the image of the map is a Lie subgroup.

 Let $a$ be any even integer

My approach: Since there are $n$ number of males and $n$ number of females, there are $2n$ number of people in total. If I seat them around a circular table, I can choose to first sit a male or a female, and sit last the sex that did not sit first (i.e. for $n=2$ I can order them as $m_{1},f_{1},m_{2},f_{2}$ or $f_{1},m_{1},f_{2},m_{2}$, where $m$ is a male, $f$ is a female). If I count the way people could be chosen from one way (CW or CCW), by the multiplication principle there are $n$ ways to select the first person of one sex and $n$ ways to select the first person of the other sex, then $(n-1)^2$ to select the second people of both sexes, then $(n-1)^3$ to select the the third people of both sexes, all the way to the last people $(n-(n-1))^2$. So there are $n^2*(n-1)^2*(n-2)^2*...*(n-(n-1))^2$ ways. Since there are $n$ similar linear arrangements that could be obtained from rotation, there are

It doesn't seem to be the best basis for, you know, pricing exotic vehicles that are worth in the millions (or billions) that a formula for variance is used ""because the maths is better"".

1142206,Finite groups with nontrivial outer automorphisms,"Let $G$ be a finite group whose center $Z(G)$ is trivial. Suppose that the group $\text{Out}(G)$ of outer automorphisms is nontrivial. Question: Does there always exist an $f \in \text{Aut}(G)$ and a $g \in G$ such that $g$ and $f(g)$ do not lie in the same conjugacy class? This question can be reformulated in the following way. The automorphism group $\text{Aut}(G)$ acts on the set of conjugacy classes of $G$. As the inner automorphism group $\text{Inn}(G)$ acts trivially on this set, the action descends to the quotient $\text{Out}(G)$. With the same assumptions as above, the question then becomes: Question: Is the action of $\text{Out}(G)$ on the set of conjugacy classes always nontrivial? Remark: I restrict myself to the case that $G$ is centerless because this case is of main importance to me. I am not sure though whether there is an easy answer or counterexample to the question in the case that we do not assume $G$ to be centerless. What I've got so far: the question is positive for the symmetric group $S_{n}$ on $n$ letters for all $n \geq 3$. Indeed, only for $n = 6$ there exists an outer automorphism and this automorphism interchanges the conjugacy class of a cycle of cycle type $(ab)$ and the conjugacy class of a cycle of cycle type $(cd)(ef)(gh)$.

1142451,Compact Operators: Weak Convergence [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Compact operator maps weakly convergent sequences into strongly convergent sequences (2 answers) Closed 9 years ago . Problem Given Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$. Consider a compact operator $C\in\mathcal{C}(X,Y)$. Then weak convergence is turned into strong convergence:
$$x_n\rightharpoonup x\implies Cx_n\to Cx$$
I'd like to try proving it but would need some hints. Attempt Denote the sup-norm by:
$$F:\Omega\to E:\quad\|F\|_\Omega:=\sup_{\omega\in\Omega}\|F(\omega)\|_E$$ Weak convergence is preserved under continuous operators:
$$\|l(Cx_n-Cx)\|=\|(C'l)(x_n-x)\|\to0$$
By uniform boundedness principle weak convergence implies boundedness:
$$x_n\rightharpoonup x:\quad\|l(x)\|_\mathbb{N}<\infty\implies\|x\|_\mathbb{N}<\infty$$
Hence one can exploit compactness of the operator:
$$(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\text{ bounded}\implies C(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\text{ precompact}$$

And the smallest non-Abelian group $S_3$ cannot be the product of its (normal) subgroup $A_3$ and the quotient $\mathbb{Z}_2$. Also, it follows from the structure theorem for finitely generated Abelian groups that cyclic groups with order a power of a prime do not allow any non-trivial decomposition.
It is also not difficult to see that $\mathbb Z$ is not decomposable, i.e., expressible as the product of two proper non-trivial subgroups. These two facts together with the full force of the structure theorem tells us precisely which finitely generated Abelian groups are decomposable, and also enables us to list all the decompositions.

What is the exact relationship between $$\Gamma (E)\otimes \Gamma (B) $$ and  $$\Gamma(E\otimes B) $$ Are they the same spaces, or if not, are they at least isomorphic to one another?","['fiber-bundles', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"
1142790,Prove $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ is smooth (infinitely differentiable).,"I have never proved that a function is smooth (infinitely differentiable) before.  The only function that comes to mind which is smooth is $g(x) = e^{x}$, because it is defined on all of $\Bbb R$, continuous everywhere, and once you prove that $g'(x) = e^{x}$, you are done in showing that it is infinitely differentiable, i.e., smooth. How would I prove that the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ is smooth everywhere except at $0$?  It's not hard to show that the derivative at each $x \neq 0$ of $f$ is $-\frac{1}{x^{2}}$.  So, I have that the first derivative exists.  How do I go about showing that derivatives of all orders exist?","['derivatives', 'real-analysis']"
1142833,Reference request: Good lower division ODE textbook that combines with linear algebra?,"I am taking an ODE course and the prof kept on making references to linear algebra. However my book (Dennis G Zill - Intro to Differential Equations) only contains algorithms to compute different solutions to ODE. I cannot see the differential equation-linear algebra connection so I kept on coming here to ask stupid questions as to how the basis in linear algebra is similar to that of a basis for a function, so and so forth. There are so many important theorems in linear algebra, but how it extends to function is totally not clear for me. If you know a textbook that somehow works the rank-nullity theorem for vectors and matrices into those of functions then I would be very happy!

1142867,"In $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\forall B$, Borel set, there exists an disjoint countable open balls covering $B$?","I know it is true that on the real line that  $\forall B$, Borel measurable set with finite measure, $\forall \varepsilon>0$ there exists  disjoint countable open balls $B_i$ cover $B$ with 
$$   \mu (\cup B_i)\leq \mu(B)+\varepsilon ,$$ where $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure. This is proven by first noting that we have $U$ open, $B\subset U$ and 
$$\mu(U)\leq \mu(B)+\varepsilon.$$ Then using the fact that on the real line, we could decompose every open set to countable disjoint open intervals(balls). Would the same hold for $\mathbb{R}^n,n\geq 2$?","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"
1142891,Geometric representation of $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$,"I was wondering what would the quoteint group $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$ look like geometrically ? Any two elements in this group will be related only if their difference is an integer. I was reading about the geometry of a torus, wherein it was stated that $\mathbb R^n/\mathbb Z^n$ was equivalent to a torus in n-dimension, so i was thinking that $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$ should probably be a circle,but if that is correct how would i get that kind of a construction?","['geometry', 'abstract-algebra']"

Show for prime numbers,  $p \equiv 1$ mod $(N!)$ that none of the numbers $1,2,...,N$ are primitive roots modulo $p$ I can't figure out where to start with this question, all I can think to use is the Legendre symbol and Euler's Criterion but I haven't been able to do it. Any help would be much appreciated.","['primitive-roots', 'number-theory']"
