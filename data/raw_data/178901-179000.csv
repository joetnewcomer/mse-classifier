3243142,$G$ is a non-abelian group of order 6 $ \implies G \approx S_3 $. Simpler proof?,"I've seen some proofs of this fact but they seemed more complicated than necessary, so I've tried to come up with my own, which is hopefully simpler. Can you kindly tell me if it's correct? Proof. $G$ cannot have an element of order 6, else it would be cyclic and thus abelian. So the elements of $G$ different from $e$ can only have order 3 or 2. If all $g \in G$ have order 2 then $G$ is abelian, so there must be at least one element $a \in G$ of order 3. The subgroup $H= \langle a \rangle$ is normal in $G$ because its index is 2. $G/H$ is a cyclic group of order 2. Let $b \not \in H$ . We have $(bH)^2=H \implies b^2 \in H$ . If $o(b)=3$ , then $ b=b^4=b^2b^2 \in H$ , a contradiction. So we must conclude that every $g \in bH$ has order 2. We have $G= H \cup bH = \{e, a, a^2, b, ba, ba^2 \}$ .  Moreover, $ab \in Hb = bH$ so $(ab)^2=e$ . Then $ab=b^{-1}a^{-1}=ba^2$ , which is exactly the relation in $S_3$ . $\square$","['group-isomorphism', 'proof-verification', 'finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"
3243157,Equivalence class in X as a subset of $\mathscr P(X)$,"Due to Halmos: There is no standard notation for the equivalence class of $x$ with
  respect to $R$ ; we shall usually denote it by $x/R$ , and we shall
  write $X/R$ for the set of all equivalence classes $\ldots$ Exercise: show that $X/R$ is indeed a set by exhibiting a condition
  that specifies exactly the subset $X/R$ of the power set $\mathscr
P(X)$ . ~P. R. Halmos, Naive Set Theory (p. 28) EDIT: Taking the answers I've received thus far, here's what I'm currently working with. Let $X$ be a set, and let $R$ be an equivalence relation in $X$ . Then $x/R$ (or $[x]$ if you prefer) is a set comprising the elements $y$ such that $(x, y) \in R$ . Each such equivalence class for each element $x \in X$ is a subset of $X$ and therefore a member of $\mathscr P(X)$ . This in turn means that $X/R$ , the set of all $x/R$ for our given $X$ and our given equivalence $R$ , is a set of subsets of $X$ , making it a subset of $\mathscr P(X)$ . Now, I've worked through two examples: If we let $X = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and let $R$ be the relation of equality in $X$ , then $X/R = \{\{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{4\}\}$ . This is a subset of $\mathscr P(X)$ as expected. If we let $X = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and let $R$ be the cartesian product $X \times X$ , then $X/R = \{\{1, 2, 3\}\}$ , which is a subset of $\mathscr P(X)$ as expected. As for how one can come up with a general specification that achieves both of these results: $$X/R = \{S \in \mathscr P(X): (s \in S) \iff ([t \in S] \land [s \space R \space t]) \}$$ Or, in English, the set of equivalence classes in $X$ with respect to a given relation $R$ is the set of all sets $S$ in the power set of $X$ for which an element $s$ is only in $S$ if there is also $t$ in $S$ and $s$ and $t$ stand in equivalence to one another. This strikes me as a massive cop out, but I'm stuck on how to take it more primitive.","['elementary-set-theory', 'equivalence-relations']"

3243196,Lottery - Probability,"Looking over Canada's Western Lotto Max and Daily Grand lottery probabilities, a combinations calculator shows the actual chance of getting 7/7 with 50 numbers is 1 in 99,884,400. However, that's if you only had 1 selection per ticket. Since there are 3 selections per ticket, their website accurately shows the chance is 3 times better (99,884,400/3 = 33,294,800). There are also 14 additional draws to the main draw where you must match 7/7 for another chance to win a jackpot. Their website shows that winning 1 of the 14 additional draws has an equal chance of 1 in 33,294,800 just as the main draw. Now, this is where my question comes in: aren't the odds of winning the jackpot of 7/7 actually better than 1 in 33,294,800 considering there is more than 1 jackpot of 7/7? With 15 draws (1 main draw + 14 additional draws), aren't the odds of winning 7/7 for any 1 of the 15 draws actually 1 in 2,219,653 (33,294,800/15)? The odds should be 1 in 33,294,800 if there was only one main draw, but with 14 additional draws, it seems like the number is wrong. Also, the Daily Grand lottery shows that winning 5/5 from a range of 49 numbers per one ticket has a chance of 1 in 2,224,698. However, the combinations calculator shows the real chance is 1 in 1,906,884. It seems that matching 5/5 has a higher probability than what is shown on the official lottery website. While their website is correct that matching a specific 7/7 combination has a chance of 1 in 33,294,800 - my question is whether matching 7/7 for any 1 of the 15 main draws has a probability of 1 in 2,219,653 (33,294,800/15) versus 1 in 33,294,800? Since it doesn't matter which of the 15 specific combinations you match, any 1 of the 15 has a better chance than the website claims, am I right?",['probability']
3243209,"Is there a notion of ""localization morphism"" of schemes?","Let $A$ be a ring and $S\subseteq A$ a multiplicative system. Then the localization homomorphism of rings $\phi:A\to S^{-1}A$ induces a morphism between the spectra: $f=\mathrm{Spec}(\phi):\mathrm{Spec}(S^{-1}A)\to\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ . Is there a property of scheme morphisms $f:X\to Y$ that captures the
  idea that $f$ locally looks like the Spec of a localization
  homomorphism of rings? Does this have a name? Interesting properties/characterizations?

3243228,Simple Lie Algebra + $Z(G) = \{1\}$ $\Rightarrow$ Simple Lie Group.,"Let $G$ be a connected Lie Group ( $\mathrm{dim}G>1$ ) such that $Z(G) = \{1\}$ (center of $G$ ) and $\mathrm{Lie}(G) = \mathfrak g$ is a simple Lie Algebra. How do I prove that these conditions imply $G$ simple (as a group)? Can anyone help me? Some Ideas If $H< G$ is a normal group of $G$ , then $\overline{H}$ is a Lie Group (since $\overline{H}$ is closed), then $\mathrm{Lie}\left(\overline{H}\right)$ is a ideal of $\mathfrak{g}$ , implying $\mathrm{Lie}\left(\overline{H}\right) = \{0\}$ or $\mathrm{Lie}\left(\overline{H}\right) = \mathfrak{g}$ , if $\mathrm{Lie}\left(\overline{H}\right) = \{0\}$ then $H$ is discrete normal set $\Rightarrow$ $H\subset Z(G) = \{1\}$ . On the other hand, if $\mathrm{Lie}\left(\overline{H}\right) = \mathfrak{g}$ , $H$ is dense in $G$ , and I don't know how to proceed. Moreover, since $\mathfrak{g}$ is simple $\mathfrak g' = [\mathfrak g,\mathfrak g] =g$ , which implies $G' = [G,G] = G$ , then \begin{align*}
\det \mathrm{Ad}(g) &= \det \mathrm{Ad}([g_1,h_1]\cdot \ldots \cdot[g_k,n_k])\\ 
&=[\det(\mathrm{Ad}(g_1),\det\mathrm{Ad}(h_1)]\cdot \ldots\cdot[\det(\mathrm{Ad}(g_k),\det \mathrm{Ad}(h_k)]\\
&= 1\cdot\ldots\cdot 1 = 1,
\end{align*} then $\det \mathrm{Ad}(g)=1$ , $\forall$ $g\in G$ . Note $$\rho : G\to SL(n,\mathbb{R}) $$ $$g\mapsto \mathrm{Ad}(g) $$ is a homomorphism such that $\mathrm{Ker}(\mathrm{Ad})= Z(G)={1}$ . Then $\rho$ is a embedding in of $G$ in $SL(n,\mathbb{R})$ , however I do not know, again, how to proceed. Finally, if $G$ is simply connected then $H$ normal and connected $\Rightarrow$ $H$ closed $\Rightarrow$ $H$ is lie group $\Rightarrow$ $\mathrm{Lie}(H)$ is a ideal of $\mathfrak{g}$ , then $H=\{1\}$ or $H = G$ (using the same argument of the beginning). If $G$ is not simply connected I don't know what to do.","['lie-algebras', 'haar-measure', 'differential-topology', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"

Is $S$ differentiable with respect to $\rho$ ? The answer to this seems to be yes (see for example the question here and links therein) and is given as $S'(\rho) = I + \log\rho$ . If the result above is true, what happens when $\rho$ has at least one eigenvalue of zero?

3243321,Motion of a particle described by a simple differential equation,"Let $X_0 = \frac12$ . Let $a : \mathbb R_+ \to \{-1,0,1\}$ be a measurable function. A particle moves in the interval $[0,1]$ as follows: $$ dX_t = a_t dt \implies X_t = X_0 + \int_0^t a_s ds$$ where the integral is the Lebesgue integral. Both $0$ and $1$ are absorbing, i.e. once $X_t$ hits $0$ or $1$ it remains there. Suppose $a_t$ is Markovian. That is, $\exists$ a function $g: [0,1] \to \{-1,0,1\}$ such that, $a_s = g(X_s)$ for all $s$ . Therefore, $$X_t = X_0 + \int_0^t g(X_s) ds$$ I would like to claim the following: Claim: $X_t$ moves only in one direction. That is, if $X_t = x >X_0$ for some $t$ . Then, $\nexists s > t$ such that $X_s \in (X_0,x)$ . The reasoning is the following. Since $X_t$ reached $x$ and $a_t$ is Markovian, for any $y \in (X_0,x)$ , $a(y) = 1$ (with some abuse of notation). So, it should be impossible for the particle to return back to $y$ once it moves forward. How do I argue this formally? Can we write the claim for when $a_t$ is everywhere Markovian? Thanks.","['calculus', 'analysis', 'dynamical-systems']"

3243344,Linear first-order systems of ODEs - Proving linear dependence of a set of function vector solutions on an entire interval from a single point,"In my Analysis course at university, the professor's textbook describes linear first-order systems of ordinary differential equations, and more precisely, the solutions to the homogeneous equation of the form $$\vec{Y}\,'(t)=A(t)\vec{Y}(t)$$ where $\vec{Y}(t)$ is a vector of $n$ components that are each a function of $t$ . Now, the book states that given $n$ solutions to this equation, $\vec{Y}_1(t) ... \vec{Y}_n(t)$ , one can prove that these solutions are linearly dependent or linearly independent on an entire interval $I$ based on just a single $t_0\in I$ for which the solutions are one of both. I have spent quite some time trying to wrap my head around the proof, and I can't seem to do it, so I was wondering if anyone could reformulate it, or perhaps point me to appropriate search terms so that I can do my own further reading on the internet. The proof uses the case of linear dependence, and is as follows: Suppose $\vec{Y}_1(t) ... \vec{Y}_n(t)$ are solutions to the homogeneous differential equation above, and for a certain $t_0 \in I$ , it holds that $$\sum_{i=1}^nc_i\;\vec{Y}_i(t_0)=\vec0$$ with not all $c_i=0$ . Then, there can be defined a vector function $\vec{Y}_{total}(t)$ that is this linear combination, for which - by linearity - the differential equations above holds. This same $\vec{Y}_{total}(t)$ can then be seen as the solution to the initial value problem $\vec{Y}\,'(t)=A(t)\vec{Y}(t)$ with $\vec{Y}_{total}(t_0)=\vec0$ . Thus, because of the uniqueness of a solution, it must be true that this $\vec{Y}_{total}(t)$ is the trivial solution, proving the linear dependence of $\vec{Y}_1(t) ... \vec{Y}_n(t)$ on the entire interval $I$ . It is this final step in italics I am just not getting. How so does ""uniqueness of a solution"" come into play here? It baffles me every time I read it.","['systems-of-equations', 'linear-algebra', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

3243380,Can we let $n$ go to $\infty$ after applying the fundamental theorem of algebra to a polynomial of degree $n$?,"Recently I came across a proof of the infinite product for $\sin z$ ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022247X77902347 ). It applies the fundamental theorem of algebra to $$p_{n}(z)=\dfrac{1}{2}\left(\left(1+\frac{z}{n}\right)^{n}-\left(1-\frac{z}{n}\right)^{n}\right),$$ which it factors to a product.
But it also states that $n=2m+1$ and lets $n$ and $m$ go to infinity. Then how is the factorization to a product, by applying the fundamental theorem of algebra, possible?

3243390,Greatest perimeter polygon on a geoboard,"A physical geoboard is an organized set pegs that are distributed in a grid pattern which sits on (or is a part of) a thin rectangular base. Different sized Rubber bands can wrap around the pegs of geoboard, which can form a large number of patterns and shapes. An example of this is shown in the picture below. When I was a kid I had a computer program that was a digital version of a geoboard. The program had a square grid of nodes. The grid was ten nodes by ten nodes. Nodes on the grid could be connected by line segments. One feature of the digital geoboard is that if a closed shape was formed by line segments, the perimeter of the shape could be measured. One unit on the geoboard was the distance between two adjacent points in the horizontal or vertical direction. Here is a YouTube video of the program. One thing I tried to do during the time when I had the program was to find the largest perimeter closed shape that I could create with the grid. After a lot of trial and error I eventually came up this: If the dot coordinates are defined by $(x,y)$ and the bottom left node is defined as $(1,1)$ then the polygon in the picture directly above can be defined by the connected nodes $(1,10)\rightarrow (1,9)\rightarrow (2,9)\rightarrow (1,8)\rightarrow (3,9)\rightarrow (1,7)\rightarrow (4,9)\rightarrow (1,6)\rightarrow (5,9)\rightarrow (1,5)\rightarrow

3243621,When is an open subset of an orientable manifold an orientable submanifold?,"I am trying to complete problem $4$ from the introductory chapter of Riemannian Geometry by do Carmo. The question asks us to show that the projective plane $P^2(\mathbb{R})$ is non-orientable, first by proving any open subset of an orientable manifold is an orientable submanifold. do Carmo's definition for a manifold $M$ to be orientable is if it admits a differentiable structure $\left\{(U_\alpha,\mathbf{x_\alpha}) \right\}_{\alpha \in \Gamma}$ such that for every pair $\alpha,\beta$ with $\mathbf{x_\alpha}(U_\alpha)\cap\mathbf{x_\beta}(U_\beta)$ nonempty the differential of the change of coordinates, $d(\mathbf{x_\beta}^{-1} \circ \mathbf{x_\alpha})$ , has positive determinant. My approach to this was to say let open $V \subset M$ be given.  Then $\left\{(U_\alpha\cap \mathbf{x_\alpha}^{-1}(V),\mathbf{x_\alpha}) \right\}_{\alpha \in \Gamma}$ is a differentiable structure on $V$ that satisfies the definition. My confusion stems from the fact that an open Möbius band can embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ , for example by the embedding $f:U\to \mathbb{R}^3$ $$f(x,y) = \left(\left(1+\frac{y}{2}\cos\frac{x}{2}\right)\cos{x},\;\left(1+\frac{y}{2}\cos\frac{x}{2}\right)\sin{x},\;\frac{y}{2}\sin\frac{x}{2}\right)$$ Where $U = \left\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 : 0 \leq x < 2\pi,\;-1 < y < 1\right\}$ (taken from Wikipedia).

If $X$ is non-singular, then $Z=S^{2n-1}$ . $Bl_YX\setminus E \simeq  X\setminus Y$ and as $\dim Y \le 2n-2$ , it follows that $H^{2n}(X) = H^{2n}(X\setminus Y)$ and $H^{2n-1}(X) = H^{2n-1}(X\setminus Y)$ . Also, $\dim E = 2n-2$ , so $H^{2n}(E)=H^{2n-1}(E) =0$ . Thus $$\to H^3(X) \stackrel j \to H^3 (Z)\to H^4(Bl_YX)\stackrel {i^*}\to H^4(X) \to 0$$ is exact.

3244544,Which positive continuous functions satisfy $F(x) = F(e^x)-F(e^{-x})$ for $x\geq 0$?,"There is at least one such function. It is the cdf of the equilibrium probability distribution for the chaotic sequence $x(n+1) = |\log x(n)|$ with $x(1) = 2$ . Its graph (approximation) is pictured below. I am interested in a series expansion for the density $f(x)$ , which is the derivative of $F(x)$ . Note I expect that if you start with a different seed, say $x(1) =3$ , you end up with the same distribution, unless you pick up one of the very rare seeds (called bad seed) that results in a different $F$ . The set of bad seeds has Lebesgue measure zero, but it is infinite and even dense. My intuition is based on the following: consider instead $x(n+1) = bx(n) - \lfloor bx(n) \rfloor$ . The equilibrium distribution is uniform on $[0, 1]$ this time (if $b$ is an integer larger than 1) unless you pick up a bad seed. All rational numbers are bad seeds. Tons of other numbers are bad seeds. But the vast majority are good seeds. A good seed is equivalent to a normal number: its digits in base $b$ are evenly distributed. No one knows if $\pi, e, \log 2$ or $\sqrt{2}$ is a good seed. More on this in my article on the theory of randomness or my book on organized chaos . Similarly, in our context here, proving that $x(1) = 2$ is a good seed is a very hard problem, and possibly un-provable. Yet plenty of evidence makes you believe that it is a good seed. Some sequences such as $x(n+1) = b+x(n) - \lfloor b + x(n)\rfloor$ do not have bad seeds if $b$ is irrational. The logistic map $x(n+1) = 4x(n)\cdot (1-x(n))$ has plenty of bad seeds. In our example $x(1) = 0.567143...$ is a bad seed because $x(2) = x(1)$ and thus $x(n) = x(1)$ for all $n$ .","['stochastic-processes', 'functional-equations', 'taylor-expansion', 'sequences-and-series']"

For a lower bound, let $H$ be a Hamel basis of $\mathbb R$ over $\mathbb Q$ . Since $H$ is linearly independent over $\mathbb Q$ (and thus also over $\mathbb Z$ ), every subset of $H$ generates a distinct subgroup of $\mathbb R$ . Since $|H| = 2^{\aleph_0}$ (I think), the set of all such groups then has cardinality $2^{|H|} = 2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$ . Since this is a subset of $X$ , we must have $2^{2^{\aleph_0}}\le |X|$ .

This website says that the character table for the group $C_3$ is as shown below. where the cyclic group is $A, A^2, A^3=E$ , and $\Gamma^{(i)}$ are the irreducible representations of the group. To my understanding, the rows and columns in a character table must be orthogonal, which works for all rows and columns except when multiplying $\Gamma^{(2)}$ by $\Gamma^{(3)}$ , where we get $1+1+1=3\neq0$ . The orthogonality of rows just means that multiplying entries in a row together and summing them up gives zero. So for $\Gamma^{(1)}$ and $\Gamma^{(2)}$ , the orthogonality is that $(1)(1)+(1)\text{e}^{2\pi i/3}+(1)\text{e}^{-2\pi i/3}=0$ . The same applies to columns. We also know that the characters are just the traces of the irreducible representations. The dimensionalities of the irreducible representations are all 1, so the characters must just be group elements of the irreducible representations. Correct me if I am wrong on that point. I've seen several character tables where the orthogonality does no seem to hold and its very confusing because that is how you find a character table, by finding characters which make it orthogonal.

3244850,Canonical Form for Commuting Vector Fields,"I am reading Introduction to Smooth Manifolds by John M. Lee, and I have a question about the proof of a theorem about canonical form for commuting vector fields. The statement and the proof of the theorem (Theorem 9.46 in the book) goes as follows: Theorem . Let $M$ be a smooth $n$ -manifold, and let $(V_1,\dots,V_k)$ be a linearly independent $k$ -tuple of smooth commuting vector fields on an open subset $W\subseteq M$ . For each $p\in W$ , there exists a smooth coordinate chart $(U,(s_i))$ centered at $p$ such that $V_i=\partial/\partial s^i$ for $i=1,\dots ,k$ / If $S\subseteq W$ is an embedded codimension- $k$ submanifold and $p$ is a point of $S$ such that $T_p S$ is complementary to the span of $(V_1\mid _p,\dots V_k\mid _p)$ , then the coordinates can also be chosen such that $S\cap U$ is the slice defined by $s^1=\cdots=s^k=0$ . Proof. Choose a slice chart $(U,(x^i))$ for $S$ centered at $p$ , so that $U\cap S$ is equal to the slice $\{x\in U\mid x^1=\cdots =x_k=0\}$ . Because the theorem is local, it suffices to consider the case where $U$ is an open set of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Let $\theta_i$ denote the flow of $V_i$ for $i=1,\dots, k$ , and choose $\varepsilon>0$ and a neighbrohood $Y$ of $p$ such that the composition $(\theta_1)_{t_1} \circ \cdots \circ(\theta_k)_{t_k}$ is defined on $Y$ and maps $Y$ into $U$ whenever $|t_1|,\dots |t_k|$ are all less than $\varepsilon$ . Define $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n-k}$ by $$\Omega=\{(s^{k+1},\dots,s^n)|(0,\dots,0,s^{k+1},\dots,s^n)\in Y\},$$ and define $\Phi:(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)^k\times \Omega\to U$ by $$\Phi(s^1,\dots s^n)=(\theta_1)_{s^1} \circ \cdots \circ(\theta_k)_{s^k}(0,\dots,0,s^{k+1},\dots ,s^n).$$ The hypothesis that $\theta_i$ commutes ensures us that $\partial/\partial s^i$ is $\Phi$ -related to $V_i$ for $i=1,\dots ,k$ . By construction, we also have $d\Phi_0(\partial/\partial s^i|_0)=\partial/\partial x^i \mid _p$ for $i=k+1,\dots, n$ ; it follows that the differential $d\Phi _0$ of $\Phi$ at the origin is invertible, so $\Phi$ restricts a diffeomorphism from a neighborhood of $0$ onto an open set $\tilde U$ of $M$ . The chart $(\tilde U,\varphi):=(\tilde U, \Phi^{-1})$ is the desired slice chart for $S$ . $\square$ I do not understand why the chart $(\tilde U,\varphi)$ a slice chart for $S$ . For sure, by construction we have $\Phi (\{0\}\times \Omega)=S\cap Y$ , so if $q\in \tilde U$ satisfies $\varphi(q)\in \{0\}\times \mathbb{R}^{n-k}$ , then $q$ has to lie in $S$ . However, (if my understanding is correct) the construction above does not exclude the possibility that $\varphi(\tilde U\cap S)\supsetneq \varphi(\tilde U)\cap (\{0\}\times \mathbb{R}^{n-k})$ . So the question really boils down to finding some neighborhood of $0$ whose point is mapped into $S$ by $\Phi$ if and only if its first $k$ coordinates are all $0$ ; and intuitively, it is not hard to convince ourselves that such a neighborhood does exist. But I have been having a hard time proving it. Can anyone help me? Thanks in advance.","['vector-fields', 'differential-topology', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
3244883,Canonical Divisors versus Principal Divisors,"Perhaps this is so obvious a question that no one has asked it before, but can someone provide a simple example of a canonical divisor which is not a principal divisor or conversely on a Riemann Surface? I know that if $g(X)=1$ then $\operatorname{KDiv}(X)=\operatorname{PDiv}(X)$ , but I imagine that this does not always hold. Here is my presumably false proof that $""\operatorname{KDiv}(X)=\operatorname{PDiv}(X)""$ in general: If $\omega$ is a meromorphic $1-$ form on $X$ , then $\operatorname{div}(\omega)=\sum_{p\in X} \operatorname{ord}_p(\omega)\cdot p$ , and for $f\in \mathcal{M}(X)$ , we have $\operatorname{div}(f)=\sum_{p\in X} \operatorname{ord}_p(f)\cdot p$ . However, $\operatorname{ord}_p(\omega)=\operatorname{ord}_0(g_p(z) dz)$ where $z$ is a local parameter near $p$ , centered at $p$ . I believe one should be able to glue together the $g_p$ to form a global meromorphic function $g\in \mathcal{M}(X)$ with $\operatorname{div}(g)=\operatorname{div}(\omega)$ . In this case, we would get that $\operatorname{KDiv}(X)=\operatorname{PDiv}(X)$ . I think my mistake is that the gluing procedure produces something undesirable because of the method by which differential forms transform under a change of variables.","['riemann-surfaces', 'divisors-algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-theory']"

We can define the polynomial $P_b^n(X)$ associated to this expansion by $P_b^n(X) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^\infty a_iX^i$ . Now define the set $S_n = \{b \mid b \lt n \text{ and } P_b^n(X)\text{ is reducible in }\mathbb Z[X]\}$ .

I am interested in the likelihood that such a strategy may succeed.

Expanding in power series, we get $a=1+\sqrt{5}$ or $1-\sqrt{5}$ . We take positive $a$ . If $f\neq{\rm const}$ then $f'(0)\neq0$ - it can be any non-zero number. After that, we can uniquely define coefficients in power series $f^{(n)}(0)/n!$ step by step using differentiation of the functional equation $$
 f(0)=f(0)^2-1\ \Rightarrow\ f(0)=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{5}}2;\ 2f'(0)f(0)=af'(0)\ \Rightarrow\ f(0)=a/2;\ \ 2f''(0)f(0)+2(f'(0))^2=a^2f''(0)\ \Rightarrow\ f''(0)=\frac{2(f'(0))^2}{a^2-a};\ \ ....
$$ Can $f$ be expressed in terms of some known functions? It seems that $f$ is entire function of order $1$ . Indeed, due to the Leibnitz formula, we have $$
 a^nf^{(n)}(0)=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}f^{(n-k)}(0)f^{(k)}(0),
$$ which leads to \begin{equation}\label{l1}
 f^{(n)}(0)=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}f^{(n-k)}(0)f^{(k)}(0)}{a^n-a}.
\end{equation} It is true that $|f''(0)|\leq|f'(0)|^2=:C^2$ , see above. Suppose that we already proved $|f^{(k)}(0)|\leq C^k$ , $1\leq k\leq n-1$ . Then $$
 |f^{(n)}(0)|\leq \frac{C^n2^n}{(\sqrt{5}+1)^{n-1}\sqrt{5}}\leq C^n.
$$ Hence, the power series converges everywhere and $|f(x)|\leq|f(0)|+e^{C|x|}-1$ , $x\in\mathbb{C}$ . (The functional equation is somewhat similar to $\cos 2x=2\cos^2x-1$ . If we denote $g(x)=f(x)/f(0)$ then $$
 g'(x)=g'(0)g(a^{-1}x)g(a^{-2}x)g(a^{-3}x)....
$$ Also, the polynomial $$
 P_n(x)=f(a^nf^{-1}(x))=P\circ...\circ P(x),\ \ \ P(x)=x^2-1
$$ is some analog of Chebyshev polynomial $T_{2^n}(x)$ . The polynomials $P_n(x)$ are related to the representations of some class of infinite Lie algebras, but I forgot the story behind that...) Remark. It is seen that $f(\lambda x)$ satisfies also the functional equation, for any $\lambda$ . So, we can choose $f'(0)$ freely. Instead of this, let us choose the closest to $0$ zero as $x_0:=1$ (if zeroes exist), i.e. $f(1)=0$ . Then $f(a^{-1})=1$ (not $-1$ , since $x_0$ is the first zero and $f(0)>0$ ). Applying again the functional equation, we get $$
 f(1)=0,\ f(a^{-1})=1,\ f(a^{-2})=\sqrt{2},\ ...,\  f(a^{-n})=\sqrt{1+f(a^{-n+1})},\ ....
$$ Theoretically, we can recover $f(x)$ from infinite number of values $f(a^{-n})$ covergent to $f(0)=a/2$ . The next statement is wrong because, perhaps, $f$ can have complex zeros along with real zeros. I leave it just for possible improvements. Due to $f'(ax)=2a^{-1}f(x)f'(x)=(2a^{-1})^2f(x)f(a^{-1}x)f'(a^{-1}x)=...$ (see above infinite product for $g$ ), we can conclude that $f'(x)\neq0$ for $x\in[0,a)$ and, hence $f$ is monotonic on this interval. $f$ is also monotonic for $x\in(a,a^2)$ , since $f'(ax)=2a^{-1}f(x)f'(x)$ . Due to $f(a^2x)=f(x)^2(f(x)^2-2)$ , we see that $x_1=a^2$ is a double zero, $x_2=a^4$ is a zero of fourth order, etc. Following the same arguments as above, there are no other zeroes. Then $$
 f(x)=e^{h(x)}\prod_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(1-\frac{x}{a^{2n}}\right)^{2^n}.
$$ Is $h(x)=\ln a-\ln 2$ ? Perhaps, something wrong can be here... but if this is true then $$
 \ln f(x)=\ln a-\ln 2-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{a^{2k}x^k}{k(a^{2k}-2)}
$$ or something like that. While the previous section was wrong, the true Hadamard expansion perhaps exist. This is still rough. Let $\{x_r\}$ be the smallest primitive zeros of $f$ , such that all are other zeroes are $a^{2n}x_r$ . Dentote $H(x)=\prod_r(1-x/x_r)$ - I do not know about the convergence of the product, I am trying to explain some ideas. We can follow the arguments from the wrong section above. Then, perhaps, it is true that $$
 f(x)=\frac{a e^{dx}}{2}\prod_{n=0}^{\infty}H\left(\frac x{a^{2n}}\right)^{2^n}
$$ with some constant $d$ (I hope it is $0$ ), since the order of $f$ does not exceed $1$ . Substituting this identity into $f(a^2x)=f(x)^2(f(x)^2-2)$ we obtain also $$
 f(x)=\sqrt{2+e^{d(a^2-2)x}(2/a)H(a^2x)}.
$$ Using $f'(ax)=f'(0)\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(2f(x/a^n)/a)$ (see above $g$ ), we obtain $$
 f'(x)=f'(0)e^{\frac{dx}{a-1}}\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}H\left(\frac{x}{a^{2n}}\right)^{2^n-1}\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}H\left(\frac{x}{a^{2n-1}}\right)^{2^n-1}.
$$ It is possible to obtain other formulas. There is also another motivation to study $f$ : $$
 f(a^nx)=P\circ..\circ P(f(x)),\ \ P(x)=x^2-1.
$$ Thus, we can try to analyze the stability of values $f(z)$ under the action of the group of polynomials. This question is related to dynamical systems, fractals... Maybe the dynamical systems community already studied such analytic functions? There is an exact relation to fractals and holomorphic dynamics. Using $f(z)=P\circ...\circ P(f(a^{-n}z))$ , $P(z)=z^2-1$ , we obtain that if $z_0$ (located in the strip $S_n:=\{z:\ a^n\leq|z_0|<a^{n+1}\}$ ) is a primitive zero of $f$ , i.e. $f(a^{-k}z)\neq0$ , $k\geq1$ , then $f(a^{-n}z_0)$ is a non-trivial root of the polynomial $P_n=P^{\circ n}$ . All such non-trivia roots have the form $$
 q= s_0\sqrt{1+s_1\sqrt{1+...+s_{n-1}\sqrt{1+s_n\sqrt{2}}}},
$$ where $s_j\in\{-1,1\}$ . Without loss of generality, consider the case $f'(0)=1$ . Then, for sufficiently large $n_0$ , we have $$
 \frac{a}2+a^{-n-n_0}z_0\approx f(a^{-n-n_0}z_0)= s_0\sqrt{1+s_1\sqrt{1+...+s_{n-1}\sqrt{1+s_n\sqrt{2}}}}.
$$ Hence $$
 a^{-n-n_0}z_0\approx s_0\sqrt{1+s_1\sqrt{1+...+s_{n-1}\sqrt{1+s_n\sqrt{2}}}}-\frac{a}2(=q)
$$ and all such $q$ lying in $a^{-n_0}\leq|q|<a^{-n_0+1}$ correspond to primitive roots of $f$ lying in $S_n$ . I have computed them for $n=20$ (and $n_0=4$ ): It looks like a Julia set. So, zeros of $f$ (even primitive zeros) are very complex. I hope I did not make large mistakes somewhere... It is also possible to introduce more general functions satisfying $$
 f(ax)=bf(x)^2+cf(x)+d\ \ \ {\rm or\ even}\ \ \ f(ax)=Q(f(x)) 
$$ with some polynomial or rational $Q$ . Such class of functions contain $\sin,\cos,\exp,...$ One of the main questions is still open: are there any relations between $f$ and some known functions? Of course, any information about asymptotics, expansions, numerical results, differential equations, etc. is very welcome. A relation with the approximation of the golden ratio. Finally, I found one relation with more or less known functions. Consider $$
 g(z)=\lim_{n\to\infty}a^n\biggl(\underbrace{\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+...\sqrt{1+z}}}}_n-\frac{a}2\biggr).
$$ The function $g$ is analytic (not entire), it is considered in Paris, R. B. ""An Asymptotic Approximation Connected with the Golden Number."" Amer. Math. Monthly 94, 272-278, 1987. It satisfies the functional equation $$
 g(z)=ag(\sqrt{1+z}).
$$ Hence, $f$ is exactly the inverse function to $g$ . It is useful to note that $g'$ admits an explicit representation $$
 g'(z)=\frac{a}{2\sqrt{1+z}}\cdot\frac{a}{2\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+z}}}....
$$ Edit - 04 June 2019. There are few remarks: due to the product expansion for $g'(x)$ , all primitive zeros are simple and each simple zero of $f$ is primitive. Due to the comments and answers below (many thanks to the authors), the order of $f$ is $\rho=\ln 2/\ln a<1$ . This value can be obtained by substituting $e^{A|z|^{\rho}}$ into $f(az)=f(z)^2-1$ , which gives $a^{\rho}=2$ . Because the order $\rho<1$ , we have $d=0$ in the Weierstrass-Hadamard expansion. Something like this... For me, it was a bit strange to see the more or less explicit entire function $f$ whose zeros form fractals. Edit - 05 June 2019 As mentioned above, the function $f$ has a lot of multiple roots. There is a linear transform which leaves simple roots of only. Without loss of generality, consider the case $f'(0)=1$ . Recall that, see above, if $(x_r)$ are simple roots of $f$ then $f$ can be expressed in terms of $H(x)=\prod(1-x/x_r)$ as $$
 f(x)=\sqrt{2+(2/a)H(a^2x)}
$$ or $$
 f(x)^2-1=1+(2/a)H(a^2x),
$$ which leads to $$
 f(x)=1+(2/a)H(ax).
$$ The function $H$ has simple zeros only forming a fractal structure. Edit - 06 June 2019 People from IMRN said that $f(az)=P(f(z))$ is a Poincare equation. They provided also somereference: [main] P. Fatou, ""Memoire sur les equations fonctionnelles"", Bull. Soc. Math. Fr., 47, 161-271; 48, 33-94, 208-314 (1919). [2] A. Eremenko and G. Levin,

3245427,Why dont we only consider complete measure spaces?,"This question has been asked a few months ago , but in my opinion, it has not yet received a satisfying answer. So I ask again: Why should one consider non-complete measure spaces instead of requiring every measure space to be complete per definition? Most answers on similar questions are like: If $f$ is a measurable function, one wants its codomain to contain fewer measurable sets, so that one finds more measurable functions beside $f$ . Lebesgue-Lebesgue-measurable functions are pretty useless because not even continous functions have to be L-L-measurable (but diffeomorphisms are). If $\Omega$ is a probability space and $X:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ a random variable (where $\mathbb{R}$ is endowed with any $\sigma$ -Algebra), its distribution (pushforward measure) isnt necessarily a complete measure. But I see a mistake in those thoughts. The category of measurable spaces (set + $\sigma$ -Algebra) is confused with the category of measure spaces (set + $\sigma$ -Algebra + measure). Of course, Lebesgue-Borel-measurable functions are important, because they are the subject of separably-valued integration (on $\mathbb{R}^n$ ). But for a Bochner-measurable function (a.e. pointwise limit of simple functions) that one wants to integrate, it is irrelevant if there is a measure on its codomain. The $L_1$ -functor goes $$ L_1 : \mathsf{MeasureSpaces} \times \mathsf{BanachSpaces} \to \mathsf{BanachSpaces} \ ,\ (X,A,\mu) , E \mapsto L_1(X,\mu,E)$$ so it may be wrong to think of any sigma-Algebra on the codomain of an integrable function. Also, if $(X,A,\mu)$ is a measure space and $(X,\bar A,\bar \mu)$ is its canonical completion, a function $f:X \to E$ into a Banach space $E$ is Bochner-measurable with respect to $\mu$ , if and only if it is Bochner-measurable with respect to $\bar \mu$ . So, for Bochner integration theory, non-complete measure spaces are completely redundant. And concerning the distribution argument: If one has a random variable $X : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ , I see no reason to postulate a $\sigma$ -Algebra on $\mathbb{R}$ and the measurablitiy of $X$ . I think it to be more natural to view $\mathbb{R}$ as simply a set and consider every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ to be measurable, whose preimage is measurable. This yields a $\sigma$ -Algebra, bears no needless abandonment of per se measure-accessible subsets and if $\Omega$ is complete, the pushforward measure will be too.","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-integral', 'random-variables']"
3245432,Proving $V(X) = E(V(X|Y)) + V(E(X|Y))$ using the pythagorean theorem,"I know the textbook proof of $$V(X) = E(V(X|Y)) + V(E(X|Y))$$ but I'm interested in understanding the weird proof/analogy with the pythagorean theorem my professor gave in class. With $X, Y$ random variables, His explanation was that covariance defines an inner product, $X$ is a vector and $X|Y$ is the projection of $X$ on the ""plane"" of all posible functions of $Y$ . We proved that Cov $(X - E(X|Y), G(Y)) = 0$ and that would mean that $X - E(X|Y)$ is normal to the ""plane"" of all possible functions of $Y$ . Fine so far but then he uses the fact that $X - E(X|Y)$ and $E(X|Y)$ are perpendicular to show that $$V(X) = V(X - E(X|Y)) + V(E(X|Y))$$ which is directly taken from the pythagorean theorem. My only problem with this is the way to get from $V(X - E(X|Y))$ to $E(V(X|Y))$ . It's easy to show that $V(X - E(X|Y)) = E((X - E(X|Y))^2)$ which almost looks like the definition of variance for $X|Y$ but $X$ is not quite $X|Y$ . What justifies that $$E((X - E(X|Y))^2) = E(E((X|Y - E(X|Y))^2)) = E(V(X|Y))$$ ? Is there something else I should be assuming about this to get to this conclusion? PS: This is my first probability course. I did some linear algebra and I know inner products and abstract vector spaces but the professor didn't go as deep in this course.

Prove that $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int \sqrt[n]{f^{n} + g^{n}} d\mu$$ exists as an extended real number. What is its value? So Far: We know $\sqrt[n]{f^{n} + g^{n}} \leq \sqrt[n]{2g^{n}} \leq 2g$ . Also, \begin{align}
\log(g) &\leq \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\log(f^{n} + g^{n})}{n} \\
	&= \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{f^{n}\log(f) + g^{n}\log(g)}{f^{n} + g^{n}} & (\text{L'Hospital}) \\
	&\leq \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{f^{n}\log(g) + g^{n}\log(g)}{f^{n} + g^{n}} \\
	&= \log(g),
\end{align} whence $\sqrt[n]{f^{n} + g^{n}} \rightarrow g$ . Thus if $\int g d\mu < \infty$ then Dominated Convergence gives us $$\int \sqrt[n]{f^{n} + g^{n}} d\mu \longrightarrow \int g d\mu.$$ Where I'm Stuck: If $\int g$ is not finite, I'm not quite sure how to show the limit exists in $[-\infty, \infty]$ . According to Dominated Convergence Theorem on Wiki, it is necessary for $g$ to be integrable. So I cannot get an extended real number limit just from that theorem. I also tried integrating over the sets $\{f < 1\}$ and $\{f \geq 1\}$ . On the second set, $\frac{d}{dn}\sqrt[n]{f^{n} + g^{n}}$ is positive and I can apply Monotone Convergence Theorem over this set, which forgets about whether $\int g$ is infinite or not (if I remember correctly). But then integrating over the other set gets me at most $\int_{f< 1} \sqrt[n]{f^{n} + g^{n}} \leq \int_{f>1} \sqrt[n]{1 + g^{n}}$ .","['integration', 'measure-theory']"
3245900,How do I solve this log equation for x? $3\log _5\left(\sqrt{2+x}\right)+\log _5\left(\sqrt{2-x}\right)-3=\log _5\left(\sqrt{4-x^2}\right)$,"$3\log _5\left(\sqrt{2+x}\right)+\log _5\left(\sqrt{2-x}\right)-3=\log _5\left(\sqrt{4-x^2}\right)$ I only managed to solve up to this step: $\left(2+x\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{2-x}=\sqrt{4-x^2}\cdot \:125$ However, I'm not too sure about squaring both sides as I would have to handle ridiculously large numbers to find x, so I'm not too sure that I'm doing it correctly.","['algebra-precalculus', 'logarithms']"
3245901,"Random points on interval, expected lengths of pieces","Many years ago I came across the following task. If we have the interval $[0; 1]$ and we throw $N$ uniformly distributed and mutually independent points on it, then we'll get $N+1$ segments. What is the expected length of the longest segment? The 2nd longest? Etc. For $N=1$ , the solution is trivial: $3/4$ and $1/4$ (since the longest segment is uniformly distributed in [1/2; 1] and the shorter one is uniformly distributed in $[0; 1/2]$ ). For $N=2$ , the solution is not trivial, but possible. One just has to draw a quadrat 1 x 1. A point in it would mean that the longest segment has the x coordinate, and the 2nd longest segment has the y coordinate (and the shortest one is 1 - 1st - 2nd). One then has to carefully draw the possible area (this will be a triangle), and find its middle point. But for $N>2$ I have no clue how to solve it. I remember, the book I saw the task in, had a general solution for arbitrary $N$ , but I don't know anymore what book it was. Note that the task is somewhat similar to Average Distance Between Random Points on a Line Segment , but just somewhat.","['geometry', 'probability']"

3245982,"Showing that $R^pf_*\mathcal{F} \cong \widetilde{H^p(X, \mathcal{F})}$","$\newcommand{\oh}{\mathcal{O}} \newcommand{\QCoh}{\mathsf{QCoh}} \newcommand{\ra}{\rightarrow} \newcommand{\F}{\mathcal{F}} \newcommand{\Mod}{\text{-}\mathsf{Mod}}$ I'm working through the proof of Proposition 10 of Murfet's notes . The proposition is as follows: Let $f : X \ra Y$ be a morphism of schemes, where $X$ is noetherian and $Y = \text{Spec} A$ is affine. Then for any $ \F \in \QCoh(X)$ and $i \geq 0$ there exists a canonical isomorphism of sheaves of modules on $Y$ natural in $\F$ $$ \beta : R^if_* \F \longrightarrow \widetilde{H^i(X, \F)}.$$ The proof goes as follows (I've denoted my questions with "" Q: ""): $R^if_* \F$ has a canonical $\oh_Y$ -module structure and $H^i(X, \F)$ has a canonical $\Gamma(X, \F)$ -module structure, and since $\Gamma(X, \F)$ has the structure of an $A$ -module, $H^i(X, \F)$ has an $A$ -module structure. Also, $X$ noetherian implies that $f_* \F \in \QCoh(Y)$ . Therefore, we have a canonical isomorphism of sheaves $$ f_* \F \cong \widetilde{\Gamma(X, \F)}. $$ Q: I'm not sure why we have this. I know that if in general $\F$ is a quasi-coherent sheaf on $X$ , then for $U_i$ opens of a particular cover of $X$ , we have $\F|_{U_i} \cong \widetilde{F(U_i)}$ . But I'm not sure as to how we derive the above? I've tried $$ f_* \F|_{U_i} = \F(f^{-1}(-))|_{U_i} $$ but this doesn't really get me anywhere. Proceeding with the proof, we have for $i=0$ a canonical isomorphism natural in $\F$ $$ \mu^0 : R^0f_* \F \cong f_* \F \cong \widetilde{\Gamma(X, \F)} = \widetilde{H^0(X, \F)} \quad \checkmark $$ Now, since the tilde functor $\widetilde{-}: A \Mod \ra \oh_Y \Mod$ is exact, we have two cohomological $\delta$ -functors $\{ R^i f_*(-) \}_{i \geq 0}$ and $\{ \widetilde{H^i(X, -)} \}_{i \geq 0}$ between $\QCoh(X)$ and $\oh_Y \Mod$ . Q: Why does this follow from exactness of the tilde functor? Apologies; this may be obvious (I'm not too brushed up on my $\delta$ -functor knowledge). Quasi-coherent sheaves may be embedded into flasque quasi-coherent sheaves. Hence, both functors are effaceable for $i>0$ . Q: Why does the $\delta$ -functors being effaceable follow from this? Effaceable means (in this case) that for any object $\F \in \QCoh(X)$ there exists a monomorphism $u : \F \ra \mathcal{G}$ such that $\{ R^i f_*(u) \}_{i \geq 0} = 0$ and $\{\widetilde{H^i(X, u)} \}_{i \geq 0}=0$ , some $\mathcal{G}$ . I think that this is because we can say $u$ is the embedding into a flasque quasi-coherent sheaf, and since sheaf cohomology vanishes for flasque sheaves and higher direct images, we get the result. Is this correct modulo details? Then by a theorem of Grothendieck, both of the $\delta$ -functors are universal (i.e. a universal $\delta$ -functor is characterised by the property that giving any morphism from it to any other $\delta$ -functor is equivalent to giving just the $0$ th degree). Therefore, $\mu^0$ gives rise to the canonical natural equivalence that we require.

3246000,Graceful graphs with Valence $k$,"For a graceful graph ( code ), vertices are labeled with values from 0 to $e$ so that the $e$ edge differences are all values from 1 to $e$ . The below is now OEIS sequence A308722 . $K_3$ is the minimal valence 2 graph with $e=3$ . $K_4$ is the minimal valence 3 graph with $e=6$ . $O$ is the minimal valence 4 graph with $e=12$ . The minimal graceful graph with valence 5 has $e=20$ . The minimal graceful graph with valence 6 has $e=27$ . The minimal graceful graph for valence 7 has $e=35$ . It is unique. What are minimal graceful graphs with valence 8 and up? These are heavily related to sparse rulers .  My guess for future behavior is: e=48 with 12 vertices of valence 8. (verified this one) e=63 with 14 vertices of valence 9. Verified.  The graph complement
of the following is graceful. Or in the more normal form e=75 with 15 vertices of valence 10.  Verified. There are 37 such graphs.  The graph complement of the following is graceful. e=99 with 18 vertices of valence 11. (e=88 proved impossible). Verified. e=108 with 18 vertices of valence 12.  Verified. The graph complement of the following is graceful. e=130 with 20 vertices of valence 13. Verified. e=147 with 21 vertices of valence 14. e=180 with 24 vertices of valence 15. e=192 with 24 vertices of valence 16. e=221 with 26 vertices of valence 17. e=243 with 27 vertices of valence 18. e=285 with 30 vertices of valence 19. e=320 with 32 vertices of valence 20. e=336 with 32 vertices of valence 21.

3246009,Is there a way to bound expected value with limited information of the CDF?,"Suppose I want to evaluate $E[X]$ , where $X$ is a univariate random variable and takes values in $\mathcal{X}$ , where the smallest element of $\mathcal{X}$ is 0 and the largest element of $\mathcal{X}$ is $\overline{X}$ . The problem is that I don't have the pdf or cdf of $X$ . Instead, suppose that I know the exact value of the CDF at finitely many (but never all) values of the support. So for example, I know $Pr(X\leq x_1)=0.1$ , $Pr(X\leq x_2)=0.2$ ,..., $Pr(X\leq \overline{X})=1$ . Is there a way to bound $E[X]$ ? In other words, given this partial information what is the highest possible value of the expectation and the lowest possible value and how can I compute it? Will the characterization of the solutions in discrete and continuous random variable cases differ a lot? Intuitively, it seems that as the number of points over which I know the CDF increases (even if finitely many), I should have a good idea of the shape of the CDF and be able to bound the expectation. I am not sure how to formalize this intuition or whether it is correct.","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'upper-lower-bounds', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"
3246020,Help with $-\int_0^1 \ln(1+x)\ln(1-x)dx$,I have been attempting to evaluate this integral and by using wolfram alpha I know that the value is $$I=-\int_0^1 \ln(1+x)\ln(1-x)dx=\frac{\pi^2}{6}+2\ln(2)-\ln^2(2)-2$$ My Attempt: I start off by parametizing the integral as $$I(a)=\int_0^1 -\ln(1+x)\ln(1-ax)dx$$ where $I=I(1)$ . I then differentiate to get $$I'(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{ax\ln(1+x)}{1-ax}dx=\int_0^1 ax\ln(1+x)\sum_{n=0}^\infty(ax)^ndx=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a^{n+1}\int_0^1 x^{n+1}\ln(1+x)dx$$ Evaluating this integral by integration by parts and geometric series I get $$\int_0^1 x^{n+1}\ln(1+x)dx=\frac{x^{n+2}}{n+2}\ln(1+x)|_0^1-\frac{1}{n+2}\int_0^1 \frac{x^{n+2}}{1+x}dx=\frac{\ln(2)}{n+2}-\frac{1}{n+2}\int_0^1 x^{n+2}\sum_{k=0}^\infty(-x)^kdx=\frac{\ln(2)}{n+2}-\frac{1}{n+2}\sum_{k=0}^\infty(-1)^k\int_0^1 x^{k+n+2}dx=\frac{\ln(2)}{n+2}-\frac{1}{n+2}\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{k+n+2}=\frac{\ln(2)}{n+2}-\frac{1}{2(n+2)}\left(\psi_0\left(\frac{n}{2}+2\right)-\psi_0\left(\frac{n}{2}+\frac{3}{2}\right)\right)$$ So I arrive at $$I'(a)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a^{n+1}\left(\frac{\ln(2)}{n+2}-\frac{1}{2(n+2)}\left(\psi_0\left(\frac{n}{2}+2\right)-\psi_0\left(\frac{n}{2}+\frac{3}{2}\right)\right)\right)$$ Re-indexing I get $$I'(a)=\frac{\ln(2)}{a}\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{a^n}{n}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{\psi_0\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{n}a^{n-1}-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{\psi_0\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}{n}a^{n-1}$$ Integrating both sides from $0$ to $1$ I recover $I(1)$ $$I(1)=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(2)}{a}\left(-\ln(1-a)-a\right)da+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{\psi_0\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{n^2}-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{\psi_0\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}{n^2}$$ Then using the integral equation for the Dilogarithm I arrive at $$I(1)=\ln(2)\int_0^1 -\frac{\ln(1-a)}{a}da-\ln(2)+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{\psi_0\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{n^2}-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{\psi_0\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}{n^2}$$ $$I(1)=\frac{\ln(2)\pi^2}{6}-\ln(2)+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{\psi_0\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{n^2}-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{\psi_0\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}{n^2}$$ At this point I could not continue further as I did not know how to simplify the Digamma terms in the sums. I think that by using the Digamma function's relation to the Harmonic Numbers it could be possible to exploit known values of Harmonic sums to arrive at the answer but I could not get the sums in a form where this would work. If anyone could help me continue further or let me know if I am on the right track I would greatly appreciate it.

&=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k}{k+1} \times \frac{1}{(n+1)(k+1)-k}
