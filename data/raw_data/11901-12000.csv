92648,"Calculation of the n-th central moment of the normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$","Since integration is not my strong suit I need some feedback on this, please: Let $Y$ be $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$, the normal distrubution with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$. I know $\mu$ is the expectation value and $\sigma$ is the variance of $Y$. I want to calculate the $n$-th central moments of $Y$. The density function of $Y$ is $$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt {2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{y-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}$$ The $n$-th central moment of $Y$ is $$E[(Y-E(Y))^n]$$ The $n$-th moment of $Y$ is $$E(Y^n)=\psi^{(n)}(0)$$ where $\psi$ is the Moment-generating function $$\psi(t)=E(e^{tX})$$ So I started calculating: $$\begin{align}

E[(Y-E(Y))^n]&=\int_\mathbb{R}\left(f(x)-\int_\mathbb{R}f(x)dx\right)^n\,dx \\
&=\int_\mathbb{R}\sum_{k=0}^n\left[\binom{n}{k}(f(x))^k\left(-\int_\mathbb{R}f(x)dx\right)^{n-k}\right]\,dx \\
&=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}\left(\int_\mathbb{R}\left[(f(x))^k\left(-\int_\mathbb{R}f(x)dx\right)^{n-k}\right]\,dx\right) \\
&=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}\left(\int_\mathbb{R}\left[(f(x))^k\left(-\mu\right)^{n-k}\right]\,dx\right) \\
&=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}\left((-\mu)^{n-k}\int_\mathbb{R}(f(x))^k\,dx\right) \\
&=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}\left((-\mu)^{n-k}E\left(Y^k\right)\right) \\
\end{align}$$ Am I on the right track or completely misguided? If I have made no mistakes so far, I would be glad to get some inspiration because I am stuck here. Thanks!","['normal-distribution', 'probability']"
92662,Formula for the sum of the squares of numbers,"We have the well-known formula $$\frac{n (n + 1) (2 n + 1)}{6} = 1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 .$$ If the difference between the closest numbers is smaller, we obtain, for example $$\frac{n \times (n + 0.1)  (2 n + 0.1) }{6 \cdot 0.1} = 0.1^2 + 0.2^2 + \cdots + n^2 .$$ It is easy to check. Now if the difference between the closest numbers becomes smallest possible, we will obtain $$ \frac{n \cdot (n + 0.0..1) \cdot (2 n  + 0.0..1)}{6 \cdot 0.0..1} = 0.0..1^2 + 0.0..2^2 + \cdots + n^2$$ So can conclude that $$\frac{2n ^ 3}{6} = \frac{n ^ 3}{3} = \frac{0.0..1 ^ 2 + 0.0..2 ^ 2 + \cdots + n ^ 2}{0.0..1}.$$ Is this conclusion correct?","['summation', 'algebra-precalculus', 'solution-verification']"

If one is being fancy, then this is a statement about pushforward measures. But I would like to know if one has a similarly simple result about calculating the higher central moments. If there is no closed form, then I should say I would be happy with the first four as a compromise. To be concrete, I have a smooth function $g:\mathbb{R}^2 \to [0,1]$, and $X$ is bivariate normal (so no worries about moments existing).","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions']"

92697,Recurrence relations and Generating functions - how to find the initial conditions?,"Best to ask by example. Given the recurrence relation $a_{n}=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$, and some given initial conditions, we can find a similar relation for the generating function for the sequence, $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n$: 
$$f(x)=xf(x)+x^2f(x)+c(x)$$
Where $c(x)$ is a polynomial encoding the initial conditions. My main question is how can this polynomial be computed as painlessly as possible from the initial conditions? This is interesting not only for Fibonacci but in general, of course. A similar, probably equivalent questions is this: If for some sequence we have a rational generating function $\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ then the coefficients of $q(x)$ are exactly the coefficients of the recurrence relation for the sequence. Also, $p(x)$ is dependent on the initial conditions - but again, it's not clear to me how to compute those initial conditions from $p(x)$.","['generating-functions', 'recurrence-relations', 'combinatorics']"

92719,Is there a binomial identity for this expression $\frac{\binom{r}{k}}{\binom{n}{k}}$?,"What I'm trying to prove is this summation:
$$\sum_{i=0}^{k} \dfrac{\dbinom{r}{i} \cdot \dbinom{n - r}{k - i}}{\dbinom{n}{k}} \cdot i = \dfrac{r}{n} \cdot k$$
I used induction on $k$ as follows: $$LHS = \sum_{i=0}^{k + 1} \dfrac{\dbinom{r}{i} \cdot \dbinom{n - r}{k + 1 - i}}{\dbinom{n}{k + 1}} \cdot i$$
            $$ = \sum_{i=0}^{k} \dfrac{\dbinom{r}{i} \cdot \dbinom{n - r}{k - i}}{\dbinom{n}{k}} \cdot i

            $$ = \dfrac{rk}{n} + \dfrac{\dbinom{r}{k + 1}}{\dbinom{n}{k+1}} \cdot (k + 1)$$ Then I was stuck with the expression $\dfrac{\dbinom{r}{k + 1}}{\dbinom{n}{k + 1}}$, where $k + 1 \leq r \leq n$.

92724,Boundedness in probability,"Suppose we have a set $M$ of random variables on a probability space. Then we defined boundedness of $M$ as, $M$ is bounded if $\sup_{X\in M}P(|X|>N) \to 0$ as $ N \to \infty$. This definition means that the measure of the set where the elements of $ M $ are big is very small, in fact tends to zero.
I have three questions to this definition and some further conclusions. Now suppose we have a unbounded set. My questions are: Unbounded would mean, that for every $N>0$ there exists an $ \epsilon >0 $ and a $ X \in M $ such that $ P(|X| > N) \ge \epsilon $. Is this conclusion right? If theres a sequence $ (X_n) $ of random variables, unbounded and positive, then there's a subsequence $ (X_{n_k}) $ and a $\lambda>0 $ such that $ P(|(X_{n_k})| > k)\ge \lambda $ for every $ k \in \mathbb{N}$. My observations so far to 2. 
After the comment of Srivatsan (see below), we therefore have:$ \exists \epsilon > 0 $ sucht that for all $ N>0 $ exists a $ X_n $ such that $ P(X_n(\omega) > N) \ge \epsilon $ Put $ N=1 $, hence there is a $ X_{n_1} $ sucht that $ P(X_{n_1} > 1 ) \ge \epsilon$. Now put $ N=2 $, hence there is a $ X_i $ such that $ P(X_i > 2) \ge \epsilon$. Now the problem is, why do I know that $ i> n_1 $ ? Otherwise it isn't a subsequence.

92733,A problem about stochastic convergence (I think),"I am trying to prove the convergence of the function $f_n = I_{[n,n+1]}$ to $f=0$, but first of all I don't in which way it converges, either in $\mathcal{L}_p$-measure or stochastically, or maybe some other form of convergence often used in measure-theory. For now I'm assuming it's stochastic convergence, as in the following: $$ \text{lim}_{n \rightarrow \infty} \, \mu(\{x \in \Re: |f_n(x)-f(x)| \geq \alpha\}\cap A )=0$$ must hold for all $\alpha \in \Re_{>0}$ and all $A \in \mathcal{B}(\Re)$  of finite measure.

92735,When are two diagonal matrices congruent?,"This is probably a question that does not admit a simple answer. However, I'd like to know whether there exist criteria that determine when two diagonal matrices are congruent. I have the suspicion that, if such criteria exist, they depend strongly from the base field. In fact, over a quadratically closed field two diagonal matrices are congruent iff they have the same rank and over real closed fields Sylvester theorem answers completely the question. But over other fields? By Witt decomposition, we can restrict ourselves to consider only the case in which $A$ and $B$ are anisotropic. Hence the question is: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field and let $A = \mathrm{diag}(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ and $B = \mathrm{diag}(b_1,\dots,b_n)$ be two diagonal matrices over the field $\mathbb{K}$ such that $^t x A x \neq 0$ and $^t x B x \neq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{K}^n \setminus \{ 0 \}$. (In particular $a_i \neq 0$ and $b_i \neq 0$).

92737,Geometry problem from a Berkeley course,"I've been trying to solve this problem proposed as part of one of the first lectures of a Berkeley linear algebra course: ""What Good is a Basis ?
The freedom to choose a basis often simplifies calculations and proofs. For instance, here is a
phenomenon first noticed by G. Desargues (1593 - 1662), a contemporary of R. Descartes:
In the plane, fix two intersecting straight lines B and C and a point p on neither.
Through p draw two straight lines X and Y that intersect B and C in four points all
told. Two pairs of those points are not yet joined by straight lines; draw those lines now
and, if they intersect, call their intersection q . As X and Y move, always passing
through p , so does q move; show that it moves along some fixed straight line D .
To prove the existence of D takes some ingenuity if none but the methods of Euclidean plane
geometry may be used; and if rectangular Cartesian coordinates must be used the proof is a
tedious computation. But a relatively short computation suffices if we choose an apt basis.
Test these claims by trying to verify Desargues’ observation above using only the ideas you
learned in High-School. Then you will be better able to appreciate the strategy motivating
vector notation and its algebra used in the following proof."" The construction suggested reminds me of concepts like Ceva's theorem, complete quadrangle, internal/external division, which I learned about in Geometria Moderna (Modern Geometry required subject for math majors at UNAM Mexico). Sadly, though, I can't think of a way to use any of those concepts to solve the problem. Suggestions, please!","['vector-spaces', 'geometry', 'linear-algebra']"
92741,Properly Defining a Smooth Curve,"I have seen many different definitions of what it means for a curve to be ""smooth"". In this question , for instance,  a curve $\gamma \colon [a,b] \longrightarrow \mathbb{R^n}$ is defined to be smooth if all derivatives exist and are continuous. This seems reasonable and in-line with what it means for any manifold to be smooth. See, however, Edwards Calculus of Several Variables where a smooth curve is defined (actually, he uses the word ""path""):A curve $\gamma \colon [a,b] \longrightarrow \mathbb{R^n}$  is said to be smooth if the derivative $\gamma^{\prime}(t)$ exists, is continuous and if $\gamma^{\prime}(t) \neq 0 \;\; \forall t \in [a,b]$. Ignoring the fact that Edwards is only concerned with $C^{1}$ curves as opposed to $C^{\infty}$ curves, that this definition requires the derivative to be nonzero obviously makes it different from the first definition. Now, consider yet another definition, this time from Wade's Introduction to Analysis (3rd Edition): A subset $C$ of $\mathbb{R}^m$ is called a $C^p$ curve in $\mathbb{R}^m$ if and only if there is a nondegenerate interval $I$ and a $C^p$ function $\gamma \colon I \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ that is injective on the interior of $I$ and $C = \gamma(I)$ Ignoring the fact that Wade is defining a curve as a set of points instead of its parametrization, this definition also differs from the first two in that $\gamma$ is required to be injective. So, finally, here is my question: Is there a definition, or set of definitions, that could bring some consistency to this terminology? Perhaps there's a special name for a ""curve"" that is ""injective"" in addition to being ""smooth""? Or, maybe there's a special name for a curve that never evaluates to the $0$-vector anywhere on it's domain? It seems to me that these are different attributes and should probably have distinctive nomenclature.","['differential-geometry', 'real-analysis']"

92831,How can I prove that the additive group of rationals is not isomorphic to a direct product of two nontrivial groups?,"I am working through Paolo Aluffi's new GSM text on my own (self-study).
On page 63, he asks the reader to Prove that $\Bbb{Q}$ is not the direct product of two nontrivial groups. For some context, this is an exercise following a section entitled ""The category Grp"".  I am assuming that he means ""is not isomorphic to the direct product of two nontrivial groups"", and I can see two possible ways to proceed with this proof, but have been unsuccessful with either approach. Approach 1:  Show that the additive group of rationals has a property that is preserved by isomorphism that the direct product of two nontrivial groups does not have or vice-versa.  This seems challenging unless I can significantly narrow down the properties that a direct product of two nontrivial groups that was isomorphic to $\Bbb{Q}$ would necessarily have. Approach 2:  Considering the section in which this question occurs, show that if $G$ and $H$ are nontrivial groups and $\Bbb{Q} \cong G \times H$, then there are homomorphisms $\varphi_{G}:\Bbb{Q} \rightarrow G$ and $\varphi_{H}:\Bbb{Q} \rightarrow H$ which do not factor or do not factor uniquely through the product $G \times H$.

92870,Non-trivial solutions for cyclotomic polynomials,"I am seeking algebraic expressions which solve a polynomial equation, in particular an arbitrary cyclotomic polynomial. Let us agree we are not talking about expressions such as $e^{2\pi/7}$. My problem is to distinguish between those expressions I am going to call ""trivial"" and ""non-trivial"". Typically, algebraic expressions with radical signs admit of multiple choices for the value of the radical expression: two for a square root, three for a cube root, etc. I will define a ""non-trivial"" algebraic solution as an expression in radicals such that for any choice of values, the expression is always a solution of the equation. Example: for any quadratic equation, there are two choices for the square root, and both choices give correct solutions. For the fifth cyclotomic polynomial, the solution (which I looked up) is given by the expression:
\[
\frac{\sqrt5 - 1}4 + \frac{\sqrt{-5 - \sqrt5}}8
\]
This expression takes on four possible values, and each of them is in fact a true solution of the fifth cyclotomic polynomial. It might look like it takes on eight values because there are three choices of the square root, but two of them must be the same choice: you cannot take one value for the square root of five, and then later in the same expression switch to the other value. On the other hand, we have an alternative solution for the same polynomial: 
\[
1^{1/5}
\]
I define this as a ""trivial"" solution because it takes on five possible values, but only four of them are true solutions of the fifth cyclotomic polynomial. This expression is, of course, a non-trivial solution of the non-irreducible polynomial $x^5 - 1 = 0$, but that's not the polynomial we're talking about. I recently posted a similar question , which I believe was correctly answered by Paul Garret, but I am not at all sure that everyone who participated in the discussion was actually working on the same question. I hope this clarifies the situation. My question, then, was and is: do all the cyclotomic polynomials have ""non-trivial"" solutions? If not, what is the smallest polynomial for which such a solution (a) is not known, or (b) can be shown not to exist? I cannot believe this question is nonsense, and I would be very surprised if it hasn't been answered in the literature. EDIT I am extremely gratifying that you guys had some fun with my question. I have always loved this topic and I think it is the greatest miracle of all math that the six choices of the cubic formula (three cube roots and two square roots) can be made to logically and unambiguously collapse to exactly three values. Because I have only one check mark to award for ""accepted answer"", from many deserving contributors, I award my coveted check-mark to Ben. Thanks again guys.","['abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"
92900,Errata for Dieudonné's Treatise on Analysis volume 2 second edition,"I was looking again at the beautiful and quite complete work of Dieudonné, his Treatise of Analysis, to refresh my memory about some aspects of classical analysis. I especially love this Treatise for the quality of its exercises. Unfortunately, some of them are marred with plain mistakes (see for instance this question Separability of the set of positive measures ) or wrong hints, and make me waste a lot of time detecting all of them. Does anybody know a reliable errata for the volume 2 of this treatise ? Here below are one instance of a plain wrong hint in an exercise, and a sketch of a solution I found for it. I would very much appreciate if somebody could give some kind of reassurance that I am on the right track here and that my solution is correct. Here is the text of the exercise: The hint is obviously wrong because it is not possible to have the inequality $b\mu(A\cap F_q)\leq a\mu(A)$ for $q=n$ for instance. Below is a solution I found for comments Notation for $p\geq n\geq 0$ : $$\begin{align*}
A_{n}^p &=\left\{x\in X\ ;\ \sup_{p\geq r\geq n}f_{r}(x)\geq b\right\} \\
B_{n}^p &=\left\{x\in X\ ;\ \inf_{p\geq r\geq n}f_{r}(x)\leq a\right\} \\
\end{align*}$$ and $$\begin{alignat*}{2}
A_{n} &=\bigcup_{p\geq n} A_{n}^p &\quad B_{n} &=\bigcup_{p\geq n} B_{n}^p \\
A &=\bigcap_{n\geq 0}A_{n} &\quad B &=\bigcap_{n\geq 0}B_{n}
\end{alignat*}$$ Then we have $E_{ab}=A\cap B$. We also note that the unions and intersections in the previous definitions are respectively increasing and decreasing sequences. Choose $r\geq s\geq p\geq q\geq m\geq n$.
First we notice that $$A_{n}^m = \bigcup_{m\geq i\geq n} \left\{x\in X\ ;\ f_{n}(x)<b, \cdots, f_{i-1}(x)<b,\ f_{i}(x)\geq b\right\}$$ the union being of disjoints sets.
By definition of a martingale, for $i\leq m$, we have $$\int_{x\in X\ ;\ f_n(x)<\cdots,f_{i−1}(x)<b,\ f_i(x\geq b} f_i\ d\mu=\int_{x\in X\ ;\ f_n(x)<\cdots,f_{i−1}(x)<b,\ f_i(x\geq b}f_m\ d\mu$$
Then, we get $$\int_{A_n^m}f_{m}d\mu \geq b\mu(A_{n}^m)$$
For the same reasons, we also get $$\int_{B_{n}^m}f_{m}d\mu \leq a\mu(B_{n}^m)$$ Therefore, we deduce that $$\int_{A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p \cap A_{s}^r}f_{r} d\mu \geq b\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p \cap A_{s}^r)$$ and $$\int_{A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p \cap A_{s}^r}f_{r}d\mu \leq \int_{A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p}f_{r}d\mu =\int_{A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p}f_{p}d\mu \leq a\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p) \leq a\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B_{q})$$ Let $$b\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B_{q}^p \cap A_{s}^r) \leq a\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B_{q})$$ By successively having $r$ then $s$ then $p$ then $q$ goes towards infinity we get $$b\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B \cap A)\leq a\mu(A_{n}^m\cap B)$$
If $m$ then $n$ goes towards infinity we get $$b\mu(E_{ab})\leq a\mu(E_{ab})$$ QEA.","['measure-theory', 'analysis']"

92935,AM-GM-HM Triplets,"I want to understand what values can be simultaneously attained as the arithmetic (AM), geometric (GM), and harmonic (HM) means of finite sequences of positive real numbers. Precisely, for what points $(G, H) \in \mathbb R^2_{\geqslant 0}$, do there exist a $n$-tuple $a = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) \in \mathbb R^n_{\geqslant 0}$ such that
$$
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{AM}(a) &= 1,
\\  \operatorname{GM}(a) &= G,
\\ \operatorname{HM}(a) &= H.
\end{align*}
$$
Here the constraint on AM provides an implicit normalisation on the $n$-tuple. Note that the AM-GM-HM inequality implies that such an $(G, H)$ must lie in the lower right half of the unit square given by $$ \quad 1 \geqslant G \geqslant H \geqslant 0.\tag{$\ast$}$$ I think that the problem is quite hard for a general $n$, so I will be content with $n = 4$. In fact, I will also be happy to see any bounds improving on $(\ast)$, either for general $n$ or for specific small values of $n$. Below I sketch the solution for $n= 2$ and $n=3$. Case $n=2$. It turns out that, for any pair of numbers $(a_1, a_2)$, the three means satisfy a tight relation: $\operatorname{AM} \cdot \operatorname{HM} = \operatorname{GM}^2$. That is, all our points must lie on the parabola $H = G^2$. Case $n=3$. Now the tight relationship between the means disappears; however, the situation is still rigid enough to permit an algebraic solution. It is easy to check that the three numbers are roots of the cubic equation
$$
x^3 - 3 \operatorname{AM}  x^2 + 3 \frac{\operatorname{GM}^3}{\operatorname{HM}} x - \operatorname{GM}^3 = 0,
$$
which rearranges to
$$
H x^3 - 3H x^2 + 3 G^3 x - G^3 H = 0.
$$
We want this equation to have three real, nonnegative roots. It is well-known† that this is equivalent to the condition that the discriminant of the cubic is nonnegative:
$$
\begin{array}{crl}
& 27 (6 G^6 H^3+3 G^6 H^2 -4 G^9 H-G^6 H^4-4 G^3 H^4) &\geqslant 0
\\ \iff & 6 G^3 H^2+3 G^3 H -4 G^6- G^3 H^3-4 H^3 &\geqslant 0.
\end{array}
$$ Here is a plot of this region for $n=3$ (with $G$ along the $x$-axis and $H$ along the $y$-axis): Question. To restate my question: Can you give any bounds on the AM-GM-HM region for any $n \geqslant 4$ that beats $(\ast)$? In fact, the following conjecture looks plausible: Conjecture. For any $n$, there exists $c = c_n > 0$ such that the following holds for any $n$-tuple of positive reals:
  $$
\operatorname{AM} + c \operatorname{HM} \geqslant (1+c) \operatorname{GM}.
$$
  That is, the region lies entirely to the left of the line $G = \frac{1}{1+c} + \frac{c}{1+c} H$. This conjecture is inspired by an earlier post that essentially claims that $c = \frac{33}{50}$ works for $n=5$.‡ The proposed answer in that thread suggests using Lagrange multipliers. But unfortunately, it seems to me that it is rather too sparse on the details; I am not entirely sure how fruitful this approach would be. * †See the Wikipedia article on solving a cubic equation . ‡The equivalence between the stated problem and my question is explained clearly in Zarrax's answer in that thread . *The answer is now deleted.

I'd like to be able to prove it without choosing a basis (the symplectic analogue to a question I asked recently about inner products ), and I think it should be possible, but so far I've been unable. Let $\omega\in \Lambda^2 V^*$, where $V$ is an inner product space of dim $2n$. I want to show that $\omega^n=0 \Leftrightarrow\omega$ is degenerate. $\Leftarrow:$ $\omega$ is degenerate, so there is some element $u\in V$ with $\omega(u,v)=0, \forall v\in V.$ Then let $\{e^i\}$ be a basis containing $u$. Therefore $\omega^n(e_1\wedge\dotsb\wedge e_{2n})=0,$ and any other $2n$-vector is collinear with $e_1\wedge\dotsb\wedge e_{2n},$ so $\omega^n=0.$ $\Rightarrow:$ Given the canonical isomorphism $V\cong V^*$, we have an associated element $\omega^\sharp=\sum_i q^i\wedge p^i.$ Let $W$ be the span of the $q^i,p^i.$ If there are fewer than $2n$ distinct elements in $\{q^i,p^i\}_i$, then $\dim W<2n$ so there is a vector $u\in W^\perp$ which is in the kernel of $\omega.$ If there are $2n$ distinct $q^i,p^i$, hence exactly $n$ terms in the sum then $\omega^n=q^1\wedge p^1\wedge\dotsb \wedge p^n\wedge q^n$, but since $\omega^n=0$, there is some linear dependence among the $q^i,p^i$, so the dimension of their span is again less than $2n$, so we have an element in the kernel. If there are more than $n$ terms, then $\omega^n$ will be a sum of volume elements, which we stipulate vanishes. Can I find an element of the kernel here? (One way maybe is to say $\omega^n=\operatorname{Pf}(\omega)\text{vol}$ which vanishes iff $\det\omega$ does, but this seems like cheating) (Previous apparently nonsensical argument below:because $\omega$ is nondegenerate, we have an isomorphism $\tilde{\omega}\colon V\to V^*$ given by $v \mapsto (u\mapsto \omega(v,u))$. This induces an isomorphism $\det(\tilde{\omega})\colon \Lambda^{2n} V\to \Lambda^{2n} V^*$. Then let $u = u_1\wedge \dotsb \wedge u_{2n}$ and $v = v_1\wedge \dotsb \wedge v_{2n}$ be rank $2n$ multivectors in $\Lambda^{2n} V$ ... next step??

93036,Reference for densities and pseudoforms and non-tensorial representations of $\operatorname{GL}(n)$ and associated vector bundles,"I'm looking for a reference that will set me straight on a few things. It started out with densities. In John Lee's book, ""Introduction to Smooth Manifolds"", densities on vector spaces are functions that satisfy $$\mu(Tv_1,\dotsc,Tv_n)=|\det\; T\,|\;\mu(v_1,\dotsc,v_n)$$ for $T:V\to V$. They're like volume forms composed with absolute values. Densities are defined on manifolds and transform the obvious way under changes of coordinates. They're nice because you can integrate them in the absence of an orientation. And they're natural because the structure group is an irreducible representation of $\operatorname{GL}(n)$. This representation is a little bit unfamiliar in that it is not constructed out of tensor products of the fundamental rep and its dual. One of the reasons that symmetric and antisymmetric tensors on a manifold are important is because their structure groups belong to irreducible representations of $\operatorname{GL}(n)$. Googling for more information on the subject let me to an old USENET thread where I learned among other things that things that pick up a sign under negative determinant change of basis are called pseudoforms, not densities. Any (symmetric, antisymmetric, form, vector, etc.) can be turned ""pseudo"" by tensoring it with the determinant bundle. Densities are things with an exponent in their change of basis formulas, and these also form an irrep of $\operatorname{GL}(n)$. Jet bundles are another example of a bundle whose structure group is not a tensor product I'm left with some questions What are densities? Are they what Lee says, or what the USENET guys say? Are there differing conventions? If you use the word ""density"" for Lee's definition, then what do you call the thing with the exponent? Are there other nontensorial reps than density and pseudoforms? What about jet bundles? What about a rep of the universal cover of $\operatorname{GL}(n)$? I know that for $\operatorname{SO}(n)$ this gives us spinor reps. What about $\operatorname{GL}(n)$? And what about $\operatorname{SO}(n)$ and subgroups of $\operatorname{GL}(n)$? I would like a good reference text that covers this material in depth. Especially as it relates to differential topology on smooth manifolds.

In attempting to lead a bunch of high school students to an understanding of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, I've run into a problem determining the Euler characteristic of a cube with a square hole through it.  The problem is that the surface is like that of a torus, and so ought to have $\chi = 0$, but a simple counting of $V$, $F$, and $E$ yields $\chi = 2$. I have a wide range of abilities in my class, so I need to motivate this theorem without the use of calculus.  My hope was that by examining polyhedra of different types, they would come to ""discover"" a connection between the Euler characteristic, the total angle defect, and the number of holes through the surface, but now I'm stuck trying to come up with a way to rig the counting to make $\chi$ come out right.

How could we do that with a dimension higher, if we say that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are sides of cubes, and we position the cubes in a 3D (x, y, z) coordinate system.

The area of the triangle was a dead end (as far as we could find, the area ($\frac{\sqrt{769}}{2}$)has nothing to do with the number 6), and we couldn't think of anything more.

Here $\mathcal{Q}$ denotes the quotient sheaf. From this we get a long exact sequence in cohomology which starts as $1 \to H^0(\mathcal{O}_Y^*) \to H^0(f_*\mathcal{O}_X^*) \to H^0(\mathcal{Q}) \to H^1(\mathcal{O}_Y^*) \to H^1(f_*\mathcal{O}_X^*) \to H^1(\mathcal{Q}).$ Here we know the first two terms, and $H^1(\mathcal{O}_Y^*) = Pic(Y)$.

Assume an element in $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$ , because we can write: $\sqrt{6} = \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{2} $ and $\sqrt{6} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{3}$ the sum of $b\sqrt{3} + c\sqrt{2}$ is equal to a fraction of $\sqrt{6}$. So $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}) = \mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{6})$.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

93498,Multivariate integrals involving Dirac delta functions,"I'm interested in the behavior of Dirac deltafunctions within multivariate integrals. Here is a simple example to which I do not know the answer: $$\iint\limits_{[0,1]\times [0,1]} \delta\left(x - y\right)\, dA$$ This integrates the constant function $1$ over the line $y=x$. Is there a prefactor involed though due to the delta? I can imagine this evaluating either to $1$ or to $\sqrt2$. The information from the relevant Wikipedia page suggests the value $\sqrt2$ while WolframAlpha suggests the value $1$. How is the behavior of a Dirac deltafunction within a multivariate integral defined? My goal is to create an algorithm to solve a broad class of these problems in general.","['multivariable-calculus', 'special-functions', 'integration']"
93499,Normal sylow subgroup of a finite group is characteristic,Let $P$ be a normal sylow $p$-subgroup of a finite group $G$. Since $P$ is normal it is the unique sylow $p$-subgroup. I would like to say if $\phi$ is an automorphism then $\phi(P)$ is also a sylow $p$-subgroup. Then uniqueness would finish the proof. But is that true? Does an automorphism of a group always send subgroups to subgroups of the same order?,"['sylow-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'normal-subgroups']"

Which these there methods is faster? I can say that the answer is not ""3"", but at least can you compare the first two methods for me? Is there any other numeric method which is better (faster and/or more reliable) than the ones in the list? My matrix class can also do QR decomposition and can solve linear matrix equations in Ax=b format; can these features be used in determinant calculation?","['matrices', 'determinant', 'numerical-methods']"
