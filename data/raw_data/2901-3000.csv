20488,A question on the proof of the De Bruijn-Erdos theorem,"I just read a very short paper on the De Bruijn-Erdos theorem. It essentially states that if we have $n$ points and $m$ lines, where any two points lie on a line, and each line has at least two points, then there are at least as many lines as points. The proof is in this short paper . It is stated at the very top, and the proof I'm curious about begins in the middle of page 2 and ends at the top of page 3. I don't quite follow the inequalities 
$$
s_j\leq k_n\ \text{for}\ j>\nu
$$
that are found at the very top of page 3. Why would that fact that an index $j$ being greater than the minimum number of lines passing through a given point require that the number of points on that indexed line is at most the number of lines passing through that point? Apart from that I follow the rest. Does it violate one of the assumptions about the space? Thanks.",['geometry']
20503,Ahlfors's proof of analytic functions reducing to a constant,"I'm reading the beginning of chapter 3 of Ahlfors where he starts to introduce analytic functions in regions, and I had a question on a part of Theorem 11: Let $f=u+iv$ be an analytic function in a region $\Omega$. If the modulus of $f$ is constant, then $f$ must reduce to a constant. His proof starts out as follows: If $|f|=u^2+v^2$ is constant, then $ u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 0$, and $ u \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = -u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0$.

20514,"The set of all sets of two elements does not exist, but the set of sets of two elements of a given set does?","I'm trying to wrap my head around this concept of extracting sets from a given set to show that a subset is indeed a subset. Suppose I want to show that the set of all sets of two elements does not exist. I approach it like this. Suppose such a set $V$ exists of all elements containing exactly the sets of two elements. Then for any nonempty set $X$, the set $\{X,\emptyset\}$ is a set, by the pairing axiom, and since $X\neq\emptyset$, $\{X,\emptyset\}$ has two elements, so $\{X,\emptyset\}\in V$ for all sets $X$. Then by the power set axiom, $\bigcup V$ is the set of all sets, since $\emptyset\in\bigcup V$, and any nonempty set $X\in\bigcup V$ as well. But the set of all sets does not exist, a contradiction, so such a set $V$ does not exist. Does this approach work? However, if I'm given a nonempty set $A$, is the following a proper formulation that shows that the set of all sets of the form $\{a,b\}$ for $a,b\in A$ is a set? If $a,b\in A$, then $\{a,b\}\subset A$, and $\{a,b\}\in\mathscr{P}(A)$. Assuming that $a$ and $b$ need not be distinct, consider
$$
\{t\in\mathscr{P}(A)\ |\ \exists x\exists y(x\in A\land y\in A\land t=\{x,y\}\}.

This is a set by the subset schema. Have I correctly specified the type of sets I want, or do I need to include something about if $z\in t\implies z=x\vee z=y$?, or is that unnecessary? Thanks.",['elementary-set-theory']
20519,Question regarding Weierstrass M-test,"The Weierstrass M-test tells that given a function sequence $(u_{n}(x))$ where $x \in I$, if there exists a convergent series $\sum a_{n}$ such that $|u_{n}(x)|\leq a_{n}$ for all $n$ and $x\in I$, then $\sum u_{n}(x)$ converges uniformly in $I$. What about the opposite of it? If $\sum u_{n}(x)$ converges uniformly in $I$, then there exists a convergent series $\sum g_{n}$ such that $|u_{n}(x)|\leq g_{n}$ for all $n$ and $x \in I$. Since the theorem isn't in the form of 'if and only if', I'm trying to think of an example to counter the above: My attempt was to define a function sequence such as this: Then taking $u_{1}(x)=f_{1}(x),\ u_{n}(x)=f_{n}(x)-f_{n-1}(x)$. It can be shown that $f_{n}(x)$ converges uniformly in $[1, \infty)$, therefore $u_{n}(x)$ does as well. But $|u_{n}(1)|=|f_{n}(1)|$ which is the constant sequence: $1, 1, 1, ...$. If we assume by contradiction that there exists such a sequence $1\leq g_{n}$ that $\sum g_{n}$ converges then by the comparison test $\sum 1$ converges which is obviously not true. First, I'd like to know if the above is true. It took me quite a while to come up with something and I'm not even sure it's true. Also, It's very difficult for me to visualize these complicated functions (like the one above) where both $x$ and $n$ play a role. Is there an easier way to deal with these questions?","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

20631,For any even function $f$ there is infinite number of functions $g$ such that $f(x) = g(|x|)$,"This is question from Spivak's Calculus.
Question statement (paraphrased): For any even function $f$ there is infinite number of functions $g$ such that $f(x) = g(|x|)$ I have made attempt at proof, here is my work. My main concern is whether my proof that there are infinite such functions is correct. Let $g$ be a function such that for any positive $x$, $f(x) = g(x)$ and let $f$ be some even function. We will show that above equality then holds even when $x$ is negative: $f(-x) = g(|-x|) \Leftrightarrow f(x) = g(x)$, which is true by definition of these functions. It now remains to show that there is infinite number of those functions. I understand that is so because $g$ can be defined as one whishes for negative numbers and it won't change equality. But I cannot think of formal proof. I'm thinking about assigning values to functions $g$ in a way that I define $g_{1}(-1) = k$ and then making infinite number of them by induction: for any function $g_{n}(x) = k$, if x is negative, we define $g_{n+1}(x-1) = k$. Then by the fact that there is infinite natural numbers, and for every natural number there is going to be unique function, we can conclude there is infinite number of functions. Is the concept of induction applicable here or is it not?","['calculus', 'functions']"
20634,Comb space has no simply connected cover,"I'm having trouble solving the following exercise in Hatcher's Algebraic Topology(1.3 #5): ""Let $X$ be the subspace of $R^2$ consisting of the four sides of the square $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ together with the segments of the vertical lines $x=\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{4},\ldots$ inside the square. Show that for every covering space $\tilde{X}\to X$ there is some neighbourhood of the left edge of $X$ that lifts homeomorphically to $\tilde{X}$. Deduce that $X$ has no simply-connected cover."" I tried piecing together open sets in $\tilde{X}$ which were homeomorphic to open square shaped $\epsilon$-neighbourhoods of points in the left edge of $X$, but I couldn't glue them together coherently. My second idea was to use the path lifting property to lift the left edge, but I couldn't extend it to a lift of an open neighbourhood of the left edge. Edit : Some more detail on my first attempt: Suppose I have two open squares $U_1$ and $U_2$ in $X$ (containing the left edge) with nonempty intersection, and that have preimages $\coprod_i U_{1,i}$ and $\coprod_j U_{2,j}$ with each piece of that mapping homeomorphically onto $U_1$ and $U_2$ respectively. Suppose I've chosen a specific $U_{1,i}$, and I want to choose a specific $U_{2,j}$ so that their union maps homeomorphically to $U_1$ union $U_2$. Such a choice can be specified by a point in the chosen $U_{1,i}$ that maps into $U_2$, but for each such point, there could be a different choice of $j$. My intution tells me that to make this choice, one needs to appeal to the bad local nature of the left edge of $X$, (so that you're certain to get some of the vertical lines inside of the desired open set) but I'm not sure how to proceed with that.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"
20638,Is the dual covector field of a nonzero vector field closed?,"Given a nowhere vanishing vector field, say $E_1$, on a manifold $M^n$, it should be possible to extend this locally to a basis of vector fields $E_1,\ldots , E_n$ so that $E_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$ for some coordinates $x_i$. (For example, locally we can choose a chart where $E_1$ looks like $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}$ and then just define $E_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$). For such a frame there we may define a co-frame on $T^*M$, $\varphi^i$ so that $\varphi^i(E_j) = \delta_{ij}$. By the intrinsic definition of the exterior derivative,
\begin{equation} d\varphi^1(E_i,E_j) = E_i(\varphi^1(E_i)) - E_j(\varphi^1(E_j) - \varphi^1([E_i,E_j]) . \end{equation}
The first two terms will be zero as they are the derivative of either the constant function 0 or 1. Similarly, $[E_i,E_j] = [\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i},\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}] \equiv 0$. Finally, since $d\varphi^1$ is a two form, we see by linearity that $d\varphi^1 \equiv 0$ . In fact, any nonvanishing 1-form $\omega$ can (locally) be expressed as the dual of a nonvanishing vector in some coordinate framing. This would seem to imply that any nowhere zero 1-form has zero exterior derivative. Since I do not believe this is true, there must be some flaw to my reasoning, but I cannot see it.","['geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

20670,Theorem of Arzelà-Ascoli,"The more general version of this theorem in Munkres' 'Topology' (p. 290 - 2nd edition) states that Given a locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ and a metric space $(Y,d)$; a family $\mathcal F$ of continuous functions has compact closure in $\mathcal C (X,Y)$ (topology of compact convergence) if and only if it is equicontinuous under $d$ and the sets $$ \mathcal F _a = \{f(a) | f \in \mathcal F\} \qquad a \in X$$ have compact closure in $Y$. Now I do not see why the Hausdorff condition on $X$ should be necessary? Why include it then?

20806,Explanation/Intuition behind why $C_n$ counts the number of triangulations of a convex $n+2$-gon?,"I was reading about the Catalan numbers on wikipedia, because it seems like they show up quite a bit. I'm reading some of the examples in the applications to combinatorics section. Some of them make sense fairly easily for me. For example, I see that the number of ways to parenthesize a product of $n+1$ terms $x_0,x_1,\dots, x_n$ is $C_n$, since the final multiplication $\cdot$ based on the parentheses must show up between two factors $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$, and the way to parenthesize those terms $x_0,\dots,x_k$ and $x_{k+1},\dots,x_n$ are $C_k$ and $C_{n-k-1}$, respectively . Since this final $\cdot$ could show up anywhere, I get the recurrence
$$
C_n=C_0C_{n-1}+C_1C_{n-2}+\cdots +C_{n-1}C_0
$$
which is the same as the Catalan numbers, given that the initial conditions are the same. In the same way, I see that the number of binary rooted trees with $n+1$ leaves is also given by $C_n$, since a binary tree essentially determines a parenthesization of a product of $n+1$ leaves if two leaves are enclosed in parentheses if they have the same parent node, and you follow the tree from the leaves up. I also understand the way it counts monotonic paths not passing the diagonal, as the first time a path touches the diagonal is like the position of the final multiplication on a product of $n$ terms, and splits the product into two smaller, but essentially similar subcases. But how does triangulating an $n+2$-gon give the same counting situation? I figured if you choose a vertex and draw a triangle with it as one of the vertices, it should give two other polygons that should suggest a recurrence relation like the one above, just like the Catalan numbers. Could someone point it out, or possibly show a way to relate it to one of the other identical counting situations which I understood? I don't quite see how this situation is the same.

20843,A direct proof of the properties of the matrix of minors,"Let $A$ be an invertible $n\times n$ matrix.  Define the matrix of minors $\Delta(A)$ of $A$ to be the matrix whose $(i,j)$ entry is the determinant of the minor of $A$ with the $i$ th row and $j$ column omitted. Certainly, the most important property of $\Delta(A)$ is that it is instrumental in computing the inverse of $A$ : $$ A^{-1}= \frac{1}{\operatorname{det}(A)}\sigma\cdot \Delta(A)^T\cdot \sigma$$ where here, $\sigma$ is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries alternate $1$ and $-1$ . From this fact and elementary properties of the inverse, it is easy to prove the following Taking the matrix of minors is an involution up to scaling; that is, $\Delta(\Delta(A))=\operatorname{det}(A)^{n-2}\cdot A$ Taking the matrix of minors is an group homomorphism; that is, $\Delta(AB)=\Delta(A)\Delta(B)$ . If you actually write out either of these identities in terms of minors, you get a series of non-trivial-looking identities on the minors of an invertible matrix. Is this the easiest way to obtain these identities on minors?  It would bother me if it was, for a couple of reasons.  First, it seems extremely likely that the second identity above holds for non-invertible matrices.  Second, if $A$ is totally positive or non-negative (that is, every minor of every size is positive or non-negative), then so is $\Delta(A)$ .  However, the inverse of a totally positive matrix will almost never be totally positive, and so the above proof of the identities will stray off the totally positive path. Therefore, Can the identities on minors implied by the above relations on $\Delta$ be proven in a more direct way? Ideally, this proof would be 'subtraction-free', to make it more natural in the totally-positive setting. Edit: I should be a little bit more clear about what sort of thing I am looking for.  I am interested in spaces of totally-positive matrices and the corresponding algebras generated by minors on them (specifically, they are cluster algebras).  An important involution of these spaces and algebras is the matrix of minors defined above.  Note that taking inverses or cofactors does not preserve totally positivity, and so it doesn't act on this space. Mainly, I asked this question because I was annoyed at using a map whose properties couldn't be proven without passing to a different, bigger space (not that this doesn't happen all the time in math).  I was curious if there was a proof along algebraic lines, following only from the simplest relations on minors (the 3-term Plucker relations).","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"

(3.19.1) is the fact that the connected subspaces of $\mathbf{R}$ are intervals and that intervals are connected.

There are lots of nice examples of continuous bijections $X\to Y$ between topological spaces that are not homeomorphisms.

My Question: Is there a connected topological space $X$ and a continuous bijection $X\to X$ that is not a homeomorphism? For the record, my example of a continuous bijection $X\to X$ that is not a homeomorphism is the following.  Roughly, the idea is to find an ordered family of topologies $\tau_i$ (
$i\in \mathbb Z$) on a set $S$ and use the shift map to create a continuous bijection from $\coprod_{i\in \mathbb Z} (S, \tau_i)$ to itself.  Let $S = \mathbb{Z} \coprod \mathbb Z$.  The topology $\tau_i$ is as follows: if $i<0$, then the left-hand copy of $\mathbb Z$ is topologized as the disjoint union of the discrete topology on $[-n, n]$ and the indiscrete topology on its complement, while the right-hand copy of $\mathbb Z$ is indiscrete.  The space $(S, \tau_0)$ is then indiscrete.  For $i>0$, the left-hand copy of $\mathbb Z$ is indiscrete, while the right-hand copy is the disjoint union of the indiscrete topology on $[-n, n]$ with the discrete topology on its complement.  Now the map $\coprod_{i\in \mathbb Z} (S, \tau_i)\to \coprod_{i\in \mathbb Z} (S, \tau_i)$ sending $(S, \tau_i) \to (S, \tau_{i+1})$ by the identity map of $S$ is a continuous bijection, but not a homeomorphism.",['general-topology']

I'll first explain the context, after which I'll pose my precise question. We want to prove that the functions of the form $e^{-x}p(x)$, where $p$ is a polynomial, are dense in the set of continuous functions defined on $[0,\infty)$ which tends to 0 at $+\infty$, equipped with the sup norm. For this, we apply Stone-Weierstrass on the completion $[0,+\infty]$, and consider the algebra generated from the functions of the form $\sum_{n=1}^N e^{-nx}p_n(x)$ (to which we add also the constant functions). Next, we need to show that we can uniformly approximate the functions $e^{-nx}p(x)$ by functions of the form $e^{-x}q(x)$. Lang suggests to first approximate $e^{-2x}$ by functions of the form $e^{-x}q(x)$ using Taylor's theorem with remainders. Then consider $e^{-nx}p(x)$ in general. I think I know how to do the first step. For the second step, the $n\geq 3$ cases are easy. On the other hand, I don't know how to treat the case $n=2$. So here's my question: can we approximate a function of the form $x^me^{-2x}$, where $m\in\mathbb{N}$, uniformly over $[0,\infty)$, by functions of the form $e^{-x}q(x)$, where $q$ is a polynomial?

The authors make use of some clever lemma and make an observation that $diag(n) = n + 1 - r_3(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil)$. Here, $r_3(.)$ denotes the minimum value $k$ such that any $k$-element subset of $[n]$ contains a $k$ term arithmetic progression (a la Roth's theorem statement).

Here is my problem: I know I need to solve the right side to be: 
$$\frac{e^{ax}\left(a\cos(bx) + b\sin(bx)\right)}{a^2+b^2} + C.$$ To divide by the constant, I multiplied everything on the right side by 
$$\frac{a^2}{b^2+1}.$$
but this leads me to get $b^2 + 1$ on the bottom instead of $a^2 + b^2$. I will show what I am doing in detail: After setting the initial integral equal to:
$$\frac{1}{a}e^{ax}\cos(bx) + \frac{b}{a}\left(\frac{1}{a}e^{ax}\sin(bx) - \frac{b}{a}\int e^{ax}\cos(bx)\,dx\right) + C$$
I simplify:
$$\int e^{ax}\cos(bx)\,dx = \frac{a^2}{b^2+1}\left(\frac{1}{a}e^{ax}\cos(bx) + \frac{b}{a}\left(\frac{1}{a}e^{ax}\sin(bx)\right)\right) + C$$ If this is already wrong, can someone point be in the right direction?

21076,Choice of $q$ in Baby Rudin's Example 1.1,"First, my apologies if this has already been asked/answered.  I wasn't able to find this question via search. My question comes from Rudin's ""Principles of Mathematical Analysis,"" or ""Baby Rudin,"" Ch 1, Example 1.1 on p. 2.  In the second version of the proof, showing that sets A and B do not have greatest or lowest elements respectively, he presents a seemingly arbitrary assignment of a number $q$ that satisfies equations (3) and (4), plus other conditions needed to show that $q$ is the right number for the proof.  As an exercise, I tried to derive his choice of $q$ so that I may learn more about the problem. If we write equations (3) as $q = p - (p^2 - 2)x$ , we can write (4) as $$
q^2 - 2 = (p^2 - 2)[1 - 2px + (p^2 - 2)x^2].
$$ Here, we need a rational $x > 0$ , chosen such that the expression in $[...]$ is positive.  Using the quadratic formula and the sign of $(p^2 - 2)$ , it can be shown that we need $$
x \in \left(0, \frac{1}{p + \sqrt{2}}\right) \mbox{ for } p \in A,
$$ or, for $p \in B$ , $x < 1/\left(p + \sqrt{2}\right)$ or $x > 1/\left(p - \sqrt{2}\right)$ . Notice that there are MANY solutions to these equations! The easiest to see, perhaps, is letting $x = 1/(p + n)$ for $n \geq 2$ .  Notice that Rudin chooses $n = 2$ for his answer, but it checks out easily for other $n$ . The Question: Why does Rudin choose $x = 1/(p + 2)$ specifically?  Is it just to make the expressions work out clearly algebraically?  Why doesn't he comment on his particular choice or the nature of the set of solutions that will work for the proof?

21142,Help understanding game version of Baire category theorem,"I got this from Thomson et al.'s freely available "" Elementary Real Analysis "" p.356. They introduce Baire's category theorem through a game where, given two players (A) and (B) Player (A) is given a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$, and player (B) is given the complementary set $B = \mathbb{R} \backslash A$. Player (A) first selects a closed interval $I_1 \subset \mathbb{R}$; then player (B) chooses a closed interval $I_2 \subset I_1$. The players alternate moves, a move consisting of selecting a closed interval inside the previously chosen interval. The play of the game thus determines a descending sequence of closed intervals
  \begin{align} 
  I_1 \supset I_2 \supset \ldots I_n \supset 
  \ldots\end{align}
  where player (A) chooses those with odd index and player (B) those with even index. If
  \begin{align}
  A \: \bigcap_n^{\infty} I_n \neq \emptyset
  \end{align}
  then player (A) wins; otherwise player (B) wins. Then they argue that if player (A) is dealt the irrational set and (B) is dealt the rational set, (A) always has a strategy to win. I'm confused in several ways by this argument. One confusion is about the term ""closed interval"". Does, for example, the closed interval [1,1] count as an interval? Because if that's the case, can't whoever has the first turn just end the game then and there without regard to whether he has the rationals or irrationals? Say, if (A) received the rationals, he can just pick [0.5,0.5]. Game over. (But I'm guessing probably not, because the game wouldn't happen) If that is not the case, and an interval has to be defined $[a,b]$ s.t. $a < b$, isn't it always true that for any $I_{2n+1} = [a_{2n+1}, b_{2n+1}]$ for the odd numbered turns of (A), and where (A) has the irrationals, there exists some $q \in [a_{2n+1},b_{2n+1}]$ s.t. $q$ is rational? Because $\mathbb{Q}$ is also dense on the real line. Or is this argument relying on the fact that a countable intersection of closed sets is always closed? And that it can converge to a single point. But if it converges to a single point, it might be a closed set, but is it still a closed interval? And does that still count as winning? And can't (A) still play this same game even if he were dealt the rationals if all that is needed is that his choice of intervals converge to a single point? I've been thinking about this for a few days now and none of the ways I've approached it convince me that their discussion of the game is true (though I do trust that it is true, since the authors are mathematicians and I'm not), so any help would be appreciated.","['baire-category', 'real-analysis']"
