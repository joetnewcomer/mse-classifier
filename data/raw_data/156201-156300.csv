2653135,Compute $\int\frac{x}{x+1}dx$,"My textbook uses the following method: $$\int \frac{x}{x+1}  dx = \int \frac{x +1-1}{x+1}dx=\int 1-\frac{1}{x+1}=x-\ln|x+1|$$ It seemed obvious after seeing it solved, but I didn't spot that first step of splitting the fraction. So I attempted it using u substitution: $u = x+1$ $x = u-1$ $dx = du$ $$\int \frac{u-1}{u}  du = \int 1-\frac{1}{u}=u-\ln|u| = (x+1) - \ln|x+1|$$ The two expressions after using subsitution are equivalent aren't they? $$\int \frac{u-1}{u} = \int \frac{x +1-1}{x+1}$$ So when doing the u substitution, it appears that I'm getting to the same stage where they split the fraction. Can anyone explain what I'm doing wrong? Thanks in advance","['substitution', 'integration', 'calculus']"
2653216,How to calculate the integral $\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{(x^2+8)^3}}dx$?,"I need to solve something like this
$$\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{(x^2+8)^3}}dx$$ Wolfram alpha says the solution is $$\frac{x}{8\sqrt{x^2+8}} + c$$ The problem is that the integrand is obtained by the quotient rule:
$$\bigg(\frac{g(x)}{h(x)}\bigg)'=\frac{g'(x)h(x)-g(x)h'(x)}{h^2(x)}$$
$$\bigg(\frac{x}{8\sqrt{x^2+8}}\bigg)'=\frac{1}{8}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{x^2+8}-\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{x^2+8}}}{x^2+8}=\frac{1}{8}\cdot\frac{\frac{x^2+8-x^2}{\sqrt{x^2+8}}}{x^2+8}=\frac{1}{8}\cdot\frac{8}{\sqrt{(x^2+8)^3}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(x^2+8)^3}}$$

2653235,How to proof a real variety is not locally a manifold,"I'm becoming desperate with a problem, which doesn't seem so difficult. I have a real algebraic set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^{15}$ defined by

x_3^2 + y_3^2 + z_3^2 -1 = 0 \\
c_1^2 + s_1^2 - 1 = 0 \\
c_2^2 + s_2^2 - 1 = 0 \\
c_3^2 + s_3^2 - 1 = 0 \\
l_1 = \ldots = l_6 = 0,
$$
where $l_1, \ldots, l_6$ are linear in the $x_i,y_i,z_i,c_i,s_i$, (basically $X$ is the preimage of zero of a smooth map $(S^2)^3 \times (S^1)^3 \to \mathbb{R}^6$). I found 24 points, where all principal minors of the jacobian are zero. I want to show now, that these points are ""singular"", i.e. $X$ is not locally an embedded submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{15}$ around these points. I know that this set is irreducible of dimension $3$ and I think I can calculate the complex tangent cones $\mathcal{C}$ (tangent cone of the complex variety) in these points (with groebner bases) but I think it is not true in general, that $\mathcal{C} \cap \mathbb{R}^{15} = \mathcal{C}_\mathbb{R}$? Does anybody have an idea how to proof this, or could maybe give a pointer to literature which considers this kind of problems or just vaguely related problems. Its quite difficult to find any research in this direction (or I don't know where to look). Many Thanks!","['real-algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2653473,Can I assume that $0^0 = 0$ when dealing with the center of order $0$ in statistics?,"I came up to the concept of centers in statistics. Honestly, I never heard about this before few days ago. Given a collection of numbers $\{x_i\}$, $i \in \{1, \ldots, N\}$, the
  center of order $r$ is defined as the number $c$ which minimizes the
  following function: $$f_r(c) = \sum_{i=1}^N \left|x_i - c\right|^r.$$ In particular, it comes out that: The center of order $0$ is the mode of the collection $\{x_i\}$. The center of order $1$ is the median of the collection $\{x_i\}$. The center of order $2$ is the mean of the collection $\{x_i\}$. For fun, I was able to prove point 3 (very easy) since $f$ is smooth. Point 2 is somehow hard, but I think I can solve it. Instead, for point 1, I'm having some troubles. Consider the function $f_0(c)$. If $c \neq x_i$, then $x_i - c \neq 0$ and then
$$\left|x_i - c\right|^0 = 1.$$ Therefore, if I choose $c$ such that $c \neq x_i ~\forall i$, then I get that: $$f_0(c) = N.$$ Now, $\color{red}{\text{I assume in this context that}~ 0^0 = 0}$.
That is, if $c = x_j$ for some $j$, I get: $$\left|x_i - c\right|^0 = 0.$$ If the value of $x_j$ is repeated exactly $m$ times, then I get: $$f_0(x_j) = N - m.$$ Therefore if $x_j$ correspond to the mode of the collection, then $m$ is maximum, and hence $f_0(x_j)$ attains its minimum. Is this ""proof"" correct? A numerical ""evidence"" I consider the collection $\{1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.
In this case, the mean is $3.125$, the median is $2.5$ (between $2$ and $3$) and the mode is $2$. Hereafter, I plot the function $f_r(c)$ for $r=2$ (mean) and $r=1$ (median). Also I plot the function for $r=0.1$, $r=0.01$, $r=0.001$ and $r=0.0001$.","['statistics', 'analysis', 'limits']"

I also tried Mathematica, and apparently, this is too complicated for Mathematica to solve. A side-note question: if the general method to find a Lyapunov function is currently not available, is that because no one is smart enough to come up with the general method? Or is it due to its nature that it's ""impossible"" to have the general method? And has anyone proved its impossibility?

2653903,Proof Verification: Showing that these two product metrics are equivalent.,"I am working on this problem from Simmons' ""Introduction to Topology and Modern Analysis"" (Problem 10-6). Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be a finite class of metric spaces with metrics $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$. If $X = X_1 \times X_2 \times \dots \times X_n$, and $d$ and $\bar{d}$ are metrics defined as follows: $$d(\{x_i\}, \{y_i\}) = \max d_i(x_i, y_i)$$
$$\bar{d}(\{x_i\}, \{y_i\}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(x_i, y_i)$$ then show that the two metric spaces $(X, d)$ and $(X, \bar{d})$ have precisely the same open sets. (Here, $\{x_i\}$ denotes an n-tuple from $X = X_1 \times X_2 \times \dots \times X_n$) Here is my approach: I know a theorem that two metrics are equivalent iff. every open ball in the first metric contains an open ball from the second metric (centred at the same point) and vice-versa. So, let $B_d(\{x_i\}, r)$ be and open ball in $(X, d)$. Here, $B_d(p, r)$ denotes an open ball with respect to metric $d$, centered at p and with radius $r$. Let $\{y_i\} \in B_d(\{x_i\}, r)$, now, we wish to show that $\{y_i\} \in B_{\bar{d}}(\{x_i\}, s)$ for some $s > 0$ (possibly a function of $r$?). Now, $$\{y_i\} \in B_d(\{x_i\}, r) \implies \max d_i(x_i, y_i) < r \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(x_i, y_i) < nr \\ \implies \{y_i\} \in B_{\bar{d}}(\{x_i\}, nr)$$ Similarly, let $\{y_i\} \in B_{\bar{d}}(\{x_i\}, r)$, then, $$\{y_i\} \in B_{\bar{d}}(\{x_i\}, r) \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(x_i, y_i) < r \implies \max d_i(x_i, y_i) < r \\ \implies \{y_i\} \in B_d(\{x_i\}, r)$$ So, we conclude that the metrics $d$ and $\bar{d}$ are equivalent. I would really appreciate some comments/correction on this proof. In particular, I would like to know that when we show an open ball (with respect to first metric) having radius $r$ is contained in an open ball (with respect to second metric) having radius $s$, then, can $s$ be a function of $r$ or must it be constant depending only on the center? At this point I haven't yet studied homeomorphisms or Lipschitz equivalence of norms, so please avoid using those concepts.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'proof-verification']"
2653937,Estimating the critical probabilities $\mathrm{P_{c1}}$ and $\mathrm{P_{c2}}$ mathematically for the infinite system case,"Suppose I have an $\mathrm{N\times N}$ square matrix consisting of only $0$'s and $1$'s. (I'm considering that $0$ represents ""white"" and $1$ represents ""black"".) The probability of a certain element being $1$ is $\mathrm{p}$. At that certain probability $\mathrm{p}$, we count the number the number of white clusters and number of black clusters in the matrix. Any two elements who share a side (i.e. any one of them lies to the left, right, top or bottom of the other) or share a vertex are considered to belong to the same cluster. BUT, there's one special case i.e. if anywhere in the matrix there occurs a situation like this: 0 | 1 1 | 0 OR 1 | 0 0 | 1 That is two $1$'s share a vertex (diagonally connected) and two $0$'s also share a vertex as shown, the $50\%$ of the times, one should consider the $1$'s to belong to same cluster and other $50\%$ of the times one should consider the $0$'s to belong to the same cluster. Suppose I am gradually increasing $\mathrm{p}$ from $0$ to $100$ in steps of $0.001$ and counting the number of black and white clusters for each $\mathrm{p}$. My aim is to find that critical probability $\mathrm{P_{c1}}$ at which number of white clusters increases from $1$ to a number greater than $1$ as $\mathrm{N}\to\infty$. Also I need to find $\mathrm{P_{c2}}$ at which number of black clusters decreases from a number greater than $1$ to $1$. To be more clear, Let $\mathcal{C}_0, \mathcal{C}_1$ denote the clusters of 0's and 1's
  in the matrix (or graph), respectively. We are defining $\mathrm{P_{c1}}$ as $$ \mathcal{C}_{0} = \begin{cases} 1 & \qquad p < \mathrm{P_{c1}} \\
>  1 & \qquad p > \mathrm{P_{c1}} \end{cases} $$ and $\mathrm{P_{c2}}$ as $$ \mathcal{C}_{1} = \begin{cases}
> 1 & \qquad p < \mathrm{P_{c2}} \\ 1  & \qquad p > \mathrm{P_{c2}} \end{cases} $$ for $N\to\infty$. I wrote a program for the $1000\times 1000$ case, and averaged the critical probabilities over $10$ iterations. (The program basically had a loop which ran from $\mathrm{p}=0$ to $\mathrm{p}=100$ and I outputted those $\mathrm{p}$'s at which the number of white clusters increased from $1$ and number of black clusters decreased to $1$) The value I got for $\mathrm{P_{c1}}$ was $0.05$ and for $\mathrm{P_{c2}}$ it was $0.96$. However, I don't know if any purely mathematical technique exists to find the convergence value of these two critical probabilities for the infinite matrix case (i.e. $\mathrm{N}\to \infty$). Around $3$ decimal places of accuracy will be enough for my purpose. Any help will be appreciated.","['graph-theory', 'percolation', 'probability', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

However, what I want $f$ to be, is, the graph $|x|^x=|y|^y$ , without line $x=y$ , but nevertheless contains the two points which the curve intersect with $x=y$ . Note that the convention $0^0=1$ , maybe not as usaul. Clearly $f$ is not a function. I doesn't have any idea about continuity, derivative, integral, and many other important technique, apply on an implicit curve. However, I does want to ask: $1$ ) How to write $f$ in an rigorous way? (How to represents 'the intersection of the curve with $x=y$ , as the line $x=y$ is originally contains in the curve?) $2$ ) Is $f$ continuous?(What does it means to be a continuous implicit curve? Is it smooth?) $3$ ) How can we break it down into several functions so that we can use the properties of functions? $4$ )[ANSWERED] Can we find the area (maybe not 'integral', since in definition to Riemann-integral, integral under x-axis is negative, but clearly area can't be negative) surrounding by the curve $f$ ? Or does it make any sense to say the area of an implicit curve? Is there a strict definition? From wikipedia , maybe we need to show that it is Jordan curve? (Thanks, Peter Heinig, in the comment. Answer : By Barry Cipra, the integral is $3.527\dots$ . $5$ ) Given a straight line, at most how many points can the line intersects $f$ ? I believe the answer is 4, as an example, $y=-x-1$ . Moreover, what if the line is in the form $y=a$ ,while $a\in\mathbb R$ ? I believe is 2. See the image below,
for some example $6$ ) Where are the extrema of $f$ , a) in the normal sense, b) when we take $x=y$ as the $x$ -axis, c) when we take $x=-y$ as the $x$ -axis? $7$ ) What is the intersections of the curve with, a) $x=y$ , (ANSWERED by Rahul) b) $x=-y$ ,  (ANSWERED) If $x>0$ and $x=−y$ , then we get $x^x=x^{−x}$ , $x^{2x}=1$ , $x=1$ , $y=−1$ ,
and similarly for $x<0$ we get $x=−1,y=1$ . This answers 7b. – Wojowu c) $x$ -axis? (ANSWERED) $8$ ) a) What is the circumscribed circle to the curve $f$ ? (I think that it may be $x^2+y^2=2$ ) b) What is the inscribed circle to the curve $f$ ? $\space\space\space$ (I observed by trial and error that it may be $x^2+y^2=a$ $\space\space\space$ while $a\approx 0.27067056\approx\frac{1352}{4995}$ , see the image below) 9)[ANSWERED] Perhaps we should restrict our attention to $x^x=y^y$ , consider the part of $f$ which is in the first quadrant (including positive x and y axes),see the image below, the red curve. How can we find the integral of it on [0,1](How can we write it in a more convenient form?) I observed that the integral should be $\gt 1-\frac{\pi}{4}$ (See the image below) and $\lt \frac{1}{2}$ , perhaps, $\frac{e}{10}$ ?. Answer : By Yuriy S, the integral is $0.317\dots$ . 10)Is the locus, when $f$ is rotated around the origin, the area between the two concentric circles $x^2+y^2=2$ and $x^2+y^2=\frac{2}{e^2}$ ? See the image and here . The equations of the graph: Using rotation matrix, as mentioned in Yuriy S's answer, Define a paremeter $a$ , as the rotation degree measures in radian (clockwise), $f$ , after rotation, is $$\left|x\cdot\cos a-y\sin a\right|^{x\cdot\cos a-y\sin a}=\left|x\sin a+y\cos a\right|^{x\sin a+y\cos a}$$ For $$\space x\cdot\cos a-y\sin a\neq x\sin a+y\cos a$$ Of course, there are two points more. Does it helps to prove that $f$ is continuous, i.e., question 2 above? NOTE: To interpret the graph with Desmos, we need to consider two cases, namely, $\space x\cdot\cos a-y\sin a<x\sin a+y\cos a$ and $\space x\cdot\cos a-y\sin a> x\sin a+y\cos a$ respectively, see the link above. I need really to apologize that I really doesn't have any idea to answer. I am not presently familar with implicit curve, but only a little knowledge about real analysis. However, I ask it because I think it is interesting. Moreover, it is good for an easy answer, but it is not neccesary that the answer should be very elementary, since knowing how the question can be solve by wonderful mathematical techniques is itself interesting. Welcome for any answer, even not as a complete answer to all 10 questions. Thanks for answering my naive questions! Sorry for a new question, but I really like to ask :)","['real-analysis', 'functions', 'analytic-geometry', 'implicit-function', 'graphing-functions']"

2654043,Why do we need $\beta_1>0$ and $\alpha_n<\beta_n$ in this proof?,"This question is about theorem 3.54 of Baby Rudin: Statement and proof of that theorem are given here: Theorem 3.54: Let $\sum a_n$ be a series of real numbers which converges, but not absolutely. Suppose 
  $$-\infty \leq \alpha \leq \beta \leq +\infty.$$
  Then there exists a rearrangement $\sum a_n^\prime$ with partial sums $s_n^\prime$ such that 
  $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\inf s_n^\prime = \alpha, \ \ \ \mbox{ and } \ \ \ \lim_{n\to\infty}\sup s_n^\prime = \beta. \tag{24}$$ Proof: Let $$p_n = \frac{|a_n| + a_n}{2}, \ q_n = \frac{|a_n| - a_n}{2} \,\,\,\,\, (n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots). $$ 
    Then $p_n - q_n = a_n$, $p_n + q_n = |a_n|$, $p_n \geq 0$, $q_n \geq 0$. The series $\sum p_n$, $\sum q_n$ must both diverge. For if both were convergent, then $$\sum \left( p_n + q_n \right) = \sum |a_n|$$ would converge, contrary to hypothesis. Since $$ \sum_{n=1}^N a_n = \sum_{n=1}^N \left( p_n - q_n \right) = \sum_{n=1}^N p_n - \sum_{n=1}^N q_n,$$ divergence of $\sum p_n$ or convergence of $\sum q_n$ (or vice versa) implies divergence of $\sum a_n$, again contrary to hypothesis. Now let $P_1, P_2, P_3, \ldots$ denote the non-negative terms of $\sum a_n$, in the order in which they occur, and let $Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, \ldots$ be the absolute values of the negative terms of $\sum a_n$, also in their original order. The series $\sum P_n$, $\sum Q_n$ differ from $\sum p_n$, $\sum q_n$ only by zero terms, and are therefore divergent. We shall construct sequences $\{m_n \}$, $\{k_n\}$, such that the series $$ P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} - Q_1 - \cdots - Q_{k_1} + P_{m_1 + 1} + \cdots + P_{m_2} \\- Q_{k_1 + 1} - \cdots - Q_{k_2} + \cdots, \tag{25}$$ which clearly is a rearrangement of $\sum a_n$, satisfies (24). Choose real-valued sequences $\{ \alpha_n \}$, $\{ \beta_n \}$ such that $\alpha_n \rightarrow \alpha$, $\beta_n \rightarrow \beta$, $\alpha_n < \beta_n$, $\beta_1 > 0$. Let $m_1$, $k_1$ be the smallest integers such that $$P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} > \beta_1,$$ $$P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} - Q_1 - \cdots - Q_{k_1} < \alpha_1;$$  let $m_2$, $k_2$ be the smallest integers such that $$P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} - Q_1 - \cdots - Q_{k_1} + P_{m_1 + 1} + \cdots + P_{m_2} > \beta_2,$$ $$P_1 + \cdots + P_{m_1} - Q_1 - \cdots - Q_{k_1} + P_{m_1 + 1} + \cdots + P_{m_2} - Q_{k_1 + 1} - \cdots - Q_{k_2} < \alpha_2;$$ and continue in this way. This is possible since $\sum P_n$, $\sum Q_n$ diverge. If $x_n$, $y_n$ denote the partial sums of (25) whose last terms are $P_{m_n}$, $-Q_{k_n}$, then $$ | x_n - \beta_n | \leq P_{m_n}, \ \ \ |y_n - \alpha_n | \leq Q_{k_n}. $$ Since $P_n \rightarrow 0$, $Q_n \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, we see that $x_n \rightarrow \beta$, $y_n \rightarrow \alpha$. Finally, it is clear that no number less than $\alpha$ or greater than $\beta$ can be a subsequential limit of the partial sums of (25). From chatroom, I got to know that $\beta_1>0$ (in fact, we can make it $\beta_1\ge 0$) is needed to ensure $|x_n-\beta_1|\le P_{m_1}$, and by $\alpha_n<\beta_n$, we ensure that $\alpha_n<x_n$ because by construction, $\beta_n<x_n$ ensuring that we need to subtract some $Q$'s to make $y_n<\alpha_n$. My question is: What guarantees us that we need to add at least one $P$ to go from, e.g., $P_1+\ldots+P_{m_1}-Q_1-\ldots-Q_{k_1}<\alpha_1$ to $P_1+\ldots+P_{m_1}-Q_1-\ldots-Q_{k_1}+P_{m_1+1}+\ldots+P_{m_2}>\beta_2$? I mean $\beta_2$ can be so small that we don't need to add $P_{m_1+1}+\ldots+P_{m_2}$. And in this case, I think, expression $|x_2-\beta_2|\le P_{m_2}$ becomes meaningless. Also, another question: Can't we accomplish our goal to have $\alpha_n<x_n$ by just $\alpha_n=\beta_n$ instead of $\alpha_n<\beta_n$?","['real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series']"
2654103,A question on a lemma by Serre involving the special linear group.,"In ""Abelian l-Adic Representations and Elliptic Curves"", page 169 (link provided at the end), Serre proposes the following lemma: ""Let $X$ be a closed subgroup of $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}_{p})$ whose image in $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{F}_{p})$ is $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{F}_{p})$. Assume $p \geq 5$. Then $X=\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}_{p})$."" I'm having a lot of trouble understanding what this lemma is actually telling me about the group structure of, say $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}/{p}^{k}\mathbb{Z}).$ Any help understanding this lemma would be greatly appreciated. As well as this, the excerises that follow ask a) Generalise this lemma for $\text{SL}_{d}(\mathbb{Z}_{p})$. This, as far as i can see, is identical to the proof of the $d=2$ case. b) Show that the only closed subgroup of $\text{SL}_{d}(\mathbb{Z}_{3})$ which maps onto $\text{SL}_{d}(\mathbb{Z}/3^{2}\mathbb{Z})$ is $\text{SL}_{d}(\mathbb{Z}_{3})$ itself. c) Show that the only closed subgroup of $\text{SL}_{d}(\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ which maps onto $\text{SL}_{d}(\mathbb{Z}/2^{3}\mathbb{Z})$ is $\text{SL}_{d}(\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ itself.

2654105,Proposition 5.1 in Introduction to Topological Manifolds by Lee,"This is Proposition 5.1 in Introduction to Topological Manifolds by Lee I understand the proof up until the point where he mentions that ""because boundedness of $f^{-1}$ implies $F(x) \to 0$ as $x \to 0$"" But $f^{-1}[\mathbb{S}^{n-1}] \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \not\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ so we can't use the Extreme Value Theorem here which is what gives boundedness of a function in the most general case (I think). This is what the author means I think. I think that the author means that there exists a function $g : \mathbb{S}^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $g(x) = d(0, f^{-1}(x)) = |f^{-1}(x)|$ which is continuous and thus $g[\mathbb{S}^{n-1}] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is compact so $g$ is bounded (by the extreme value theorem). Hence $\sup(g[\mathbb{S}^{n-1}])$ exists which I'll call $\alpha$. Now pick $x \in \overline{\mathbb{B}^{n}}$, then we have $|x|\alpha \to 0$ as $x \to 0$ $\implies$ $|x| \cdot \left|f^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{|x|}\right)\right| \to 0$ as $x\to 0$  $\implies$ $|x| \cdot f^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{|x|}\right)\to 0$ as $x\to 0$ for $x \in \overline{\mathbb{B}^{n}}$ $\implies  F(x) \to 0$ as $x \to 0$.

2654118,"$\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ is infinite dimensional when $V$ is finite dimensional and $W$ is infinite dimensional.","In an earlier post Proof of $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ being infinite dimensional I presented a proof for the proposition that Theorem. If $V$ is finite dimensional with $\dim V>0$ and $W$ is infinite
  dimensional then the vector space $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ is infinite
  dimensional. However the proof presented there though correct was preposterously long. I present here another proof which makes use of the following theorem. I would like to know whether this new proof is correct? Theorem ($2.A.9)$ A vector space $V$ is infinite dimensional if and only if there is a sequence of vectors $v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4,....$ such that for all $n\in\mathbf{Z^+}$ the subsequence $v_1,v_2,....,v_n$ is linearly independent. Proof. Since $W$ is infinite dimensional we may invoke a sequence of vectors  $\psi:\mathbf{Z^+}\to W$ such forall $n\in\mathbf{Z^+}$ the subsequence $\psi(1),\psi(2),...,\psi(n)$ is linearly independent. Let $v_1,v_2,...,v_m$ be a basis for $V$ and consider the sequence $\phi:\mathbf{Z^+}\to\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ defined as follows
$$\phi(n) = T(c_1v_1+c_2v_2+\cdot\cdot\cdot+c_mv_m) = c_1\psi(1)+c_2\psi(2)+\cdot\cdot\cdot+c_m\psi(m+n)\tag{1}$$ We now show by recourse to Mathematical-Induction that with the above definition for all $n\in\mathbf{Z^+}$ the list $\phi(1),\phi(2),...,\phi(n)$ is linearly independent. Evidently $\phi(1)$ on its own is linearly independent. Now assume that for some $k\in\mathbf{Z^+}$ the list $\phi(1),\phi(2),...,\phi(k)$ is linearly independent but the list $\phi(1),\phi(2),...,\phi(k),\phi(k+1)$ is not. Then for some $j\in\{1,2,3,...,k+1\}$ it is the case that $\phi(j)\in\operatorname{span}(\phi(1),\phi(2),...,\phi(j-1))$ but this $j\not\in\{1,2,....,k\}$ since $\phi(1),\phi(2),...,\phi(k)$ is linearly independent, consequently $j = k+1$, which implies that for some $x_1,x_2,...,x_k\in\mathbf{F}$
$$\phi(k+1)= x_1\phi(1)+x_2\phi(2)+\cdot\cdot\cdot+x_k\phi(k)$$ then applying both sides to the vector $v_m$ we have
$$\phi(k+1)v_m = x_1\phi(1)v_m+x_2\phi(2)v_m+\cdot\cdot\cdot+x_k\phi(k)v_m\tag{2}$$
$$\psi(m+k+1) = x_1\psi(m+1)+x_2\psi(m+2)+\cdot\cdot\cdot+x_m\psi(m+k)\tag{3}$$ but $(3)$ implies that $\psi(m+k+1)\in\operatorname{span}(\psi(1),\psi(2),...,\psi(m+k))$ contradicting the fact that for all $n\in\mathbf{Z^+}$, $\psi(1),\psi(2),...,\psi(n)$ is linearly independent. $\blacksquare$","['linear-algebra', 'proof-verification', 'linear-transformations']"

I interpreted the RHS as the answer to: “given $n$ balls, how many ways can you paint black the top half of $p$ of them and the bottom half of $q$ of them?” For example, for $(n, p, q) = (11, 4, 6)$ one such way would be $$⬒ ⬓ ⬜ ⬓ ⬛ ⬜ ⬓ ⬒ ⬛ ⬓ ⬜.$$ My idea, thus far, was to interpret the $k$ on the LHS as the number of fully painted balls. (Here $k=2$.) Then the challenge is to find an interpretation of the selections in ${p\choose k}{q\choose k}{n+k\choose p+q}$ as “encoding” a way to do what was asked, leaving $k$ balls fully painted. I suppose the selection of $k$ out of $p$ could be interpreted as: “which of the top-painted balls is also bottom-painted?” And the selection of $k$ out of $q$ is the same for the bottom-painted balls. So the first two choices tell us what the above sequence looks like when only looking at the top-painted and bottom-painted balls respectively: $$⬒ ⬛ ⬒ ⬛ \quad\text{and}\quad ⬓ ⬓ ⬛ ⬓ ⬛ ⬓.$$ From this info (by matching up the ⬛s) we know the sequence looks like this: $$\{\substack{⬒\\⬓⬓}\} ~⬛~ \{\substack{⬒\\⬓}\} ~⬛~ \{⬓\} $$ where the expressions in braces expand in some order to the boxes inside them, possibly padded with unpainted boxes, but not with ⬛s. In our case \begin{align*}
\{\substack{⬒\\⬓⬓}\} &\to ⬒ ⬓ ⬜ ⬓ \\
\{\substack{⬒\\⬓}\} &\to ⬜ ⬓ ⬒ \\
\{⬓\} &\to ⬓⬜.
\end{align*} And now there should be some way to encode precisely this info in a selection of $(p+q)$ elements out of $(n+k)$ elements! I’m totally mystified as to how this would work. Is there indeed a way to do this? Or an easier combinatorial interpretation of this identity? I feel like I am on the right track, as my choice of an interpretation for $k$ is “too nice not to work” (☺)  and also worked for the similar identity I linked .

A lake is stocked with a fish population of size $ N(t)$ at time t. Initially the population is $N(0) = N_0$ the evolution of he population is given by this ODE:$$ \frac{dN}{dt}=\frac{aN}{b}(b-N)$$ Where a and b are both positive constants.
a) find N(t)
b) what is the behavior of N(t) and t tend to infinity So the way the question is set up makes me think its somehow separable here's what i've tried
Rearranging this gets me:
$$\int \frac{1}{N(b-N)}dN=\int \frac{a}{b}dt$$
Partial fractions on LHS give:
$$\int \frac{1}{b(b-N)}+\frac{1}{bN} dN=\int \frac{a}{b}dt$$
evaluating the integrals and simplifying:
$$\frac{1}{b}ln(\frac{N}{b-N})=\frac{a}{b}t+C$$
some more fiddling:
$$\frac{N}{b-N}=Ae^{at}$$
where A is a postive constant.
So i can mess around further getting this sort of thing $N(t)=\large{\frac{Abe^{at}}{1-Ae^{at}}}$ (thanks to martin for picking up the sign error that should be $N(t)=\large{\frac{Abe^{at}}{1+Ae^{at}}}$)thing i'm missing.

Show that the sum of zeros of $P_m$ is given by $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^{m} \cot^2\dfrac{\pi k}{2m + 1} = \dfrac{m \left( 2m - 1 \right)}{3}$$ and that the sum of theie squares is given by $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^{m} \cot^4\dfrac{\pi k}{2m + 1} = \dfrac{m \left( 2m - 1 \right) \left( 4m^2 + 10m - 9 \right)}{45}$$ As far as the solution is concerned, I have been able to prove the first part and upto proving the existence of the polynomial in the second part. For later parts, I do not have any insights in proceeding towards the solution. Help will be appreciated!","['complex-numbers', 'analysis']"

2655146,(Baby Rudin Remark 11.11) Every closed set is measurable,"I'm reading Principles of Mathematical Analysis Chapter 11 written by Walter Rudin. I came up to Remark 11.11 (a) where it says ""If $A$ is open in $R^p$, then $A \in \mathfrak{M}(\mu)$, since it is possible to construct a countable base whose members are open intervals"". But the next statement is confuses me. It says, ""By taking complements, it follows that every closed set is in $\mathfrak{M}(\mu)$"" I have searched for similar questions here at Math Stack Exchange and most of the answers make use of Borel Set or $\mathscr{B}$, a collection of all Borel Set, or $\sigma$-algebra, which is closed under ""complement"", but they are yet to be defined in Remark 11.11. My idea is as follows. Let $A$ be a set in $R^p$ which is open and is a union of countable open interval.
$$A = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}I_n$$
then,
$$A^c = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}{I_n}^c$$
$\mathfrak{M}(\mu)$ is a $\sigma$-ring which means that it is closed under countable union and therefore countable intersection. Therefore if ${I_n}^c \in \mathfrak{M}(\mu)$, then the proof is complete. I tried to think of unit intervals $U_{(n_1,n_2,\dots,n_p)}$, which I defined,
$$U_{(n_1,n_2,\dots,n_p)} = \{ x \in R^p | n_i \le x_i \lt n_i+1 \text{ for } i=1,2,\dots,p \}, \text{ $n_1,n_2,\dots,n_p$ are integers.}$$
Every unit intervals are pairwise disjoint, and collection of all unit intervals in $R^p$ is countable. For some unit interval $U^*$ which intersects $I_n$, $(U^* - I_n)$ is an elementary set which can be broken down into a union of disjoint finite intervals. Therefore it seems that ${I_n}^c$ can be experessed as a countable union of disjoint intervals. $U_{(n_1,n_2,\dots,n_p)}$ belongs to $\mathscr{E}$(a family of all elementary subsets in $R^p$). It is possible to construct a sequence where every member of the sequence is the interval itself, therefore $U_{(n_1,n_2,\dots,n_p)} \in \mathfrak{M}_F(\mu)$. Since ${I_n}^c$ can be expressed as a countable union of unit intervals in $\mathfrak{M}_F(\mu)$, ${I_n}^c \in \mathfrak{M}(\mu)$ and proof is complete. But I am uncertain whether this solution is correct. Any corrections or guidance into the right direction is appreciated. Thanks!","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory']"

Here $F^{(k)}(1)$ is defined as the limit (if it exists) of $F^{k}(z)$ when $z \to 1$ for $|z|<1$ . Is this possible with this interpretation? Is it possible if we take a derivative in the radial sense by taking $z$ to be real in the previous limit?

&=e^{1/(x-1)}\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{(-1)^k}{(1-x)^{n+k}}\binom{n}{k}\binom{n-1}{k-1}(n-k)!\\
&\to \frac{1}{e}\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^k\binom{n}{k}\binom{n-1}{k-1}(n-k)!, \quad x\to0,

For example, given a polynomial $f(x,y)$ , where the degree in each variable is at most $n$ , how many evaluation points uniquely determine this polynomial? My current intuition: If I fix the first variable to say 1, then I get that if polynomials $f$ and $g$ of degree $n$ agree on $(1 ,y_1), ~\dots~, (1 ,y_{n+1})$ , then I have $f(1,x) = g(1,x)$ for all $x$ (since fixing the polynomials in one variable gives me univariate polynomials of degree $n$ ).
Now I can define a polynomial $h(x,y) = f(x,y) - g(x,y)$ , which is $0$ at any point of the form $(1,x)$ . Assume $f$ and $g$ agree on the points above, but $f \neq g$ , then maybe I can say something about $h$ not being the constant $0$ polynomial and having too many roots?

Since I'm not doing this for a class, I worked out a very informal proof for the second case (no $a_n$ is its own inverse): Since there must be an $a^{-1}$ for each $a$, then $(a_1a_2a_3a_4...a_n)$ can be reduced to so many instances of $(a_1a_1^{-1}a_2a_2^{-1}...a_{n/2}a_{n/2}^{-1})$, which can be simplified to $e^{n/2}$, or just $e$.

It is a simple matter to find examples of such functions, with the easiest case being when $\alpha =1$, as in this case any differentiable function with bounded derivative will obey the $\alpha =1$ (Lipschitz) estimate. I was recently looking at Classical Fourier Analysis by Grafakos.  In the study of pointwise convergence of Fourier series he proves a result (Corollary 3.3.8) that says that if we have a function on the $n-$torus, $f: \mathbb{T}^n \to \mathbb{C}$, and a point $y \in \mathbb{T}^n$ such that
$$
|f(x) - f(y)| \le C \prod_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^{\alpha_j} \text{ for all }x \in \mathbb{T}^m

then the Fourier partial sums converge at $y$.  This suggests that the collection of functions satisfying this condition is of some interest. It's not hard to build a function that satisfies this condition at a point.  To make things simpler let's swap to $\mathbb{R}^n$ from the torus and restrict to real-valued functions.  Then we can define $f(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n |x_i|^{\alpha_i}$ to get a trivial example satisfying the condition at $y=0$.  I then started thinking about this condition as a general one, satisfied for all pairs of points $x,y$, i.e. I want a function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ such that there exist $C>0$ and $0 < \alpha_i \le 1$ such that 
$$
|f(x) - f(y)| \le C \prod_{j=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^{\alpha_i} \text{ for all }x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n.
$$ This is a sort of strange variant of the standard Holder continuity condition.  Note that to avoid triviality we should assume that $\sum_i \alpha_i \le 1$ as otherwise 
$$
|f(x)-f(y)| \le C |x-y|^{1+\epsilon} 
$$
for $\epsilon = \sum_{i} \alpha_i -1 >0$, and so $f$ is constant. My problem is that I can't seem to come up with any example that satisfies this condition for all $x,y$.  Initially I guessed functions of the form $f(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n f_i(x_i)$ would work, but this doesn't fly.  For example, with $n=2$ we get
$$
f_1(x_1)f_2(x_2) - f_1(y_1) f_2(y_2) = (f_1(x_1) - f_1(y_1))f_2(x_2) + f_1(y_1)(f_2(x_2) - f_2(y_2))
$$
and so if $f_1,f_2$ are bounded and Holder continuous (with exponents $\alpha_1,\alpha_2$) we get 
$$
|f(x) - f(y)| \le C |x_1 - y_1|^{\alpha_1} + C |x_2 - y_2|^{\alpha_2}.
$$
This is not what we want. Do such functions exist?  If so, is there a sufficient condition for generating them (something like the bounded derivative condition above)?  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! EDIT:
@Dap made the observation I had overlooked.  If $x_i = y_i$ then $f(x)=f(y)$ and so $f$ must be constant on every hypersurface parallel to the coordinate axes.  This shows that $f$ is constant.","['real-analysis', 'continuity', 'uniform-continuity', 'metric-spaces', 'analysis']"
2655762,Finding index of closest Fibonacci Number to a given value,"Here it is: Find $n$, such that that $F(n)$ [Fibonacci function] is the closest possible Fibonacci number to $a$, or in other words, such that $\text{abs}(F(n)-a)$ is minimum. I think there should be a way to implement an algorithm, but I'm rather looking for a mathematical proof. What I've tried so far is to take the generalized non-recursive form of the Fibonacci function, isolate the $n$ and then create a function $f(a, n)$ of the absolute value of $F(n) - a$, and then take the derivative with respect to $n$ and then set it to $0$, but i believe this is not quite the way to find maxima and minima of functions of several variables (I haven't gotten to that part of calculus yet). I'm looking for a clarification on the correct method of finding such value of $n$ for this function, or maybe even a completely different approach.","['fibonacci-numbers', 'discrete-mathematics']"

The problem here is that I actually did not compute those two integrals myself, I entered them in Maple and for each one of them I got the answers in terms of the error function, however they canceled out luckily and I was left with the correct answer. Can anyone help me evaluating this integral by a clever substitution so that I don't have to deal with non-elementary functions?","['multivariable-calculus', 'integration']"
2655785,Geodesic equation and arclength parametrization,"Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold and $\gamma\subset M$ a curve in $M$. Suppose I would like to show that $\gamma$ satisfies the geodesic equations $$\ddot{x}^k=-\Gamma_{ij}^k\dot{x}^i\dot{x}^j.$$ If $\gamma$ is not parametrized by arc length, $\gamma$ may not satisfy the geodesic equations, as this example demonstrates: Why is $\gamma(t)=(0,t)$ a geodesic in the hyperbolic plane? My question is why a geodesic, which is not parametrized by arc length, may not satisfy the geodesic equations (as in the above example). Do Carmo derives the geodesic equations on page 62 and states that a curve in $M$ is a geodesic iff it satisfies the geodesic equation. Where does he assume that the curve is parametrized by arc length?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
