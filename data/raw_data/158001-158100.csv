2706056,Proving that a cubic curve over $\Bbb{C}$ is homeomorphic to a torus,"Mike Reid's Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry gives a discussion of the topology (as a subspace of $\Bbb{P}^2_{\Bbb{C}}$) of a cubic curve $C : y^2 = q(x) \cup \{\infty\}$,
along the same lines as the answer by user8268 to this MSE question how is a cubic curve topologically equivalent to a torus? Both discussions describe the geometry nicely but don't give details of the proof of the main claim. Reid takes $q(x) = x(x-1)(x-\lambda)$. He considers the function $\pi : C \to \Bbb{P}^1_{\Bbb{C}}$ given in affine coordinates by $(x, y) \mapsto x$ and $\infty \mapsto \infty$. $\pi$ is a double covering except over $\{0, 1, \lambda, \infty\}$. He then considers disjoint paths $01$ and $\lambda\infty$ with the indicated endpoints. Reid claims that if the parts of $C$ lying over these paths is removed, $C$ falls into two pieces. I.e., if we call the two paths $M$ and $N$, he is claiming that $E = C \setminus \pi^{-1}[M \cup N]$ has two connected components. After quite a long struggle, I believe I can now prove this claim using the theory of covering projections.  Here is a sketch of my proof. It is fairly easy to see that $\pi\mid_{E}$ is a (double) covering projection. Since the base $B = \Bbb{P}^1_{\Bbb{C}} \setminus (M \cup N)$ of this double cover is homeomorphic to $S^1 \times (0, 1)$, there are two possibilities: either $E$ is homeomorphic to $B$ and the double cover is induced by the double cover $z \mapsto z^2$ of $S^1$ or $E$ is homeomorphic to the disjoint union $B \sqcup B$ and the double cover is the trivial one that restricts to the identity on each component. What Reid is claiming is that the latter holds, so that there is a continuous map sending $x \in B$ to a $y$ such that $(x, y), (x, -y) \in C$, i.e., we have a continuous choice for $\sqrt{q(x)}$. To see that this holds, take $\alpha : S^1 \to B$ to be a generator of the fundamental group $\pi_1(B)$. We must show that $q \circ \alpha$ lifts to the double cover $z \mapsto z^2$ of $\Bbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$ (so that the lifting provides a value for $\sqrt{q(\alpha(s))}$ as a continuous function of $s \in S^1$). Now parametrise the paths $M$ and $N$ by continuous maps $\mu, \nu: [0, 1] \to \Bbb{P}^1_{\Bbb{C}}$ satisfying: $$\mu(0) = 1 \quad \mu(1) = 0 \quad \nu(0) = \lambda \quad\nu(1) = \infty$$ and, for $t \in [0, 1]$, put: $$
q_t(x) = x (x - \mu(t)) \left(\frac{\lambda x}{\nu(t)} - \lambda\right)
$$ Then $q_t(x)$ has no roots on $B$ and hence we have a homotopy between $q = q_0$ and $q_1$ as maps $B \to \Bbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$. But $q_1(z) = -\lambda z^2$. So $q \circ \alpha$ has degree $2$ and does indeed lift to the double cover of $\Bbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$. I am interested to know whether my proof is the usual one and what alternatives there are. I would appreciate any relevant pointers to the literature. I am guessing that the above is a special case of some general result about the degree of $q \circ \alpha : S^1 \to \Bbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$, where $q$ is polynomial of degree $n$ and $\alpha$ is a curve that winds once around $m$ of the $n$ roots of $q$.","['algebraic-curves', 'reference-request', 'algebraic-geometry']"
2706165,Graph of $\log(3-x)$,"So if $y=\log(3-x) = \log(-x+3)$ then you reflect $\log(x)$ in the $y$ axis to get $\log(-x)$. Then because it is $+3$ inside brackets you then shift to the left by $3$ giving an asymptote of $x=-3$ and the graph crossing the $x$ axis at $(-4,0)$. However this does not work. The answer shows the $+3$ in the bracket shifting the curve to the right by $3$ giving an asymptote of $x=3$ and the curve crossing the $x$ axis at $(2,0)$. Why does it do this?

2706269,Finite union of countable sets is countable.,"Question Is my proof that the union of countable sets is countable correct? If $A_1, A_2, A_3,\dots, A_n$ is a collection of countable sets, then the union: $$A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3 \cup \dots A_n$$ is countable as well. Attempted Proof We attempt to prove the claim by induction. Base case: Consider the set $$B=A_2\setminus A_1$$ Clearly, $B\subseteq A_2$ ( $B$ is countable) and $A_1\cup B$ = $A_1\cup A_2$ . If $B$ is finite, then $$B= \{b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, \dots, b_j \}\quad j\in\mathbb{N}_0$$ and so we can construct a bijection $$f(n)=\begin{cases}
b_n\quad n\leq j\\
a_{n-j}\quad n> j
\end{cases}$$ If $B$ is infinite, then we can construct a bijection $$f(n)=\begin{cases}
b_{\frac n2}\quad n\text{ even}\\
a_{\frac{n+1}{2}}\quad n\text{ odd}
\end{cases}$$ Now, suppose the statement holds for $n= k\geq 2$ , that is, $$A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3 \cup \dots A_k$$ is a countable set. Observe that $$(A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3 \cup \dots A_k)\cup A_{k+1}$$ is a union of two countable sets which, by the base case, is also countable. Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all $n\in\mathbb{N}.\qquad\square$","['proof-writing', 'elementary-set-theory', 'solution-verification']"

2706313,Proving Equation for Timelike Geodesics of a Conformally Flat Metric,"I'm given a conformally flat metric $$g_{\mu\nu} =\Omega(x)\eta_{\mu\nu}$$, and asked to show that for timelike geodesics the geodesic equation takes the form: $$\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} (\Omega \frac{\partial x^{\mu}}{\partial \tau}) +\eta ^{\mu \lambda} \partial_{\lambda} (log(\sqrt{\Omega}))$$ I almost have the result but am off by an extra factor of $\Omega$. The Christoffel symbols evaluate to: $$\frac{1}{2} \Omega^{-1} \eta^{\rho m} (\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial x^{\nu}} \eta_{m \mu} +\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial x^{\mu}} \eta_{m \nu} -\eta_{\mu \nu} \partial_m \Omega)$$, and carrying out the summations over the dummy index m give: $$\frac{1}{2} \Omega^{-1} (\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial x^{\nu}} \delta_{\mu}^{\rho} +\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial x^{\mu}} \delta_{\nu}^{\rho} -\eta_{\mu \nu}\eta^{\rho m} \partial_m \Omega)$$So plugging this result into the geodesic equation:$$ \frac{\partial^{2} x^{\mu}}{\partial \tau^{2}} + \Gamma_{\alpha \beta}^{\mu} \frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d \tau}\frac{dx^{\beta}}{d \tau} =0$$ gives: 
$$ \frac{\partial^{2} x^{\mu}}{\partial \tau^{2}} + \frac{1}{2} \Omega^{-1} (\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial x^{\beta}} \delta_{\alpha}^{\mu} +\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \delta_{\beta}^{\mu} -\eta_{\alpha \beta}\eta^{\mu m} \partial_m \Omega) \frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d \tau}\frac{dx^{\beta}}{d \tau} =0$$ and evaulating further
$$ \frac{\partial^{2} x^{\mu}}{\partial \tau^{2}} + \frac{1}{2} \Omega^{-1} (\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial x^{\beta}}\frac{dx^{\beta}}{d \tau} \frac{dx^{\mu}}{d \tau} +\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d \tau} \frac{dx^{\mu}}{d \tau} -\eta^{\mu \lambda} \partial_{\lambda} \Omega \eta_{\alpha \beta}\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d \tau}\frac{dx^{\beta}}{d \tau}) =0$$ Noting that: 
$$\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial x^{\beta}}\frac{dx^{\beta}}{d \tau} = \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial \tau}, \eta_{\alpha \beta}\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d \tau}\frac{dx^{\beta}}{d \tau} =-1$$ I get:
$$\frac{\partial^{2} x^{\mu}}{\partial \tau^{2}} + \frac{1}{2} \Omega^{-1}(2\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial \tau}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d \tau} + \eta^{\mu \lambda} \partial_{\lambda} \Omega) =0$$ which is rearranged to:
$$\frac{\partial^{2} x^{\mu}}{\partial \tau^{2}} + \Omega^{-1}(\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial \tau}) + \eta ^{\mu \lambda} \partial_{\lambda} (log(\sqrt{\Omega})) =0$$ Which is indeed off by a factor of $\Omega$ from the desired expression.

Assume that the $d$ operator has to jump to go the next variable and each jump results in a change of sign. Consequently to reach $\mu$ it has to make $j$ jumps making the sign to alternate $j$ times.

2706652,On probability matching,"Probability matching is the strategy of betting on different events proportionally to the probability of them happening. In standard decision theory, that's quite a bit worse than just betting all your money on the most likely event. (Assuming linear utility of money.) However, when the utility of the good bet on is not linear, this can make sense. If there is enough food for a population, split over two locations, it makes sense for the population to split matching the ratios. In Nassim Talebs Antifragility the Author writes: The idea of comparative advantage has an analog in probability: if you sample from an urn (with replacement) and get a black ball 60 percent of the time, and a white one 40 percent, the optimal strategy, according to textbooks, is to bet 100 percent of the time on black. The strategy of 60 percent of the time on black and 40 percent on white is called ""probability matching"" and considered to be an error in the decision-science literature. (...) People's instinct to engage in probability matching appears to be sound, not a mistake. In nature, probabilities are unstable (or unknown), and probability matching is similar to redundancy, as a buffer. So if the probabilites change, in other words, if there is another layer of randomness, then the optimal strategy is probability matching. I have tried some simulations using an urn-model as described, but with stochastically fluctuating $p$ (adding some uniform noise to $p$ after every draw), and in all my simulations, probability matching still performed worse. So is the quote nonsense, or are there actual precise conditions making probability matching optimal in the urn model, or at least in a more sophisticated model (not invoking non-linear utilities)?
If the quote is sound, but there are no such precise conditions (or they are not feasible to formulate for you), what is the intuition behind it?","['decision-theory', 'probability']"

Now, also, take the function $$f_2(x)=(x+3)^x.$$ This will give results like $4^1$, for $x=1$, $5^2$, for $x=2$, and $6^3$, for $x=3$, and etc. Both of these kind of relate to Fermat's last theorem and Euler's related conjecture. What's cool is that $f_1(x)=f_2(x)$, when $x=2,3$. However, both functions separate at higher values, for example: $$f_1(4)=3^4+4^4+5^4+6^4=2258\neq f_2(4)=7^4=2401.$$

Given that any squared real expression is $ \ge 0$, the constant is then by default the minimum possible value of the expression. However, after trying many different groupings and simplifications, I cannot figure out how to entirely confine the variable terms into squared expressions, and so every result I get is the combination of a constant term and a variable term. Nothing in the text of the problems suggests that the answer to this question should be so different from the answer to the other two questions, so I think it's still asking for an isolated constant term.

2706836,"""Recursive definitions"" in Tao's Analysis Vol I","I am totally confused when Tao gets into recursive definitions (page 26). Paraphrasing, the axioms of natural numbers let us define sequences recursively. Suppose we want to build a sequence $a_0, a_1, a_2, ...$ by first defining $a_0 := c$ and then letting $a_1 := f_0(a_0)$, then $a_2 := f_1(a_1)$, etc. In general $a_{n++} := f_n(a_n)$. Now he claims that this procedure gives a single value to the sequence element $a_n$, i.e. there is a unique function $a(n)$ from $N$ to $N$ such that $a(0) = c$ and $a(n\text{++}) = f_n(a(n))$ for each natural number $n$. Proof: Induction. $a_0 := c$ as a base case (which does not get redefined by anything else since $n\text{++}$ cannot be $0$ by Peano's third axiom). Then suppose inductively the procedure gives a single value to $a_n$. Then it gives a single value to $a_{n++} := f_n(a_n)$, which does not get redefined anywhere due to the successor function being injective. This completes the induction and so $a_n$ is defined for each natural number $n$ with a single value assigned to each $a_n$. Now, I have no idea what's going on here. I've read this at least ten times and I'm just not seeing it. I don't understand what he's doing here, what he's proving, what he's using this for, etc. He explains this definition right before we move forward into the definitions and derivations for things like addition: $0+m=m$ and $(n\text{++}) + m = (n+m)\text{++}$. I don't understand why we have basically $n$ different functions denoted $f_n()$. Why not just $f()$? What is this function supposed to do? What does this have to do with recursion? What is this allowing us to do? Tao sort of pulls this recursive paragraph out of nowhere and I don't understand what he's connecting this to or how it works or why we need it. For example, if we let $S$ represent the successor function, then addition is defined as $m+0 = m$ with $m+S(n) = S(m+n)$. How would this functional, recursive relationship map between this and what Tao is talking about? What is $a_{n\text{++}}$? What is $f_n(a_n)$?

Assume that for every $i \in I$ the set $I_{\leq i} = \{j \in I\ |\ j \leq i\}$ is finite. This type of poset is useful for induction arguments: you can carry out constructions by induction on the size of $I_{\leq i}$. The type of application I have in mind is the following: Application. Given a functor $F \colon I^{\operatorname{op}} \to \mathscr C$ to some category $\mathscr C$ with fibre products, and given a subcategory $\mathscr C' \subseteq \mathscr C$ of 'nice' objects such that every object of $\mathscr C$ is 'covered' (noncanonically) by an object of $\mathscr C'$, one can construct a covering $G \colon I^{\operatorname{op}} \to \mathscr C'$ of $F$ by induction as follows: for $i$ minimal choose any cover $G(i) \to F(i)$ with $G(i) \in \mathscr C'$. In general, if $I_{\leq i} = \{j_1,\ldots,j_r\}$, choose $G(i) \in \mathscr C'$ as a cover of
$$F(i) \underset{F(j_1)}\times G(j_1) \underset{F(j_2)}\times \cdots \underset{F(j_r)}\times G(j_r),$$
which by construction admits maps to each $G(j_k)$ for $k \in \{1,\ldots,r\}$ making all the necessary diagrams commute. Question. Do these posets have a standard (or non-standard!) name in the literature? I would also be interested in a systematic study of directed posets with this property.

First I tried it on the simple virus dynamic model with immune response. I know I don't need to use this method to calculate R0 to this simple system, but I wanted to try it to get an idea as to how I can use this next generation matrix. The system is, \begin{alignat}{1}
\dot{x} &= λ - dx - βxv,\\
\dot{y} &= βxv - ay-pyz, \\
\dot{v} &= ky - uv,\\
\dot{z}&=cyz-bz

\dot{y} &=~& - ay &~+~& \frac{λβ}{d} v, \\
\dot{v} &=& ky &~-~& uv, \\
\dot {z}&=&-bz
\end{alignat} I tried this with and without $\dot z$ for the infected subsystem (those equations of the ODE system that describe the production of new infections and changes in state among infected individuals), but in both cases as Ro I get   $R_0={\beta \lambda k\over adu}$ . 1)However, Ro for this system should be $R_0={\beta \lambda k\over (a+p \hat z)du}$ where $\hat z$ is the equilbrium state immune response when CTL response is activated. $\hat z={1\over p}({\lambda \beta c k\over cdu+\beta bk}-a)$  . How can I obtain this $R_0$ value using next generation matrix? 2) In this viral model because the virus load doesn't get cleared it reaches the steady state with non zero $\hat z$. But, what happens in a model where the viral load will peak and declines to zero and at the end the model reaches the infection free state with $\hat z$=0. In this case how to include the effect from immune response (z) into $R_0$ as if I let $\hat z=0$, then it will not be included in $R_0$. I don't understand what this $\hat z$ should represent? I am trying to find $R_0$ in a model similar to the model in this article where $B_s,B_r$ are two types of bacteria and $I,P$ are innate and adaptive immune response and $R$ is resource. 3) In a model where the  viral load increase to reach a peak and then declines, does R0 have to change over the increasing and declining phase? What I mean is in the viral growth phase should $R_0>1$ and in the viral decline phase $R_0<1$? So, is the growth and decline are governed by two different $R_0$ values?","['mathematical-modeling', 'biology', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems']"

However, the right hand side is $-4/n^2$ when n is odd but when it is even it is $4/n^2$. If $a_n$ is $ -4/n^2$, then the Fourier series is: 
$$f=\pi^2/3-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 4/n^2*cos(nx)$$.  If I plug in $\pi$, I get $f(\pi)=\pi^2$ and I get this expression above to be $$\pi^2/3-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^n* 4/n^2$$.  So I have equating the two $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n+1}4/n^2=2\pi^2/3$$.$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n+1}/n^2=\pi^2/6$$. I get the alternating series of $1/n^2$ to be $\pi^2/6$.
However, the answer should be $\pi^2/6$ for not the alternating series, but $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 1/n^2$=$\pi^2/6$, the alternating series does not equal this.

2707554,Is it possible to topologize the collection of all Radon measures on a metric space?,"Given a set $X$, an outer measure on $X$ is a function $\mu:\wp(X)\to [0,+\infty]$ such that $\mu(\varnothing)=0$ and $\mu(A)\leq \sum_{j=1}^\infty \mu(A_j)$, whenever $A\subset \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty A_j$. A set $A\subset X$ is said to be measurable if $\mu(S)=\mu(S\cap A)+\mu(S-A)$, for all $S\subset X$. The collection of $\mu$-measurable sets is a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$, so the restriction of an outer measure $\mu$ on the $\mu$-measurable subsets of $X$ is a measure in the usual sense. If $(X,d)$ is a metric space, we say that an outer measure $\mu$ on $X$ is a Radon measure , if $\mu$ is Borel-regular (i.e. every Borel set in $X$ is measurable and, for every $A\subset X$, there is some Borel set $B\supset A$ such that $\mu(A)=\mu(B)$); $\mu(K)<\infty$, for every $K\subset X$ compact; $\mu(A)=\inf\{\mu(U)\,:\, A\subset U, U \text{ open}\}$ for every $A\subset X$; $\mu(U)=\sup\{\mu(K)\,:\, K\subset U, K \text{ compact}\}$ for every open $U\subset X$; Denote the collection of all Radon measures on $(X,d)$ by $\mathcal{R}(X)$. We say that a sequence $\mu_n$ in $\mathcal{R}(X)$ weakly converges to $\mu\in \mathcal{R}(X)$ if
$$\lim_{n\to \infty}\int_Xf\,d\mu_n=\int_Xf\,d\mu,$$
for every $f\in \mathcal{C}_c(X)$ (the set of the continuous functions $f:X\to \mathbb{R}$ with compact support). I want, if possible, to endow $\mathcal{R}(X)$ with a topology such that the notion of convergence induced by it coincides with the weak convergence defined above. Following the idea given here , I've tried the following: For each $f\in \mathcal{C}_c(X)$, $x\in \mathbb{R}$ and $\delta>0$, define
  $$ U_{f,x,\delta}=\left\{\mu\in \mathcal{R}(X)\,:\,\left|\int_Xf\,d\mu-x\right|<\delta \right\},$$
  and consider $\scr B$ the collection of all such $U_{f,x,\delta}$'s. Now try to show that $\scr B$ is a basis for a topology on $\mathcal{R}(X)$; Such topology has the required property (its convergence is given by the weak convergence). To show 1., suppose $\mu\in U_{f,x,\delta}\cap U_{g,y,\epsilon}$. Then we need to find $h\in \mathcal{C}_c(X)$, $z\in \mathbb{R}$ and $\varepsilon>0$ such that
$$ \mu\in U_{h,z,\varepsilon}\subset U_{f,x,\delta}\cap U_{g,y,\epsilon}.$$ Following the definitions, I've got that
$$\left|\int_X(f-g)\,d\mu-(x-y)\right|<\delta+\epsilon,$$
therefore $\mu\in U_{f-g,x-y,\delta+\epsilon}$, but, I was not able to show that $\nu\in U_{f-g,x-y,\delta+\epsilon}\implies \nu\in U_{f,x,\delta}\cap U_{g,y,\epsilon}$ (I think this choice of $h$, $z$ and $\varepsilon$ is probably wrong). And I really don't know what else to do. The Wikipedia link above defines such topology for the collection of probability measures (those with $\mu(X)=1$), not Radon ones...

2707625,Characteristic polynomial of a matrix which stabilizes a point,"I'm confused on a couple of points in this paragraph in A First Course in Modular Forms , section 2.3. Returning to elliptic points, suppose $\tau \in \mathscr H$ is fixed by a nontrivial transformation $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d\end{pmatrix} \in \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$.  Then $a \tau + b = c \tau^2 + d \tau$; solving for $\tau$ with the quadratic equation ($c = 0$ is impossible since $\tau \not\in \mathbb Q)$ and remembering that $\tau \in \mathscr H$ shows that $|a+d| < 2$.  Thus the characteristic polynomial of $\gamma$ is $x^2 +1$ or $x^2 \pm x + 1$.  Since $\gamma$  satisfies its characteristic polynomial, one of $\gamma^4 = I, \gamma^3 = I, \gamma^6 = I$ holds. First, from where can we conclude $|a+d| < 2$?  Next, how are they making conclusions about the characteristic polynomial $$\det \begin{pmatrix} t - a & -b \\ -c & t - d\end{pmatrix} = t^2 + (-a-d)t + ad - bc = t^2 + (-a-d)t + 1$$ from the equation $a \tau + b = c \tau^2 + d \tau$?","['number-theory', 'modular-forms']"

Question: does the $s$ and $t$ nodes represent every possible pair of nodes? To give an example, suppose $s = 1$ and $t = 4$.

I couldn't prove this rigorously though: the way I found this out is that I considered three cases: $x > \frac{1}{2}c \rightarrow$ the rectangle is 'taller' $x < \frac{1}{2}c \rightarrow$ the rectangle is 'wider' $x = \frac{1}{2}c$ For case 1: If I imagine folding the three smaller triangles around the rectangle over the rectangle, but they will overlap $\rightarrow T_{\text{rectangle}} < \Sigma T_{\text{small triangles}}$ For case 2: If I imagine folding again, I get the same inequality as for case 1 For case 3: This is the only case when there's no overlap and $T_{\text{rectangle}} = \Sigma T_{\text{small triangles}}$ Now I suppose I can say that $T_{\text{rectangle}} + \Sigma T_{\text{small triangles}}$ is constant (it's the area of the big triangle), so $T_{\text{rectangle}}$ is maximal for case 3 (How should I prove this rigoruously?) Then of course from $x = \frac{1}{2}c$ it follows that $y = \frac{1}{2}H$ and also that the inscribed rectangle's area is half of the triangle's area. So there, I somewhat solved it... But I would like to see a proof that is more concise, where there are no ambiguous steps. I know that I could also use calculus (at first I was trying to differentiate the area of the rectangle which is $T(x,y) = xy$, but to do that I'd have to express $y$ in terms of $x$ (or vice versa) and it didn't really work out...

2708282,An efficient way to check the coefficient of $x_1 x_2...x_n$ in the product of $m$ polynomials,"We have $n$ variables $x_1, ..., x_n$ and $m$ polynomials $f_1, ..., f_m$. The maximum degree of each variable $x_i$ in each polynomial $f_j$ is $1$. Moreover, each variable is present in at most two of the polynomials and each polynomial contains at most 3 of the variables. We define $F$ as the product of all the polynomials: $F=f_1*f_2*...*f_m$ . We are interested to know whether a particular term ($x_1 x_2...x_n$) appears in $F$ or not. In other words, whether or not the coefficient of $x_1 x_2...x_n$ would be nonzero if we fully expand $F$. Is there an efficient way to check that? Here is an example: $f_1 = (5 x + 3 x y - z)$ $f_2 = (- x y + 2 y )$ $f_3 = (z -3)$ $F = f_1 f_2 f_3 = (5 x + 3 x y - z)(- x y + 2 y)(z -3)$ $F = -30 x y+15 x^2 y-18 x y^2+9 x^2 y^2+6 y z+7 x y z-5 x^2 y z+6 x y^2 z-3 x^2 y^2 z-2 y z^2+x y z^2$ We are interested to know whether or not the coefficient of $xyz$ is zero. In the above example, it is not zero and is equal to $7$. Is there an efficient way to do that (at least for some non-trivial special cases) which is applicable to cases with for example $n=300$ variables and $m=200$ polynomials. Edit : 
this is equivalent to check whether $\alpha = \frac{\partial^n }{\partial x_1 \partial x_2 ... \partial x_n}   F \bigg|_{x_1=x_2=...=x_n=0}$ is zero or not. Is there a reasonable numerical approximation method to check the derivative at the origin? Background : Here is some background information about the origins of this problem for the interested readers: Given any boolean function in 3 variables, we could represent it with a binary vector in an 8 dimensional space with entities equal to 1 iff the the function returns TRUE for that combination of inputs. (i.e. standard sum of products form) We could use the following matrix to linearly map the space of the boolean functions to a new space which can be represented with polynomials in 3 variable: The above matrix defines a reversible transformation (from boolean domain to polynomial domain) with several interesting properties, some listed below: i)  Row $X$ only depends on $x$, and is $1$ in columns with $x$ and $-1$ in columns with $x'$ (complement of $x$). ii) Row $XY$ is the element by element product of row $X$ and row $Y$. (and only depends on $X$ and $Y$, or more specifically $x \mathbin{\oplus} y$). iii) The inner product of each pair of rows (or columns) is zero (orthogonal). iv) All the elements are 1 and -1 (for normalized $w$, it is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$ and $\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$  where $n$ is # of variables) v)  Matrix is symmetric, so $w’=w$ and for normalized $w$, we have $w^{-1}$=$w$. (The inverse transform and forward transform only differ in a constant factor $\frac{1}{2^n}$). vi) Any boolean function on three (or in general $n$) variables, could be represented by binary vector $u$, where $u_i$ is 1 if and only if $f$ is TRUE for the corresponding combination of inputs. vii) Moreover, if we have two functions $f_1$ and $f_2$, $f_{12}=f_1 \land f_2$ is represented by $u_{12}=u_1 * u_2$ where, $*$ is element by element product. Then $v_{12}=w.u_{12}=w(u_1 *u_2)$. (not equal to $w u_1 * w u_2$, however you can perform regular multiplication in polynomial domain you just need to replace any $x^2$ with $1$ at the end and it will be equivalent to $\land$ in boolean domain. Note that given (iv), square of any row will be equal to row $1$) viii)   Similarly with three functions $f_{123}=f_1 \land f_2 \land f_3$, we have $u_{123}=u_1*u_2*u_3$, $v_{123}=w(u_1*u_2*u_3)$ ix) If we multiply $F$ by $X$ in polynomial domain, in boolean domain all the terms with $x$ will be multiplied by $1$ and all the terms with $x'$ will be multiplied by $-1$. x) $F(X=0)$ in polynomial domain gives the number of solutions ($1$ elements) in boolean domain. Similarly, the coefficient for $X$ in polynomial domain is the number of solutions with $x=TRUE$ minus number of solutions with $x=FALSE$. Similarly the coefficient for $XY$ is the number of solutions with $xy$ weighted by parity (i.e. $xy$ and $x'y'$ solutions are counted with positive sign and $xy'$ and $x'y$ solutions are counted with negative sign). This is also direct consequence of i and ii. Is there any good references for this transformation? Is it known by any names so I can look it up? Any ideas for possible applications? My motivation was that using these orthogonal bases, one could simplify some computations in the transformed domain (e.g. develop faster algorithms for solving SAT or simplify logical circuits using algebraic and non-algebraic methods). To test if a set of boolean equations are simultaneously satisfiable, one could transform them to polynomials, expand them, replace all $x_i^2$ with $1$ and check if the remainder is absolute zero or not. To do it more efficiently, one could set $x_i$ to zero to eliminate some intermediate terms as expanding. For example suppose $x_i$ is only present in $f_1=a x_i +b$ and $f_2 = c x_i +d$, expanding for $x_i$ and eliminating $x_i$ using the above method would yeild: $F = f_1 f_2 f_3 ... f_m = (a x_i +b)(c x_i +d)f_3 ... f_m =(ac x_i^2  +(bc+ad) x_i +bd)f_3 ... f_m \\ \equiv (ac+bd) f_3 ... f_m$ We can then continue with eliminating other variables. After eliminating all the variables, the remainder would give the total number of solutions that would satisfy all the equations simultaneously.

2708350,Proving the trichotomy of order for the natural numbers,"Is my proof correct? The trichotomy of order for natural numbers states: Let $a,b$ be natural numbers. Then exactly one of the following statements is true: I. $a < b$ II. $a = b$ III. $a > b$ Proof: If $a < b$ then by definition $a \neq b$. If $a > b$ then $a \neq b$ by definition as well. Therefore it is not possible to have I and II be true at the same time, nor II and III be true at the same time, nor I, II, and III be true at the same time. If $a < b$ and $a > b$ then it means we can write $a = b + m$ and $b = a + n$ for natural numbers $n,m$ where $a \neq b$. By substitution, $a = a + n + m$, which by cancellation law is $0 = n + m$. This also means $n = m = 0$, suggesting that $a = b$, a contradiction. Therefore it is not possible for I and III to be true at the same time. Now we will show that at least one of I, II, or III is true via induction on $a$. Base case: Let $a=0$. If $b=0$, then $a=b$, statement II, is true. If $b \neq 0$, then statement I is true, $0 < b$, since we can write $0 + m = m = b$ where $0 \neq b$. Inductive step: Suppose either $a < b$, $a = b$, or $a > b$ is true. We need to show that $S(a) < b$, $S(a) = b$, or $S(a) > b$ is true. If $a > b$, then $S(a) > b$ is true, since $a = b + m$ where $a \neq b$, so we also have $S(a) = S(b + m) = b + S(m)$ which satisfies the definition for $S(a) > b$ as long as $S(a) \neq b$. And $S(a) \neq b$ is true, since if it weren't, we'd have $b = b + S(m)$ or $0 = S(m)$ by additive identity and cancellation law, and $0$ is not a successor of any natural number. If $a = b$, then $S(a) > b$ is true. This is because if $a = b$ then $S(a) = S(b) = S(b + 0) = b + S(0)$ which satisfies the definition for $S(a) > b$ as long as $S(a) \neq b$. And $S(a) \neq b$ is still true, since if it weren't, we'd have $b = b + S(0)$ or $0 = S(0)$ by additive identity and cancellation law, and $0$ is not a successor of any natural number. If $a < b$, then either $S(a) < b$ or $S(a) = b$ is true. We can write $b = a + m$ for some $m$ where $a \neq b$ (so $m \neq 0$). Suppose $m=S(0)$. Then $b = a + S(0) = S(a + 0) = S(a)$. If $m \neq S(0)$, then $S(a) \neq b$, so it suffices to show that $b = S(a) + k$ for some $k$. If we let $S(k) = m$ (which is valid since we have $m \neq 0$), then $b = a + S(k) = S(a + k) = S(a) + k$ holds. This closes the induction.","['real-analysis', 'inequality', 'proof-verification', 'logic', 'peano-axioms']"

2708596,Puzzle reference request: planting trees in a semicircle orchard,"I saw this puzzle once, but cannot find any reference on this now. Can you find a reference? In a semicircle orchard, trees are planted in the orchard in the given manner: after the $n^\text{th}$ tree is planted, the orchard is divided into $n$ equal sectors, and each sector must contain exactly one tree. The trees cannot be on the sector boundaries. How many trees can be planted in this manner? The puzzle says that there's a proof that at most 17 trees can be planted. 
Also, a related question: if instead of a semicircle, the orchard is a circle, can more trees be planted? Edit: The first problem is usually called ""Irregularity of Distribution"". A website that illustrates this is http://weitz.de/irr/ I have solved the second question. There's a pattern by which the trees can be planted and the sectors be divided, so that the trees can be planted endlessly. Let the circle be $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$, written as $[0, 1)$. Then the trees are planted in this manner: $$t_1 = 0, t_2 = 1/2, t_3 = 1/4, t_4=3/4, ...$$ and in general, $\forall n \geq 1, 1 \leq i \leq 2^n$ $$t_{2^n + i} = t_i + 1/2^{n+1}$$ This has a very geometric meaning if you draw it out on a circle. Basically, for the points $2^n+1, ... 2^n+ 2^n$, just take the points $1, ... 2^n$ and shift them clockwise by $1/2^{n+1}$. Then, after planting the $n$th tree, let the $n$ sectors be divided at the points $t_{n+1}, t_{n+1} + 1/n, ...$ Then each tree is in a unique sector.","['puzzle', 'reference-request', 'recreational-mathematics', 'geometry']"

Prove that $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty}f(x)$ and $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to -\infty}f(x)$ exist and are infinite. I eventually found the official solution, but I don't quite understand it.

If $M$ were unbounded above, then there is $(x_n) \to \infty$ such that $f(x_n)=a$. But we know $\lim_{n \to \infty}f(f(x_n))=\infty$ and so we would have $f(a)=\infty$, which can't be. So $M$ is either empty, or bounded above. However it is, there is $\delta>0$ such that $f(x) \neq a, \: \forall x \geq \delta$. Since f has the intermediate value property, it follows that $f(x)<a, \: \forall x \geq \delta$ or $f(x)>a, \forall x \geq \delta$. Without loss of generality, suppose $f(x)<a, \: \forall x \geq \delta$. We will prove $\lim_{x \nearrow a}f(x)=\infty$. Let $(y_n)$ be strictly increasing and convergent to $a$. Then there is $n_0$ such that $f(\delta)<y_n<a, \: \forall n \geq n_0$.

If it were unbounded above, we would get a contradiction as we did before. Thus it is bounded and let $x_n=\sup M_n \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $x_n \in M_n$, so $f(x_n)=y_n$.

2708931,Proving the Fubini-Tonelli Theorem,"Okay, so the notes I'm using give the theorem as follows: Let $ (\Omega_1, \mathcal{A}_1, \mu_1) $ and $ (\Omega_2, \mathcal{A}_2, \mu_2) $ be two $ \sigma-$finite measure spaces. $ (1) $ If $ f \colon \left(\Omega_1 \times \Omega_2 \right) \rightarrow \left(\overline{\mathbb{R}}, \mathcal{B} (\overline{\mathbb{R}}) \right) $ is a non-negative function, then $ x \mapsto \int_{\Omega_2} f(x,y) \ d\mu_2 (y) $ is $ \mathcal{A}_1 - \mathcal{B}(\overline{\mathbb{R}}) $ measurable and $ y \mapsto \int_{\Omega_1} f(x,y) \ d\mu_1 (x) $ is $ \mathcal{A}_2 - \mathcal{B} (\overline{\mathbb{R}}) $ measurable. Then we have $ \int_{\Omega_1 \times \Omega_2} f \ d (\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2) = \int_{\Omega_1} \left(\int_{\Omega_2} f(x,y) \ d\mu_2 (y) \right) \ d\mu_1 (x) = \int_{\Omega_2} \left(\int_{\Omega_1} f(x,y) \ d\mu_1 (x) \right) \ d \mu_2(y) $. $ (2) $ If $ f \in \mathcal{L}^1 \left(\Omega_1 \times \Omega_2, \mathcal{A_1} \otimes \mathcal{A_2}, \mu_1 \otimes \mu_2 \right) $ then $ f(x, \cdot) \in \mathcal{L}^1 \left(\Omega_2, \mathcal{A}_2, \mu_2 \right) \ \mu_1 $-a.e. $ f(\cdot, y) \in \mathcal{L}^1 \left(\Omega_1, \mathcal{A}_1, \mu_1 \right) \ \mu_2 $-a.e. I'm pretty sure I understand the proof of (1) pretty well as a consequence of Monotone Convergence and the properties of the product measure. What's confusing me is the notes' justification for (2); they claim that (2) follows from (1) and the fact that any non-negative measurable function is the pointwise limit of an isotone sequence of non-negative simple functions. I just don't see how. So first of all I want to know if that's just a typo (he refers to ""Lemma 4.4""; Lemma 4.4 is in fact a theorem , which makes me suspicious), and what has been written makes no sense; secondly I want to check that my proof makes sense. Obviously I'll only prove the first case; the proof of the second is no different. Wlog we can assume that $ f $ is non-negative (then for arbitrary $ f $ we know that the restrictions of $ f^+ $ and $ f^- $ are integrable almost everywhere, say on $ N_+^C, N_-^C $, then we have that the restriction of $ f $ is integrable on their intersection, which is also the complement of the null set $ N_+ \cup N_- $ ). We have $ \int_{\Omega_1 \times \Omega_2} f \ d (\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2) = \int_{\Omega_1} \left(\int_{\Omega_2} f(x,y) \ d\mu_2 (y) \right) \ d\mu_1 (x) < \infty $. In particular, the non-negative function $ x \mapsto \int_{\Omega_2} f(x,y) \ d\mu_2 (y) $ is contained in $ \mathcal{L}^1 \left(\Omega_1, \mathcal{A}_1, \mu_1 \right) $. Therefore, $ \int_{\Omega_2} f(x,y) \ d\mu_2 (y)  $ is finite outside of a null set, say $ N $ (this was proved in the course; in general an integrable function is finite almost everywhere). So on $ N^C $ the non-negative function $ y \mapsto f(x,y) $ is integrable, i.e. $ f(x, \cdot) \in \mathcal{L}^1 \left(\Omega_2, \mathcal{A}_2, \mu_2 \right) \mu_1 $-a.e., as required. Seems pretty basic, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything, since I may be forced to prove this in an exam in the not too distant future.","['product-space', 'measure-theory']"
2708959,Sum of independent Geometric and NegBin random variables,"Let $Y\sim \operatorname{Geom}(p)$ and $X\sim \operatorname{Negbin}(k,p)$ be independent. I’m trying to find the distribution of $X+Y$. What I have thus far is:
$$P(X+Y=m)=\sum_{i=1}^{m-k} P(X=m-i)\space P(Y=i)$$
$$=\frac{p^{k+1}(1-p)^{m-k}}{1-p} \space \sum_{i=1}^{m-k} \binom{m-i-1}{k-1}$$ From here, I’m not sure how to simplify the summation above. I tried expanding it, and it does not seem to be complicated, as it’s simply the sum of the binomial coefficients $\binom{m}{k-1}+\cdots+\binom{k-1}{k-1}$.
Any advice to simplify this summation? Thanks in advance!",['probability-theory']

2708979,How to determine $\prod_{g\in G}g$ in all generality,"This question is based on another question that is closed as a duplicate: How to determine $\prod_{g\in G}g$? , which was in the reopening queue but is removed again, so I decided to ask myself. (""This question has been asked before and already has an answer. If those answers do not fully address your question, please ask a new question ."") So the question was Let $G$ be a finite Abelian group, then determine
  $\prod\limits_{g\in G}g.$ This question has answers in the original post and here . I reasoned as follows: If there is no element of order 2, every element and its inverse appear in the product, and the identity $e$ appears once, such that the product equals $e$. By Cauchy's theorem, this is the case when $\mathrm{order}(G)$ is odd. If $\mathrm{order}(G)$ is even, again by Cauchy's theorem, there is an element of order $2$. Suppose there are $k$ elements of order $2$ and denote these by $g_1,g_2,\ldots,g_k$. Then, because $G$ is abelian by assumption, $\{e,g_1,g_2,\ldots,g_k\}\subset G$ is a subgroup (verify this). Then by Cauchy's theorem again, the order of this subgroup must be even, thus $k$ is odd. If we write out $\prod_{g\in G}g$ now, we observe that for all $g\not\in\{e,g_1,g_2,\ldots,g_k\}$, both the element and its inverse appear exactly once in the product, thereby yielding the identity element. Thus the product reduces to $\prod_{i=1}^{k}g_i$. For $k=1$, it's simple, $\prod_{g\in G}g=g_1$, for $k=3$ also: $\prod_{g\in G}g=g_1\circ g_2\circ g_3=g_3^2=e$, since $g_1\circ g_2\not\in \{e,g_1,g_2\}$. For any $k>3$ (the general case) the product reduces to exactly one element in $\{e,g_1,g_2,\ldots,g_k\}$ but to be honest I don't see how to infer anything about this. So this is not a duplicate of the linked questions, the way I see it, because you are asked to determine the product in all generality. Maybe someone else knows how to calculate the product for $k>3$. Question : for the case described above, how do I determine $\prod\limits_{g\in G}g$? This case is not treated in the other answers. Obviously the product reduces to exactly one element in $\{e,g_1,g_2,\ldots,g_k\}$, but can we say for which values of $k$ the product equals $e$ and when it equals a non-identity element from $\{e,g_1,g_2,\ldots,g_k\}$? And please, don't close again unless there is a good reason. Also, if I'm missing something and I'm asking something that is totally trivial, please explain!

2709011,For i.i.d. $\{X_n\}$ proving $\frac1n\max\limits_{1\leqslant k\leqslant n}|X_k|\xrightarrow{\mathrm{a.s.}}0\Leftrightarrow E(|X_1|)<+∞$,"$\def\d{\mathrm{d}}$Given that $X_1, X_2, \cdots$ are i.i.d., prove that$$
\frac{1}{n} \max_{1 \leqslant k \leqslant n} |X_k| \xrightarrow{\mathrm{a.s.}} 0 \Longleftrightarrow E(|X_1|) < +\infty.
$$ My try: Because $\varliminf\limits_{n \to \infty} \dfrac{1}{n} \max\limits_{1 \leqslant k \leqslant n} |X_k|$ and $\varlimsup\limits_{n \to \infty} \dfrac{1}{n} \max\limits_{1 \leqslant k \leqslant n} |X_k|$ are both measurable with respect to the exchangeable σ-algebra of $X_1, X_2, \cdots$, they are both almost surely constants by the Hewitt-Savage 0-1 law, i.e.$$
\varliminf_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \max_{1 \leqslant k \leqslant n} |X_k| = c_1, \quad \text{a.s.} \tag{1}\\
\varlimsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \max_{1 \leqslant k \leqslant n} |X_k| = c_2, \quad \text{a.s.}
$$
where $c_1, c_2 \in [0, +\infty]$. Also, if the distribution function of $|X_1|$ is $F(x)$, then the distribution function of $\dfrac{1}{n} \max\limits_{1 \leqslant k \leqslant n} |X_k|$ is$$
F_n(x) = P\left( \frac{1}{n} \max_{1 \leqslant k \leqslant n} |X_k| \leqslant x \right) = \prod_{k = 1}^n P(|x_k| \leqslant nx) = (F(nx))^n,
$$
which implies\begin{align*}
E\left( \frac{1}{n} \max_{1 \leqslant k \leqslant n} |X_k| \right) &= \int_0^{+\infty} x \,\d((F(nx))^n) = \frac{1}{n} \int_0^{+\infty} y \,\d((F(y))^n)\\
&= \frac{1}{n} \int_0^{+\infty} y·n (F(y))^{n - 1} \,\d F(y) = \int_0^{+\infty} y (F(y))^{n - 1} \,\d F(y)\\
&\leqslant \int_0^{+\infty} y \,\d F(y) = E(|X_1|).
\end{align*}
Also for any $c > 0$,$$
\sum_{k = 1}^\infty P(|X_1| \geqslant ck) < \infty \Longleftrightarrow E(|X_1|) < +\infty. \tag{2}
$$
However, I failed to connect (1) and (2) to prove the proposition. Any ideas are appreciated. Thanks in advance.","['probability-theory', 'convergence-divergence']"
