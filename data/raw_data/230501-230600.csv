4783526,Dot product rules with vectors,Let $u$ and $v$ be vectors where $u\neq v$ in the equation: $$2u\cdot(u-v)=u\cdot(u-v)$$ I am trying to find a reason why you cant just cancel out the $(u-v)$ from both sides. My reasoning is that dividing either side by $(u-v)$ would be dividing a scalar by a vector. I'm not sure if this is the reason why or if it has to do with another rule of the dot product.,"['calculus', 'vectors']"

User Greg Martin has already given a wonderful explanation for the relation of this sequence to this one. This sequence can also be defined by the highest power $n$ of $2$ such that it divides $\binom{2n}{n}$ My Sequence was the Powers of $2$ in the Denominator of the Generalization. Also it contained Binomial Terms in numerator so it seems what I got was the reduced denominator (as the powers of 2 got cancelled in numerator and denominator).",['sequences-and-series']

Problem : imagine Spider-man walking on the cantor function (see the plot like the side of a building) : Now he can throw a line to come faster to the top of the stairs . The problem is the spider-man webs can only solidify on an angle(i.e corner). Question : If spiderman have a limitied number of spider-webs which stay only on angle (corner) what is the probability he comes to the top of the stairs on a limited interval of the Cantor's function admitting it's his only means of transport ? Do you have a strategy ? I have no attempt because it's a new problem for me but Bernoulli's distribution could be a start  . Example of path to come on a horizontal line : The new question is : Finalizing Question : If Spiderman is a point on that curve and have the probability $P=1/2$ to get a rational point $(x_i,y_i)$ on the curve he choose (The Cantor set here) and stop if the point is irrational what's the probability he goes at the top of the devil staircase ( $x=y=1$ ) if he is assimilated to an increasing unknow $x$ starting to $x=0$ and $x_i<x_{i+1}$ .In other word what's the probability he diverges (projective geometrical point of view) to $x=y=1$ choosing a number of rational point which is bounded  ? We can bound it with the Fréchet-Boole's inequality . To figure it see : Another one and Thomae function The problem can be reformulate in term of Brownian motion : Simplifying question for kids : If now a kid plays with a Soap bubble and the bubble in a slight wind goes to a staircase what's chance the bubble don't collapse before the end of the next level of the home?

4783566,Why does {$i \mid i \notin S_i$} lead to a contradiction when showing the set all subsets of a countably infinite set are uncountable?,"In the following explanation of why all subsets of a countably infinite set are uncountable, I am not understanding why the existence of { $i \mid i \notin S_i$ } leads to a contradiction: The set of all subsets of a countably infinite set is uncountable.
Answer: True. Assume the sets are countable and thus each set corresponds to a natural number: $S_i$ . The set { $i \mid i \notin S_i$ } cannot be any of the $S_i$ 's since it differs on whether $i$ is in the set of not. I am wondering if here there is a certain way with which we associate a set with the natural number corresponding to it such that the set { $i \mid i \notin S_i$ } leads to a contradiction somehow- must $S_i$ contain $i$ ? What would the construction of the $S_i$ formally look like? I am at a loss to understand how this leads to a contradiction, and would appreciate if someone could elucidate this.","['elementary-set-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"

4783740,When is the derived category of the equivariant category of an abelian category the same as the equivariant category of its derived category?,"Let $G$ be a finite group acting on an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ in the sense of Deligne (see e.g. Definition 3.1 in Elagin, On equivariant triangulated Categories ). Then we can define the equivariant category $\mathcal{A}_G$ . The objects are pairs $(E,\{\lambda_g\}_{g\in G})$ where $E\in\mathcal{A}$ is a G-invariant objects of $\mathcal{A}$ and each $\lambda_g\colon E\rightarrow g^\ast E$ is a choice of isomorphism (and morphisms have some compatibility with the group action). There is also an induced action of $G$ on the bounded derived category, $D^b(\mathcal{A})$ , so one can form the equivariant category of that, $D^b(\mathcal{A})_G$ . Q: When is $D^b(\mathcal{A})_G\cong D^b(\mathcal{A}_G)$ ? This is true when $\mathcal{A}=Coh(X)$ , where $X$ is a scheme and $G$ is a linearly reductive (not necc. finite!) group acting on $X$ (which induces an action on $Coh(X)$ by pullback), see Theorem 9.6 in Elagin, Cohomological descent theory for a morphism of stacks and for equivariant derived categories .

Question. Is it true that a convex subset $S\subseteq X$ is closed in the both the weak topologies generated by $\mathscr{A}$ and $\mathscr{B}$ (that is, $S$ is closed in $(X,\sigma(X,\mathscr{A})$ and $(X,\sigma(X,\mathscr{B}))$ ) if and only if $S$ is closed in $(X,\sigma(X,\mathscr{C}))$ ? The ""if"" part should be trivial by the fact that $\mathscr{C}\subseteq \mathscr{A}$ and $\mathscr{C}\subseteq \mathscr{B}$ , so that $\sigma(X,\mathscr{C})\subseteq \sigma(X,\mathscr{A})$ and $\sigma(X,\mathscr{C})\subseteq \sigma(X,\mathscr{B})$ (without the hypothesis that $S$ is convex). What about the converse? Ps.

One approach that might be promising is to consider $P$ fixed as the $xy$ -plane, and ask instead about the choice of orthogonal unit vectors $v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4$ such that the resulting cube intersects $P$ well; this amounts to intersecting some bands that are the projection of the inequalities $0\le (x,y,z,w)\cdot v\le 1$ .

4783939,"Polya's urn, should I use martingales or LLN","I am trying to prove the following question, but I am finding it a bit tricky to determine the distribution of $X_i$ (the number of red balls drawn in the $i$ -th round) and thus I do not know which approach I should use to prove this. All help is appreciated! Consider an urn with r red and b blue balls initially present. In each
round a ball is drawn from the urn uniformly at random, and then
replaced together with another ball of the same colour. Let $R_n$ denote
the number of red balls in the urn after n rounds. Show that, almost
surely, $R_n \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ , i.e. that red balls are drawn infinitely many
times. My first thought is the following: Since after each round the ball is replaced together with an identical copy, we should have $(r+b)+i$ balls in the urn after $i$ rounds and therefore the number of balls is constantly growing for each round, and each of these $(r+b)+i$ balls is equally likely to be drawn. Because of this, the variables in the sequence are not independent and the distribution depends on the outcome of the previous round, so, $X_i$ should be Bernoulli distributed with parameter p. And if this is right, I should not be able to use the law of large numbers to prove this since the Law of Large Numbers typically assumes that the random variables are identically and independently distributed. If this is true, I should probably use Martingales to prove the question instead. However, when I looked around with some classmates, chatGPT and read on the internet, it still seems that some say that $X_i$ in this case is Binomial distributed with parameter $p$ and goes on to use the law of large numbers to prove this. Since this type of urn-problem is new to me I do not feel certain with which way is the correct way to proceed proving this (Martingales or LLN) and I would appreciate all the help to clarify which way is correct and what the distribution of $X_i$ is in this case!","['polya-urn-model', 'martingales', 'law-of-large-numbers', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

Take a sequence $\{x_n\}\subset Ker(T)$ . Suppose that $x_n\to x\in X$ as $n\to \infty$ in $X$ . Since $T$ is bounded, then there exists some constants so that $\|T\|\le M$ . Then $$
\|Tx_n-Tx\|\le \|T\|\|x_n-x\|\le M\|x_n-x\|
$$ As $n\to \infty$ , we have $$
0\le \|Tx\|=\|Tx_n-Tx\|\to 0
$$ Then $x\in Ker(T)$ . Thus $ker(T)$ is closed. For (2) , I consider an example of an identical map from $c_{00}$ to $c_0$ equipped with sup norm: $$
T: c_{00}\to c_0
$$ Since $\|T\{x_k\}\|_\infty\le \|\{x_k\}\|_{\infty}$ , then for $x=\{x_k\}$ , $$
\|T\|=\sup_{\|x\|\le 1} \|Tx\|\le \|x\|\le 1
$$ Also, the image of $c_{00}$ is just $c_{00}$ which is not closed in $c_0$ . Because $c_{00}$ is not complete and by the result ""Let $X$ be a Banach space. The linear subspace $Y$ of $X$ is complete iff $Y$ is closed in $X$ "". So $Im(T)=c_{00}$ is not closed in $c_0$ .","['banach-spaces', 'normed-spaces', 'analysis', 'real-analysis', 'solution-verification']"
4784019,"In a MOBA, is it possible for every character to have a <50% winrate?","In a recent discussion with friends we were discussing win-rates in a video game. One person suggested it made sense that every champion could have a less than 50% win rate, while another suggested this was impossible because every loss suffered for a champion would result in a win for another. In practice it seems highly unlikely to ever have a <50% win rate for every character in a team based game like a MOBA, however we weren't able to come to the an answer and none of us are good enough at statistics for a definitive answer. Some constraints and details to consider given the ruleset of a MOBA like League of Legends: Win rate is defined as the percentage of games won for a specific character. Every game has an equal number of winning and losing players (5 on each side). I would prefer to disregard scenarios in which a player leaves in which case there would be 4 on one side and 5 on the other. Each player will select the character they play before the game begins from a list of characters. This list is larger than 10 so their will be characters whose win rates are not affected if they do not appear in a game. Players are unable to switch characters mid game. Each character may appear once on each team, which means their are a minimum of 5 characters and a maximum of 10 appearing in each game. If a character is on both teams in a game the result would count as both a loss and a win for that character, otherwise if the character is ""unmirrored"" it would only be a win or a loss depending on the result. Draws are not allowed, or at least do not affect win rates.",['statistics']

Problem: In my case, $X = \textit{BV}([a,b])\times\textit{BV}([a,b])$ , where $\textit{BV}([a,b])$ is the set of all real-valued functions on $[a,b]$ that are of bounded variation, $Y = \mathbb R$ , and $$f(F,G) = \int_a^b F\,\mathrm dG.$$ Here the integral is the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral; note that since real-valued functions on a compact set that are of bounded variation are also bounded and real-valued functions are measurable, $f$ is well-defined. Is $f$ Hadamard differentiable (maybe tangentially to some subset $U$ ) for each $(F,G)\in X$ ?

I wrote $B(F(a))$ instead of $B(a)F(a)$ (and similar for $b$ ). The error is also in the comments. I hope this error didn't cause any confusion. > However, since I am operating on the larger space $\textit{BV}([a,b])\times\textit{BV}([a,b])$ , I suppose that this result no longer holds. Therefore my question: is there any hope that $f$ is still Hadamard differentiable on this larger space? Unfortunately, I have no idea how to tackle this problem. So any help is appreciated. The functions I want apply $f$ to are the of the form $\frac{L + R}2$ , where $L$ and $R$ are left- and right-continuous functions with the same points discontinuities (i.e., if $L$ is discontinuous at $t\in[a,b]$ , then so is $R$ ). So I have some form of continuity and an at most countable set of discontinuities.

My thoughts: I tried to find the first turning point to the right of the $y$ -axis, without success.

Finding the roots of $f(x)$ $f(x)=\text{Im}\sum\limits_{k=1}^n e^{kxi}=\dots=\dfrac{\sin x+\sin ((nx+x)-x)-\sin (nx+x)}{2-2\cos x}=0$ If $\sin (nx)=0$ then $(\sin x)(1-\cos (nx))=0\implies x=0, \pi, \frac{2k\pi}{n}$ If $\sin (nx+x)=0$ then $(\sin x)(1-\cos ((n+1)x)=0\implies x=0, \pi, \frac{2k\pi}{n+1}$ We have found $n+1$ distinct roots. Now we will show that these are the only roots. $\sin (kx)=\text{Im}(\cos x+i\sin x)^k=(\sin x)(k-1 \text{ -degree polynomial in $\cos x$})$ $\implies f(x)=(\sin x)(n-1 \text{ -degree polynomial in }\cos x)$ The $n-1 \text{ degree polynomial in }\cos x$ has at most $n-1$ distinct roots in $\cos x$ , so it has at most $n-1$ distinct roots in $x$ . The roots of $\sin x$ are $0$ and $\pi$ . So $f(x)$ has at most $n+1$ distinct roots in $x$ . So the $n+1$ roots that I found above, are the only roots. Showing that $f(x)$ has exactly one turning point between neighboring roots $\cos (kx)=\text{Re}(\cos x+i\sin x)^k=k \text{ -degree polynomial in $\cos x$}$ $\implies f'(x)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k\cos (kx)$ is an $n$ -degree polynomial in $\cos x$ So $f'(x)$ has at most $n$ distinct roots in $\cos x$ , so it has at most $n$ distinct roots in $x$ . So $f(x)$ has at most $n$ turning points. Earlier we found that $f(x)$ has at exactly $n+1$ distinct roots.

For an injective self-adjoint operator, the range is dense, which shows that $A^{-1}$ is a densely-defined operator. By the assumption on the spectrum, the function $\sigma(A)\ni\lambda\mapsto\lambda^{-1}$ is well-defined and

Prove that $2^{n^2}\geq n^n$ . Here is my attempt: First, we define that $P(n):= 2^{n^2} \geq n^n$ . Base Case : $P(1):2^{1^2} =2^1\geq 1^1=1$ Therefore, $P(1)$ is true. Inductive Step : Suppose that $P(k):2^{k^2} \geq k^k$ is true for natural number $k.$ We are going to show that $P(k+1)$ is also true by induction hypothesis. Starting from the left side, we have $$2^{(k+1)^2}=2^{k^2+2k+1}=2^{k^2}\cdot 2^{2k}\cdot 2^1$$ Now, we know that from the induction hypothesis, $2^{k^2}\geq k^k$ , so we have $$2^{k^2}\cdot 2^{2k}\cdot 2^1 \geq k^k \cdot 2^{2k}\cdot 2^1$$ Now, we want to show that $k^k \cdot 2^{2k}\cdot 2^1\geq (k+1)^{k+1}$ . We can rewrite $(k+1)^{k+1}$ as $(k+1)^k \cdot (k+1)$ , and by the binomial expansion, we have $$(k+1)^k = k^k + \binom{k}{1} k^{k-1} + \binom{k}{2} k^{k-2} + \ldots + \binom{k}{k-1} k + 1$$ Now, notice that $\binom{k}{1} k^{k-1} \leq k^k$ because $\binom{k}{1} = k$ , and for all positive integers $k$ , it is obvious that $k^{k-1} \leq k^k$ . Similarly, $$\binom{k}{2} k^{k-2} = \frac{k^k-k^{k-1}}{2} \leq k^k$$ $$\binom{k}{3} k^{k-3} = \frac{k^k-3k^{k-1}+2k^{k-2}}{6} \leq k^k$$ $$\vdots$$ $$\binom{k}{k-1} k = k^2 \leq k^k$$ $$\binom{k}{k} 1 = 1 \leq k^k$$ So, we can rewrite $(k+1)^k$ as $(k+1)^k = k^k + \text{some terms that are less than or equal to } k^k$ . The problem arise when we form an inequality $$(k+1)^k \leq k^k + k\cdot k^k = k^k + k^{k+1}$$ Now, multiplying both sides of this inequality by $k+1$ we get $$(k+1)^k \cdot (k+1) \leq (k^k + k^{k+1}) \cdot (k+1) = k^k \cdot (k+1)^2$$ I want to show that $(k+1)^{k+1} \leq 2^{(k+1)^2}$ , but I don't know if it is okay to do this : I know that $n^2 \leq 2^n$ for natural number $n\geq 4$ which is also can be proven by induction. Therefore, I can say that $(k+1)^2 \leq 2^{k+1}$ for natural number $k\geq 4$ . Thus I have $$ k^k \cdot 2^{k+1}\geq k^k \cdot (k+1)^2 \geq (k+1)^{k+1}.$$ Therefore, $$2^{(k+1)^2} = 2^{k^2} \cdot 2^{k+1} \geq k^k \cdot 2^{k+1}\geq k^k \cdot (k+1)^2 \geq (k+1)^{k+1} $$ $\therefore$ $P(k+1)$ is true.

4784462,A possible criterion for a function on a complex analytic space to be holomorphic,"Let $(X, \mathcal O)$ be a reduced complex analytic space, and $f:X \rightarrow \mathbb C$ be a continuous function. Assume that for all holomorphic mappings $F$ from unit disc $D \subset \mathbb C$ to $X$ the function $f \circ F$ is holomorphic on $D$ . Is it true that $f$ is holomorphic on $X$ ? The inspiration for this question comes from a form of Ruckert's Nullstellensatz, that states that a for a reduced (i.e. without nilpotent elements) analytic algebra $A$ and a non-zero element $s \in A$ there exists a homomorphism $\phi: A \rightarrow \mathcal O_1$ such that $\phi(s) \ne 0$ (here $\mathcal O_1$ denotes the algebra of convergent power series of one variable). That is, if $(X,\mathcal O)$ is a complex space, which is reduced at a point $x \in X$ , then a germ of analytic function at a point $x$ is completely determined by its compositions with holomorphic maps from a neighborhood of $0$ in $\mathbb C$ to $X$ that map $0$ to $x$ . I already understood that this concept can lead to an easy proof of the maximum modulus principle: if absolute value of a holomorphic function has local maximum at $x$ , then $f$ is constant in some neighborhood of $x$ . Indeed, then compositions of $f$ with maps from $D$ to $X$ that map $0$ to $x$ are all contants (equal to $f(x)$ ) due to maximum modulus principle on $D$ . Thus, the germ of $f$ at $x$ coincides with the germ of the constant function $f(x)$ . It is easy to see that this question (if the statement is indeed true) can lead to an easy proof of the fact that a limit of sequence of holomorphic functions that converges uniformly on compact sets is again holomorphic. The proof of this fact in the book of Gunning and Rossi is far more complicated.

4784544,Impossibility of trisecting the 60° angle using only a straightedge and compass,"In my lecture notes (and elsewhere on the Internet), the proof starts like this: Let's consider a $60^{\circ}$ angle and let's show that trisecting the angle (i.e. constructing 3 angles of $20^\circ$ ) would imply constructing $\cos(20^\circ)=\cos(\pi/9)$ which is not constructible with a straightedge and compass. Then they proceed to show that $\cos(\pi/9)$ is not constructible. The problem is that I feel like this also shows that bisecting the angle is impossible because we could consider bisecting a $40^\circ$ angle (to construct 2 angles of $20^\circ$ ) and show, in a similar way, that $\cos(\pi/9)$ is not constructible. But, this is not true since we know that we can bisect any angle. Where is the flaw in my reasoning ?","['proof-explanation', 'geometry']"

And $B_t=xU_t+\sqrt{1-x^2}U_t$ . Then $$\begin{align}\operatorname{cov}(B_t,B_s)&=\operatorname{cov}\left(xU_t+\sqrt{1-x^2}U_t,xU_s+\sqrt{1-x^2}U_s\right)\\&=x^2(t\wedge s)+2x\sqrt{1-x^2}(t\wedge s)+(1-x^2)(t\wedge s)\\&=(t\wedge s)+2x\sqrt{1-x^2} (t\wedge s)\\&=(t\wedge s)\left(1+2x\sqrt{1-x^2}\right)\end{align}$$ We know that $B$ is a Brownian motion iff $\left(1+2x\sqrt{1-x^2}\right)=1$ or equivalently $2x\sqrt{1-x^2}=0$ which implies $x=0$ or $x=\pm 1$ .

What I'm now trying is noting that $ \text{lim sup}_{n\to\infty} \frac{X_n}{n} \leq 1$ is logically equivalent to: $P(\text{lim sup}_{n\to\infty} \frac{X_n}{n} > 1) = 0$ $P(\text{lim sup}_{n\to\infty} A_n) = 0$ . In other words, the event $A_n$ does not happen infinitely often.

Let $f(m, km)$ be the number of rectangles (including squares) on a $m$ by $km$ checkerboard. Determine all ordered pairs $(m, k)$ for which $f(m, km)$ is a perfect square. Progress Because a $x \times y$ checkerboard has $\binom{x+1}{2} \times \binom{y+1}{2}$ rectangles, $f(m, km)=\binom{m+1}{2} \times \binom{km+1}{2}=\frac{km^2(m+1)(km+1)}{4}$ . Since $f(m, km)$ is a perfect square, $(km+k)(km+1)$ needs to be a perfect square, which means that $(km+k)(km+1)=x^2$ for which $x\in \mathcal{N}_*$ . It's easy to find that $(m, 1)$ is a ""family"" of solution for this question. I checked the sequence https://oeis.org/A082649 with somebody and found out that it had a relationship with this question. For example, the first smallest $k$ equals to 1, the second smallest $k$ equals to $4m+4$ , the third smallest $k$ equals to $16m^2+24m+9$ , and the fourth smallest $k$ equals to $64m^3+128m^2+80m+16$ . I am not sure how this sequence is related to this question, but I believe that it may not be a coincidence. Conjecture From the sequence, one of my classmates formed a conjecture that may be proved. Conjecture: For any positive integer $m$ , let $$k=\frac{\sinh^2(n \sinh^{-1} (\sqrt{m}))}{m}$$ where $n$ is an arbitrary positive integer. Then $$\frac{km^2(m+1)(km+1)}{4}$$ $$= \frac{\sinh^2 (n \sinh^{-1} (\sqrt{m})) \cdot m \cdot (m+1) \cdot (\sinh^2  (n \sinh^{-1} (\sqrt{m})) +1)}{4}$$ evaluates to a positive integer. I have tried to further simplify $f(m, km)$ given in the conjecture, and I finally get the following result: $$f(m, km)=\frac{m^2a^4+ma^4+m^2a^2+ma^2}{4}$$ for which $a=\sinh (n \sinh^{-1} (\sqrt{m}))$ . Triangular Numbers By looking at the formula for $f(m, m)$ , it equals to the product of two triangular numbers.

First, after a first attempt I decided to consider a martingale because at some point, for convergence issue (you will tell me if I am wrong) I will need to have an increasing sequence of functions to apply monotone convergence. This leads to the use of absolute value and unfortunately this does not preserve a sub martingale. Now let $T\in(0,\infty)$ .

4785186,Why inner regularity of measure is defined as to be approximable from within by compact sets and not by closed sets?,"This question has been asked here , but I don't believe that we have had a satisfactory answer, so I would like to reformulate that question. Please forgive me if this question turns out to be rather silly. Let $(X,\mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measurable space such that $\Sigma$ contains the borel algebra. Usually, $\mu$ is called outer regular if $$
\mu(A)=\inf\{\mu(G):G\supset A,G\text{ open}\},\quad\forall A\text{ measurable}.
$$ Personally, I would be very tempted to defind a measure to be inner regular if $$
\mu(A)=\sup\{\mu(F):F\subset A,F\text{ closed}\},\quad\forall A\text{ measurable}.\tag{1}
$$ But it turns out that the definition in reality is $$
\mu(A)=\sup\{\mu(F):F\subset A,F\text{ compact}\},\quad\forall A\text{ measurable}.\tag{2}
$$ And I'm wondering why. Since that a measure satisfying $(2)$ is called inner regular, let's call a measure satisfying $(1)$ one that is approximable by closed sets . The two notions can be very different. For a $KC$ space (where every compact set is closed), every inner regular measure is approximable by closed sets, but not vice versa: consider the lower limit topology and the Lebesgue measure $\mu$ over $\mathbb{R}$ . Since this topology contains more closed sets than the usual one, $\mu$ is clearly approximable by closed sets, but $\mu$ is not inner regular since every compact set in the lower limit topology is countable. If we remove the $KC$ assumption, then an inner regular measure is not necessarily approximable by closed sets: consider the trivial topology where every set is compact. If $\mu$ is approximable by closed sets, then every measurable proper subset of $X$ has measure $0$ , so either $\Sigma=\{\emptyset,X\}$ , either $\mu(X)=0$ . So I would like to ask: why do we choose to break the symmetry here in the definition of outer and inner regularity? In other words, why is using closed sets less desirable, while using open sets is acceptable? Or are we generally working in the setting where the two definitions become equivalent?","['measure-theory', 'borel-measures', 'real-analysis']"

\epsilon > |x_n - a| \geq \bigl| |x_n| - |a| \bigr|

4786388,"If $f > 0$, $\ker(L)$ contains only constant functions, where $L = - \Delta + \nabla (- \log(f)) \cdot \nabla$ (Villani, Subsec. 7.6)","In subsection(s) 7.5 (and 4.1) of Topics in Optimal Transportation , Cedric Villani states the following (I paraphrase): Take a probability measure $\mu \in \mathcal P_2(\mathbb R^n)$ with finite second moment and strictly positive density $f$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb R^n$ . Consider the linear differential operator $$
L := - \Delta + \nabla (- \log(f))\cdot \nabla.
$$ Then $L$ satisfies the following integration-by-parts formula with respect to $\mu$ : $$
\int_{\mathbb R^d} (L h_1)(x) h_2(x) \, \text{d}\mu(x)
= \int_{\mathbb R^d} (L h_2)(x) h_1(x) \, \text{d}\mu(x) 
= \int_{\mathbb R^d} \nabla h_1(x) \cdot \nabla h_2(x) \, \text{d}\mu(x) 
$$ for all $h_1, h_2 \colon \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R$ with certain regularity assumptions.
In particular, $L$ is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on the set of those $h$ with respect to the $L^2(\mathbb R^d, d \mu)$ scalar product. Inspired by $\| h \|_{L^2(\mathbb R^d)}^2 = \int_{\mathbb R^d} | h(x) |^2 \, \text{d}x$ and $\| h \|_{\dot{H}^1(\mathbb R^d)}^2 = \int_{\mathbb R^d} \| \nabla h(x) \|_2^2 \, \text{d}x$ we define weighted square ""norms"" $$
\| h \|_{L^2(\mathbb R^d, d \mu)}^2 = \int_{\mathbb R^d} | h(x) |^2 \, \text{d}\mu(x)
\quad \text{and} \quad
\| h \|_{\dot{H}^1(\mathbb R^d, d\mu)}^2 = \int_{\mathbb R^d} h(x)(L h)(x) \|_2^2 \, \text{d}\mu(x).
$$ Since $f > 0$ everywhere, $\ker(L)$ only contains constant functions. Under certain regularity conditions which we prefer not to discuss here, one can define the inverse $L^{-1}$ of $L$ on space of functions $h$ with $\int_{\mathbb R^d} h(x) \, \text{d}\mu(x) = 0$ and then establish \begin{align}
\| h \|_{H^{-1}(\mathbb R^d, d \mu)}
& := \sup\left\{ \int_{\mathbb R^d} h(x) k(x) \, \text{d}\mu(x): k \in \mathcal{C}_c^{\infty}(\mathbb R^n), \| k \|_{\dot{H}^1(\mathbb R^d; d\mu)} = 1 \right\} \\
& = \int_{\mathbb R^d} h(x) (L^{-1} h)(x) \, \text{d}\mu(x),
\end{align} so $H^{-1}(\mathbb R^d, d \mu)$ is dual to $\dot{H}^1(\mathbb R^d, d \mu)$ . My work so far. I don't know how to show that $\ker(L)$ only contains constant functions, partly because I don't know on which space $L$ is defined.
If we could take $f = 1$ (we can't since then $\mu$ would not be a probability measure), then $L = - \Delta$ and surely $\ker(L)$ also contains linear functions.
If $f(x) = e^{-x^2} \in L^2(\mathbb R)$ up to a normalization constant, then $-\log(f) = x^2$ and thus $L h = - h''(x) + 2 x h'(x)$ and $L h = 0$ implies $h(x) = c_1 \text{erfi}(x) + c_2$ , where erfi is the imaginary error function, according to WolframAlpha, which is not constant.

I am wondering I what way "" $\ker(L)$ contains only constant functions"" is meant and how to show it.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'elliptic-operators', 'optimal-transport', 'probability-distributions', 'linear-transformations']"
4786393,Why is Euclidean geometry neglected in modern study of mathematics? [closed],"Closed . This question is opinion-based . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post . Closed 8 months ago . Improve this question I have always been fascinated by Euclidean geometry and it was my favourite subject at school. However, I have noticed that Euclidean geometry is not very popular among pure math students (except IMO students). It seems that most people prefer not to learn more about it and it has become something like a “dead field”. It is weird that geometry is probably the oldest field of math, but I struggle to find books for geometry and I can easily find thousands of good books on calculus, analysis, topology, etc. in minutes. I have tried to find some good books on Euclidean geometry that go beyond the basic school curriculum and cover more advanced topics, such as the nine-point circle, Morley’s theorem, Ceva’s theorem, Menelaus’ theorem, Ptolemy’s theorem, etc. However (I posted questions like this here (asking for book recommendations for geometry that don't use any math other than geometry like linear algebra , group theory ,.. etc)   and here (this was my first question on this site before I even knew about dup questions ) ), I have not been very successful in finding such books. Most of the books I have found are either too elementary or too old and I struggled to find any modern book about geometry that goes beyond high school. It seems that nobody wants to write a book about it anymore and that makes me think it is a dead field. This makes me wonder why Euclidean geometry is so neglected in modern mathematics. Is it because it is not practical or useful for modern applications and technology anymore? Is it because it is an old field? Is it because it is not relevant or interesting anymore? Personally, I do not think any of these reasons are valid. I think the reason for someone to study pure mathematics is curiosity and interest not how practical and applicable math is  and I think that geometry is still interesting and worth studying but I still don't understand why nobody cares about it anymore.","['euclidean-geometry', 'book-recommendation', 'geometry', 'reference-request', 'soft-question']"

Call this set $M_n$ for the dimension $n$ . I know it's an algebra, but it obviously has a much stricter structure. For example, if $f:\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function and $g_1,\dots,g_m\in M_n$ then $f(g_1,\dots,g_m)\in M_n$ too. Now my question is, can I bound the value of $m$ ?

My idea: I am imagining that if I tile $\mathbb{R}^3$ with cubes (make a grid) and then ""randomly"" choose some subset of cubes and stuff these cubes with bump functions, while leaving other cubes map to zero, then I can prove that this function is not in $P$ .

Suppose further that h is an embedding of ℂ into ℂ 2 . Then the image h(ℂ) is a smooth (C ∞ ) real surface at each of its points h(z), deriving its metric in the standard way as a submanifold of ℂ 2 = ℝ 4 .  As such it has a well-defined gaussian curvature K(z) at each point h(z) ∈ ℂ 2 . After finding a formula for K(z) in no book or paper that I was able to access, I calculated such a formula as K(z) =  -2 |h''(z) ^ h'(z)| 2 / |h'(z)| 6 , where h''(z) ^ h'(z) is shorthand for f''(z) g'(z) - g''(z) f'(z).

My Question I do not have problem proving the statement for functions of one variable (see My Attempt below). But I am not sure how to apply the above theorem for the case of functions of $n$ variables. Could someone please help me with this? Basically, how to formally and rigorously extend the proof of the statement from functions of one variable to $n$ variables? Thanks a lot in advance! My Attempt Here is what I have so far: Proof $\quad$ We first prove that a function of one variable $f$ is concave if and only if the set on or below its graph in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a convex set. Suppose that $f$ is concave, and that $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ lie in the set on or below its graph $G$ ; that is, $f(x_1) \geq y_1$ and $f(x_2) \geq y_2$ . Any point on the line segment $L$ joining these two points can be represented by $(tx_2 + (1-t)x_1, ty_2 + (1-t)y_1)$ , where $t \in [0,1]$ . Since $f$ is concave, we have \begin{align*}
f(tx_2 + (1-t)x_1) \geq tf(x_2) + (1-t)f(x_1) \geq ty_2 + (1-t)y_1.
\end{align*} Thus, the segment $L$ lies in the set on or below $G$ . Hence, the set on or below $G$ is convex. Conversely, suppose the set on or below $G$ is convex, and that $(x_1,f(x_1))$ and $(x_2,f(x_2))$ are in this set. Then, for all $t \in [0,1]$ , the point $(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2, tf(x_1) + (1-t)f(x_2))$ is also in this set. Thus, \begin{align*}
tf(x_1) + (1-t)f(x_2) \leq f(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2).
\end{align*} So, $f$ is concave. Now, let $f$ be a function defined on a convex subset $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbf{n}}$ . $\dots$ (This is where I got stuck.)","['convex-analysis', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

So we can make $n^2$ quite irrelevant in this case, so $$\lim_{x\to \infty} n^{2} ( \sqrt[n]{x} - \sqrt[n+1]{x} )= n^{2} \lim_{x\to \infty} ( \sqrt[n]{x} - \sqrt[n+1]{x} )$$ Here, I tried to solve for $\lim_{x\to \infty} ( \sqrt[n]{x} - \sqrt[n+1]{x} )$ . The only method I could think of is using the identity $$x^n - y^n = (x-y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} y + ... + x y^{n-2} + y^{n-1})$$ Then we have $$

\lim_{x\to \infty} ( \sqrt[n]{x} - \sqrt[n+1]{x} ) &= \lim_{x\to \infty} ( \sqrt[n]{x}-1+1 - \sqrt[n+1]{x} ) \\

\end{split}
$$ This reduces to $$\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{x-1}{[(\sqrt[n]{x})^{n-1} + \cdots + 1 ]} - \lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{x-1}{[(\sqrt[n+1]{x})^{n} + \cdots + 1 ]}$$ Now, I have some confusions with this one. So my current situation is that I believe that the denominator will always go to bigger and bigger, to $\infty$ , as far as $n > 0$ , and perhaps most of the time, my assumption is that $$[(\sqrt[n+1]{x})^{n} + \cdots + 1 ] \geq x - 1$$ so the fraction in total will go to $0$ as far as the assumption is given as such. But when I approach this problem in another way, which is by rewrite the whole limit as $$n^2(\lim_{x\to\infty} x^\frac1n - x^\frac{1}{n+1})$$ Using that $$ x^{\frac1n}=e^{\frac{\ln{x}}{n}}$$ The limit becomes $$n^2 \lim_{x\to\infty} (e^{\frac{\ln{x}}{n}} - e^{\frac{\ln{x}}{n+1}})$$ of which as long as $n$ does not reach $\infty$ , the limit goes to infinity, which is contradictory to what the way we have done above results in, given the assumption. I am pretty sure that there are faults, but I do not know how to clearly approach and fix those issues. I also tried to disprove the assumption, but I do not know how. How would I proceed then to solve this limit? Where I am wrong at?","['limits', 'calculus', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

4786955,Prove: $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} C_i\binom{2(n-i)-1}{n-i} = \binom{2n}{n+1}$,"I am working on the following problem: Given that all of the legal paths (ones which do not cross over the line $y = x$ ) from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ must begin with a move to the right and end with a move upwards. And anytime the number of upward moves exceeds the number of rightward moves, the path becomes illegal. The solution seems to be the total number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ minus the total number of illegal paths. Interestingly, I found that the number of illegal paths can be expressed by the formula: $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} C_i\binom{2(n-i)-1}{n-i}$ Here, $C_i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ Catalan number. For instance, $C_0 = 1, C_1 = 1, C_2 = 2, C_3 = 5 ...$ . Also, the number of illegal paths is the second term in the  Catalan numbers: $\binom{2n}{n} - \binom{2n}{n+1}$ , resulting in $\binom{2n}{n+1}$ . I am seeking a proof for: $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} C_i\binom{2(n-i)-1}{n-i} = \binom{2n}{n+1}$ Any insights or methods to prove this would be greatly appreciated.","['summation', 'catalan-numbers', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
4786972,Norm on $H^1/2(\partial\Omega)$ by first isomorphism theorem.,"I want to show that $\operatorname{ran}(T)$ equipped with \begin{equation*}
\lVert v\rVert:=\inf\{u\in H^1(\Omega):Tu=v\}
\end{equation*} is a Hilbert-Space.
I have seen that the definition of the norm is motivated by the norm on quotient spaces.
It was suggested to show that $\hat{T}:x+\ker(T)\mapsto T(x)$ is an isomorphism form $H^1(\Omega)/\ker(T)$ to $H^{1/2}(\partial\Omega)$ , by applying the first Isomorphism Theorem.
How do I apply the Theorem without knowing that $\operatorname{ran}(T)$ is closed. I know that $\hat{T}$ is linear, bijective and continuous, how do I continue?","['hilbert-spaces', 'fractional-sobolev-spaces', 'sobolev-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'quotient-spaces']"
4786973,Bernoulli Bootstrapping and the Beta Distribution,"My understanding of the bootstrap is that it gives us a method to understand the distribution of an estimator applied to a dataset. I've read statements of the form ""bootstrapping relies on the closeness of the empirical CDF for a sample of size $n$ to the true CDF"". But I wanted to understand the implication of using the bootstrap in a simple case. Suppose I have a dataset of $N$ Bernoulli trials, with $n$ successes. I want to have an understanding of my uncertainty in $p$ , the probability of success. My understanding is that the bayesian approach to this would give us a pdf for $p$ of $$
P(p|N, n) = \frac{p^{n+ \alpha -1} (1-p)^{N-n+\beta-1}}{B(n+ \alpha, N-n+\beta)}
$$ Where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ define the prior. Naively, I guessed that maybe using the bootstrap on this type of data might give the same answer as a Haldane prior, of $\alpha=0, \ \beta=0$ , since if $n=N$ , both this and the bootstrap would require that $p=1$ . But when I wrote down what the bootstrap would predict for probabilities of $k$ successes, I get $$
P(p=k/N) = {N \choose k} (n/N)^{k} (1 - n/N)^{N-k}
$$ This seems to take a totally different form than the Bayesian answer. How should I understand both of these approaches?
Am I totally misunderstanding the interpretation of bootstrapping in this case?
Is there some Bayesian prior secretly implied by the use of the bootstrap in this example?","['statistics', 'bayesian', 'bernoulli-distribution', 'bootstrap-sampling', 'probability']"
4787094,Union of two disjoint congruent polygons is centrally symmetric. Must the polygons differ by a 180 degree rotation?,"Let $P$ be a polygon with $180^\circ$ rotational symmetry.  Let $O$ be the center of $P$ and suppose $P$ is dissected into congruent polygons $A$ and $B$ .  Must the $180^\circ$ rotation around $O$ send $A$ to $B$ ? This conundrum appears to have stumped everyone I know, and we don't know if the answer is ""yes"" or ""no"". If the problem is too difficult, the case in which $P,A$ , and $B$ are polyominos (polygons formed by joining unit squares along their sides) is also of interest.","['geometry', 'dissection', 'combinatorial-geometry', 'polyomino', 'tiling']"
