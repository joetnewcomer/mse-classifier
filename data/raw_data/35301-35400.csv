337409,Equivalence relation on a topological space,"Define a relation on a topological space $X$ by $x \sim y$ iff there is a connected subspace $A \subseteq X$ that contains both $x$ and $y$. Prove this is an equivalence relation on $X$. I figured out reflexivity and transitivity. The one I am trying to do is symmetry. How does this sound? Let $x, y \in X$. We want to show that if $x \sim y$, then $y \sim x$. Since $x \sim y$, there is a connected subspace $A$ containing $x$ and $y$. Then their is a connected subspace $y \sim x$ in $A$ containing $y$ and $x$. Thus, $x \sim y$ and $y \sim x$.",['general-topology']
337410,An eigenvector is a non-zero vector such that...,"Various sources define eigenvalues and eigenvectors in slightly different ways (context independent).  For example, both of the following definitions seem not to exclude the zero-vector as an eigenvector.  In Lang : Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $K$, and let $A:V\to V$ be an operator on $V$.  An  element $\mathbf{v}\in V$ is called an eigenvector of $A$ if there exists $\lambda\in K$ such that $A\mathbf{v}=\lambda\mathbf{v}$.  If $\mathbf{v}\ne \mathbf{0}$, then... and, in Hoffman/Kunze Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$ and let $T$ be a linear operator on $V$.  A characteristic value of $T$ is a scalar $c$ in $F$ such that there is a non-zero vector $\alpha$ in $V$ with $T\alpha =c\alpha$.  If $c$ is a characteristic value of $T$, then (a) any $\alpha$ such that $T\alpha = c\alpha$ is called a characteristic vector of $T$ associated with the characteristic value $c$, and (b) the collection of all $\alpha$ such that $T\alpha = c\alpha$ is called the characteristic space associated with $c$. More typically (?), you would see explicit exclusion of the zero-vector as, An eigenvector is a non-zero vector $x$ such that $A\mathbf{x}=\lambda\mathbf{x}$ for some scalar $\lambda$.  The scalar $\lambda$ is called an eigenvalue and $x$ an associated eigenvector.  The eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda$ is the set of all associated eigenvectors along with the zero-vector. I realize that the zero-vector must be explicitly excluded when defining an eigenvalue, but once that definition is made, explicitly excluding the zero-vector as being an eigenvector and then explicitly including it again to form the eigenspace seems rather artificial.  Is this simply a matter of attempting to make the definitions more natural depending on their order? That is, eigenvalue (excluding the zero-vector), then eigenvector -> zero vector ok eigenvector, then eigenvalue -> zero vector not ok or, is there anything incorrect about the definition given, for example, in Hoffman/Kunze above?  If so, what sort of inconsistency would result from the definition.  I'm not an algebraist, so something rather elementary (if possible) would be preferred.","['linear-algebra', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"

337437,A question concerning compactness - Topology,"Prove that if $X$ is a compact space and $H = \{h_{\alpha} : \alpha \in A\}$ is any collection of closed subsets with the property that $\cap_{\alpha}h_{\alpha} = \emptyset$, then there is a finite collection $\{h_{i}\}$ of sets from $H$ with the property that $\cap_{i}h_{i} = \emptyset$. My attempt : By De Morgans Laws, it follows that  $\cup(X \setminus h_{\alpha}) = X$. Since each $h_{\alpha}$ is closed then the collection $\{X \setminus h_{\alpha}: \alpha 
\in A\}$ is an open cover of $X$. By assumption, $X$ is compact, so this cover admits a finite subcover. Therefore, $\exists$ some $K$ such that $X = (X \setminus h_{\alpha_{1}}) \cup ... \cup (X \setminus h_{\alpha_{k}})$. So we have a finite collection $\{h_{\alpha_{1}}...h_{\alpha_{k}}\}$. If their is a better way to write this proof, or its wrong let me know. I think its the right idea though.","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

337446,Are these open sets?,"This is the question: Which of these sets are open sets on the lower limit topology on $\mathbb{R}$, whose basis elements are $[a,b),a<b$?
$$[4,5)\qquad\left\lbrace3\right\rbrace\qquad [1,2]\qquad(7,8)$$ The first one clearly is open, as it belongs to the basis.
The secon one can't be, as all basis elements have more than one element, and so no union of basis elements can have only one element.
The fourth can be built by: $$(7,8)=\bigcup_{7<a<8}[a,8)$$ The third one, I can't prove it's not (it's clearly not open). I'm trying something like this: If it was open, it would be the result of union of sets like $[1,a)$. I can't prove though, that the union of those sets can't have a closed limit. EDIT: Could it be: The union of those sets is defined by setting a set of values for $a$. $a\in\mathbb{R}$, so there must be a maximum $a$: $a_{max}$, and so the final result of the union would be $[1,a_{max})$. That works if the set of values for $a$ is finite. If it's not, then if it's bounded the same thing works, if its unbounded the set would be $[1,\infty)$","['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory']"
337450,"compact and locally Hausdorff, but not locally compact","I wonder if there is a compact and locally Hausdorff space $X$ which is not locally compact, in the sense that every point has a neighborhood base consisting of compact sets. A space is called locally Hausdorff if every point has a neighborhood which is a Hausdorff space under the subspace topology. Such a space need not be Hausdorff. However, if each point has a closed Hausdorff neighborhood, then the space is Hausdorff. An example is the real line with two origins . If one restricts this space between $-1$ and $1$, it becomes compact. Unfortunately, it is also locally compact. If $X$ is Hausdorff and compact, then it is also locally compact, so the Hausdorff neighborhoods must all be proper subsets of $X$. Does anyone have an idea?","['general-topology', 'compactness']"
337452,Interpolation of surface normals on the face of a triangle and Goroud shading,"I am learning lightning for 3D graphics. What I'm about to ask about is described on this tutorial page here . The color of a certain pixel with lightning is given by $$D*I*(\hat{L}\cdot \hat{N}))$$
Where $D$ is the color of the surface, $I$ is the color of the light source (also called intensity). $L$ is the vector pointing towards the light source, and $N$ is the surface normal. Note that D and I are not vectors, even though colors are actually 4D vectors in computer science. I assume this is because you're suppose to assume that you do this operation component wise for each of the components of the 4D vector (except the last component probably, which is the alpha value. If you can, let me know if my assumption on this is correct). For directional lightning (the direction to the light never changes, like the sun), a technique used is called gouraud shading. The vertices of a face (triangle) have predefined normals and the lightning color is calculated at each of the vertices, and then interpolated along the entire face of the triangle. This means that a color of a point along the interpolation can be given as $$(D*I*(\hat{L}\cdot \hat{N_{a}}))\alpha +(D*I*(\hat{L}\cdot \hat{N_{b}}))(1-\alpha)$$ Alpha is the interpolation value. $N_{a}$ and $N_{b}$ are two different normals at different vertices. The only reason this technique appears realistic is because the direction to the light does not change. Really, this way of calculating it is a shortcut, the proper way to do it is by just interpolating the normals instead of the color result. Like this. $$D*I*(\hat{L}\cdot (\hat{N_{a}}\alpha+\hat{N_{b}}(1-\alpha)))$$ However, this is a more expensive interpolation. At the page I linked in the second sentence of this post, there is a proof that the above equation is equal to the below equation. $$(D*I*(\hat{L}\cdot \hat{N_{a}}))\alpha +(D*I*(\hat{L}\cdot \hat{N_{b}}))(1-\alpha)$$ That is why goroud shading supposedly works. However, I have thought of a case where I think goroud shading does not work, meaning interpolating the resulting colors at the vertices of the face will not achieve the correct effect as interpolating the normals would. Consider this image. Pretend it is a triangular face. Pretend the direction to the light is given by the straight ""up"" vector at the center of that face as seen in the picture. Therefore, the face should be brightest at the center of the face. However, if you use goroud shading, notice it would not achieve this effect because the vertices of the face are supposed to be slightly darker than the middle. This is because the normals at the vertices are slightly pointed away from the direction towards the light. So interpolating dark to dark will obviously not achieve a brighter color in the middle. If I am correct in this, does this mean the proof that showed the interpolation of the normals is equivalent to the interpolation of the results is wrong, or is there something else going on that I am missing?","['vector-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

337459,"Isolated Versus Non-Isolated Fixed Point, 2D Dynamics","I am trying to understand the classification of fixed points in a dynamical systems context (fixed points of a system of two linear differential equations are places where both $x_1' = x_2' = 0$). Representing 2D systems as a matrix equation $\vec x'=\matrix A\vec x$, Strogatz classifies fixed points based on $\tau$, the trace of the matrix and $\Delta$, the determinant of the matrix: unstable node:                                                 $\tau>\sqrt{4\Delta}$,      $\Delta>0$ unstable spiral (spiral source):    $\sqrt{4\Delta}>\tau>0$,              $\Delta>0$ neutrally stable centers:                                $\tau=0$,              $\Delta>0$ stable spiral (spiral sink):          $-\sqrt{4\Delta}<\tau<0$,             $\Delta>0$ stable node:                                                      $\tau<-\sqrt{4\Delta}$,  $\Delta>0$ saddle point:                                                                              $\Delta<0$ However, he is very vague about the boundary cases.  Specifically, what happens on the parabola $\tau^2-4\Delta=0$ and the line $\Delta=0$? Strogatz mentions that these include star nodes (decoupled systems), degenerate nodes (one unique eigendirection), and nonisolating fixed points.  However, in a later problem, he mentions ""isolating fixed points"".  What is the difference?

337546,How often must an irreducible polynomial take a prime value?,"Suppose $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial over $\mathbb Z$ of degree $n$. Is it always the case that there exist distinct $x_1,\ldots,x_{2n+1}\in \mathbb Z$ such that $f(x_1),\ldots,f(x_{2n+1})$ are all prime? So far I've tested a few irreducible polynomials using mathematica, and this has held. The motivation is to use this as a test for irreducibility, as if $f(x)$ is not irreducible then it takes on at most $2n$ prime values, as either factor takes on $1$ or $-1$ at most $2n$ times. (I'd also be interested in learning if this bound can be improved). This could potentially be expended to other rings of integers, i.e. $\mathbb Z[i]$, but in that case the minimal number of primes needed to certify that $f(x)$ is irreducible would increase as more units appear.","['prime-numbers', 'polynomials', 'number-theory']"

I tried to come up with a counter example and failed, so in a fit of arrogance I've decided that this must be true, but I don't know how to prove it.  To make it a little easier I tried assuming that the $x_i$ are relatively prime so that $h = x_1\cdots x_n$.  Then I tried using inequalities to show that for some $i$ we have $a_ix_i > d$, cause then we could choose $b_i = d/x_i$ and all other $b = 0$.

337591,An ordering different from the Gray order (digits change by 1 at each step),"Given $A=\lbrace x_n,\ldots x_1\rbrace$. How would I construct an ordering on the subsets of $A$ such that the immediate successor of a subset is obtained by either adding or deleting one element, and the order is not a reflected Gray code, no matter how you re-index the elements of $A$?

Does this idea of adding elements until I reach $A$, removing elements until I get back to singleton, increasing as much as I can after that, then decreasing work for larger $n$? EDIT The reflected Gray code is defied inductively by (1) the reflected Gray code of order $1$ is $0;1$. (2) Suppose $n>1$ and the reflected Gray code of order $n-1$ has been constructed. To construct the reflected Gray code of order $n$, we first list the $(n-1)$-tuples of 0s and 1s in the order given by the reflected Gray code or order $n-1$, and attach a $0$ at the beginning (i.e. on the left) of each $(n-1)$-tuple. We then list the $(n-1)-$tuples in the order which is the reverse given by the reflected Gray code of order $n-1$, and attach a $1$ at the beginning.","['coding-theory', 'combinatorics']"

However, $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}$ is not equal to $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}y}$, and not equal to $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z}$, so it appears that the function for differentiation would be: derivative :: (real -> real) -> variable with respect to which you are differentiating -> (real -> real) so, why can't I do:

If $h_2 = x\mapsto \left(y\mapsto \dfrac{1}{x}\cdot y\right)$ , then $h_2 = h_1$ and $D_{h_2}=\mathbf{R}$ . My question. Consider now $f = x\mapsto \dfrac{1}{x}$ and $g_2 = x\mapsto(y\mapsto xy)$ .
Then obviously $D_{g_2\circ f} =\mathbf{R}\setminus\{0\}$ . What is the simplest way to write $g_2\circ f$ in $\lambda$ -notation (preferably with "" $\mapsto$ "")? A problem: my naïve attempt to write $g_2\circ f$ gave me, after $\beta$ -reduction, the same term as for $h_2$ .  However, $h_2$ is defined at $0$ , but $g_2\circ f$ is not. Update. I have realized that a part of this phenomenon does not involve lambda-calculus.  The problem is that there is an infinity of ways to ""curry"" a set-theoretic function of two arguments. For example, the function $f(x, y) = \dfrac{y}{x}$ of real arguments can be curried as $$
\hat{f}(x) = y\mapsto\frac{y}{x}\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R},\quad
x\in\mathbf{R}^* =\mathbf{R}\setminus\{0\},
$$ or as $$
\hat{f}(x) = \begin{cases}
y\mapsto\dfrac{y}{x}\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R} &\text{if}\ x \ne 0\\
\emptyset\ \text{(the empty function)} &\text{if}\ x = 0
\end{cases},\quad
x\in\mathbf{R}.
$$ Update. I have stumbled upon virtually my examples in Declarative continuations: an investigation of duality in programming language semantics by Andrzej Filinski (1989): [...] the uncurried forms of the following two ML functions fn x=>let t=1/x in (fn y=>t)
fn x=>fn y=>1/x both compute the inverse of the first argument, but behave differently (the first may fail) in curried form.","['notation', 'lambda-calculus', 'functions']"

For $sin(\pi)$ with $z^2$ = $1$ the first factor in the product is 0. And for any integer multiple of $\pi$, $n$, the $n$th term in the product will be zero, and the correct result is achieved. But how does knowledge of the zeroes of the function determine the unique sinusoidal curve between those zeroes? Is it due in this case to $\pi$ giving the sinusoidal shape and in general, what is the determination of the shape of the curve between the zeroes that allows the WF to reproduce it?

Then, we can define $\phi(z) = \int_0^{z} \frac{dt}{f(t)}$, where the path is taken in $\bar{H}$. This function maps $\bar{H}$ to a half-infinite rectangular strip $[-\pi/2,\pi/2] \times [0,\infty)$. I don't completely understand why this is the case. Wouldn't $\psi(z) = \int_0^{z} f(t) dt$ map $\bar{H}$ onto $[-\pi/4,\pi/4] \times (-\infty,0]$? The argument for this is the same for that of $\phi$:  The function $\psi$ maps $[-1,1]$ to $[-\pi/4,\pi/4]$. Every time $z$ passes a branch point along the real axis, the argument changes by $\pm\pi$, so this results in a $\pm\frac{\pi}{2}$ turn. So it appears $\psi$ essentially does what $\phi$ does. Then is there any reason to look at $\phi$ rather than $\psi$? (More generally, why does the Scwarz Christoffel mapping need all those things appear in the denominator rather than in the numerator?) p.s.

  \curl\grad = 0,\\
  \div\curl = 0 $$ where $\Delta$ denotes the (vector) Laplacian $\nabla^2$. Since none of these equations requires the cross-product, which is only defined in three dimensions, can they be used to generalize the curl operator to an arbitrary $d$-dimensional space? I know taking the root of an operator is not exactly a funny thing, but Dirac has managed that before , even if it led to requiring anticommuting Grassman numbers and spinors... So my questions are: In which dimensions $d$ is $\curl :=+\sqrt{\grad\div-\Delta}$ uniquely defined (by the additional constraints mentioned above, or maybe including other properties of the 3D $\curl$)? In which of these dimensions does this work for simple complex numbers without requiring the introduction of spinors? How to actually calculate it? Bonus question: Use this generalization to generalize the cross product Note to answerers: I declared the operators \curl , \grad and \div for convenience, they should work everywhere below the question. As an explicit example, observe $n=2$: Claiming that $\curl = \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}$, use $\curl\grad=0$ and $\div\curl=0$ to obtain $$\curl = \alpha\begin{pmatrix}\partial_y^2 & -\partial_x\partial_y \\ -\partial_x\partial_y & \partial_x^2\end{pmatrix}$$ the square of which is $$\curl^2=\alpha^2\begin{pmatrix}\partial_y^2\Delta & -\partial_x\partial_y\Delta\\ -\partial_x\partial_y\Delta & \partial_x^2\Delta\end{pmatrix}
\stackrel!= \begin{pmatrix}-\partial_y^2 & \partial_x\partial_y\\\partial_x\partial_y & -\partial_x^2\end{pmatrix} = \grad\div-\Delta$$ So $\alpha^2 \stackrel!= -\Delta^{-1}$ and formally $$\curl = \begin{pmatrix}\partial_y^2 & -\partial_x\partial_y\\ -\partial_x\partial_y & \partial_x^2\end{pmatrix}\otimes(\sqrt{-\Delta})^{-1}$$ $\sqrt\Delta$ requires Spinors, as feared, and I assume they will arise for all even dimensions.

338157,Birational Maps of Nonsingular Projective Curves,"I'm trying to solve exercise I.6.7 in Hartshorne, stated (in part) here: Let $P_1,\ldots,P_r, Q_1,\ldots,Q_s$ be distinct points of $\mathbb{A}^1$.  If $\mathbb{A}^1-\{P_1,\ldots,P_r\}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^1-\{Q_1,\ldots,Q_s\}$, show that $r=s$. Here is my thinking so far.  Let $U=\mathbb{A}^1-\{P_1,\ldots,P_r\}$ and $V=\mathbb{A}^1-\{Q_1,\ldots,Q_s\}$, and view $U$ and $V$ as open subsets of $\mathbb{P}^1$.  Let $\varphi:U\rightarrow V$ be an isomorphism, and $i:V\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$ be inclusion.  Then the morphism $i\circ\varphi:U\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$ can be uniquely extended (Hartshorne I.6.8) to a map $\overline{\varphi}:\mathbb{P}^1\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$.  Must $\overline{\varphi}$ be an isomorphism?  If so, the result follows because then $\overline{\varphi}$ must map the set $\{P_1,\ldots,P_r,\infty\}$ bijectively to the set $\{Q_1,\ldots,Q_s,\infty\}$. I understand that any birational map between two nonsingular projective curves must 'induce' an isomorphism, as up to isomorphism, there is only one nonsingular projective curve in every birational equivalence class of curves.  Where I lack understanding is exactly how a birational map induces an isomorphism.  In my question, $\langle U,i\circ\varphi\rangle$ is a birational map from $\mathbb{P}^1\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^1$, but how do I know that extending it as I've done gives an isomorphism $\overline{\varphi}:\mathbb{P}^1\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^1$?","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

338171,An odd proof of the uncountability of the reals,"So, in proving that the reals are uncountable you assume otherwise and attempt to make a list of them. Working in binary this list is of form $a_1,a_2,\ldots$ where $a_i = x_{i,1}x_{i,2},\ldots$ represents the binary expansion. Given any index $j$ some real number (actually, an infinite number of them) has its $j$th digit $1$. If $x_{j,j} \neq 1$ we can swap $a_j$ with $a_k$ such that $k > j$ and $x_{k,k} = 1$; by the remark above such an $a_k$ exists. Because $k > j$ we do not undo any previous work. Thus we can assume that $x_{j,j} = 1$ for all $j$. Then $0$ is not in our enumeration. This is of course the diagonal argument but it is a little unsettling to me that specifying any decimal expansion in advance, we could have made the exact same argument to show that ${\it any}$ real number is not in our enumeration.

Here are the definitions: Let $G$ be a group and let $A$ be a $G$-module (that is, a $\mathbb{Z}[G]$-module). We have the ""cochains"" $$C^1(G,A)=\{\text{maps }: \; G \rightarrow A\},$$ and ""cocycles"" $$Z^1(G,A)=\{(a_\sigma)_{\sigma \in G}\; | \; a_{\sigma \tau}=\sigma a_\tau+a_\sigma \},$$ and ""coboundaries"" $$ B^1(G,A)=\{(\sigma b-b)_{\sigma \in G}\}.$$ we have $$C^1(G,A) \supset Z^1(G,A) \supset B^1(G,A).$$ We then define the 1st cohomology group $$H^1(G,A)=\frac{Z^1(G,A)}{B^1(G,A)}.$$ For any normal subgroup $H \leq G$, we also have the inflation map $$ \text{inf}: H^1\left(\frac{G}{H}, A^H\right)\rightarrow H^1(G,A).$$ Let $K$ be a perfect field. Then $G=\text{Gal}(\overline{K}/K)$ is a topological group with basis around the identity given by the subsets $\text{Gal}(\overline{K}/L)$ where $[L:K]< \infty$. (I think we also want $L/K$ to be Galois, but the lecturer didn't say this.) We then impose that the stabiliser of any $a \in A$ is an open subgroup of $G$, and that the ""cochains"" are continuous w.r.t. the discrete topology for $A$. Then the lecturer claims that $$H^1(\text{Gal}(\overline{K}/K),A)=\lim_{\rightarrow}H^1\left(L/K, A^{\text{Gal}(\overline{K}/L)}\right).$$ I can't see why this is true. I'm really struggling to get a hold of the RHS. Here the direct limit is taken over finite extensions $L$ of $K$ with respect to the inflation map. Edit: here is my attempt at proving $$Z^1(\text{Gal}(\overline{K}/K),A)=\lim_\rightarrow \; Z^1\left( \text{Gal}(L/K),A^{\text{Gal}(\overline{K}/L)}\right).$$ I think what I want to show is that a cocyle $(a_\sigma)\in Z^1(\text{Gal}(\overline{K}/K),A)$ is induced by a cocyle in $Z^1( \text{Gal}(L/K),A^{\text{Gal}(\overline{K}/L)})$ for some $[L:K]<\infty$. Now, by the continuity we can find a finite extension of $K$, $L_1$, such that the coset of $\text{Gal}(\overline{K}/L_1)$ is contained in the preimage of $0=a_1$. Since this coset contains $1$, it is actually just $\text{Gal}(\overline{K}/L_1)$. By the condition about stabilisers, we can find $L_2$ such that a coset of $\text{Gal}(\overline{K}/L_2)$ fixes $a_1$, and again this coset is just $\text{Gal}(\overline{K}/L_2)$. Take $L$ to be the Galois closure of the compositum $L_1L_2$. Suppose $\sigma, \sigma' \in \text{Gal}(\overline{K}/K)$ such that $\sigma|_L=\sigma'|_L$. Then $\sigma^{-1} \sigma'=\tau \in \text{Gal}(\overline{K}/L)$. So $$a_\sigma'=a_{\sigma \tau}=\sigma a_\tau+a_\sigma =a_\sigma.$$ Thus $a_\sigma$ depends only on $\sigma|_L$. So for $\tau \in \text{Gal}(\overline{K}/L)$, $a_{\tau \sigma}=a_\sigma$. So $\tau(a_\sigma)=a_{\tau \sigma}-a_\tau=a_\sigma$. Thus each element of $\{a_\sigma: \sigma \in \text{Gal}(\overline{K}/K)\}$ is fixed by $\text{Gal}(\overline{K}/L)$, as required.","['elliptic-curves', 'number-theory']"
