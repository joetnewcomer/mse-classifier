3720983,Value of $n$ for which the function $x^n \sin {\frac{1}{x}}$ is continuous at $x=0$,"The question is as follows, Determine the values of $n$ for which the function, $$f(x) = \begin{cases}x^n\sin\left(\frac1x\right) & ,x\neq 0 \\ 0 & ,x=0\end{cases}$$ is continuous at $x=0$ The way I tried to solve it is by using inequalities, starting with, $$-1 \leq \sin \left(\frac1x\right) \leq 1$$ $$-x^n \leq x^n\sin \left(\frac1x\right) \leq x^n$$ $$\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} -x^n \leq \lim _{x\rightarrow0} f(x) \leq \lim_{x\rightarrow 0} x^n $$ Which gives us, continuity $\forall \;n$ This seems right but I'm not sure, could someone confirm it and also is there a better method?","['continuity', 'functions']"
3720989,What can be concluded about the probability: $\mathbb{P}(\sum\limits_{n\ge1}\frac{X_n}{n} \quad\text{converges})$?,"Let $\{X_n\}_{n\ge1}$ be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with $\mathbb{P}(X_n=1)=\mathbb{P}(X_n=-1)=\frac{1}{2}$ . What can be concluded about the probability: \begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(\sum\limits_{n\ge1}\frac{X_n}{n} \quad\text{converges})?
\end{align} I believe that I have a solution which doesn't utilize the fact that they are identically distributed at all, so I am wondering if the following is correct? Note that $\{X_n\}_{n\ge1}$ is an independent sequence of r.v.'s $\implies$ that $\{\frac{X_n}{n}\}_{n\ge1}$ is an independent sequence of r.v.'s. Now note that: \begin{align}
A:&=\{\sum\limits_{n\ge1}\frac{X_n}{n} \quad\text{converges}\}\\
&=\{\sum\limits_{n\ge k}\frac{X_n}{n} \quad\text{converges}\} \quad\text{for all}\ k\ge 1\\
&\in \sigma(\frac{X_k}{k},\frac{X_{k+1}}{k+1},\frac{X_{k+2}}{k+2},...) \quad\text{for all}\ k\ge 1\\
\end{align} Hence, $A \in \bigcap\limits_{k\ge1}\sigma(\frac{X_k}{k},\frac{X_{k+1}}{k+1},\frac{X_{k+2}}{k+2},...)=\tau$ and therefore by Kolmogorov's 0-1 law: $\mathbb{P}(A)=0\ \text{or}\ 1 $ . Am I missing something and this solution is incorrect? Otherwise, I don't see a need to even mention the distribution of the $X_n$ 's.","['self-learning', 'probability-distributions', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"
3721042,Is there an entire function with domains for which $f(A)=B$ and $f(B)=A$?,"Let $f$ be an entire function. Suppose that there exist two nonempty disjoint, open, connected non-empty sets $A,B$ in the plane such that $f(A)=B$ and $f(B)=A$ . Does it follow that $f$ is linear? Equivalently, if a meromorphic function satisfies this condition is it necessarily an automorphism? Neither of the conditions of disjointness and openness can be dropped, of course. I tried to see if results in dynamics about 2-periodic domains apply, but they usually only regard Fatou components or are otherwise not suitable. But it does seem like a question simple enough that it ""ought to"" be amenable to such machinery. Any ideas?","['complex-analysis', 'complex-dynamics']"
3721047,Turning An Algebraic Number Into An Algebraic Integer,"We know that for any algebraic number $\alpha$ $\exists$ $m\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$ such that $m\alpha$ is an algebraic integer. If $\alpha$ is an algebraic integer then $m=1$ suffices. But if $\alpha$ is not an algebraic integer but an algebraic number then we have the following theorem. Theorem: Let $$f(X)=a_nX^n+a_{n-1}X^{n-1}+\ldots+a_1X+a_0\in\mathbb{Z}[X]\;(a_n>0)$$ be the unique irreducible polynomial with $\gcd(a_n,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_1,a_0)=1$ and $\alpha$ as a root. Then $a_n\alpha$ is an algebraic integer. Proof: Consider the monic polynomial $$P(X)=X^n+a_{n-1}X^{n-1}+a_na_{n-2}X^{n-2}+\ldots+a_n^{n-2}a_1X+a_n^{n-1}a_0\in\mathbb{Z}[X]$$ Then $$P(a_n\alpha)=(a_n\alpha)^n+a_{n-1}(a_n\alpha)^{n-1}+a_na_{n-2}(a_n\alpha)^{n-2}+\ldots+a_n^{n-2}a_1(a_n\alpha)+a_n^{n-1}a_0\\=a_n^{n-1}(a_n\alpha^n+a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1}+a_{n-2}\alpha^{n-2}+\ldots+a_1\alpha+a_0)=a_n^{n-1}f(\alpha)=0$$ Hence $a_n\alpha$ , being a root of the monic polynomial $P(X)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ , is an algebraic integer. My question: Denote the set of algebraic integers by $\mathbb{A}$ . Then the theorem says for a particular algebraic number $\alpha$ the set $$S_{\alpha}=\{|m|:m\in\mathbb{Z},m\alpha\in\mathbb{A}\}\setminus\{0\}\neq\emptyset$$ Consider the algebraic number $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}$ . Clearly $3\in S_{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}}$ . The minimal polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ for $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}$ is $9X^2-2$ . Hence by the theorem $9\in S_{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}}$ . Moreover since $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3},\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}$ are not algebraic integers we have $\min(S_{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}})=3$ . This example shows that $a_n$ is not necessarily $\mathrm{min}(S_{\alpha})$ . But by Well-ordering principle $\min(S_{\alpha})$ exists. Can we compute $\min(S_{\alpha})$ in terms of $\alpha$ ?","['number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'algebraic-numbers']"
3721081,"For every natural number $n$, $f(n) =$ the smallest prime factor of $n.$ For example, $f(12) = 2, f(105) = 3$","QUESTION: Let $f$ be a continuous function from $\Bbb{R}$ to $\Bbb{R}$ (where $\Bbb{R}$ is the set of all real numbers) that satisfies the following property: For every natural number $n$ , $f(n) =$ the smallest prime factor of $n.$ For example, $f(12) = 2, f(105) = 3.$ Calculate the following- $(a)\lim_{x→∞}f(x)$ $(b)$ The number of solutions to the equation $f(x) = 2016$ . MY SOLUTION: I do not have a problem in understanding part $(a)$ . Clearly, $\infty$ is not a number and we cannot find any smallest prime factor for it. Or we can also argue that for any even number- $f(even)=2$ And for any odd number it depends on the type of the odd number.. in case it's prime then $f(prime \space x)=x$ and in case it's not prime then the answer is something else.. Anyway, we find that there are numerous possibilities and since all of these possibilities directly depend on the number we have chosen so, we cannot account for what happens in the case of $\infty$ . Coming to the second part, the question itself bounced over my head. Let's see carefully what it says- We know, $f(x)=$ the smallest prime factor of $x$ . Therefore, $f(x)=2016$ must imply (by the same logic that)- The smallest prime factor of $x$ is $2016$ . Wait. What?! Firstly, 2016 is not prime. So how can I account for $x's$ which have such an impossible prime factor.. secondly, even if we assume that $2016$ is the smallest factor of $x$ there are infinite $x's$ which satisfies such a property. Our answer in that case is not bounded (although it's nowhere mentioned it should be).. So what does the second part even mean? 🤔 Thank you in advance for your kind help :).","['prime-factorization', 'functions', 'prime-numbers']"
3721097,"If $A$, $B$ and $C$ are sets, where $A \triangle C = B \triangle C $, then $ A = B $","I have to prove or disprove the following claim: If $A$ , $B$ and $C$ are sets, where $A \triangle C = B \triangle C $ , then $ A = B $ My proof is the following: Consider any sets $A$ , $B$ and $C$ , where $A \triangle C = B \triangle C $ . We need to prove, that $ A = B $ by showing that $ A \subseteq B $ and $ B \subseteq A $ . First, we will show that $ A \subseteq B$ . For this, consider any $ x \in A $ . We will prove that $ x \in B $ . Notice, that either $ x \in C $ or $ x \not\in C $ . Therefore we will proceed by cases: $ x \in C $ . Since $ x \in A $ and $ x \in C$ , we see that $ x \not\in A \triangle C $ . Consequently, as $ A \triangle C = B \triangle C $ , we know that $ x\not\in B \triangle C $ . This means that $ x \in B $ . $ x \not\in C $ . This means that $ x \in A \triangle C $ . Consequently, $ x \in B \triangle C $ . Therefore $ x \in B $ . The second part of the proof (to show that $ B \subseteq A $ ) is very similar to this. Can someone please take a look at the proof and criticize it? I'm especially interested in this part: Note, that either $ x \in C $ or $ x \not\in C $ . Therefore we will proceed by cases: Is it okay to proceed this way or is it unclear or incorrect?

Substituting $U(y,t)=u(e^{-y},t)$ and $F(y)=f(e^{-y})$ we get $$ \frac{\partial^2 U(y,t)}{\partial y^2}+(1-a)\frac{\partial U(y,t)}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial U(y,t)}{\partial t},$$ with the solution $$\hat U(\xi,t)=\hat F(\xi)e^{(-4\pi\xi^2+(1-a)2\pi i\xi)t},$$ since $\hat U(\xi,0)=\hat F(\xi)$ . Taking the Fourier transform in the y variable (assuming that u satisfies the necessary conditions and $\hat {\frac{\partial U}{\partial t}}$ = $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\hat U$ ), and using $$\hat F(\xi)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(x)e^{-2\pi xi\xi} dx=\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{f(y)}{y}e^{2\pi i\log(y)\xi} dy,$$ we are supposed to get $$u(x,t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi t}}\int_0^{\infty}e^{-(\log(v/x)+(1-a)t)^2/(4t)}f(v) \frac{dv}{v},$$ whereas I get $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_0^{\infty} e^{(-4\pi^2\xi^2+(1-a)2\pi i\xi)t}e^{2\pi\log(y/x)i\xi} \frac{f(y)}{y} dyd\xi$$ and don't know how to simplify it.","['complex-analysis', 'fourier-analysis', 'fourier-transform', 'heat-equation']"
3721124,$I_n \sim I_m $ iff $ n=m $ by induction over n,"This question is related to Prove that if $A \sim I_n$ and $A \sim I_m$ then $n=m$ in which basicaly the same was proof in another way.Now my aim is to understand the following proof by mathematical induction I have the following proof in my lecture notes: Clearly if $n=m$ , the identity mapping over $I_n$ is bijective and then $I_n \sim I_m $ Viceversa, let $I_n \sim I_m $ and let's uppose $n\leq m$ . If $n=1$ and $\varphi:I_1 \rightarrow I_m$ is bijective, then it is also surjective: therefore m=1.
Let's supposse the thesis is true for a fixed $n \geq 1$ and let's verify it for $n+1$ . Let $\varphi:I_{n+1} \rightarrow I_m$ be bijective and let $u=\varphi(n+1) \in I_m$ . The mapping: $$\tau: I_m \rightarrow I_m $$ $$k \rightarrow\begin{cases} 
k, &\text{if }k \neq u,m\\
u, &\text{if } k=m\\
m, &\text{if } k=u 
\end{cases}$$ is bijective, and so is $\tau \circ\varphi:I_{n+1} \rightarrow I_m$ Because $\tau \circ\varphi(n+1)=\tau(u)=m,$ it follows that $\varphi_{\big|I_n}$ is a bijection from $I_n$ to $I_{m-1}$ , so by inductive hypothesis $n=m-1$ , that is $n+1=m$ . The thesis is then proved by induction I have two questions about this proof Is there an error in the last part?: Shouldn't it be ( $\tau \circ\varphi)_{\big|I_n}$ instead of $\varphi_{\big|I_n}$ ? Why do I need to define $\tau$ and $\tau \circ \varphi$ for? Can't I just define : $\theta: I_n \rightarrow I_{m}\setminus{\varphi(n+1)}$ which is bijective since I am only taking $(n+1,\varphi(n+1)) $ out of $\varphi$ and then apply the inductive hypothesis to it, so that $n=m-1$ , that is $n+1=m$ .","['elementary-set-theory', 'induction']"
3721157,Is this Linear Algebra Approach for Tangent Plane of an Ellipsoid Legal?,"In my vectorial calculus course, I was basically asked for finding a tangent plane for an ellipsoid parallel to a given plane by means of the gradient. Exactly the question was: Find the values of m for which the plane $x - 2y -2z  + m = 0$ is
tangent to the ellipsoid $x^2 +4y^2 +16z^2 = 144$ I solve it using the gradient, but I thought it could be a more interesting way to solve it. Firstly, I suppose that if we were making the exact same problem with a sphere of radius 12, we could take advantage of its symmetry… Modify the scale of the coordinates to transform the ellipsoid into a sphere, by making the substitutions $x = x'$ , $ y = \frac{1}{2} y'$ , $z = \frac{1}{4}z'$ . Hence I am working in a kind of $\rm I\!R^{'3}$ instead of $\rm I\!R^3$ Apply the same exact substitution to the plane, in order to bring it to my new space, as well. Use the normalised vector normal to the plane, and find the scalar $\alpha$ for which the vector line intersects the surface of the sphere. Let's call it $v_1^{'}$ . Technically speaking, that vector represents the point in which the the plane in $\rm I\!R^{'3}$ is tangent to the sphere. Apply a linear transformation T to $v_1^{'}$ , so that $T:\rm I\!R^{'3} \rightarrow  \rm I\!R^3$ whose associate matrix is \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 2 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 4
\end{bmatrix} In order to bring my $v_1^{'}$ to the original space. Once I have my new vector $v_1$ , It also touches the ellipsoid at it's surface. But is clear that is not normal to my original plane. However, as it is the point of hypothetical contact of the plane with the ellipsoid, I just calculate the norm of the projection of $v_1$ on the my normal vector $n$ , and used it as the distance required for my plane to move in order to be tangent to the ellipsoid. Using the distance between planes equation, I found my final m and finished the exercise. However, I'm not sure if it's completely legal. And if it was, is there any other application of this technique?, we can use if for more complex problems?","['multivariable-calculus', 'linear-algebra', 'vectors', 'vector-analysis']"

Let $W(X)$ be the Wallman compactification of $X$ . Is $W(X)$ locally compact? As a step towards this, is the remainder $X^*= W(X)\setminus X$ locally compact? The remainder $X^*$ is certainly closed in $W(X)$ , and hence compact. To see this, suppose that $X$ is non-compact and that $K$ is a compact neighbourhood of a point $x\in X$ , with interior $U$ . Let $C$ be the complement of $U$ in $X$ . Then $C$ belongs to every free closed ultrafilter $\cal F$ on $X$ , for otherwise, by the disjointness of ultrafilters, there is closed set $D$ belonging to $\cal F$ disjoint from $C$ . Then $D\subseteq U\subseteq K$ , and hence $D$ is compact, and thus $\cal F$ is a fixed ultrafilter. Hence the closure of $C$ in $W(X)$ is $C\cup X^*$ . It follows that $U$ is open in $W(X)$ , and thus that $X^*$ is closed.","['general-topology', 'compactification', 'compactness']"

3721344,Probability of different winners in a two candidate election (range voting vs majority),"I was clicking through the xkcd comics, and I came upon xkcd 2225 . I didn't know about "" Range Voting "", so decided to read about this voting system. I came up with the following problem based off it: Let there be $2$ candidates in an election, $C_1$ and $C_2$ . Each voter will randomly assign both candidates a score, choosing from the standard uniform distribution, $U(0, 1)$ . The winner, counting by range voting, will be the candidate who got the greater sum of scores. The winner, counting by majority voting, will be the candidate who got the greater number of high scores. What is the probability that the two winners are different as the number of voters approaches $\infty$ ? I fear that explanation was unclear, so let me illustrate an example: Let there be $5$ voters. Then the scores could be $$[0.1, 0.2]$$ $$[0.6, 0.7]$$ $$[0.9, 0.1]$$ $$[0.4, 0.5]$$ $$[0.8, 0.9]$$ Then $C_1$ would be the winner by range voting since $0.1 + 0.6 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.8 = 2.8 > 2.4=0.2+0.7+0.1+0.5+0.9$ . $C_2$ would be the winner by majority because they secured voters $1, 2, 4, 5$ , whereas $C_1$ only secured voter $3$ . I can rewrite the problem as $$2 \mathbb{P}(C_1 \text{ winning range} \cap C_2 \text{ winning majority})$$ This can in turn be written as $$2 \sum_{k=1}^{n/2}\mathbb{P}(C_1 \text{ winning range} \cap C_1 \text{ getting exactly k in majority vote})$$ Let $s_i$ be the value of the vote cast by the $i$ th voter for $C_1$ minus the value of the vote cast for $C_2$ . The values of $s_i$ will follow the distribution of $1 - |x|$ with $-1 < x < 1$ . The inner probability can be written in terms of integrals, although it is very ugly, to get $$2\sum_{k = 1}^{n/2}\binom{n}{k} \int_0^1 ... \int_0^1 \int_{-1}^0 ... \int_{-1}^0 \prod_{i=1}^{k}(1-s_i) \prod_{i=k+1}^n (1+s_i) \left[\sum_{i=1}^n s_i > 0\right] ds_n...ds_{k+1} ds_k...ds_1$$ where $[$ $]$ denotes the Iverson bracket . From here, the integral can be rewritten to get $$2\sum_{k = 1}^{n/2}\binom{n}{k} \underbrace{\int_0^1 ... \int_{0}^1 \prod_{i=1}^{n}s_i \left[\sum_{i=k+1}^n s_i - \sum_{i=1}^k s_i > n-2k \right] ds_n...ds_1}_{I_{n, k}}$$ Using Mathematica, I found that $I_{2, 1} = \frac{1}{8}, I_{3, 1} = \frac{19}{720}, I_{4, 1} = \frac{191}{40320}, I_{5, 1} = \frac{887}{1209600}, I_{6, 1} = \frac{6797}{68428800}, I_{5, 2} = \frac{10117}{1209600}, I_{6, 2} = \frac{467009}{239500800}$ . However, I wasn't able to simplify the sum any further. I found that the approximation for $n = 3$ is $\frac{19}{120}$ , for $n = 5$ it is $\frac{21121}{120960}$ , and for $n = 7$ , it is $\frac{56332921}{311351040} \approx 0.181$ . I didn't include results about even $n$ because of possible ambiguity with the $k = n/2$ case. It seems that $I_{2k, k} = \frac{1}{2^{2k+1}}$ , and $$\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\binom{2k}{k}}{2^{2k+1}} = 0$$ so this would confirm that ignoring the $k = n/2$ case would have no impact as $n \to \infty$ . My questions: Would it be possible to find a closed form for $I_{n, k}$ ? If so, what is it? What is the closed form for the limit of the probability as $n$ approaches $\infty$ ? Edit: I can instead use the sums of the integral as the bounds. I get $$I_{n, k} = \int_0^k \int_{n-2k+S_1}^{n-k} P_{k}(S_1)P_{n-k}(S_2)dS_2 dS_1$$ where $P_m(x) = \int_0^1 ... \int_0^1 \prod_{i=1}^m s_i \left[\sum s_i = x\right]ds_m ... ds_1$ $P_m(x)$ can be rewritten as $$\int_{x-1}^{x} (x-t) P_{m-1}(t) dt $$ with $P_m(x) = 0$ for $x < 0$ and $x > m$ . I found that $P_1(x) = x$ for $0 \le x \le 1$ , $$P_2(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \frac{1}{3!}x^{3} & : 0 \le x \le 1\\ \frac{1}{3!}(-x^3 + 6x - 4) & : 1 \le x \le 2 \end{array} \right.$$ $$P_3(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \frac{1}{5!}x^{5} & : 0 \le x \le 1\\ \frac{1}{5!}(-2x^5 + 30x^3 - 60x^2 + 45x-12) & : 1 \le x \le 2 \\ \frac{1}{5!}(x^5 - 30x^3 + 60x^2 + 45x-108) & : 2 \le x \le 3 \end{array} \right.$$ $$P_4(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}

\frac{1}{(2m-1)!}x^{2m-1} &: 0 \le x \le 1

\end{array} \right.$$ Edit $2$ : Letting $P_{m, k}(x)$ be $P_m(x)$ for $k \le x \le k+1$ and repeatedly using the recurrence relation, I found that $$P_{m, k}(x) = \int_{x-1}^{k}\left(x-x_{1}\right)P_{m-1,k-1}\left(x_{1}\right)dx_{1}+\sum_{t=1}^{m-k-1}\frac{1}{\left(2t+1\right)!}\left(\left(x-k\right)^{2t}\int_{k-1}^{k}P_{m-t-1,k-1}\left(x_{2}\right)\left(2kt+x-\left(1+2t\right)x_{2}\right)dx_{2}+\int_{k-1}^{x-1}P_{m-t-1,k-1}\left(x_{2}\right)\left(1-x+x_{2}\right)^{2t}\left(-2t-x+x_{2}\right)dx_{2}\right)$$ However, when I try to use this for $P_{m, 2}(x)$ , I get a really long and nasty function with hypergeometric functions.

3721532,Generalizing Catalan numbers: number of ways where we cross the diagonal $k$ times.,"Let's say we have a square grid with n steps each. One starts at the lower left corner, takes $2n$ steps; $n$ of them to the right and $n$ of them to the upwards and ends up at the upper right corner. If we want to count the number of paths that don't cross the main diagonal and stay on a particular side of it, we get the Catalan numbers, $C_n=\frac{2n \choose n}{(n+1)}$ . Accounting for both sides, the total paths that don't cross the main diagonal then become $2 C_n$ . A natural question to ask is: how many paths cross the main diagonal exactly $k$ times? Let's call this number $R_{k,n}$ . I want to find a closed-form expression for $R_{k,n}$ . Obviously, $R_{0,n}=2C_n$ My attempt and some thoughts The question here: Using the Catalan numbers provides a warm-up. Both @joriki and @robjohn calculate the number of paths that have a segment that is positive (possibly empty) followed by a segment that is negative (possibly empty). Let's denote this sequence, $G_n$ as joriki does. They do this by noting that conditional on some cut-off point, we simply get two Catalan sequences. Hence, the number of such paths becomes the convolution of the Catalan numbers with themselves. joriki notes that this sequence will have a generating function that is the square of the generating function of the Catalan numbers. He uses this to determine that it is simply the $n+1$ th Catalan number. Another way to go about finding this would have been to use the general formula here: Proof of identity about generalized binomial sequences. with $k=2$ . The two yield the same answer. This can be used to get $R_{1,n}$ per the following equation (we divide $R_{1,n}$ by 2 because the sequence only considers paths which were negative first and then positive while $R_{1,n}$ includes sequences that were positive first): $$G_n=C_{n+1}=2C_n+\frac{R_{1,n}}{2}$$ $$=> R_{1,n}=2C_{n+1}-4C_n$$ Now, can we apply this ""convolution trick"" to get $R_{k,n}$ ? One way is to consider paths that have three sections. They start off with a section (possibly empty) below the main diagonal. Then, they cross it and there is a section (possibly empty) above the main diagonal. Then, they cross it again and there is a third section (possibly empty) that stays below the main diagonal. Unlike before, there are two cut-off points and it seems we have a three-way convolution of the Catalan numbers with themselves. The first thought is that the number of such paths (say $H_n$ ) will have a generating function that is the cube of that of the Catalan numbers. And if we increase the number of segments further, we get higher and higher powers of the generating function. But this can't be right since as we keep increasing the number of such segments, the number of paths should keep increasing per equation (5.70) here: Proof of identity about generalized binomial sequences. . In reality, we'll reach an upper bound at some point when we simply cover all ${2n \choose n}$ paths. So, what is the error in the ""three way convolution leading to a generating function becoming the cube of the Catalan number generating function"" argument? One resolution might be that the argument is fine, but increasing the cut-off points starts double and triple counting the paths.","['catalan-numbers', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics', 'sequences-and-series']"
3721536,Chern-Weil theory in the cohomological Atiyah-Singer theorem,"I am interested in the following piece of data appearing in the cohomological Atiyah-Singer theorem. My reference is ""The index of elliptic operators. III"" by Atiyah and Singer. Let $D:\Gamma(E)\to\Gamma(F)$ be an elliptic operator where $E\to X$ and $F\to X$ are complex vector bundles over a closed manifold $X$ . The principal symbol of $D$ is a bundle isomorphism $\pi^\ast E\to\pi^\ast F$ , where $\pi$ is the restriction of the projection $T^\ast X\to X$ to the complement of the zero section. Given a Riemannian metric on $X$ , the Thom space $\operatorname{Th}_X$ of $T^\ast X\to X$ is the topological space arising as the one-point compactification of the unit ball subbundle of $T^\ast X$ . Using the above bundle isomorphism (and the obvious extension across the zero section), one extends $\pi^\ast E-\pi^\ast F$ to an element of $K(\operatorname{Th}_X)$ . The Chern character gives an element of cohomology on the Thom space, and the cohomological Thom isomorphism gives an element of cohomology on $X$ . Now, the de Rham theorem says that this final cohomology element can be represented by a smooth differential form. My question is: can such a smooth form be prescribed in differential-geometric terms from the principal symbol, the (choice of) Riemannian metric on $X$ , and perhaps a choice of hermitian bundle metrics and metric-compatible connections on $E\to X$ and $F\to X$ ? This seems non-obvious since the Thom space does not seem to have a natural smooth structure, and so the use of the Chern character in the above presentation doesn't seem immediately amenable to the Chern-Weil approach. But, given the context and the conclusion, it seems unnatural to be forced to reach into the theory of topological characteristic classes. If I understand correctly, the answer to my question is ""essentially yes"" according to Quillen's article ""Superconnections and the Chern character,"" which identifies such a differential form via a choice of ""superconnection"" on $\pi^\ast E\oplus\pi^\ast F.$ However, Quillen's article seems to be answering a more general question, and has nothing to do with, for instance, the Thom space. Can one make use of the more special situation above to give a simpler answer than Quillen's?","['algebraic-topology', 'k-theory', 'homology-cohomology', 'characteristic-classes', 'differential-geometry']"

3721655,"Let $A$ & $B$ be sets. Prove that $\{A,B\}$ is a set.","Here are the axioms that I'm allowed to use. Axiom of Existence: There exists a set. Axiom of Belonging: If $x$ is an object and $A$ is a set, then $x \in A$ is a proposition. Axiom of Extension: Two sets are equal iff they have the same members. Axiom Schema of Specification: Let $S$ be a set and let $p(x)$ be an open sentence about the objects in $S$ . Then, $\{x \in S: p(x)\}$ is a set. Axiom of Unions: Let $F$ be a family of sets. Then, $\cup F$ is a set and it contains all objects that belong to at least one set in the family $F$ . Axiom of Powers: Let $S$ be a set. There exists a set $P(S)$ whose elements are all the subsets of $S$ . So, all of this is what I'm allowed to prove this result and nothing more. I think this is sufficient context based on the book that I'm using. Now, I will present my argument. Proof Attempt: Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. By the Axiom of Unions, $A \cup B$ is a set. By the Axiom of Powers, $P(A \cup B)$ is a set. Since $A \subset A \cup B$ and $B \subset A \cup B$ , it follows that $A \in P(A \cup B)$ and $B \in P(A \cup B)$ . We define the following: $$\phi = \{x \in P(A \cup B): (x = A) \lor (x = B) \}$$ By the Axiom Schema of Specification, $\phi$ is a set. Then, the Axiom of Extension implies that $\phi = \{A,B\}$ and it follows, then, that $\{A,B\}$ is a set. That proves the desired result. I'm kind of not happy with that first line that uses the Axiom of Unions. It just feels wrong. But perhaps that's just me being stupid about this. In any case, is the argument above correct?

Now, consider $$ E \left( \frac{\lambda^{S_n}} {\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \lambda^{S_k}} \right).$$ The task is to find a sequence $f(n)$ (possibly random) such that $$ E \left( \frac{\lambda^{S_n}} {\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \lambda^{S_k}} \right) \Big/ {f(n)} \to 1 $$ and thus, find the growth behavior of the expectation at question.
Note that $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \lambda^{S_k} \to L:= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \lambda^{S_k}$ a.s. Here the question from before (first part deleted): [...] Then, I am interested in general, what is the asymptotic growth behavior of $$ E \left( \frac{\lambda^{S_n} (1- \lambda^{S_n})}{\lambda^{S_n} + \sum_{k=0}^n \lambda^{S_k}} \right) ?$$","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'asymptotics', 'real-analysis']"
3722352,Sum of $f(x)$ and $f(\frac{1}{x})$ for a monotonic function,"I came across this question from a competitive exam: $\textbf{Problem: }$ Given $f:[\frac{1}{2},2]\to\mathbb{R}$ a strictly increasing function, define $g:[1,2]\to\mathbb{R}$ by $g(x)=f(x)+f(\frac{1}{x})$ . Does there exist a suitable $f$ for which there is a partition $P$ of $[1,2]$ such that $U(P,g)=L(P,g)$ ? Here, $U(P,g)$ and $L(P,g)$ are the upper and lower Riemann sums respectively. I could figure this out and the answer is $\textbf{Yes}$ . One can take $f(x)=\log x$ , $f(x)=\frac{x-1}{x+1}$ , etc. So this is alright. I thought of making $g$ to be a constant function to construct the above examples. While trying to come up with these examples, I made some rough graphs that satisfied the hypotheses of the problem and observed something that I want to ask about. Later, I drew several graphs in Desmos as well and observed the same thing. My question is, is the following true? $\textbf{Question:}$ For $a>1$ , given $f:[\frac{1}{a},a]\to\mathbb{R}$ a monotonic function, define $g:[1,a]\to\mathbb{R}$ by $g(x)=f(x)+f(\frac{1}{x})$ . Is $g$ always non-decreasing? I feel it is true. But I could not prove it. Neither could I construct a counterexample. Any hints to prove/disprove the above statement are appreciated. If the above result is true, then the only possible candidates for $g$ in the above original problem can be constants, right? That is why I got interested in this. $\textbf{Please note:}$ I am not assuming any continuity conditions anywhere.

3722543,Embedding of countable linear orders into $\Bbb Q$ as topological spaces,"Any set $X$ with a linear order has a uniquely associated order topology generated by the open intervals.  That makes it into a linearly ordered topological space (LOTS). It is also a standard result that any countable linear order is isomorphic as a linear order to a subset of $\Bbb Q$ (uses the fact that $(\Bbb Q, <)$ is a dense linear order).  See for example here . Now in general there are many ways a linear order can be embedded into $\Bbb Q$ .  For example consider these two subsets: $$A_1=\{0\}\cup\{1/n:n=1,2,\ldots\}$$ $$A_2=\{-1\}\cup\{1/n:n=1,2,\ldots\}$$ They are isomorphic to each other as linear order, and hence have the same intrinsic LOTS topology.  But as topological subspaces of $\Bbb Q$ they are very different.  The first one is compact, and the second one has the discrete topology, but only the first one has its intrinsic LOTS topology match its topology as a subspace of $\Bbb Q$ .  So an embedding that makes the subspace and order topologies match is special in a way. Here is my question: Given a countable set $X$ with a linear order, is it possible to embed it into $\Bbb Q$ by a linear order isomorphism so that the order topology on $X$ matches the subspace topology from $\Bbb Q$ ? Anything you want to add explaining the relationship between the two topologies would be very interesting.  For example one topology always stronger than the other.  And are there some cases for the linear order $X$ where the two topologies always coincide independently of a linear order embedding?","['order-theory', 'general-topology']"

This example appears in Section 6.3 of Dummit and Foote's Abstract Algebra . The definition of generators and relations there is somehow confusing. It begins with a given group $G$ and a subset $S$ of $G$ such that $G=\llg S\rrg$ and then assume a subset $R$ of the free group $F(S)$ has the property that its normal closure in $F(S)$ equals to the kernel of the group homomorphism $\pi$ , where $\pi$ is defined by the following commutative diagram: where $\iota_k$ , $k=1,2$ , are the inclusion maps. This a priori appearance of the group $G$ in the definition makes statements like the example above difficult to understand. To approach the example above, I will use the following definition instead: Let $S$ be a set and $F(S)$ the free group on $S$ . Let $R$ be a set of words in $F(S)$ , i.e. $R\subset F(S)$ , and $N$ the normal closure of $R$ in $F(S)$ . The group $\llg S|R\rrg$ is defined as $$
\llg S|R\rrg=F(S)/N

If I can establish the following, $N=\ker\pi$ ; $\pi$ is surjective, (trivial because $\pi(a^mb^n)=m\pi(a)\oplus n\pi(b)$ ) then by the first group isomorphism theorem, the proof is done. The inclusion $\ker\pi\supset N$ is easy; since $\ker\pi$ is a normal subgroup, it suffices to show that $\ker\pi\supset R$ : $$
\pi([a,b])=[\pi(a),\pi(b)]=[(1,0),(0,1)]=(0,0)\;.

From my understanding of these answers, the first one has a more lenient hypothesis, since to apply F.T.C. we need the function to have an antiderivative, which is not always the case. Knowing this, I was wondering about the extension of this question into a line integral. Let's say that $C$ is a path that starts at point $p$ and ends at point $q$ . If I define $C^*$ to be the same path but staring at $q$ and ending at $p$ , is it generally true that $$
\int_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = - \int_{C^*} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} \quad ?
$$ where here $r:[t_0, t_f]\subset \mathbb{R} \to C$ , with $r(t_0) = p$ and $r(t_f) = q$ being a biyective parametrization of our path. I know that I can show this to be true if $\mathbf{F}$ happens to be a conservative field using the gradient theorem , in a similar manner as the 1D case can be shown by F.T.C., but since this is not always true I don't know if I can say that this holds in general . Is there a way to show that this always holds? Or alternatively, is there a counterexample where this fails?

3723242,Is there an elementary expression for every real sequence?,"By elementary expression for the sequence $\{a_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ , I mean an elementary function $f : X \to \mathbb C$ , where $\mathbb N \subset X \subset \mathbb R$ , such that $f(n)=a_n$ for all $n$ . The set of elementary functions , is the smallest set that contains constant functions $f(x)=c\in\mathbb C$ ; contains $f(x)=x$ ; is closed under addition $f(x) + g(x)$ , multiplication $f(x)g(x)$ and exponentiation $f(x)^{g(x)}$ , where exponentiation is restricted to where $f(x)\in\mathbb R^+$ for convenience; is closed under composition $f(g(x))$ is closed under exponentiation $\exp f(x)$ and logarithm $\ln f(x)$ by the principal branch. In particular, trigonometric functions and their inverses are also elementary ( $\sin(x) = \frac{-i}2(e^{ix}-e^{-ix})$ , $\arctan x=\frac{1}{2}i[\ln(1-ix)-\ln(1+ix)]$ , etc). And the Gaussian function $\lfloor x\rfloor, x\in \mathbb R\backslash \mathbb Z$ is elementary by fiddling with $\arctan \cot x$ (which resembles the fractional part function). A very important elementary sequence is the prime number sequence $p_n = \text{the } n^{\text {th}} \text{ prime}$ . This sequence IS elementary! To see this, construct $$c = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} p_i 10^{-i(i+1)/2},$$ which converges and is a constant , thus satisfying our criteria despite containing infinite sums. We can then construct $f(i)=\left\lfloor c10^{i(i+1)/2}\right\rfloor - \left\lfloor c10^{i(i-1)/2}\right\rfloor10^{i}$ to extract the primes, since $p_i < 10^i$ . In this way, we can construct elementary expressions for any positive integer sequence, as long as it can be bounded by another elementary sequence. And by a clever construction here (contains unfixed minor errors) or here (Chinese) , we can see that all positive integer sequences can be bounded, and thus have elementary expressions. We can easily generalize this to all rational sequences. So the question is: Can this result be generalized to real sequences? (Of course, complex sequences easily follows.) Note that it does not suffice to use the counting argument, since there are $\beth^{\mathbb N}_1 = \beth_1$ real sequences, which is equal to the number of elementary expressions. And the method we used before cannot be generalized, because similar encodings will almost always involve fiddling with digits, which leads to decoding functions containing dense discontinuities. And elementary functions can't be discontinuous on a dense set.","['elementary-functions', 'sequences-and-series']"

I want to show that $F$ is a Riemannian submersion. Definition : a Riemannian submersion $F:(M,g_M) \to(N,g_N)$ is a submersion $F:M \to N$ such that for each $p\in M$ , $DF:\ker(DF)^\perp \to T_{f(p)}N$ is a linear isometry. That is, if $v,w \in T_pM$ are perpendicular to the kernel of $DF: T_pM \to T_{F(p)N}$ , then $$g_M(v,w) = g_N(DF(v),DF(w)).$$ To show that $F$ is a Riemannian submersion, I tried to find $\ker (DF)$ . Since I don't know the method to find $DF$ when $F$ is not a real function, I set $F$ as a real-valued function as below. $$F(a,b,c,d) = \left(\frac{1}{2} ((a^2 - b^2) - (c^2 -d^2)), ac+bd, bc-ad\right).$$ Then I computed $$DF =\begin{pmatrix} a & -b & -c & d \\ c & d & a & b \\ -d & c& b& -a\end{pmatrix}$$ To find a kernel, I used elementary row operations to an augmented matrix $(DF|0)$ . This calculation is very messy, so I am not sure whether this method is right or not. p.s. I know there are similar questions( The hopf fibration is a submersion.

Then, exists a subsequence $(g_k)$ of $(f_n)$ such that $\Vert g_{k+1}-g_k \Vert < 2^{-k}$ . Define $$ (*)g(x) = \vert g_1(x) \vert + \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \vert g_{k+1}(x) - g_k(x) \vert \implies \vert g(x) \vert ^p = (\vert g_1(x) \vert + \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \vert g_{k+1}(x) - g_k(x) \vert)^p$$ Note that $g: X \rightarrow \overline{R}$ is measurable and $g \geq 0$ . Then by Fatou's lemma (notice that the sequence on the right converges to $\vert g \vert ^p$ ) $$ \int \vert g \vert^p d\mu \leq \text{liminf}\int (\vert g_1(x) \vert + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \vert g_{k+1}(x) - g_k(x) \vert)^p d\mu $$ $$ \implies (\int \vert g \vert^p d\mu)^{1/p} \leq \text{liminf} \lbrace \int (\vert g_1(x) \vert + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \vert g_{k+1}(x) - g_k(x) \vert)^p d\mu \rbrace^{1/p} $$ By Minkowski's and because $\Vert g_{k+1}-g_k \Vert < 2^{-k}$ we have $$ \implies (\int \vert g \vert^p d\mu)^{1/p} \leq \text{liminf} (\Vert g_1 \Vert_p + \sum_{i=1}^n \Vert g_{k+1} - g_k \Vert_p) = 1 + \Vert g_1 \Vert_p  $$ $\textbf{Here comes my first question}$ , in the book it says that if we consider $E=\{x \in X / g(x)< \infty \}$ then $E \in \mathcal{F}$ and $\mu(X \setminus E)=0$ . I can't understand why $\mu(X \setminus E)=0$ . After this he says that $g$ converges $\mu-a.e$ (I guess it will refer to (*)) and $g \chi_{E}$ is in $L^p$ . $\textbf{Here my second question}$ , because it is necessary to work with E?. I know that $g$ can take $\infty$ , but from the above we can see that $\int \vert g \vert^p d\mu < \infty $ because $g_1 \in L^p$ and so $\Vert g_1 \Vert_p < \infty$ and then $g \in L^p$ . Anyway, following the proof of the book, we define $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by $$f(x) = g_1(x) + \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} g_{k+1}(x)-g_k(x), \hspace{0.1cm} x\in E $$ $$f(x) = 0, \hspace{0.1cm} x\notin E $$ Applying the triangle inequality we have $\vert g_k \vert \leq \vert g_1 \vert + \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \vert g_{j+1}-g_j \vert \leq g$ and then $\vert g_k \vert^p \leq g^p$ . Because $\vert g_k \vert^p \rightarrow \vert f \vert^p$ converge in $E$ (i.e $\mu$ -a.e) by the Dominated Convergence Theorem : $f \in L^p$ . Then we have $\vert f -g_k \vert \leq 2 \text{max}\{ \vert f \vert, \vert g_k \vert \}\leq 2g $ i.e $\vert f-g_k \vert^p \leq 2^p g^p$ , by the Dominated Convergence Theorem $$ 0 = \int \lim \vert f-g_k \vert^p = \lim \int \vert f-g_k \vert^p \implies \lim \Vert f-g_p \Vert_p = 0 $$ Then $g_k \rightarrow f$ in $L^p$ . Finally, because $(f_n)$ is Cauchy, for $\epsilon > 0$ , exists $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m,n>n_0$ implies $$ \int \vert f_m-f_n \vert^p < \Vert f_m - f_n \Vert_p <\epsilon^p $$ $\textbf{Here my third question}$ , in the book says that we have consider $k$ (bigger) such that $$ \int \vert f_m-g_k \vert^p < \epsilon^p $$ What means this ?, I understand that means that we can always choose a index of subsequence such that is greater than $n_0$ but I'm not sure. And then applying Fatou's Lemma $$ \int \vert f_m-f \vert^p \leq \text{liminf} \int \vert f_m-g_k \vert ^p  \leq \epsilon^p $$ And then $f_n \rightarrow f$ in $L^p$ , so $L^p$ is complete.

3723813,Intuition for a Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (According to 3Blue1Brown),"I have recently watched this video by $3$ Blue $1$ Brown, regarding winding numbers and the fundamental theorem of algebra. I am trying to formalize the idea he shows in the video (starting at 21:26). Specifically, I am trying to connect his proof to a one I've seen in
complex analysis classes: Theorem. Fundamental theorem of algebra. Let $P(z)=z^d+a_1 z^{d-1}+a_2z^{d-2}+\ldots+a_{d-1}z+a_d\in \Bbb{C}[x]$ be a monic complex polynomial of degree $d$ . So the sum of all orders of $P$ 's zeroes is exactly $d$ . Proof. For a function $f$ , denote the sum of orders of all its zeros as $N_f$ . Let $Q(z)=z^d$ . It is obvious that $N_Q=d$ . Subtracting $Q$ from $P$ gives a polynomial of degree $d-1$ , therefore $\frac{|P(z)-Q(z)|}{|Q(z)|}\to0$ as $z\to\infty$ . Let $R_0$ be large enough so that for every $R>R_0$ , every $|z|=R$ satisfies $|P(z)-Q(z)|\le |Q(z)|$ . Using Rouché's theorem for the path $\gamma(t)=R e^{it}$ for $t\in[0,2\pi]$ , we deduce that $N_P=N_Q=d$ . $\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$ Understanding 3Blue1Brwon's Video In his video, $3$ B $1$ B defines a winding number of a complex function on a path as the total number of times the image of the function on the path ""goes through all hues"" of the color map (with negative and positive directions), and explains why a nonzero winding number means that the function has a zero within the area of the path. Qustion 1: What does he mean by this winding number? I.e., what is the formal definition of a ""winding number"" of a function ? I am familiar with the definition $$\operatorname{Ind}_\gamma (a) := \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{\text{d}z}{z-a},$$ which defines the index of a (closed) path in respect to a point . He then explains that the winding number of $Q(z)=z^d$ (in his video, $d=5$ ) around $0$ is $d$ (around some circular path). This I can intuitively understand - as $x$ goes along the unit circle, for example, the function $x^d$ goes around the circle $d$ times. Qustion 2: How is it connected to $0$ being a zero of order $d$ of $Q(z)$ ? Now, as $z\to\infty$ , the leading term of $P(z)$ is the only significant one, so $3$ B $1$ B explains that in a large enough circle, the index of $P$ and $Q$ will be the same. This argument is quite similar to the one in the proof above - Qustion 3: I assume that using Rouché's theorem ""hides under the surface"" some of the intuition in the proof. Is there a way of explicitly using this index equality of $P$ and $Q$ in a large enough circle formally in order to prove the fundamental theorem? Moreover, I know that paths that are homotopy equivalences, have the same index. Are $P$ and $Q$ in fact homotopy equivalences in the area outside the circle? Summing up, I am looking for a more ""mathematically complete"" explanation of $3$ B $1$ B's argument, rigorous yet intuitive. Edit: Question 4: Rouché's theorem is proved using the so called argument principle, as Oliver Diaz's answer mentions. I assume that, intuitivly, we would have wanted to write $\int_\gamma \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} \ \text{d}z=\ln(b)-\ln(a)$ (if $\gamma(0)=a$ and $\gamma(1)=b$ ), but that is of course nonsense, since the complex logarithm is not holomorphic in $[-\infty,0]$ . That does remind me of the work done in a non-conservative field. Is this really the intuitive reason that the argument principle ""works""?","['complex-analysis', 'complex-integration', 'intuition']"

We wish to prove that $$(x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n)^{-1} = x_n^{-1} x_{n-1}^{-1} \cdots x_2^{-1} x_1^{-1}.$$ I'm not sure if the correct way to proceed is by showing the multiplication out, which doesn't seem to me to be required for the inductive step. Here is what I have so far. Proof. Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \in G$ for some group $G$ . We proceed by induction on $n$ .
When $n = 1$ , we have $$x_1^{-1} = x_1^{-1}.$$ Less trivially, when $n = 2$ , we have $$\begin{align}
(x_1 x_2)(x_2^{-1} x_1^{-1}) &= x_1 (x_2 x_2^{-1})x_1^{-1} \\
&= x_1 e x_1^{-1} \\
&= (x_1 e)x_1^{-1} \\
&= x_1 x_1^{-1} \\
&= e,
\end{align}$$ and $$\begin{align}
(x_2^{-1} x_1^{-1})(x_1 x_2) &= x_2^{-1} (x_1^{-1} x_1)x_2\\
& = x_2^{-1} e x_2 \\
&= x_2^{-1} (ex_2) \\
&= x_2^{-1} x_2 \\
&= e,
\end{align}$$ so $(x_1 x_2)^{-1} = x_2^{-1} x_1^{-1}$ .
Supposing inductively that the result holds when $n = k$ , $$
(x_1 x_2 \cdots x_k)^{-1} = x_k^{-1} x_{k-1}^{-1} \cdots x_2^{-1} x_1^{-1},$$ we prove the result when $n = k + 1$ : \begin{align*}
(x_1 x_2 \cdots x_k x_{k+1})^{-1} & = ((x_1 x_2 \cdots x_k)x_{k+1})^{-1} = x_{k+1}^{-1} (x_1 x_2 \cdots x_k)^{-1} \\
& = x_{k+1}^{-1} (x_k^{-1} x_{k-1}^{-1} \cdots x_2^{-1} x_1^{-1}) \\
& = x_{k+1}^{-1} x_k^{-1} x_{k-1}^{-1} \cdots x_2^{-1} x_1^{-1}.
\end{align*} How does this look?","['group-theory', 'solution-verification', 'induction']"
3723967,Is every module automorphism diagonalized by irreps?,"Let $G$ denote a finite group, and let $V$ be a complex and finite dimensional $G$ module; that is, there is a group representation $G\to GL(V)$ . Finally, let $T\colon V\to V$ be an intertwining map, that is, a linear map such that $T(gv)=g T(v)$ for all $v\in V$ and $g\in G$ . By the theorem of Maschke , there are irreducible $G$ -modules $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_n$ such that $$
V=V_1\oplus V_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus V_n.$$ Question . Is it true that $$T v_j=\lambda_j v_j, \qquad \forall v_j\in V_j,$$ for some $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n\in\mathbb C$ ? The lemma of Schur says that this is the case provided that $$\tag{*}T(V_j)\subset V_j.$$ This is because, in this case, $T$ restricts to an intertwining self-map of $V_j$ , which is irreducible. Therefore such restriction must be a scalar multiple of the identity. But is it true that (*) always holds with the given assumptions? EDIT . This question arises from the following observations. Suppose that $G$ is finite and abelian, and let $L^2(G)$ denote the space of all complex-valued functions on $G$ , which is a $G$ -module with the representation $gf(x):=f(x-g)$ . (This seemingly complicated notation hints at more general cases, with infinite groups). Let $\chi\in L^2(G)$ denote a character, that is, a homomorphism of $G$ into $\mathbb C^\times$ . Then an intertwining map $T\colon L^2(G)\to L^2(G)$ satisfies $$T\chi=\lambda_\chi \chi, $$ as it is easy to prove. And since the irreps are in this case the 1-dimensional subspaces $$
\operatorname*{span}(\chi), $$ it follows that intertwining maps of the $G$ -module $L^2(G)$ are diagonalized by irreps. (As the accepted answer clearly shows, intertwining maps of other $G$ -modules need not be even diagonalizable! This is the reason why I found that answer surprising and enlightening). Let us consider an infinite and non-abelian case. Suppose that $T\colon L^2(\mathbb S^{d-1})\to L^2(\mathbb S^{d-1})$ is rotation-invariant; $$
(Tf)(R^{-1}x)=T(f(R^{-1}\cdot))(x).$$ Then $T$ is diagonalized by spherical harmonics. Precisely, letting $$\{Y_{n, j}\ :\ j=1, \ldots, N(n)\}$$ denote a complete orthonormal system of spherical harmonics of degree $n$ , we have that $$
Tf=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \lambda_n \sum_{j=1}^{N(n)} \hat{f}(n, j) Y_{n, j}, $$ where we have let $\hat{f}(n, j)$ denote the coefficient $\langle f | Y_{n, j}\rangle.$ This latter example actually is a consequence of the lemma of Schur. Indeed, the decomposition of the $SO(d)$ -module $L^2(\mathbb S^{d-1})$ into irreps is precisely $$
\bigoplus_{n=0}^\infty \operatorname*{span}\{ Y_{n,j}\ :\ j=1, \ldots, N(n)\}, $$ and these irreps are pairwise non-isomorphic, because $N(n)$ is not a constant. (Actually, $N(n)$ has a well-known combinatorial expression, which there is no need to write down explicitly here).","['harmonic-analysis', 'representation-theory', 'linear-algebra']"

Let us also denote $f_i := f(x_i)$ . Exercise. Assume that $f\in \operatorname{C^5}[x_0, x_4].$ Show that there exists some $\xi(x_2)=:\xi\in[x_0, x_4]$ such that $$f'(x_2) = \dfrac{f_0 - 8f_1 + 8f_3 - f_4}{12 h} + \dfrac{h^4}{30}f^\mathrm{V}(\xi).\label{E}\tag{E}$$ Solution. Using a method of undetermined coefficients and approximation by Taylor polynomials with Lagrangian remainders, I believe to have shown that $$f'(x) = \dfrac{f_0 - 8f_1 + 8f_3 - f_4}{12 h} + \frac{h^4}{30} \frac{16\, f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_2) - 4\, f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_1)}{12} \tag{1}$$ where $\xi_1, \xi_2 \in[x_0, x_4]$ , and $x:=x_2.$ Here is the more detailed explanation. (Skip forward to section named Question if you wish). First for $k = 1, 2$ using Taylor polynomials and Lagrangian remainders $$f(x\pm kh) = f(x) \pm f'(x)\, kh + f''(x)\, \frac{k^2 h^2}{2} \pm f'''(x)\, \frac{k^3 h^3}{6}
 + f^\mathrm{IV}(x)\,\frac{k^4 h^4}{24} \pm f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_\pm^k)\,\frac{k^5 h^5}{120} \label{A1}\tag{A1}$$ where $\xi_\pm^k$ is between $x$ and $x \pm k h$ . Note also that $x_1 = x - h$ , $x_3 = x + h$ and so on. Let us view the expression $Af_0 + Bf_1 + Cf_3 + Df_4$ where $A, B, C, D$ are to be determined. After substituting $f_0, f_1, f_3, f_4$ from the earlier Taylor expansion $\eqref{A1}$ into this expression, one gets after further dividing both sides by $h$ that \begin{align*}\frac{Af_0 + Bf_1 + Cf_3 + Df_4}{h} = \, (&A + B + C + D)\,\frac{f(x)}{h} + (-2A - B + C + 2D)\, f'(x)\\

\label{A2}\tag{A2}\end{align*} Next we attempt to determine the coefficients $A, B, C, D$ in such a way that we are left with $f'(x)$ and $h^4$ terms on the RHS of $\eqref{A2}$ . This gives us the system $$
\begin{cases}
	A + B + C + D = 0,\\
	-2A - B + C + 2D = 1, \\
    4A + B + C + 4 D = 0, \\
    -8A -B + C + 8D = 0,\\
    16A + B + C + 16D = 0.
\end{cases}\label{A3}\tag{A3}
$$ The unique solution is $A = - D = \dfrac{1}{12}$ , $-B = C = \dfrac{2}{3}.$ If we denote the $h^4$ term by $-\mathcal R(x)$ , then substituting the values of the coefficients back into $\eqref{A2}$ , we get $$\dfrac{f_0 - 8f_1 + 8f_3 - f_4}{12 h} + \mathcal R(x) = f'(x).\label{A4}\tag{A4}$$ Comparing this to $\eqref{E}$ , what remains to be shown is that the expression $$\mathcal R(x) = \left[32A\, f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_-^2) + B\, f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_-^1) - C\, f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_+^1) - 32D\, f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_+^2)\right]\,\frac{h^4}{120}\label{A5}\tag{A5}$$ or, after substituting the solution coefficients and simplifying, that the expression $$\mathcal R(x) = \frac{h^4}{30} \frac{8\, f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_-^2) - 2\, f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_-^1) - 2\, f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_+^1) + 8\, f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_+^2)}{12}\label{A6}\tag{A6}$$ is somehow equal to $$\dfrac{h^4}{30}f^\mathrm{V}(\xi)\label{A7}\tag{A7}$$ for some $\xi\in[x_0, x_4]$ . Because $f^\mathrm{V}$ is continuous, by the intermediate value theorem we get \begin{align*}
f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_-^1) + f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_+^1) = 2 f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_1),\label{A8}\tag{A8}\\
f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_-^2) + f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_+^2) = 2 f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_2),\label{A9}\tag{A9}
\end{align*} where $\xi_1 \in(x - h, x + h)$ and $\xi_2 \in(x - 2h, x + 2h)$ . Therefore, $$\mathcal R(x) = \frac{h^4}{30} \frac{16\, f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_2) - 4\, f^\mathrm{V}(\xi_1)}{12}.\label{A10}\tag{A10}$$ Question.

Therefore, $x$ must be relatively prime to $p$ . Then, by Fermat's theorem, $x^{p - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod p$ . So: $$\textrm{rem}(n^{(p-1)/2}, p) = \mathrm{rem}((x^2)^{(p-1)/2}, p) = \mathrm{rem}(x^{p-1}, p) = 1,$$ which proves (i). (c) Assume that $n$ is not a square modulo $p$ .

3724155,A Polynomial Formed from the Roots of Another Polynomial ad infinitum,"Let $P(x)$ be a monic polynomial of degree $d$ with complex coefficients. Let $r_1(P),r_2(P),\dots, r_d(P)$ denote the set of roots, ordered so that $|r_1(P)| \leq |r_2(P)|\leq\dots\leq |r_d(P)|$ . Define the map $T$ by: $$(TP)(x)=x^d+r_1(P)x^{d-1}+r_2(P)x^{d-2}+\dots+r_d(P),$$ i.e. $TP$ is the monic polynomial whose coefficients are the roots of $P$ . Let us call a monic polynomial periodic if $T^KP=P$ for some $K>0$ . The question is: for any $d>0$ , does there exist a periodic polynomial of degree $d$ , other than the trivial solution $x^d$ ? Remark on the definition of T As pointed out in the comments, the definition of $TP$ is ambiguous if there are two roots $r_i(P)$ and $r_j(P)$ such that $|r_i(P)|=|r_j(P)|$ and $r_i(P)\neq r_j(P)$ . If the roots of $P$ have this property, then you may break the ties however you please. For example, if $P(x)=x^3-x$ , then it is up to you whether to set $r_2(P)=1$ and $r_3(P)=-1$ or $r_2(P)=-1$ and $r_3(P)=1$ . However, either ordering still must have $r_1(P)=0$ , since there is no ambiguity there. Note that the set of polynomials that have this ambiguity has measure zero, so I suspect such considerations will not influence the solution of the problem anyway. Empirical Evidence If $d=1$ then the answer is clearly yes (any $P(x)=x-a$ will do the job, with $a\ne 0$ ). If $d=2$ then $P(x)=x^2+x-2$ is a fixed point of $T$ , so in particular is periodic with period 1. I examined other low degrees by numerical simulation. Note that this requires relaxing the definition of a cycle, since testing for exact equality of floating point numbers is impossible. Thus, for these simulations, the condition $T^KP=P$ was replaced with $\|T^KP-P\|_\infty<\varepsilon$ , with $\varepsilon=10^{-10}$ . In particular, these simulations can only find polynomials $P$ that are periodic up to some fixed error tolerance. The simulation was done by first initializing the coefficients of $P$ using values drawn from a standard normal distribution, and then iteratively applying $T$ 1000 times and checking whether the obtained sequence was eventually periodic (up to error $<\varepsilon$ ). Note that this method might not find all cycles. The periods found thusly for low degrees are: $$
\begin{array}{rc}
d=3 & \text{possible periods}= 1 ; 11 \\
4 & 21 \\
5 & 4 ; 56 \\
6 & 34 ; 44 \\

9 & 256 ; 311 ; 466 \\
10 & 275 ; 336
\end{array}
$$ Furthermore, for degrees $\leq 8$ , all of the simulated sequences eventually became periodic, however this was not true for $d=9$ or $10$ (of course, this does not imply that these sequences never become periodic, just that they did not before the simulation ended).

Moreover, is $L/F$ even Galois? I am not sure if it is possible to use the fundamental theorem of Galois theory.","['permutations', 'galois-representations', 'galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'symmetric-groups']"
