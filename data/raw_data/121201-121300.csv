1818515,Piecewise Functions difficulty,"I am new here. I need a bit of help. Not the best at math. Johnny jumps from a plane at $3000$ feet in the sky. After $35$ seconds, he deploys a parachute. $h =$ height. $t =$ # of seconds after jumping. 
$$h(t) = 
\begin{cases}
-51.5t + 3000 &  \text{if $0 \leq t \leq 35$}\\
-8.9t + 1509 &  \text{if $t > 35$}
\end{cases}
$$
When does Johnny hit the ground? I thought a process of $3000 = -8.9t + 1509$ would work but when I solved for $t$, my results were $-167.53$. I like to picture this on an $x,y$ plane and I do not understand how a negative number could be incorporated in this context. Or perhaps my answer is just wrong altogether? Also for clarification, what in this sense would be an example of functional notation? I assume the explanation would provide the interval notation. I think it would be $(-167.53, 3000)$?","['algebra-precalculus', 'word-problem', 'functions', 'graphing-functions']"
1818516,Computing Curvature of a Connection (Dirac Monopole),"I'm trying to verify some computations in a paper I'm reading and am feeling a little lost. In particular I haven't been able to properly compute curvature of  a connection acting on a line bundle. Here's a specific example (modeled on the Dirac monopole): Consider spherical coordinates related to Euclidean coordinates by $$(t,x,y) = (R\cos \theta, R\cos \psi \sin \theta, R \sin \psi \sin \theta)$$ Take the Hermitian line bundle $L_k$ over $\mathbb{R}^3$ defined by the transition function $g_{\theta 0} = e^{ik\psi}$ on the complement of the $t$-axis from $\theta \neq 0$ to $\theta \neq \pi$. Consider the connection $\bigtriangledown$  on $L_k$ defined by connection matrices $$A_0 = (ik/2)(1+\cos \theta) d\psi$$ $$A_\pi = (ik/2)(-1+\cos \theta)d\psi$$ where the first is defined on $\theta \neq 0$, the second on $\theta \neq \pi$. Let $\phi = ik/2R$. Then, $$\bigtriangledown \phi = d\phi = -(ik/2R^2) dR = -\star((ik/2)d(\cos \theta d \psi)) = \star F_{\bigtriangledown}$$ Its the last equality that troubles me. How does one compute the connection from the matrices? I've also only computed very easy examples of curvature so I'm lost on obtaining $F_\bigtriangledown$ as well. A detailed computation/explanation would be helpful. Thanks.","['mathematical-physics', 'curvature', 'differential-geometry', 'vector-bundles', 'connections']"
1818520,Definition of Cauchy Sequence,"I have a question regarding the definition of a Cauchy sequence of a sequence in a metric space.
The definition I learned and that is consistent with Wikipedia defines
a sequence $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ as a Cauchy sequence if
$$
\forall\, \varepsilon>0 \;\;\exists\, N\in\mathbb{N}\;\;
\forall\, m,n \geq N : d(x_m,x_n)<\varepsilon
$$
If I am not mistaken, there is a simpler, but equivalent definition:
$$
\forall\, \varepsilon>0 \;\; \exists\, N\in\mathbb{N} \;\;
\forall\, m \geq N: d(x_m,x_N)<\varepsilon
$$
This is simpler, because it only has two natural numbers in it instead of three.
This makes it easier to prove, that a given sequence is a Cauchy sequence. Note that the equivalence relies on the triangle inequality. Proof: $(\Rightarrow)$: we simply choose $n=N$. $(\Leftarrow)$: Let $\varepsilon>0$.
Then
$$
\exists\, N\in\mathbb{N}\;\;
\forall\, m \geq N: d(x_m,x_N)<\frac12\varepsilon
$$
This means that for $m,n\geq N$ we have
$$
d(x_m,x_n) \leq d(x_m,x_N)+d(x_n,x_N)
< \frac12\varepsilon +\frac12\varepsilon
= \varepsilon
$$ So here is my question: why did I never encounter the more simple definition before?
Did I make a mistake somewhere? Are there advantages to the common definition, that I don't see? Edit: Often the shortest/simplest definition becomes the standard definition. Why not in this case?","['real-analysis', 'metric-spaces', 'cauchy-sequences']"

At first, finding the domain of the function. Noting that $\sqrt{x + 2} \geq 0 \implies x \geq -2$. Then, solving inequalities for $x + 3 - 2\sqrt{x + 2} \geq 0$ and $x + 27 - 10\sqrt{x + 2} \geq 0$ we get that their domain $D = \mathbb{R}$, because quadratics which arise from those inequalities have exactly one root - $S_1 = \{-1\}$ and $S_2 = \{23\}$. Because all expressions are greater than $0$, I am omitting absolute values. Solving the equation via substitution $t = \sqrt{x + 2}$ we get:
$$\sqrt{x + 3 - 2t} + \sqrt{x + 27 - 10t} = 4$$
$$x + 3 - 2t = 16 - 8\sqrt{x + 27 - 10t} + x + 27 - 10t$$
$$t^2 - 10t + 25 = x + 27 - 10t$$
$$t^2 = x + 2$$
$$x + 2 = x + 2 \implies S = [-2, \infty).$$ But according to my textbook (which I use as a preparation for entrance exams) the solution must be $S = [-1, 23]$, where -1 and 23 are, obviously not coincidently, solutions to the quadratics, which we obtain while solving expressions under square roots.

1818576,Help with solving ODE,"This is actually a part of an SDE problem, which I am having problem to solve. However i think it requires only ODE knowledge to solve. I have $$\mu(u) = x^3 + 3 \int_t^u a \mu(s) ds + 3 \sigma^2 \int_t^u xe^{a(s-t)}ds$$ Now taking derivatives w.r.t $u$ we obtain the following ODE for $\mu$ $$\dot{\mu}(u) = 3a\mu(u) + 3\sigma^2xe^{a(u-t)}$$ And plugging in $u=t$ both integrals cancel, so
$$\mu(t) = x^3$$ The solution to the ODE should be: $$\mu(u) = x^3e^{3a(u-t)}+ \frac{3\sigma^2x}{2a}e^{3a(u-t)}-\frac{3\sigma^2x}{2a}e^{a(u-t)}$$ Now what i have done i first i solve the homogenous equation $$d\mu_h = 3a\mu_h ds$$ I get $$\mu_h = x^3e^{3a(u-t)}$$ Now when solving the rest of the equation i get: $$d\mu = 3\sigma^2xe^{a(u-t)}ds$$ Which could be solved quite straight-forward: $$\mu = 3\sigma^2x \int_t^ue^{a(u-s)}ds = 3\sigma^2x[-\frac{e^{a(u-s)}}{a}]_t^u = 3\sigma^2x \frac{1}{a}(e^{a(u-t)}-1)$$ Now putting them together i do not get the same solution as asked for. i.e. $$\mu_h + \mu = x^3e^{3a(u-t)} + 3\sigma^2x \frac{1}{a}(e^{a(u-t)}-1)$$ Which is not the same as: $$\mu(u) = x^3e^{3a(u-t)}+ \frac{3\sigma^2x}{2a}e^{3a(u-t)}-\frac{3\sigma^2x}{2a}e^{a(u-t)}$$ Does anyone know where the error in reasoning is?",['ordinary-differential-equations']

1818627,Is it always possible to always choose coordinates so that the curvature is locally zero?,"I would have thought that this was completely possible as manifolds are so ""soft"" and the only problems would have been global ones (like Gauss Bonnett etc). But I've never seen the phrase ""of course it is always possible to find coordinites in an some open neighbourhood around a point so that the curvature is zero"". Also people seem to be very excited about normal coordinites as they have vanishing curvature at a single point, so now I am starting to suspect perhaps it is NOT true. But maybe it is and it's just not very useful so nobody cares. Thoughts? Edit: I initially thought that vanishing christoffel symbols implied vanishing curvature but this is not true at all.

Show that $A$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all (infinite) binary sequences: $C = \{ b_1, b_2, b_3,...  | b_i \in \{ 0,1 \} \}$. To do this I tried to assign each number in $\Bbb N$ a unique binary sequence (e.g. $5 = 001, 9 = 101, 59 = 001101$). Thus, any subset of $\Bbb N$ would translate to a unique sequence of binary numbers in $C$. This has a few issues, however. A subset of $\Bbb N$ could be finite, and my method would thus translate that subset to a finite binary sequence in $C$, which can't happen because $C$ is the set of all infinite binary sequences. How do I correct this? Just hints please. I'm also running into a notational issue, which I would like some clarification on. I'm not sure I understand the notation used for $C$; are $b_1, b_2, ...$ infinite sequences themselves, or do they each individually represent either a 0 or a 1?

that
$$\hat{\tau} = \frac{1}{2}(\hat{a}^2 + \hat{b}^2),$$

1819302,Are there parts of Integral Calculus that just *have* to be memorized?,"Note : In this question I speak more from a calculation/operational point of view,  as opposed to a more theoretical (Analysis) point of view. When studying Differential Calculus, I found that there was very little that I had to memorize . Virtually all calculation aspects, such as finding derivatives etc., and some theorems, could all be derived on the spot through basic methods. As examples, through basic implicit differentiation, one could prove the inverse function theorem, within a few lines. $$\text{Inverse Function Theorem}\ \ \ \ (f^{-1})'(x) = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}$$ Or if I wanted to find $\dfrac{d}{dx}\ \tan^{-1}(x)$, I could use the inverse function theorem and with the help of a trigonometric identity find the derivative quite easily. I didn't have to memorize $\dfrac{d}{dx}\ \tan^{-1}(x) = \dfrac{1}{1+x^2}$. In fact, apart from the derivatives of $\sin(x)$, $\sinh(x)$ and $\cos(x)$, $\cosh(x)$, I didn't memorize any of the other derivatives for trigonometric functions, I would just re-derive them using basic differentiation rules each time. However I noticed that when studying Integral Calculus, there tends to be a lot more that one just has to commit to memory . For example if I wanted to evaluate the following integral $$\int \dfrac{1}{1+x^2}\ dx$$ The only way I could ever evaluate the integral, would be if I knew $\dfrac{d}{dx}\ \tan^{-1}(x) = \dfrac{1}{1+x^2}$, which would require that I had memorized the derivative (something I tried my best not to do when studying differential calculus). When studying Mathematics, for the most part (and within reason of course) I try my best never to memorize what I can re-derive/prove. I've found that this approach helps improve my skills, and pushes me to search for the deepest possible understanding. But it seems that there are some things, that just have to be committed to memory to be able to make any sort of progress, and this troubles me quite a bit, as I'm not sure as to what I should be just memorizing , and what I should really be working to get the best understanding on. Furthermore Integration is a very heuristic process, whereas Differentiation is a more algorithmic process. Generally we try to get integrals into forms we know of already so that we can evaluate them (with the exception of the Risch algorithm), or it would be impossible to evaluate them by any other means. Wouldn't that require one to memorize the various types of possible integrals? First off, am I looking at this wrong? Are there ways one can reprove results, or evaluate integrals, in a manner that doesn't require one to just memorize and recall a list of formula's like a parrot? What aspects of Integral Calculus would you say, just have to be memorized , i.e. what results in Integral Calculus are close to impossible to re-derive or prove on the spot? Where does one draw the line, between what should be looked at long and hard for the deepest possible understanding, and what should just be memorized ? Lastly, correct me if I'm wrong, but as one makes the transition into higher mathematics (analysis and beyond), that there are some things that you just have to commit to memory , to be able to make any sort of progress?","['derivatives', 'integration', 'soft-question', 'calculus']"

1819327,Do functions all have an infinite number of limits?,"I originally understood limits to be where functions run towards $\pm\infty$ as they approach some specific $x$ value and where they run towards (but never touch) some specific value (like $0$) as $x$ approaches infinity, thus making that value impossible to reach (a limit a function can't cross, in a Zeno's paradox -like way). Now that I'm beginning to actually study calculus, I'm seeing that limits are somehow more broad. Specifically, I now see limits are always referred to in relation to some stated $x$ value being approached (as indicated by the conventional notation: $\lim_{x\to p} f(x)$). But, this makes it seem to me like you can pick any value (any $p$) you want, that the limit is simply whatever value the function approaches as $x$ approaches whatever value you decided to pick. Wouldn't that mean functions have an infinite number of limits? (You can find an infinite number of points on a line/curve, after all.) If so, what's so limiting about ""limits"" then? Also, wouldn't this make limits the most stupidly obvious things? For example: $f(x)=x^2$ will obviously approach $4$ as you pick $x$ values arbitrarily closer and closer to $2$ ($1.9, 1.99. 1.999, 1.9999, 1.99999,$ etc )? If functions don't have an infinite number of limits, than how do you recognize which values for $x$ to approach make sense? Obviously, preconceived notions can screw with actually learning how a thing works because it can frame the information you're trying to integrate within a meaningless perspective, but figuring out how to shed those preconceived notions can be hard when you don't understand where you've gone wrong in the first place. ...oh, god, someone help me.

1819361,Is there always a Minimal Product Measure,"I am studying measure theory and I have a question concerning the wikipedia-article ""Product measure"". I already asked on the Wikipedia-""talk""-page but so far noone answered. The problem concerns the ""minimal product measure"". I copy the following from the Wikipedia talk page: Take Omega to be any uncountable set. Take Sigma to be the power set of Omega. Take mu to be the measure taking any countable set to zero and any uncountable set to infinity. Then (Omega, Sigma, mu) is a (very ugly) measure space (far from being sigma-finite). Now I take the product of Omega with itself and consider the possible product measures on the product sigma algebra. The product sigma algebra contains all sets of the form A times B. Apart from that I dont care how the product sigma algebra looks like. By the definition in the article every product measure satisfies mu(A times B)= mu(A) times mu (B). In particular mu(Omega times Omgea) will be infinity for any product measure. Now, consider the maximal (Caratheodory) product measure. By construction this maximal measure takes only the values zero and infinity. Now, lets go on to the minimal measure. The construction of the minimal measure mentioned in the article says that the minimal measure of a set is the sup over all subsets with finite maximal measure. But every set with finite measure has measure zeri. So in my example this minimal measure will be constantly zero on all measurable sets. In particular, the minimal measure of Omega times Omega will be zero. And so it is not a product measure anymore. Is there a mistake in my argument does the existence of the minimal measure rely on some properties of the measure space which my (ugly) measure space does not have?

Here is a screenshot of the slide for reference: Feel free to scroll down near the end for a slide describing what the Newton's algorithm is doing in more detail. My confusion comes from line 6 of the algorithm, the one about the line search. From my understanding of his explanation, the idea is that you increase the value of $\eta_k$ and each time you increase it, you compute your cost function $f$. The moment you get to the minimum, you stop and you use that $\eta_k$. I think this $\eta_k$ is essentially the learning rate you need to immediately go to the minimum. But then if that is the case, why would you need any iterations?  Wouldn't the linear search mean that after one step of the algorithm you're at the minimum? Second Question I have another question that I would love to have answered if possible. So in the previous slide, the professor shows that for the newton's algorithm for linear regression, the $\theta$ after one step is equal to the solution you get from the method of least squares in matrix form. In other words, he says that  you only need one step of the algorithm to get the optimal $\theta$. If this is the case, what is the point of showing us the iterative algorithm in the slide above?

1819527,Computing $\underset{x^2+y^2+(z-2)^2\le 1}{\int\int\int}{1\over x^2+y^2+z^2}dxdydz$ in Spherical Coordinates,"Compute: $\underset{x^2+y^2+(z-2)^2\le 1}{\int\int\int}{1\over x^2+y^2+z^2}dxdydz$. Hint given : show that $\cos \theta> {r^2+3\over 4r}$ $1<r<3$ What I already did : I shift the unit sphere two coordinates upwards. With $z=r\cos \theta$, assisted by a general drawn line from the sphere (suppose from $a=(x,y,z)$) to the origin, we get that $x^2+y^2$ equals $a$'s projection on the $z$-axis, which by simple computations equals $(r\sin\theta)^2$. Then : $$x^2+y^2+z^2-4z+4=r^2-4r\cos\theta+4\le 1\Rightarrow \cos \theta \ge {r^2+3\over 4r}$$ (How is the strong inequality achieved? I tried showing it but the RHS are variables.) Obviously $1<r<3$. The change of variables is injective and surjective using the inequality in the hint, and the remaining term is $r^2\sin \theta$, but I have no how $\theta$ acts in a single round. I find myself starting from $\theta=0$ (r=1), and again $\theta =0 $ for $r=3$. Do you have any idea how one can proceed from here? While I do understand how to bound the variables in the unit sphere(or, obviously any sphere centered at the origin), here it all seems to collapse. Final answer is told to be : $\pi(2-{3\over 2}\log 3)$, for those who are interested or need it.","['multivariable-calculus', 'indefinite-integrals', 'integration']"

I know that $R^np_{2,*}\Lambda(L)=0$ if $n\neq g=:dimX$ and $R^gp_{2,*}\Lambda(L)=i_*O_{K(L)}$ where $K(L)$ is the kernel of the map $\phi_L:X\to \widehat{X}$ and $i$ its inclusion into X.

Find the integral values of $a$ for which $f$ is onto(surjective).

1819728,Do Hausdorff spaces that aren't completely regular appear in practice?,"Completely regular spaces include all metrizable spaces, topological vector spaces, and topological groups in general. In fact, they are exactly the uniformizable spaces .
Complete regularity is hereditary, ie. a subspace of a completely regular space is also completely regular, and it's preserved by arbitrary products. The completely regular spaces are in fact a reflective subcategory of $\mathrm{Top}$, as can be seen from another characterization: they are exactly the spaces for which the real functions determine the topology, ie. the topology is the initial topology for the set of real continuous functions.
Finally, every subspace of a compact Hausdorff space is completely regular, and conversely, every ($T_0$) completely regular space embeds universally into a compact Hausdorff space via the Stone-Čech compactification. There are of course many natural examples of topologies that aren't completely regular. The two that I know of are Zariski topology, which is $T_1$, but not Hausdorff, and Alexandrov topology , which is a natural topology on a poset that can't even be $T_1$ in an interesting way. What I haven't seen before are examples of Hausdorff topologies that aren't completely regular, and weren't constructed specifically for the purpose of being a counterexample. Considering how widely topology is applied (and how little I know of it) I'm assuming there are some, and I'd be interested in hearing how often they appear. The strengthening of this question to normal spaces seems to have elementary and satisfactory answers: the topology of pointwise convergence on $\mathbb R$ isn't normal (witnessing the fact that normal spaces aren't closed under products).","['general-topology', 'separation-axioms']"

1819791,Diagonal morphism of regular variety is a regular embedding,"Let $X$ be a regular $k-$variety (i.e. all of its local rings are regular) of pure dimension $d$. Then I would like to show that the diagonal morphism $X\rightarrow X\times_k X$ is a regular embedding of codimension $d$, to be able to prove exercise $12.2.M$ in Ravi Vakil's ""Foundations of Algebraic Geometry"". The preceding exercise shows that any closed embedding $Y \rightarrow Z$ with $Y$ regular and $Z$ regular at all points in the image of $Y$ is a regular embedding. I'd like to use this (particularly because Vakil lists $12.2.M$ as a consequence of the preceding exercise), only I'm having trouble proving that $X \times_k X$ is regular at points on the diagonal. Thus what I would really like to know is: Let $X$ be a regular $k-$variety. Then $X \times_k X$ is regular at points on the diagonal. Since $X$ is finite type, I can explicitly describe the local rings of $X$ as quotients of local rings of affine space, and use the kernels involved to explicitly describe the local rings of $X \times_k X$ as quotients of the local rings of $X$, but I can't then do very much with this, and I'm not sure that this is even the right approach. Edit: Some of the answers suggest that regularity is not enough to show that the diagonal is a regular embedding. One provides an example of a regular scheme $W$ where $W \times W$ isn't regular at the diagonal, so the approach taken in this question is certainly flawed.","['schemes', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"
1819802,Intersection of hypersphere and hyperplane question,"It's strange that I haven't found a nicely explained example of this on the Internet, since it seems like a fairly standard example.  However, I'm trying to intersect a hypersphere and a hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^n$.  The equations are: $$||x - C||^2 = R^2$$ for the hypersphere, where $C$ is the center and $R$ is the radius, and $$\vec{v} \cdot \vec{n} = D$$ where $\vec{n} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a unit vector.  From what I can tell, I do the following: First I need a point $p$ on the hyperplane, which I can obtain.  I then compute the distance between the center of the hypersphere and the hyperplane, which is given by: $$ \rho = (C - p)\cdot \vec{n}$$ The intersection is nonempty if $-R < \rho < R$, if I am correct, and the intersection is an $n-1$ dimensional hypersphere.  Then, the radii and center of the hypersphere are given by: $$ r = \sqrt{R^2 - \rho^2}$$
$$\bar{c} = C - \rho \vec{n}$$ First of all, is that correct?  Second, I want to find a point on the intersecting hypersphere.  I've used generalized spherical coordinates to find such a point, but it is in the original space (and thus has $n$ coordinates).  Something about that seems very wrong to me, since I appear to have an extra dimension.  How do I go about finding points on the intersecting hypersphere?

We have $f(x) - p_1(x) = (x-a)(x-b) \frac{f''(\zeta(x))}{2}$ for some $\zeta(x) \in (a,b)$ so by the integral mean value theorem $$\int_a^b f(x) \,dx - \frac{b-a}{2}[f(a)+f(b)] = \int_a^b (x-a)(x-b)\frac{f''(\zeta(x))}{2} \, dx = $$ $$f''(\eta) \int_a^b \frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{2} \,dx \text{ for some } \eta \in (a,b)$$ and then computing the integral gives the result. The derivation I know for the error term for the Lagrange interpolant (in general) involves repeated applications of Rolle's theorem. In particular, the proof of existence of suitable $\zeta(x)$ is non-constructive so we don't know that $\zeta(x)$ is continuous, which I think is a problem for applying the integral mean value theorem since $f''\circ \zeta$ may not be continuous even though $f''$ is. I've since seen this proof in a few different places and all of them pass over this issue without comment. Why is it that we can apply the integral mean value theorem here?

Thus, it seems we could have at most the following types of set systems for a space which has at most the cardinality of the continuum. $\underset{f}{\cup}$, $\underset{f}{\cap}$ (Boolean) algebra $\underset{c}{\cup}$, $\underset{f}{\cap}$/$\underset{c}{\cap}$, $\underset{f}{\cup}$ (slightly stronger than a $\lambda$ system) $\underset{c}{\cup}$, $\underset{c}{\cup}$ $\sigma-$algebra $\underset{u/a}{\cup}$, $\underset{c}{\cup}$/ $\underset{u/a}{\cap}$, $\underset{c}{\cup}$  ????? Related: Is there a difference between allowing only countable unions/intersections, and allowing arbitrary (possibly uncountable) unions/intersections? $\underset{u/a}{\cup}$, $\underset{f}{\cap}$/ $\underset{u/a}{\cap}$, $\underset{f}{\cup}$ systems of open sets (topologies)/systems of closed sets resepctively $\underset{u/a}{\cup}$, $\underset{u/a}{\cap}$ Alexandroff topologies The motivation for the set axioms of a Boolean algebra are obvious, because they basically constitute ""closure under elementary logical operations"". For example, all truth functions are well-defined given a Boolean algebra, as is propositional logic. The motivation for a $\sigma-$algebra is also fairly clear to me -- it is essentially the ""countable closure/extension"" of a regular algebra, and this property allows us to define countably additive set functions, and along with that obtain closure under pointwise limits of functions as well as the monotone convergence theorem, the two foundations on which integration theory is based. It is also clear that such additivity could not be extended to the cardinality of the continuum, since the uncountable sum of any non-zero numbers is infinite. But why do open/closed set systems turn out to be useful? How are these uncountable axioms applied fruitfully in topology? As far as I am aware, for example with stochastic processes, we usually rely on some separability/first/second-countability properties in order to be able to apply most topologies fruitfully -- i.e. some reduction of the ""uncountable"" axiom to an essentially countable property. So why not study only metric spaces? Moreover, the study of limits is only defined/sensible once we have the T1 and T2 separation axioms, so the claim that we study set systems of type 5. in order to study limits seems unjustified to me; at the very least we need that in combination with some separation axioms. Also, why do we study set systems of type 5., but not of types 4. or 6.? What is the essential property that type 5. set systems capture (in the way that type 1. and type 3. systems capture)? The best discussion of this topic which I have found so far: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19152/why-is-a-topology-made-up-of-open-sets I agree with the OP of that question however, that the top-voted answer is more of a justification for the notion of metric space (which are always separable in some sense due to the density of the rationals in the reals). The discussion of how notions of limit really seem to be more of a consequence of a notion of ""Hausdorfness"" is here: Why not just study the consequences of Hausdorff axiom? What do statements like, ""The arbitrary union of open sets is open,"" gain us? I would also like to point out that the axiomatization of topology in terms of neighborhood systems, plus the Hausdorff axiom, seems to be more relevant to understanding the concept of ""limit"" than the axioms of a general topological space. And again, I don't see why we would need uncountably many neighborhoods of a given point to define it as the limit of something, since countably many neighborhoods always suffices (at least in the metric space setting). Motivation: The motivation for this question came from some rumination about stochastic processes. Namely, the reason why their study can be so difficult is that we are confined to using set systems of type 3., which are only countably closed, whereas we are studying uncountably many random variables. In order to get any degree of meaningful results, we therefore rely on having some degree of ""separability/regularity"" properties that essentially allow us to reduce to the countable case where it counts (for instance with regards to the existence of regular conditional distributions). So as frustrating as it may be trying to study uncountable objects with set systems of type 3., it is clear to me why we can not replace such set systems with any of type 4, 5, or 6, again so that integration and probability are tractable. So then I thought ""oh so we must use topologies because we need uncountability for some reason"". But then I thought about how almost all topologies which I am aware of/use are in some way ""separable"" or ""first/second-countable"", which basically constitutes reducing back to the countable case, the same way we do with stochastic processes. I.e. there is no fundamental gain in generality, since the only cases of uncountable objects we can/do study are those special cases which can be reduced back to the countable case in some meaningful way. I'm really at a loss as to why an uncountable closure axiom would be at all useful, and why we would want only finite closure for the complementary operation, rather than some type of infinite closure. I feel like it has to have something to do with the distinction between ""discrete"" and ""continuous"" spaces, which leads us back again to the study of stochastic processes, and the distinction between ""discrete"" and ""continuous"" time. Namely, for a set with countable cardinality, like the natural numbers, the power set coincides with the reasonable choices for sigma algebra and topology. In other words, both concepts are clearly only needed when moving to the uncountable case, where they don't necessarily coincide with the power set, i.e. we can gain a concept of ""continuousness"", rather than the ""discreteness"" which we are necessarily confined to with set systems of countable sets. Again, the purpose of $\sigma-$algebra in this case is clear to me, since it is actually only closed under countable set operations, but now I really don't understand why we are able to use the uncountable set axiom profitably in open/closed set systems, especially since in all cases which I am aware of we have some sort of ""separability"" which reduces the concept of topology to a countable one. So why not define the concept which we actually use, which is countable, not uncountable in nature?","['math-history', 'soft-question', 'measure-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'general-topology']"

Edit 6/10/16: Progress?
If we define the operator $Ty(x) = e^x + \frac{y(x^2)}{2},$ then $|Ty(x) - Tz(x)| = 1/2|y(x^2) - z(x^2)|,$ which might be a contraction map (not exactly sure how)... then we could use a fixed point theorem to conclude that for some guess $y_0,$ the series  $T^N y_0(x) = \frac{y_0(x^{2^N})}{2} + \sum_{n=0}^N \frac{\exp(x^{2^n})}{2^n}$ converges to $y(x)$? Could anybody confirm if one is allowed to claim this
$$ |Ty(x) - Tz(x)| = 1/2|y(x^2) - z(x^2)|
$$
 is a contraction map?  On one hand, it look like
$$ |Ty - Tz| = 1/2|y - z|,
$$
but on the other, the arguments are not the same for $y, z$ on both sides of the equation.",['analysis']
1819994,Obtaining a nice map to a curve by using blowups,"Let $X$ be a smooth and projective variety over a finite field (separated, finite type, integral). Then after performing a number of blowups I should be able to find a proper surjective map from $X$ to a smooth curve, where the generic fibre is smooth and geometrically integral. My question is really: how? I assume we can use projection away from a hyperplane, yielding a rational map from $X$ to the projective line (if I'm not making any dimension mistakes here). After performing a number of blowups this becomes an everywhere-defined map (right?). But how can I make sure the generic fibre is smooth and geometrically integral?

This seems to be a pretty straightforward Negative Binomial distribution problem, with X~NegBin(k,0.5) where k is the number of ""successes,"" and I figured since they are equally likely, asking whether the Xth child is a boy or girl can be interchanged, so for numbers 1 and 2, they can just get plugged right into the equation for Neg.

All possible subgroups of S\A = 2^(n-m)   (It is important to save the empty set so with that we get : $(A,X \in A)$ as pairs!!) So we get a total of $(2^m -1)\cdot(2^{n-m})$ subgroups of $S$ that are not foreign to $A$. For every group that has $m$ elements, there exist ${n \choose m}$ subgroups.
