2162141,Reconciliating the definitions of derivative for a curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$,"It seems to me that two very different definitions of derivative permeate the literature: in introductory calculus, the derivative $f'(x)$ of a (differentiable) function $f:U\subseteq\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ at a point $x\in\mathbb{R}$ is a real number . When one moves on to multivariable calculus, the derivative $Df(x)$ of a function $f:U\subseteq\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ at a point $x\in\mathbb{R}^m$ is a linear mapping $Df(x):\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$. However, when one talk about curves $\gamma:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$, we are already in the domain of multivariable calculus, so the derivative $\gamma'(x)=D\gamma(x)$ of $\gamma$ at a point $x\in\mathbb{R}$ should be a linear mapping $D\gamma(x):\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$. But usually I see people using $\gamma'(x)$ as an element of $\mathbb{R}^n$. How to reconcile those? My guess is that $\mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}^n)\simeq M_{1\times n}(\mathbb{R})\simeq\mathbb{R}^n$, so people just identify $\gamma'(x)$ with its tuple in $\mathbb{R}^n$, just like sometimes one speaks of a matrix as a linear map or a linear map as being a matrix.","['multivariable-calculus', 'curves', 'differential-geometry']"
2162145,All continuous $f$ such that $\sin(f(x)) = \sin(x)$,"Question Find all continuous $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $\sin(f(x)) = \sin(x)$ $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$. Here is my thinking for this problem: Since $\sin(k\pi) = 0, \forall k \in \mathbb{Z}$ we require an $f$ which is an integer multiple of $\pi$ at integer multiples of $\pi$ and since $\sin$ is $2\pi$ periodic we require the 'translation' associated with periodicity to be an even multiple of $\pi$. Because of continuity we require a linear solution and due to the fact that $\sin$ is odd, we require the coefficient of the $x$ term to be $1$. Thus the only solutions take the form: $f(x) = x + 2m\pi, m \in \mathbb{Z}$. My question is, have I missed any solutions? How might I know that these are the only ones?","['continuity', 'real-analysis', 'functional-equations']"
2162178,The origin is not in the convex hull $\Rightarrow$ the set lies in a hemisphere?,"I am trying to understand the proof of the following claim: Let $f:A \subseteq \mathbb{S}^n \to \mathbb{S}^n$ be an $L$-Lipschitz* map (with $L <1$). Then $f(A)$ is contained in the interior of a hemisphere. *The distance on $\mathbb{S}^n$ can be either the intrinsic one or the extrinsic (Euclidean) one, it does not matter. In the standard proof I have found here (pg 7, lemma 2.8), the author shows that the convex hull of $f(A)$ in the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ does not contain the origin. Why is this enough to deduce the claim? Edit: As commented by Jyrki Lahtonen, if a convex hull of a set $B$ is closed , then it is the intersection of all closed half-spaces containing $B$. From this the following key-lemma follows: Lemma: A closed convex set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which does not contain the origin $\bar O$ is contained in a closed half-space which does not contain $\bar O$. In particular, $B$ is contained in the interior of a half-space whose boundary does contain $\bar O$. Proof: Suppose $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is closed and convex. $$\bar O \notin B=\operatorname{Conv}(B)=\cap_{\text{half-space } \, H, B \subseteq H} H$$ so there exist a closed half-space $H$ containing $B$ which does not contain the origin. $H$ can be written in the form of $H:=\{ y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}| \langle y,v \rangle \ge  c\}$ where $v \in \mathbb{R}^{n},c \in \mathbb{R}$. $\bar O \notin H \Rightarrow c>0$. Thus, $$ B \subseteq \{ y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}| \langle y,v \rangle \ge  c > 0\} $$ is contained in the interior of the half-space $D=\{ y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}| \langle y,v \rangle \ge  0\}, \bar O \in \operatorname{bd} D$. Note: The lemma is false if $B$ is not closed. Take for instance $$B=\{ (x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 \,| \, x \ge 0, y \ge 0 \} \setminus {(0,0)}$$ $B$ is convex, $\bar O \notin B$, but any closed half-space containing $B$, must contain $\bar O$. However, $B$ is contained in the interior of a half-space whose boundary does contain $\bar O$, the halh-space $\{ (x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 \,| \, x + y \ge 0 \}$. The lemma implies the claim for when $f(A)$ is 
compact: This still leaves open the question whether or not, the claim holds in more general case. Proof: First, observe that compactness of $f(A)$ implies closedness of $\operatorname{Conv}(f(A))$. So, by the lemma there exist a closed half-space $H$ containing $f(A)$ which does not contain the origin. $H$ can be written in the form of $H:=\{ y \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}| \langle y,v \rangle \ge  c > 0\}$ where $v \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1},c \in \mathbb{R}$. Thus, $$ f(A) \subseteq \{ y \in \mathbb{S}^n| \langle y,v \rangle \ge  c > 0\} $$ is contained in the interior of a hemisphere $D=\{ y \in \mathbb{S}^n| \langle y,v \rangle \ge  0\} $, as we wanted.","['convex-geometry', 'lipschitz-functions', 'convex-hulls', 'geometry']"

2162191,Closed form for the series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k \ln \left( \tanh \frac{\pi k x}{2} \right)$,"Is there a closed form for: $$f(x)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k \ln \left( \tanh \frac{\pi k x}{2} \right)=2\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2n+1}\frac{1}{e^{\pi (2n+1) x}+1}$$ This sum originated from a recent question , where we have: $$f(1)= -\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^1 \ln \left( \ln \frac{1}{x} \right) \frac{dx}{1+x^2}=\ln \frac{\Gamma (3/4)}{\pi^{1/4}}$$ If we differentiate w.r.t. $x$, we obtain: $$f'(x)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{\pi k}{\sinh \pi k x}$$ There is again a closed form for $x=1$ (obtained numerically): $$f'(1)=-\frac{1}{4}$$ So, is there a closed form or at least an integral definition for arbitrary $x>0$? The series converges absolutely (numerically at least): $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty \ln \left( \tanh \frac{\pi k x}{2} \right)< \infty$$ Thus, this series can also be expressed as a logarithm of an infinite product: $$f(x)=\ln \prod_{k=1}^\infty \tanh (\pi k x) - \ln \prod_{k=1}^\infty \tanh  \left( \pi (k-1/2) x \right)$$ $$e^{f(x)}=  \prod_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\tanh (\pi k x)}{\tanh  \left( \pi (k-1/2) x \right)}$$ This by the way leads to: $$\prod_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\tanh (\pi k)}{\tanh  \left( \pi (k-1/2) \right)}=\frac{\pi^{1/4}}{\Gamma(3/4)}$$ I feel like there is a way to use the infinite product form for $\sinh$ and $\cosh$: $$\sinh (\pi x)=\pi x \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1+\frac{x^2}{n^2} \right)$$ $$\cosh (\pi x)=\prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1+\frac{x^2}{(n-1/2)^2} \right)$$","['infinite-product', 'definite-integrals', 'sequences-and-series', 'closed-form']"

&= 2(\boldsymbol P_i(\boldsymbol a) - b_i)\cdot \frac{\partial \boldsymbol P_i}{\partial a_i}(\boldsymbol a)

2162398,Proving a set is not Lebesgue measurable,"I am looking for a non measurable set. I found a set I am almost sure it is not measurable, but am unable to prove it.
First we define $f:[0,1]\to [0,9]$ by $$f(0.a_1a_2a_3...)=\begin{cases}\lim_{n\to\infty}(1/n\sum_{i=1}^n a_i) &\text{if the limit exists } \\0 &\text{if the limit does not exist}\end{cases}$$
That means $f$ gives the mean value of the decimals, for example $f(1/3)=3$ and $ f(1/7)=4.5$
Remark: if a number has 2 decimal representations ($0.2$ and $0.1999...$) we define $f(x)=0$ to avoid problems. Now we define $$A=\{x\in[0,1]:f(x)=4.5\}$$
I am convinced that both $A$ and $A^c$ have an outer measure of $1$, and thus are not measurable, but I can't prove it. Here is what makes me believe their exterior measure is $1$: For $A$: -$A$ is uncountable (necessary for a non zero measure) -$A$ is dense (necessary for an outer measure of $1$) proof: we can take the first n decimals as we want, and make the limit converge to 4.5 by alternating 4's and 5's (for example to find a number in $A$ between 0.2 and 0.201 we can take 0.20454545...) -We can chose half of the decimals (that means $a_1,a_3,...$) of a number as we wish, and then chose the others to make sure the number is in $A$. This implies $A$ is uncountable, but is much stronger. Proof: simply make $a_{2k}+a_{2k+1}=9$ -If we take a number randomly (that means by choosing $a_1,a_2,...$ randomly), we have a probability of $1$ that this number is in $A$, which means ""almost all the numbers"" are in $A$. For $A^c$: -$A^c$ is uncountable -$A^c$ is dense. Proof: the numbers with a finite decimal representation are dense in $[0,1]$ and not in $A$ -We can chose any non 1 proportion of the decimals as we wish and still make sure the number is not in $A$. For example, we can set all the decimals $a_k$ such that $k\neq 0$ mod n, and change only the decimals $a_k$ such that $k=0$ mod n, and make sure the number is not in $A$. This means you can chose ""almost all the decimals"" as you wish, and $A^c$ must be ""very big"". Proof: set all decimals you are allowed to modify to $0$. If the number is not in $A$, you are done. If the number is in $A$, set all the decimals you can modify to $1$. As this proportion was not $0$, you have increased $f(x)$, thus it is no longer equal to $4.5$, and the number is not in $A$. That are all properties of $A$ and $A^c$ that may be important for the outer measure I was able to find. For approximations of the outer measure, I only have the trivial properties that they are at most $1$, and their sum is at least $1$. Can anyone prove or disprove the fact $A$ is measurable? Or can someone find a better upper/lower bound for the outer measures of $A$ and $A^c$?

I will refer to them as $(1)$ and $(2)$ respectively. To prove $(1)$: Assume $(A\cap B=A) \land(A\cup B=B)$. Let $x\in A$. Then $x\in A\cup B=B$ so $A\subseteq B$. Or in another way, Assume $(A\cap B=A) \land(A\cup B=B)$. Let $x\in A$. Then $x\in A\cap B$ so $x\in A$ and $x\in B$. So $A\subseteq B$. To prove $(2)$ we have to prove the following four things assuming $A\subseteq B$ and knowing $A\subseteq B$ means that $x\in A\implies x\in B$: $$A\cap B\subseteq A\tag{3}$$
$$A\cap B\supseteq A\tag{4}$$
$$A\cup B\subseteq B\tag{5}$$
$$A\cup B\supseteq B\tag{6}$$ To prove $(3)$: Let $x\in A\cap B$. Then $x\in A$, so $(3)$ is proven. To prove $(4)$: Let $x\in A$. Now we know from $A\subseteq B$, that $x\in B$, so $x\in A$ and $x\in B$ so $A\subseteq A\cap B$. To prove $(5)$: Let $x\in A\cup B$. Then $x\in A$ or $x\in B$, but $x\in A$ implies $x\in B$ so either ways $x\in B$. Hence $x\in A\cup B\implies x\in B$. To prove $(6)$: Let $x\in B$, then $x\in B\cup A$, so $B\subseteq A\cup B$.

Then $\exists$ set $A\subseteq R$ which contains infinitely many elements, such that $I=\langle A\rangle$. Let $A=\{a_1, a_2,...,a_n,...\}$, then we $\langle a_1 \rangle\subset \langle a_1, a_2 \rangle\subset...\subset \langle a_1, a_1,...,a_n,... \rangle$, which is an infinite chain of nested ideals. This is a contradiction, thus $I$ must be finitely generated.

Then, $\forall a_i\in A$, for $1\le i\le n$, $\langle a_1\rangle \subset \langle a_1, a_2 \rangle \subset... \langle a_1, a_2,..., a_n \rangle$, which is a finite chain of nested ideals.

What I see is that an atlas is said to be maximal atlas if it is not contained in any other atlas. What does this containment actually mean? Let $\mathcal{A}$  be an atlas and $\mathcal{B}$ be another atlas. When do we say that $\mathcal{A}$ is contained in $\mathcal{B}$? I was not able to find definition of this. Another confusion is about union of atlases. Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be two atlases. What do we mean by union of atlases? Is it just the union $\{(U,\phi)_{\phi\in \mathcal{A}},(V,\psi)_{\psi\in \mathcal{B}}\}$? It may happen that this union is not an atlas i.e., there can be two charts $\phi_\mathcal{A}$ and $\psi_{\mathcal{B}}$such that $\phi_{\mathcal{A}}$ and $\psi_{\mathcal{B}}$    are not compatible. By maximal atlas do I mean an atlas $\mathcal{A}$ such that for any other atlas $\mathcal{B}$, the union as above is not an atlas?

2163361,"What are these 3D shapes, if anything?","I'm trying to think of a 3D analogue to the ellipse, but not the ellipsoid. A circle is constructed with a piece of string anchored at the radius. So the distance from center to the curve is always the same. An ellipse is constructed with a piece of string ending at two foci. The sum of the two lines is always the same. For 3D, I can think of 3 ways: Three points define a plane. These are our 3 foci. Make lines from each of them that meet at some point on the curve of the shape. But the 3 lines must always sum to the same number. (I'm pretty sure this is not and ellipsoid, but possibly, if 2 foci coincide, it would be an ellipsoid?) Three points define a plane. These are our 3 foci. Make lines from each of them that meet at some point on the curve of the shape. This also defines a tetrahedon. The surface area of the tetrahedron must be constant. Same as above, except we want the volume of the tetrahedron to be constant. What do those shapes look like? Maybe someone knows how to program a 3D model, or graph it somehow?

2163373,Maximum A Priori Estimate of Beta-Bernoulli,"Suppose I have a d-dimensional vector $x$ whose components $x_i$ are each i.i.d. Bernoulli with some $\theta_i$. $\theta$ is then the vector of parameters and

I want to estimate $\theta$ with the Maximum A Priori (MAP) method with a $Beta(2, 2)$ prior for each $\theta_i$. So far what I have is this, ignoring normalization constants: $$
p(\theta|x) \propto p(x|\theta)p(\theta) $$ $$
p(\theta|x) \propto \prod_{i=1}^d\theta_i^{x_i}(1-\theta_i)^{(1 - x_i)} \theta_i(1-\theta_i)

p(\theta|x) \propto \prod_{i=1}^d\theta_i^{x_i +1}(1-\theta_i)^{(2 - x_i)}

$$
p(\theta|x) \propto \prod_{i=1}^d Beta(x_i + 2, 3 - x_i)
$$ At this point I choose the mode for each individual Beta distribution, which is $$\frac{x_i + 1}3$$ and so the MAP estimate is $$p(\theta|x) \propto \prod_{i=1}^d \frac{x_i + 1}3$$ That's only using one vector from my dataset though.

2163438,A tennis club has $2n$ members. We want to pair up the members by twos for singles match. How many ways may we pair up all the members of the club?,"This question is from Kenneth P. Bogart's book ""Combinatorics through guided discovery"" which can be freely downloaded at https://math.dartmouth.edu/news-resources/electronic/kpbogart/FDL-bogart/kpbogart-FDL.tar.gz The question sounds very simple and, I thought the solution was $C_{(2n, 2)}$ which after some simple algebra yields $C_{(2n,2)} = n(2n - 1)$. For a simple (and manually verifiable) case of 10 members, thus $n = 5$, it leads to the answer 45 ways which is the same result as the one obtained from $C_{(10,2)}$. The answer in the book bears no resemblence to that. Specifically, quoting from the book 12. A tennis club has $2n$ members. We want to pair up the members by
twos for singles matches. (a) In how many ways may we pair up all the members of the club?
(Hint: consider the cases of 2, 4, and 6 members.) Solution: Suppose we list the people in the club in some way (perhaps in alphabetical order), and keep that list for the remainder of the problem. Take the ﬁrst person from the list and pair that person with any of the $2n − 1$ remaining people. Now take the next unpaired person from the list and pair that person with any of the remaining $2n − 3$ unpaired people. Continuing in this way, once k pairs have been selected, take the next unpaired person from the list and pair that person with any of the remaining $2n − 2k − 1$ unpaired people. Every pairing can arise in this way, and no pairing can arise twice in this process. Thus the number of outcomes is $$\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}2n − 2i − 1$$. This is the product of the odd numbers between 1 and $2n − 1$. It is also the product of every second term of $(2n)!$. Notice that the other n terms of $(2n)!$ are even. In fact, if we double each term of n!, we would get the
missing terms of (2n)!. Thus $$(2n)! = 2^n n! \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2n - 2i - 1$$ Therefore the number of tennis pairings is $$\frac{(2n)!}{2^n\ n!}$$. end quote from the book I do not see how the number of outcomes ends up as the product  $$\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}2n − 2i − 1$$  I see a sum of elements of disjoint sets not a product. for $2n = 10$ , I see $$C_{10,2} = 45$$ his solution yields $$\frac{(10)!}{2^5\ 5!} = 945$$ That's 900 additional pairs that I do not see.

$F(f) = f(0) + \frac{1}{f(1)+\frac{1}{f(2)+...}}$ But what if $f(n) = 0 \ for\ all \ n \in \mathbb{N}?$ And can someone give me more injections form $\mathbb{N^{N}}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ ?","['real-analysis', 'cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"
2164072,Flatness and the Family of Projective Plane Curves,"I've been working through Chapter 6: Flat Families of Eisenbud's Commutative Algebra: With a View Toward Algebraic Geometry , and I have gotten myself stuck on Exercise 6.6, which deals with the family of projective plane curves. The question reads as follows (with some paraphrasing to keep it short): Consider $k\mathbb{P^3}$ , and fix a degree $d$ . For each multi-index $\alpha = (a_0,a_1,a_2)$ with $a_0+a_1+a_2 = d$ let $x_\alpha$ be an indeterminate. Set $R = k[\{x_\alpha\}]$ , and let $S$ be the $R$ -algebra: $$ S = \frac{R[y_0,y_1,y_2]}{\left(\sum_\alpha x_\alpha y_0^{a_0}y_1^{a_1}y_2^{a_2}\right)}.$$ Show that: $(a)$ if we invert any $x_\alpha$ , then the family becomes flat. That is, the $R[x_\alpha^{-1}]$ -algebra $S[x_\alpha^{-1}]$ is flat, by showing that it is a free module (it is not finitely generated). $(b)$ $S$ is an integral domain, and moreover that it contains $R$ , so that it is torsion-free as a $R$ -module. $(c)$ $S$ is actually not flat over $R$ , by proving and using the following two facts: If $S$ is a flat module over a ring $R$ and $R \to T$ is any map of rings, then $S\otimes_R T$ is flat over $T$ . There is a map of rings $R = k[\{x_\alpha\}] \to k[t] = T$ , such that $$T \otimes_R S = \frac{k[t,y_0,y_1,y_2]}{(ty_0^d)}$$ is not a flat $T$ -algebra. I understand geometrically that this corresponds to all projective curves of degree $d$ , and that the $x_\alpha$ represent the ""coefficients"" of the curves. I also know that the fiber of any prime $P$ (essentially picking out a specific set of constants to get an irreducible curve) is a polynomial ring over $\text{Frac}(P)$ modulo the equation of degree $d$ that we choose. I can prove part $(b)$ without too much trouble, but I am very much stuck on part $(a)$ . I have tried a few obvious aproaches such as trying to enumerate a basis, but I am getting confused with the structure of the localization. I would very much appreciate a hint for part $(a)$ and possibly part $(c)$ . Thanks in advance.","['flatness', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"
2164074,What are examples of vectors that are not usually called vectors?,"In algebra, a vector is an element of a vector space. An example of such an element is a matrix. In linear algebra, a vector is a shorthand name for a $1 \times m$ or a $ n \times 1 $ matrix. (Whereas a matrix itself is also a vector, by definition, but rarely referred to as such.) In (analytic) geometry, a (euclidean) vector is a geometric object with a magnitude and direction. These can be represented by tuples . Both matrices and tuples are clearly vector elements in some spaces, but are for some reason not called vectors by name, unlike euclidean vectors and row vectors . Are there any other examples of vectors that are not called vectors, like matrices and tuples?","['linear-algebra', 'definition']"

2164221,ε-δ: Proving that $\lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(x) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} f(a+h) $,"Firstly, I do realize that this proof was asked about before here , but the proposed proof was different and the answers were also not complete. To get to the point: I have written my own proof of this simple theorem, however I'm not sure if the proof is correct--the exercise is taken from Spivak, who seems to have provided different and more elaborate proof of that theorem. My proof is following: By the definition of limit (omitting the 'for all's and 'there exists''): $$ \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L_1 \implies 0 < |x - a| < δ_1 \implies |f(x) - L_1| < ε $$
and
$$ \lim_{h\to 0} f(a + h) = L_2 \implies 0 < |h - 0| = |h| < δ_2 \implies |f(a + h) - L_2| < ε $$ Let's work on the second limit:
$$|h| = |(a+h) - a|$$
$$\text{Let } y = a + h$$
Now, the second limit takes the following definition:
$$ 0 < |y - a| < δ_2 \implies |f(y) - L_2| < ε $$
We see that both limits have the exact same form right now. By Theorem 1 [stating that if limit L exists it is necessarily unique] $L_1 = L_2$ and $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = \lim_{h\to 0} f(a + h)$ $$Q.E.D.$$ Is my reasoning correct or have I made an error somewhere?","['epsilon-delta', 'calculus', 'limits']"
2164333,Why does $\ker(T) = \{0\} \Leftrightarrow T$ is injective,"Let $T$ be linear transformation from $V$ to $W$. I know how to prove the result that nullity$(T) = 0$ if and only if $T$ is an injective linear transformation. But I still don't intuitively understand why the kernel only containing the zero vector means that $T$ is injective, and vice versa. In contrast, the relation between the image of $T$ and condition of being surjective is easy to see, since in order to map to all of the elements of $W$ the image of $T$ must have the same dimension as $W$. This can intuitively be seen with a diagram of the mapping from $V$ to $W$, for example. I can't really imagine a diagram that plainly shows the injective condition. In short, what about nullity$(T) = 0$ imples that $T$ is a one-to-one function?","['linear-algebra', 'linear-transformations']"

My question is whether it still works or if Yeh's way is necessary (for instance, he split the $\mu(E_n)< \infty \; \forall n$ and the $\mu(E_n)= \infty$ for some n cases).  In my notes I like to be brief so if a shorter way works I'd like to write that out instead :) My idea: pick a sequence $(F_n:n \in \mathbb{N})$ in $\frak{A}$ where $F_1=E_1$, $F_n=E_n \setminus ( \cup_{k=1}^{n-1} E_k)$.  Then a previous lemma shows 
$$\cup_{k=1}^n E_k = \cup_{k=1}^n F_k \text{ for } n=1,2,\ldots, \infty$$
Then by the countable additivity of $\mu$:
\begin{split}
\mu( \cup_{k=1}^\infty E_k) & = \mu( \cup_{k=1}^\infty F_k)= \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mu( F_k)\\
&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mu( F_k)= \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu( \cup_{k=1}^n F_k)\\

2164482,Proving any number of the form $2^n$ can't be written as the sum of k consecutive numbers.,"I think i have proved that any number of the form $2^n$ can't be written as the sum of k consecutive positive integers, but i would be grateful if i could have some clarification as to whether this is a correct and valid proof or not. Let $g=x+(x+1)+(x+2)+(x+3)+...+(x+(k-1))$, hence g is the sum of k consecutive positive integers. $g=kx+\sum_{d=1}^{k-1}d$ Hence, $g=kx+\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ Rearranging for x we find, $x=\frac{g}{k}-\frac{(k-1)}{2}$ So, for certain values of $k$, we can be sure that a positive integer value of $x$ can be found, and hence $g$ can be written as the sum of $k$ consecutive positive integers.There are two cases for $k$ to considor: Case 1) $k$ is odd. If $x$ exists, it must be the case $k$ | $g$, as for odd values of $k$, $\frac{(k-1)}{2}$ will alwyas be an integer, and hence $x$ will. Case 2) $k$ is even. $k$ does not divide $g$, but $\frac{g}{k}$ must be a multiple of $\frac{1}{2}$, and hence equals $\frac{h}{2}$, for some odd $h$. Letting $j=2^n$, assume that we can write $j$ as the sum of $k$ consecutive positive integers. If $k$ is odd, then if a $k$ exists, it must divide $j$, by Case 1. But, $j$ has no odd factors as it is a power of two, hence $k$ could not be odd. If $k$ is even, by Case 2 it mut be the case $k$ does not divide $j$. Also, $\frac{j}{k}=\frac{h}{2}$, for some odd $h$. But, this implies $2j$ has an odd factor, $h$. but, as $2j$ is a power of $2$, it can't have odd factors. So, $k$ can't be odd. Hence, $k$ is neither odd or even, and this is a contradiction to our assumption. Hence no $x$ exists, and hence and number of the form $2^n$ can't be written as the sum of $k$ consecutive positive integers. Any feedback on this proof would be appreciated.",['number-theory']
