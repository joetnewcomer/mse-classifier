1369506,Riemann mapping under which uncountably many boundary points correspond to a single point,"I am interested in the following question, which is 10.4 from this list : Give an example of a domain conformally equivalent to the disc where
  uncountably many points on the unit circle correspond to a single
  point on the boundary. I take this to mean something like, ""Find a point $p$ on the boundary of the domain and uncountably many points $e^{i\theta_\alpha}$ such that $f(z)$ tends to each $e^{i\theta_\alpha}$ depending on how $z$ approaches $p$."" I was thinking of doing something like the following. Fix a finite number of angles $\theta_i$. Consider the unit disk, and excise line segments of length $1$ with center at the origin and angle $\theta_i$. Then excise a slit from origin to the boundary of the disk to make the region simply connected. It seems like the origin would then correspond to finitely many different points on the boundary of the disk (depending on which part of the middle ""star"" the sequence of points approaches the origin in the original region). However, cutting out uncountably many line segments no longer leaves an open set, so I don't think this method will work. Is there another way?","['complex-analysis', 'conformal-geometry']"
1369511,"If I randomly generate a string of length N from an alphabet {A, B, C}, what's the likelihood that exactly k characters will be the same?","I have an alphabet: {A, B, C}. I'm randomly generating strings of length N from that alphabet. Examples: Examples: N=5, AACBC, AAAAA, BBCAA What is the likelihood that exactly k characters of that string are the same? (k <= N) (k corresponds to the maximum number of similar characters... Example: With string AABCAAA: N=7, k=5 because there are 5 A's. String AABBCC: N=6, k=2 because there are equally-sized groups of A's, B's, and C's.) Initially, my solution looked like this: P(k characters are the same) = $(\frac{1}{3})^k * (\frac{2}{3})^{n-k}$ Until I realized that this solution wasn't robust enough-- it doesn't matter WHICH characters are the same, only that k characters are the same.

1369513,Let $\ f_1:A \rightarrow B$ and $\ f_2:A \rightarrow B$. Prove or disprove $f_1 \cap f_2$ iff $f_1=f_2$.,"Here is the question I am working on (screenshot): So, I haven't worked with function proofs very much (especially in the context of iff statements and with intersections). I am looking to see if I am on the right track for how to approach this proof, and to look for feedback in the holes of my proof knowledge. Strategy: I will prove this statement (not disprove). Forward:
Prove directly. Let $(x,y) \in f_1 \cap f_2$. This is equivalent to saying that $x \in f_1$ and $x \in f_2$, given by the intersection. From here, I am uncertain where to go and how to show this indicates $A=B$. Converse:
I was thinking that I should proceed by contrapositive. To do the contrapositive, my statement would be ""If $A \neq B$, then $f_1 \cup f_2$ is not a function"". I am much more stuck with the converse direction, so a push in the right direction would be helpful.

1369516,Realizing the oscillator algebra as a matrix Lie algebra,"In Hilgert's & Neeb's Structure and Geometry of Lie Groups , they introduce a Lie algebra, which they call the ""oscillator algebra,"" as an extension of the Heisenberg algebra. They give a basis $\{p,q,z,h\}$ for this Lie algebra, related by $$[p,q]=z, \\ [h,p]=q, \\ [h,q]=-p,$$ with all other brackets being $0$. For some reason, I felt the need to try to find a finite-dimensional faithful representation for this algebra. Twenty-four hours later...still no real progress. A quick check (directly from the relations or from Cartan's solvability criterion) will show that this Lie algebra is solvable. The adjoint representation is, thus, not a viable candidate. I hoped playing with upper triangular matrices would bring something, but trying to write out general terms became tedious and unhelpful, and Lie's theorem only works over $\mathbb{C}$ (and some special cases in $\mathbb{R}$). I've tried finding useful information from the commutators themselves. I think we can assume that $pq=z$ and $qp=0$, but I have no actual proof of this. I could really use a forceful shove in the right direction. Is there an easier way to go about finding this representation than brute force? If so, what is it?","['lie-algebras', 'linear-algebra', 'representation-theory', 'matrices']"
1369529,Topology: Prove that this subspace topology is discrete,"The question is from Topology and Its Applications Chapter 1, by William F. Basner. The question states the following, Let $\mathbb{Z}$ be a topological space with subspace topology inherited from $\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R}$. Prove that $\mathbb{Z}$ has discrete topology. Proof . Since $\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R}$, we note that from the definition of subspace topology we have an $O \subset \mathbb{Z}$ which is only open iff $O' \subset \mathbb{R}$ when $O = \mathbb{Z} \cap O'$. Now, we must precede to show that every $O \subset \mathbb{Z}$ is open, so we can prove that $\mathbb{Z}$ is a discrete space. By definition 6, we see that there must exist a $B_{r}(x) \subset O$ and this must be true for all $O \subset \mathbb{Z}$. Since $O = \mathbb{Z} \cap O'$, $B_{r}(x) \subset \mathbb{Z} \cap O'$ must be true. Therefore, $B_{r}(x) \subset \mathbb{Z}$ and $B_{r}(x) \subset O'$, but because both $\mathbb{Z}$ and $O'$ are open, then $B_{r}(x)$ must be open. Since this is true for all $B_{r}(x)$ we can conclude that $\mathbb{Z}$ has a discrete topology. $\square$ I feel like this proof is a load of crap (It is my first attempt at a proof in a while) I want feed back, and I need to know if I did this correctly.","['real-numbers', 'integers', 'general-topology']"
1369536,What are the rules for taking derivatives in linear algebra?,"I was reading through a paper on beamforming and came across an equation whose derivative I don't fully understand. A cost function is given as: $$ J(\mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{w}^HR\mathbf{w} +\lambda^*[\mathbf{w}^H\mathbf{s}(\theta_0-1] + \lambda[\mathbf{s}(\theta_0)^H\mathbf{w}-1] $$ and the derivative w.r.t. $\mathbf{w}^*$ is found and set to equal 0: $$\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{w}^*}J(\mathbf{w}) = R\mathbf{w} + \lambda^*\mathbf{s}(\theta_0) = 0$$ It seems to me that $\mathbf{w}$ and $\mathbf{w}^*$ (or $\mathbf{w}^H$) are treated as essentially independent variables, although in my (perhaps naÃ¯ve) mind they should be related somehow. Is there a fundamental reason they're separate? Perhaps some linear algebra rules for derivatives would be wonderful for me, I just don't know where to look. Thanks! Edit: To clarify some, $\mathbf{w}$ are the beamforming weights, $\mathbf{s}(\theta_0)$ is the steering vector towards the angle of interest, $R$ is the covariance matrix of the input signal, and $\lambda$ is a tuning parameter.","['derivatives', 'linear-algebra', 'matrix-calculus', 'matrices']"
1369541,What is the cardinality of the set of roots of unity?,"Consider the geometric interpretation of ""roots of unity"": My intuition says that you can place arbitrarily many equidistant points on the unit circle and catch every point that lies on it. Therefore every $z \in \mathbb{C}$ that lies on the unit circle should be a solution to $z^n = 1$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. But, if I understand correctly, for any $n$, $z^n = 1$ has exactly $n$ roots. Therefore, we have a countable union of countable sets, and therefore the set of roots of unity is countable. Does that mean that there are points on the unit circle that are not in the sets of roots of unity?","['elementary-set-theory', 'roots-of-unity', 'cardinals']"
1369598,Smallest integer,"I encountered an intriguing problem and I think I have a solution, but I want to run it by some of the smarter people around here: Find the smallest integer $n, n>1$ such that $C(n)=n, C(n)$ is the total number of 1s that appear as you count from 1. For example, $C(9) = 1$, counting from $n=1$ to $n=9$, there is one 1. $C(99) =20, C(100)=21$, etc. I was able to get, as I stated, that from 1 to 99, there are 20 1s. From 1 to 199, $100 + 20*2$, up to 999 there are these $140 + 8*20 = 300$. Keeping with this algorithm I get $C(9,999)=4,000, C(99,999)=50,000$, and $C(199,999)=C(200,000)=200,000$ What I seem to be having trouble with is, is this the smallest integer for which $C(n)=n$?","['discrete-mathematics', 'elementary-number-theory']"

I dont need detailed proof but just the intuition of this.

1369726,Double integral of a product in calculus of variations,"Let's say I have an integral of the form
$$
  V(u) = \iint\limits_{[0,T]^2}f(x,y)u(x)u(y)\mathrm dx\mathrm dy

$$
  \delta V(u) \approx \iint\limits_{[0,T]^2}f(x,y)[u(x)\delta u(y) + u(y)\delta u(x)]\mathrm dx\mathrm dy
$$
since I hope the term $\delta u(x)\delta u(y)$ can be disregarded. How can I find the optimal $u$ now? In the 1d case I'd have
$$
  F(u) = \int_0^T G(x,u(x))\mathrm dx \quad \implies \quad \delta F(u) \approx \int_0^TG_u(x, u(x))\delta u(x)\mathrm dx

and by fundamental lemma of calculus of variations I would get $G_u(x, u(x)) = 0$. However, I am not sure whether this passage is extendable to my case. Fwiw, my original case is a bit more complicated: I deal with an integral
$$
  W(u) = V(u) + F(u),

and since I know how to variate the latter part, I hope it is enough to know how to variate the former. Would be happy to hear any suggestions.

For one-dimensional representations, one has $$T \mapsto -1\,,$$ $$e^1 \mapsto \pm q^{-1/2}\,,$$ and $$T \mapsto q\,,$$ $$e^1 \mapsto \pm q^{1/2}\,.$$ i.e. there are four $1$ -dim representations. Method 2: We should be able to read off the irreducibles by Kazhdan-Lusztig theory.  Namely, for generic $q$ , for $(g, x) \in G \times \mathcal{N}$ and $g$ semisimple, such that $gxg^{-1} = qx$ , the cohomology of ""Springer"" fiber $\mathcal{B}_{g, x}$ (i.e. fixed by both $g, x$ ) is a big direct sum whose summands are the tensor product of an irreducible $H$ -module with an irreducible representation of the component group of the double centralizer $C(g, x)/C(g, x)^\circ$ .  Further, any given irreducible can only occur once in this list. So, I have for conjugacy classes of $(g, x)$ : (1) $x = 0$ , and $g$ is parameterized by $\mathbb{A}^1 = T//W$ .  When $g$ is regular semisimple, the fiber is two points, and when it is the identity, the fiber is $\mathbb{P}^1$ .  In either case the total cohomology is two dimensional.  Now, the centralizer when $g$ is regular is the torus $T$ , which is connected, so the $H$ -representation is really two dimensional (and not, say, the direct sum of two one-dimensional representations tensored with representations of the component group).  When $g = 1$ , then the centralizer is $G$ , which is still connected. (2) $x = \left(\begin{array}{cc}0&1\\0&0\end{array}\right)$ , and $g = \pm \left(\begin{array}{cc} \sqrt{q}&0\\0&1/\sqrt{q}\end{array}\right)$ .  The fiber here is a point.  So we have a one-dimensional cohomology.  The centralizer is two points, so not connected, but twisting with an irreducible representation of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ won't change our dimension count in any case. So here, we only find two $1$ -dim representations.  Where is the discrepancy?","['representation-theory', 'noncommutative-algebra', 'lie-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'hecke-algebras']"

1369956,Proving two functions are monotonically related,"I've been relying on stackexchange a lot lately but this is my first time asking a question. A lot of searching has yielded no answer so hopefully someone can help out. I'm trying to find (and prove) whether two functions are monotonically related. By monotonically related I mean that, for two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, if $f(x_i)<f(x_j)$ then $g(x_i)<g(x_j)$. In other words: $f(x_i)-f(x_j)$ must have the same sign as $g(x_i)-g(x_j)$ for all values of i and j. To get more specific, my understanding of this is that two functions could be shown to be monotonically related by proving that the function that relates $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is a monotonic function. I believe what is meant by this is that $f(x)=h(g(x))$ and $h$ has to be a monotonic function. This is about as far as I can get. I have no idea how to find a function that relates two other functions let alone how to prove said function is a monotonic function. If anyone could help with either of these issues, either showing how to find a function that relates two other functions or more generally how to show that two functions are monotonically related, it would be greatly appreciated.

Let $Ï$ be continuous a.e. on $\Bbb{R}$, let $f$ be finite on $Î©$ a.e., then $Ïâf$ is measurable if $f$ is measurable. The following might be helpful.

1370432,Partition-based entropy of a sequence,"The entropy $H$ of a discrete random variable $X$ is defined by $$H(X)=E[I(X)]=\sum_xP(x)I(x)=\sum_xP(x)\log P(x)^{-1}$$ where $x$ are the possible values of $X$, $P(x)$ is the probability of $x$, $E$ is the expected value operator, and $I$ is the self-information . In other words, $H(X)$ is the expected information content of $X$. Suppose we have a sequence $$s=\langle s_1,s_2,s_3,s_4,\ldots,s_n\rangle$$ Let $N(x)$ be the number of occurrences of $x$ in $s$. Assuming a uniform distribution, we can express $P(x)$ as $N(x)/n$, where $n$ is the length of the sequence. Hence we can express the entropy as $$\sum_x\frac{N(x)}{n}\log\frac{n}{N(x)}=\log n-\frac{1}{n}\sum N(x)\log N(x)$$ This allows us to calculate the entropy of the sequence based on the number of occurrences of individual symbols. For example, $$H(\langle a,b,a,b,a,b\rangle)=1$$ according to this measure. Switching the last two symbols yields the same entropy $$H(\langle a,b,a,b,b,a\rangle)=1$$ since the number of occurrences of each symbol does not change. However, it seems intuitively true that the second sequence is more ""random"" than the first sequence and hence should, in some sense, have higher entropy. Indeed, I found that taking the entropy of adjacent pairs of symbols in $s$, we obtain $$H(\langle ab,ba,ab,ba,ab\rangle)\approx 0.970951$$
$$H(\langle ab,ba,ab,bb,ba\rangle)\approx 1.52193$$ By this measure, the entropy of the second sequence is higher than that of the first sequence. We can do the same for triplets of symbols as well: $$H(\langle aba,bab,aba,bab\rangle)=1$$
$$H(\langle aba,bab,abb,bba\rangle)=2$$ and so on. Thus measuring the entropy not only for individual symbols but subsequences of symbols in the sequence appears to yield a better estimate of the ""complexity"" of the sequence. The same concept can be applied to 2D partitions (see here ). My questions are as follows What is the name of this approach in the literature? I'm thinking it might be something along the lines of partition-based entropy or substring-based entropy. How can I rigorously combine the partition-based entropy estimates for varying lengths to obtain a single, overall estimate of the entropy of the sequence? Is this approach related to Lempel-Ziv compression ? Can this approach be extended to continuous functions , perhaps by partitioning through open subsets of the domain of the function? Edit: On further thought, it seems a semi-rigorous combined result might be achieved by using the minimum length description principle and establishing a prior for the hypothesis ""the alphabet of the source is sequences of symbols of length $n$"" as follows: $$P(\text{source produces words of length }n)=2^{-n}\text{ or }\frac{1}{n(n+1)}$$ which satisfies unitarity: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty P(x)=1$$ thus the $n$-partition entropy estimate for each $n$ is weighed by a function of $n$.

1370814,Lang's treatment of product of Radon measures,"Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space.
We denote by $\mathcal B(X)$ the $\sigma$-algebra of Borel sets of $X$.
A positive Radon measure $\mu$ on $X$ is a measure defined on $\mathcal B(X)$ with the following properties. (1) $\mu(K) \lt \infty$ for all compact sets $K$. (2) For any $E\in \mathcal B(X)$, $\mu(E) = \text{inf}\ \mu(U)$ for all open $U$ such that $E \subset U$. (3) For any open $U$, $\mu(U) = \sup\ \mu(K)$ for all compact $K$ such that $K \subset U$. It can be proved(see, for example, Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis ) that a positive Radon measure has the following property. (3') For any $\sigma$-finite set $E\in \mathcal B(X)$, $\mu(E) = \sup\ \mu(K)$ for all compact $K$ such that $K \subset E$. Now let $\mu, \nu$ be positive Radon measures on locally compact Hausdorff spaces $X$ and $Y$.
We denote by $\mathcal B(X)\otimes \mathcal B(Y)$ the smallest $\sigma$-algebra on $X\times Y$ containg all the sets of the form $A\times B, A\in \mathcal B(X), B \in \mathcal B(Y)$.
Suppose $\mu$ and $\nu$ are $\sigma$-finite.
Let $\mu\otimes \nu$ be the product measure on $\mathcal B(X)\otimes \mathcal B(Y)$.
Let $f:X\times Y \rightarrow \mathbb C$ be a continuous function with compact support.
It can be proved using Stone-Weierstrass theorem that $f$ is measurable with respect to $\mathcal B(X)\otimes \mathcal B(Y)$. Hence it is integrable with respect to $\mu\otimes \nu$.
Hence $f \rightarrow \int f d(\mu\otimes\nu)$ is a positive linear functional defined on the vector space of continuous functions of compact support on $X\times Y$.
By Riesz representation theorem there is a unique positive Radon measure $\lambda$ on $X\times Y$ such that $\int f d(\mu\otimes\nu) = \int f d\lambda$ for all continuous functions of compact support on $X\times Y$.
Lang claims without explanation in his book Real and Functional Analysis that $\lambda$ and $\mu\otimes\nu$ coincide on $\mathcal B(X)\otimes \mathcal B(Y)$(Th. 6.3, Ch. IX, Sect. 7, p.274).
I don't understand why this is so.
Would anyone elaborate on this? EDIT(29 July 2015) For the convenience of the reader, I reproduce Theorem 6.3 and its proof in Lang's book. Theorem 6.3 .
Let $X, Y$ be locally compact Hausdorff spaces and let $\mu, \nu$ be positive $\sigma$-regular Borel measures on $X$ and $Y$, respectively.
Assume that $\mu$ and $\nu$ are $\sigma$-finite with respect to these measures.
Then all functions in $C_c(X\times Y)$ are in $\mathcal L^1(\mu\otimes\nu)$, and there exists a unique $\sigma$-regular Borel measure on $X\times Y$  which restricts to $\mu\otimes\nu$ on $\mathcal B(X)\otimes\mathcal B(Y)$. Proof .
Lemma 6.1 shows that functions in $C_c(X\times Y)$ are $(\mu\otimes\nu)$-measurable,
and combined with Fubini's theorem shows that these functions are in $\mathcal L^1(\mu\otimes\nu)$.
The map $f \rightarrow \int_{X\times Y} f d(\mu\otimes\nu)$ is obviously a positive functional on $C_c(X\times Y)$, and we can therefore apply Theorem 2.3 to get a $\sigma$-regular Borel measure having the desired properties. The Corollary 2.8 gives the uniquness, thus proving our theorem. Remark .
Lemma 6.1 just proves by using Stone-Weierstrass theorem that functions in $C_c(X\times Y)$ are $(\mu\otimes\nu)$-measurable.
Theorem 2.3 is a part of Riesz representation theorem.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. If sine is a ratio of lengths, then how can it ever be negative? I'm assuming of course that the length is always positive. Correct me if I'm mistaken.

I'm comfortable with the unit circle definition of sine. If cos and sine are defined as the x and y coordinate as we move along a unit circle, then fine, I get it. But is the unit circle definition the most fundamental? Or is it also, derived from the ratio of lengths definition?

However, we cannot use this result Sobolov Space $W^{2,2}\cap W^{1,2}_0$ norm equivalence and say $u\in H^2(\Omega)$, because 1. $u$ does not necessarily vanish on the boundary, and 2. we are not sure if $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_1^2}u+\dotsb+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_n^2}u+(\text{partial derivatives of cross terms})u$ are bounded. Aha, from Equivalent Norms on Sobolev Spaces ,
$\Delta u\in L^2(\Omega)$ is enough to say $u\in H^2(\Omega)$. But one thing is I do not know if we have the same kind of equivalence for $m>3$, and another thing is resorting to Sobolev embedding does not sound like a good idea as it depends on the dimension heavily. I wonder I could show this directly.","['sobolev-spaces', 'partial-derivative', 'calculus', 'multivariable-calculus']"

1371252,"In manifold theory, in what sense is the derivative a first-order approximation?","As I move on from the calculus definition of the derivative to the differential geometric definition in terms of tangent spaces, I am wondering how to recover the notion that the derivative of a function represents the first order approximation. Clearly the definitions of the derivative traffic in first order concepts: tangent vectors can be thought of equivalence classes of curves agreeing up to first order; one characterization of the tangent space at $x \in M$ is the dual space to $I/I^2$, where $I$ is the ideal of $C^\infty$ functions that vanish at $x$, and so on. These definitions seem to be well-suited to a characterization of $Df$ as approximating $f$ up to first order at $x \in M$, but I am having trouble putting my finger on it and expressing it precisely. I know that when we're in $\mathbb{R}^n$ the ""approximation"" property of the derivative works very well because we can identify the tangent space at a given point with $\mathbb{R}^n$ itself. But what about in the more general setting? In what sense do we have ""approximation up to first order"" there? What is it exactly that's agreeing with $f$ up to $o(\|h\|)$?","['differential-geometry', 'smooth-manifolds']"

I got answer ""The free idempotent semigroup satisfies $x^2=x$ for each element $x$. And I confirm it is finite if it is finitely generated."" with reference to a paper. If I understood correctly the concept of free object, then elements of free idempotent semigroup of three generators can be seen as strings like ""abaca"" with ""non-repeating"" property: do not count for example ""abcbc"" because has ""bc"" repeats. Well, on The longest string of none consecutive repeated pattern it is said that there is infinitely many strings of three letters with that property. So either at least one of the answers is wrong, or then I have understood this wrong. If given semigroup is finite, how many elements it has?","['universal-algebra', 'combinatorics', 'semigroups']"

1371281,Probability of Punctures for a group of cyclists,"The matter of the probability of punctures occurring cropped up during a ride yesterday with a friend. His view is this, (As we can't let a subject drop....  ;-) ) ""Eric, There must be more chance of a puncture occurring if there are more riders. The way I see it is this: If there is a 20% chance of a rider getting a puncture, then that means there is a 1 in 5 chance of a puncture for that rider. As a fraction that is 1/5. It follows that if there were 5 riders, the chances would be 5/5 for the group (i.e., one puncture). It follows that if there were 10 riders it would be 10/5 which means there would be 2 punctures. Therefore, the more riders there are, the more there is a chance of a puncture."" My view was that yes, 1/5 (20%) can be a figure to agree on, but that figure is stand alone, irrespective of the number of riders on the ride. I know probability is very counter intuitive to the human mind, so what seems to be the case is not always the case.

1371304,Relating Integration by Substitution to Change of Variables Theorem,"I'm having trouble relating the change of variables theorem from measure theory to the integration by substitution formula taught in Calculus.  I've always thought they were basically saying the same thing, but I can't quite see it.  Below I assume everything that needs to be integrable is integrable. Change of Variables Theorem : ( Wiki )  Let $(X_1, \Sigma_1, \mu)$ be a measure space and $(X_2, \Sigma_2)$ be
  a measurable space.  Let $f: X_1 \to X_2$ be measurable and let $f_*[\mu]$ be the pushforward measure on $X_2$.  Finally let $g$ be a measurable function on $X_2$.  Then
  $$
\int_{X_1} g \circ f \, \mathrm{d}\mu = \int_{X_2} g \, \mathrm{d}(f_*[\mu]).
$$ Integration by substitution : ( Wiki ) Let $f: [a,b] \to I$ be continuously differentiable for some interval $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ and let $g: I \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous.  Then
  $$
\int_a^b (g \circ f)(t) \cdot f^\prime(t) \, \mathrm{d}t = \int_{f(a)}^{f(b)} g(x) \, \mathrm{d} x.
$$ My attempt at relating the two, starting from change of variables theorem: Let $(X_1, \Sigma_1) = ([a,b], \mathcal{B}([a,b]))$ and $(X_2, \Sigma_2) = (I, \mathcal{B}(I))$.  Let $f$ be continuously differentiable and increasing and let $\mu = \mu_f$ be the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure for $f$ on $[a,b]$.  Then $f^\prime = \frac{\mathrm{d} \mu_f}{\mathrm{d} \lambda_1}$, the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $\mu_f$ w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure $\lambda_1$ on $[a,b]$.  Finally, the pushforward measure $f_*[\mu_f] = \lambda_2$, the Lebesgue measure on $I$.  Hence
\begin{align*}
\int_a^b (g \circ f)(t) \cdot f^\prime(t) \, \mathrm{d}t & = \int_{[a,b]} (g \circ f) \cdot f^\prime \, \mathrm{d}\lambda_1 \\
& = \int_{[a,b]} g \circ f \, \mathrm{d} \mu_f \\
& = \int_I g \, \mathrm{d} (f_*[\mu_f]) \\
& = \int_I g \, \mathrm{d} \lambda_2 \\
& = \int_{f(a)}^{f(b)} g(x) \, \mathrm{d} x.
\end{align*}
The first line is because $(g \circ f) \cdot f^\prime$ is continuous and so the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals coincide, the second is because $f^\prime = \frac{\mathrm{d} \mu_f}{\mathrm{d} \lambda_1}$, the third is the change of variables theorem, the fourth is because $f_*[\mu_f] = \lambda_2$, and the last line is again because $g$ is continuous and so the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals coincide. So assuming the above is correct, I can relate the two for monotone increasing $f$, but not for more general continuous $f$.  How can I show this?","['lebesgue-integral', 'lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory', 'integration']"
1371329,"LaSalle invariance, Lyapunov stability","Trying to understand the LaSalle invariance principle. Consider the system $x' = y \\
y' = -y-6x-3x^2$ a) Using the test function $V(x,y) = 0.5y^2+3x^2+x^3$, show that the origin is asymptotically stable. The principle roughly says that if $S$ is the union of all complete trajectories contained in $\{\textbf{x}: V'(\textbf{x})=0\}$, then any trajectory will end up in $S$. In this case, some work gives us $V' = -y^2$ so $V'=0$ is true for the entire x-axis. Qualitatively, It seems clear that if $y=0$, then $x'=0$ but $y'$ will take us somewhere where $V'<0$. I.e. if we start at $y=0,x\neq0$, the resulting trajectory will not satisfy $V'=0$. The origin will be in $S$ however. But isn't the sequence $\{(-2,0),(-2,0),\dots\}$ contained in $S$ as well? How can we, from the invariance principle, deduce that we will end up at the origin and not the other equilibrium? b) Estimate the domain of attraction. (Adding this since it's relevant) Here we use the level set of $V$ that passes through the other equilibrium point as an estimate, i.e. $0.5y^2+3x^2+x^3 = 4$. But isn't there a bunch of other points that are attracted to the origin? I'm struggling to understand how the level sets of $V$ interact with $V'$ and in general how $V$ and $V'$ interact with which equilibrium will be attracting.","['dynamical-systems', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
