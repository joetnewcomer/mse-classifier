35275,Determining which side of a 3D cube is facing the viewer,"Me and a friend are trying to render a rotating cube on a 2D plane(the screen) using java. Here's the problem The cube has 6 sides, each with a specific normal vector of the form $(0, 0, 1)$, $(0, -1, 0)$ and so on The sides(and their normals) are rotated using a matrix as described on     en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_projection#Perspective_projection But unlike Wikipedia we project our rotated 3D-vectors on a plane situated on the positive X-axis using: v = The 3D vector which has been rotated by the matrix = $(a, b, c)$ v2D = The 2D vector projected on the plane/screen = $(b, c)$ These new 2D vectors are then used to draw an image To determine which of the six sides, that should be rendered we use the fact that the plane is located directly on the positive X-axis. n = 3Dvector pointing directly outwards from the side n2 = [rotation matrix] *n = The rotated normal pointing directly outwards from the rotated side = $(x, y, z)$ now if $x>0$ then the side is facing the same direction as the positive X-axis. And since the plane/screen to project on is located on the positive X-axis this means that the side is facing the screen and should be drawn on it. So far, this is working perfectly and it looks like this: Image1 But this cube could need some perspective and to get this we change the projection slightly: v = The 3D vector which has been rotated by the matrix = $(a, b, c)$ $w=-a/700+1$; v2D = The 2D vector projected on the plane/screen = $(b/w, c/w)$ This gives a cube where more distant objects are smaller The only problem is that sometimes it shows sides that shouldn't be shown like: Image3 So how should I compensate for the new perspective? It's clear that n2 is no longer pointing orthogonally from the surface of the sides. So that's what I need. A vector pointing orthogonally from the surface of the side, which has been distorted by w while n2 haven't (edit) Here are some numbers. The Cube has a width of $300$ pixels i e 150 pixels from origo to a side following it's normal The plane/screen to project on is located on the positive X-axis at $(300, 0, 0)$ The viewer is located at $(1000, 0, 0)$ hence $700$ in the calculations above","['geometry', 'linear-algebra', '3d']"

35301,Dual of $\ell_{\infty}$ is not $\ell_1$,"As the title indicates I'm trying to show that $\ell_{\infty}^{*}$ is not $\ell_1$. I've shown that for p, q conjugate and finite we do indeed have $\ell_{p}^{*} = \ell_q$, with the correspondence between $y_i = \phi(e_i)\in \ell_{q}$ and $\phi$ where $e_i$ is the standard (0,....,0,1,0,....) with a 1 in the 'i'th place and $\phi \in \ell_{p}^{*}$. However, I gather the reason this falls apart in the infinite case is that the dual $\ell_{\infty}^{*}$ is far larger than (but contains) $\ell_1$, being in fact the set of bounded sequences eventually tending to 0. However, I'm having some trouble seeing this. In theory, I'm working over $\mathbb{C}$, but I don't think that's where my issue is arising. It's certainly obvious that $\ell_1$ is contained in $\ell_{\infty}^{*}$: $\sum_i |y_i| < \infty \Rightarrow |\phi(x)| = |\sum_i y_i x_i| \leq (\sum_i |y_i|)(\|x\|_{\infty})$ so $\|\phi\| \le \sum_i |y_i| < \infty$: but then this is my problem, how do we get anything which corresponds to a sequence of $y_i$ -not- in $\ell_1$? I don't think working in the reals is an issue but perhaps I'm overlooking something, so suppose (e.g.) $y_i = \frac{1}{i}$: unless I've misunderstood, this should correspond to a functional since the $y_i$ are bounded and tend to 0, i.e. $\phi(e_i) = \frac{1}{i}$ and extend linearly. But if this is the case, then surely x=(1,1,1,...) gives us an x with norm 1 ($\|x\|_{\infty} = 1$) and for which $\phi$ is unbounded? So in that case this sequence of $y_i$ is a bounded sequence tending to 0 which does not in this way correspond to a bounded linear operator: or is the correspondence no longer in the obvious way? Surely no matter how you look at it each functional gives rise to a sequence of $y_i$, and unless i've confused myself these $y_i$ must be in the space $\ell_1$, which is wrong. So where have I gone wrong?","['sequences-and-series', 'dual-spaces', 'lp-spaces', 'analysis', 'functional-analysis']"
35304,Proof that 1-1 analytic functions have nonzero derivative,"I recently saw a lecturer prove the following theorem (assuming the result that every analytic function is locally 1-1 whenever its derivative is nonzero): Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}$ be open, and let $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ be 1-1 and analytic on $\Omega$.  Then $f'(z_0) \not = 0$ for every $z_0 \in \Omega$. I got the basic idea behind the proof: we assume for contradiction that $f'(z_0) = 0$, and, assuming without loss of generality that $z_0 = f(z_0) =0$, we have (from the power-series expansion) that $f(z) = z^kg(z)$ for some analytic $g$ in some disk at the origin (i.e., $z_0$) and some $k \ge 2$. Since $z^k$ is not 1-1 in any such disk (because there are multiple roots of unity), then $f$ isn't either. However, the proof he gave was rather awkward and technical- it involved defining three different axillary functions, even though the idea was simple, and I've since forgotten how it exactly worked.  In any case, I'm convinced there's a better way. The problem is that I'm having trouble turning the idea into a real proof- I know that it obviously follows if $g$ is 1-1, but I'm also pretty sure that that is too strong an assumption.  Am I missing something, or does the argument just have to be more complicated?",['complex-analysis']
35308,"Codes: Distance, number of codewords, etc","Let $p\geq 3$ be any prime and consider the code $C = N(H)\subseteq\mathbb{Z}_p^2$, where $H =  \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & \dots & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & \dots & p-2 & p-1 \end{pmatrix}\in \mathbb{Z}_p^{2\times p}$. a) How many codewords does the code $C$ contain? I've got an idea on this part. It should just be $p^2$, shouldn't it? b) Show that every selection of two distinct columns of $H$ results in a non-singular 2x2 matrix. c) Find a codeword in $C$ of weight 3 and use (b) to conclude that the code $C$ has distance 3. Parts b and c I have no clue on where to start. I'm sure that I could probably reason my way through c if I could figure out b, since finding the codeword of weight 3 should be trivial.

35310,Stone-Čech compactifications and limits of sequences,"I've been working on some old prelims from my university when they used to just be on point-set topology. We don't cover a couple of the topics so I've been teaching myself some of the material, one of the topics no longer covered is Stone-Čech Compactification. Which I have a somewhat tenuous understanding of, at any rate one of the questions reads: Let $X$ be a completely regular topological space and let $\beta(X)$ denote the Stone-Čech compactification of $X$. Show that every $y \in \beta(X) \setminus X$ is a limit point of $X,$ but is not the limit of a sequence of points in $X$. It's clear to me how to go about the first part, $X$ if considered as a subset of $\beta(X)$ is dense in $\beta(X)$. Then it follows that for every point $y \in \beta(X) \setminus X$ that every neighborhood of $y, U$ in $\beta(X)$ will touch $X$. For the second part of the question, I must say, sadly, that I'm at a loss in general. Presumably we need to assume that we have some convergent sequence $\{x_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ that converges to a point $y \in \beta(X) \setminus X$ and show that this is a contradiction. But, probably due to my weak understanding of the Stone-Čech Compactification I am unsure of how to go about this.","['general-topology', 'compactification', 'convergence-divergence', 'compactness']"

It seems intuitive and the couple examples I've written down concretely work. I've been working on this for about an hour and a half now, and the best I've been able to do is reduce it to proving that $f(x)$ is real if $x\in \mathbb{R}$ (the Schwarz Reflection Principle finishes it off).

35338,Constructing the circle inversion inverse of a point with ruler only,"I've been reading a bit about inversive geometry, particularly circle inversion. The following is a problem from Hartshorne's classical geometry, which I've been struggling with on and off for a few days. I figured it would be helpful to show that $TU\perp OA$ first. At best, I tried to label angles according to which ones are congruent with each other. I know $\angle RPS$ and $\angle RQS$ are both right, as they subtend the diameter, so $\angle TPS=\angle UQS$ are both right as well. So $PTUQ$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, and thus $\angle RTQ=\angle PUQ$. Labeling $\angle SPQ$ as $3$ and $\angle PQS$ as $4$, I see that $1+2+3+4$ sum to two right angles. That's about as far as my observations got me. My hunch is that $RTU$ is an isosceles triangle, and $PU$ is like a line of symmetry, but I'm not sure how to show it, and how to eventually conclude $TU$ meets $OA$ at $A'$, that is, $OA\cdot OA'=r^2$, where $r$ is the radius if $\Gamma$.

Furthermore, I got this doubt that $\bar {\mathbb{Q}}$ is the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$, and the thing that confuses me is

35388,Decomposing a discrete signal into a sum of rectangle functions,"Hello math@stackexchange community ! I have a simple question that seems to have a non trivial answer.

1 & \mbox{if }0\leq x \leq 1; \\
0 & \mbox{elsewhere}

This problem seems related to: Discrete wavelet transform $l_1$ regularized solution of an overdetermined linear system Maximum subarray problem However, to my understanding it does not fit any of these cases: $r(x)$ is not a wavelet basis, the problem cannot be solved (practically) as a linear system because the (finite) set of $a_i,\ b_i,\ c_i $ values is too large to compute explicitly (length of $w$ in the order of $10^4$), Since $a_i$ is undefined, it does not fit as a maximum subarray problem. Right now I have an approximate solution (iteratively solving the problem via maximum subarray formulation by brute force exploring a subset of possible $a_i$ values), however the idea of ""decomposing a signal as a sum of rectangles"" seems general enough to think that someone has already addressed it in the past.

Details Several $\zeta$ values are connected with $\pi$ , like: $\zeta$ (2)= $\pi^2/6$ $\zeta$ (4)= $\pi^4/90$ $\zeta$ (6)= $\pi^6/945$ ... and so on for all even numbers. See this mathworld link to more details: Riemann Zeta Function So the question is, could $\zeta(3)$ be written as: $$\zeta(3)=\alpha\pi^\beta$$ $$\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{C}$$ $$\beta \ne 0$$ $$\alpha \text{ not dependent of } \pi$$ See $\alpha$ not essencially belongs $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\alpha,\beta$ could be real numbers too. When I wrote $\alpha$ is not dependent of $\pi$ it's a strange and a hard thing to be defined, but maybe $\alpha$ can be written using $e$ or $\gamma$ or $\sqrt2$ or some other constant. Edit: Maybe this still a open question .

Edit 2: I discovered a result, but later I've seen that this is something already known, either way, it is an interesting one to have it here. $$\zeta(3)=-4\pi^2\zeta'(-2)$$ but, if $\zeta'(-2)$ is of the form $\frac{\alpha}{\pi^2}$ , with $\alpha$ not dependent of $\pi$ , then this still remains as a hard and an open question. I have a conjecture that $\zeta'(-2)$ will not cancel the $\pi^2$ term, but since I wasn't able to prove it and I can't use it here.

category of its finite coverings. Then I claim that the category $C$

projective limits and disjoint unions. Since projective limits and disjoint unions commute the statement is
reduced to say that $A:= \varprojlim A_i$, where each $A_i$ is a
finite covering, is itself a covering space of $X$. For the proof
this is my problem: Fixed a point $x\in X$, and a point $\{y_i \in
A_i\} \in A$ of the fiber over $x$, then I must find an open
neighborhood $x\in U \subset X$ such that it is homeomorphic to a
convenient neighborhood $V$ of $\{y_i\}\in A$. The passage is problematic because, if the limits is taken over an
infinite index set $I$, then I'm not allowed anymore to restrict
this neighborhood $U$ in a convenient way for each $A_i$ (Infinite
intersection of opens can be not open). There is a way to bypass this problem? Or my claim is simply wrong? Probably in the solution it will be helpful (or necessary) to
restrict to a base space $X$ which admits a universal covering, i.e.
it is locally path connected and semi-locally simply connected. Edit : I forgot to mention the following fact, which justify my claim. If $X$ admits a universal covering, then it can be obtained as projective limit of finite (normal) coverings of $X$.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"

Prove that $F=0$ on all of $D$ . Conditions $(i)$ and $(ii)$ imply that $F=\nabla g$ for some $g:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $g$ must be harmonic as well. I know one solution (see end), however my initial instinct was to try to use the max/min property of harmonic functions, and I couldn't get it to work.  Since the gradient is always orthogonal to the sphere, there must be a point on the sphere where it is $0$ .

It concerns the projective line $\mathbb{P}^1$ over an algebraically closed field $k$: write $\mathscr{H}$ for the constant sheaf with values in the function field $K$ and $\mathcal{O}$ for the structure sheaf. The content of the exercise is that map on global sections $\Gamma(X,\mathscr{H}) \to \Gamma(X,\mathscr{H}/\mathcal{O})$ is surjective. In the previous subexercise one shows that $\mathscr{H}/\mathcal{O} \cong \bigoplus_{p \in \mathbb{P}^1} i_p(K/\mathcal{O}_p)$ where $i_p$ is the skyscraper sheaf construction at $p$.

35532,Nice way of thinking about the Laplace operator... but what's the proof?,"Here's a nice fact: roughly speaking, the Laplace operator gives you the difference between the value of a function at a point and the average value at ""neighboring"" points.

Then at every point $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ $$ \lim_{r \rightarrow 0} \frac{\int_{S_r(x)} f d\sigma}{V_r} - f(x) = \frac{r^2}{2n} \Delta f(x) + \bar{o}(r^2) $$ for all $C^2$ functions $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$.  So far, however, I've been unable to prove this fact.  In the book I'm following (Grigor'yan, Heat Kernel and Analysis on Manifolds ) the only theorem that's really been introduced so far is one of Green's identities: $$ \langle u, \Delta v \rangle = \langle \nabla u, \nabla v \rangle, $$ where at least one of $u,v$ is compactly supported and $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denotes the inner product over $\mathbb{R}^n$.

35623,Example of a compact set that isn't the spectrum of an operator,"This question is a follow-up to this recent question and related to that one . Is there an easy example of an (infinite-dimensional) Banach space $X$ and a non-empty compact set $K \subset \mathbb{C}$ that can't be the spectrum of a bounded operator $A: X \to X$? Of course, if $X$ contains an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space as a norm one complemented subspace and $\emptyset \neq K \subset \mathbb{C}$ is an arbitrary compact set then we can produce an operator $A: X \to X$ such that $\sigma(A) = K$. As Jonas Meyer pointed out in his answer , the recent breakthrough by Argyros and Haydon settling the long-standing scalar-plus-compact problem (see Gowers's blog entry for some background) shows that there is a space with the property that the only possbile spectra of bounded operators are the countable and compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}$ with at most one accumulation point. ( Update: Jonas Meyer has added further information and pointers to the literature to his answer, I'll refrain from repeating this information here since I couldn't add anything of interest.) But these examples are definitely far more involved than I would like them to be. If it turns out that the example has to be so difficult for some reason that eludes me, I'd like to hear about that, too. More optimistically, one might ask: Are there known classes of infinite-dimensional Banach spaces for which there is a characterization of the compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}$ that may arise as spectra of bounded operators? A nice answer to this optimistic question would be: The class of such-and-such Banach spaces has the property that only/precisely the, say, totally disconnected compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}$ arise as spectra of bounded operators. Update: In view of the question in the title, I'm of course most interested in answers that exclude certain compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}$.

35626,Isolated vertex probabilities for different random graphs,"I'm trying to teach myself a little more on threshold probabilities for random graphs, and I'm looking at the probability that graphs have an isolated vertex, when we add on a few restrictions (when by a 'random graph' I mean we take the set of vertices and add each possible (non-directed) edge between vertices with probability p). For example, in the standard ('unrestricted') graph on n vertices, we have something like p = log(n)/n as a probability above which we expect to get no isolated vertices a.e., and below which a.e. we get an isolated vertex. This case is well documented - however, I can find little to nothing in books or online in the case of specific types of random graph which are, for example, k-connected/k-edge-connected bipartite/tripartite etc. The case I'm most interested in (at the moment) is bipartite graphs, and I expect that's the next easiest case to understand too, but I can't find documentation anywhere. Is there a simple way to extend the result from normal graphs to bipartite graphs, assuming both vertex sets have the same size? I suppose my concern is that you're obviously looking at a different set of feasible graphs to the general case on 2n vertices, both fewer graphs with an isolated vertex and fewer graphs in total, so it isn't clear to me that we can immediately say the 'proportion' of graphs which have an isolated vertex will necessarily behave the same for large n.

I know that there is a theorem, in this book called the Invertible Matrix Theorem, which says that if A is invertible then so is its transpose. But I don't see what that has to do with anything? If A has an eigenvalue, then $A-\lambda I$ is linearly dependent and is not even invertible! Is that what the hint is all about? Well, I still don't see what that says about the solution set.

Now in the cases when the genus is $g = 0$ or $g = 1$ we can have an infinite number of $K$-rational points in the curve, but then Mordell's conjecture says that when the genus goes on to the next higher value $g \geq 2$ then this can no longer happen and we can only have a finite number of $K$-rational points lying on the curve (if there are any). The usual topological interpretation that one sees mentioned in the books when they talk about the genus is as the number of holes in the surface $X(\mathbb{C})$. Thus I was just wondering if there's some way to see intuitively or at least without having to resort to highly technical arguments using scheme theory why this happens? To be more specific, is there a way to see intuitively how the fact that the surface $X(\mathbb{C})$ has more than one hole (when the genus is greater than one) prevents the corresponding algebraic curve from having an infinite number of $K$-rational points? Note: If it helps to ease things at least a little bit, I would be more than happy with an argument for the case when $K = \mathbb{Q}$ the set of rational numbers.

This function $\phi$ can be written as the limit of its increasing sequence of partial sums, so I know that its integral is $2\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1+n^2}$ which converges.  This ensures that the integral of $f$ is bounded, and hence $f$ is Lebesgue integrable. I'm a bit stuck on how to show that $\int f$ is $\pi$ however.

All $n$ people born on different days means no collisions, $i=0$; two people born on the same day means $n$ collisions, $i=1$; all $n$ people born on the same day means $n$ collisions, $i=n-1$. Since the probabilities of three or more people with the same birthday are vanishingly small compared to two people with the same birthday, and decreases faster than $x$ increases, is it correct to say that this expectation can be approximated by $$E[X]\approx {n\choose 0}p_{no\ collisions}+{n\choose 1}p_{one\ collision}$$ This doesn't look right to me and I'd appreciate some guidance. Sorry - edited to change ${n\choose 1}$ to ${n\choose 0}$ in second equation. Sloppy of me.","['birthday', 'probability', 'calendar-computations']"

It is easy to check group theoretically that the cokernel of $T_\ell \phi$ is isomorphic to the $\ell$-primary part of $\ker\phi$. Can this isomorphism be made canonical?

And if it were meaningful: what would then be a reasonable estimate for the upper bound? [update] : Heuristics suggest, that $$ f(n) \approx { {n-1 \over \log(2)} + {1 \over 2} \over n} $$ and then $$\lim_{n \to \infty} f(n) = {1 \over \log(2)} \approx 1.44269504089 $$ [end update] The function results of an adaption of the problem, whether for some integer exponent n the sum of the n'th power of the first m numbers can equal (m+1)^n, say whether there exist some natural n>2, m>2, such that $S(m,n) = (m+1)^n $ where  $S(m,n)=\sum_{k=1}^m k^n $ . I convert this in a formulation using the bernoulli-polynomials for the sum of the n'th powers. It is not difficult to find, that m must be greater than n. By use of the bernoulli-polynomials one can also meaningfully interpolate m to fractional values, say x, in the sum S(m,n). So d(x,n) is the difference $d(x,n) = B(x,n)- (x+1)^n$ where B(x,n) is the Bernoulli-polynomial-generalized form of S(m,n). With this, for a given integer n, I solve for x such that d(x,n)=0. Again, in general x>n but I want to know, whether x/n is bounded... So I determine $f(n)={\text{<root x of d(x,n)>} \over n} $ Remark: in my earlier notation above in the table I used x where I meant the exponent which I now more meaningfully denote as n. Well, while I'm writing this: possibly the current problem can be solved on a much simpler way.... (At least I've now a meaningful heuristic, see above) But my deeper curiosity is about the idea; whether -and to what extend- the above idea of ""acceleration of convergence"" is/can be made valid for such a type of conclusion at all?","['approximation', 'sequences-and-series']"

36022,How do the Catalan numbers turn up here?,"The Catalan numbers have a reputation for turning up everywhere, but the occurrence described below, in the analysis of an (incorrect) algorithm, is still mysterious to me, and I'm curious to find an explanation. For situations where a quadratic-time sorting algorithm is fast enough, I usually use the following: //Given array a[1], ... a[n]
for i = 1 to n:
    for j = i+1 to n:
        if a[i] > a[j]:
            swap(a[i],a[j]) It looks like bubble sort, but is closer to selection sort. It is easy to see why it works: in each iteration of the outer loop, a[i] is set to be the smallest element of a[i…n] . In a programming contest many years ago, one of the problems essentially boiled down to sorting: Given a list of distinct values $W_1, W_2, \dots, W_n$ , find the indices when it is sorted in ascending order. In other words, find the permutation $(S_1, S_2, \dots, S_n)$ for which $W_{S_1} < W_{S_2} < \dots < W_{S_n}$ . This is simply a matter of operating on the indices rather than on the array directly, so the correct code would be: //Given arrays S[1], ..., S[n] (initially S[i]=i ∀i) and W[1], ..., W[n]
for i = 1 to n:
    for j = i+1 to n:
        if W[S[i]] > W[S[j]]:
            swap(S[i],S[j]) But in the heat of the contest, I instead coded a program that did, incorrectly: for i = 1 to n:
    for j = i+1 to n:
        if W[i] > W[j]:
            swap(S[i],S[j]) I realised the mistake after the contest ended, and later while awaiting the results, with desperate optimism I tried to figure out the odds that for some inputs, my program would accidentally give the right answer anyway. Specifically, I counted the number of permutations of an arbitrary list $W_1, \dots, W_n$ with distinct values (since only their order matters, not their actual values) for which the incorrect algorithm above gives the correct answer, for each n: n       Number of ""lucky"" permutations

This change of notation does not make the problem any simpler. I briefly skimmed through Stanley's famous list of Catalan problems , but this does not seem to be (directly) in the list. :-) Some computer experimentation suggests that the lucky permutations are those that avoid the pattern 312, the number of which is apparently the Catalan numbers.

but I'm unsure of the correctness of my derivation, let alone the correctness of the result. I suspect it's wrong, but only because I can't get the correct result in a later calculation using this density function. Is the density function above wrong, and if so, what is the correct distribution? Edit : Tried the derivation again more carefully and got a different density, which seems more reasonable. Still have lingering doubts, however.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability', 'brownian-motion']"

36041,"What is the volume of $\{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3_{\geq 0} |\; \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} + \sqrt{z} \leq 1 \}$?","I have to calculate the volume of the set $$\{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3_{\geq 0} |\; \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} + \sqrt{z} \leq 1 \}$$ and I did this by evaluating the integral $$\int_0^1 \int_0^{(1-\sqrt{x})^2} \int_0^{(1-\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{y})^2} \mathrm dz \; \mathrm dy \; \mathrm dx = \frac{1}{90}.$$ However, a friend of mine told me that his assistant professor gave him the numerical solutions and it turns out the solution should be $\frac{1}{70}$. Also, I found out that this would be the result of the integral $$\int_0^1 \int_0^{1-\sqrt{x}} \int_0^{1-\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{y}} \mathrm dz \; \mathrm dy \; \mathrm dx,$$ which is pretty much the same as mine just without squares in the upper bounds. My question is: Is the solution provided by the assistant professor wrong or why do I have to calculate the integral without squared upper bounds? Also, is there any tool to compute the volume of such sets without knowing how one has to integrate? Thanks for any answer in advance.","['integration', 'analysis']"
36042,Trace of a bilinear form?,"I'm just a beginner of differential geometry, so please forgive me if this is nothing but a silly question or I'm making a critical conceptual mistake. Let $\mathrm{I\!I}(X, Y)$ be the second fundamental form on an embedded $n$-manifold in the $(n+1)$-dimensional Euclidean space. Then the mean curvature $H$ is defined as the trace of $\mathrm{I\!I}( \cdot, \cdot)$ divided by $n$. But my question arises here. What does the trace of a bilinear form means, especially in the sense of a tensor field on a coordinate chart? Of course, considering $\mathrm{I\!I}(\xi^i g_i, \eta^j g_j) = \mathrm{I\!I}(g_i, g_j) \xi^i \eta_j$ gives us a matrix representation $h_{ij} = \mathrm{I\!I}(g_i, g_j)$ with respect to the contravariant basis. But if we take $H$ as a mere trace of this matrix $(h_{ij})$, we only have a quantity that is not invariant under the change of coordinate, which seems obviously undesirable. I know that I have trouble understanding the nature of $\mathrm{I\!I}( \cdot, \cdot)$, since the correct answer would be $(1/n)h_{i}^{i}$, where $h_{i}^{j} = h_{il}g^{lj}$. Is there any generous soul who can help me out from this conceptual messup?","['geometry', 'bilinear-form', 'differential-geometry']"

36056,nilpotent group is almost abelian - counterexample for infinite order case,"Some books use this property to characterized the finite nilpotent group: A finite group $G$ is nilpotent if and only if whenever $a,b\in G$ are elements of finite order with $\gcd(\mathrm{ord}(a),\mathrm{ord}(b))=1$ then $ab=ba$. I wonder what happen when $G$ is infinite. Does it still hold, become just an ""if"" statement, just an ""only if"" statement, or neither?

36065,Number of distinct values of $ \oint_\gamma \frac{dz}{(z-a_1)(z-a_2)...(z-a_n)}$ for closed $ \gamma $,"I've been asked to find the number of distinct values that $ \oint_\gamma \frac{dz}{(z-a_1)(z-a_2)...(z-a_n)}$ can take for simple closed curves $ \gamma $ not passing through any of the $ a_i $. My thoughts so far: I know I should be thinking about partial fractions and using Cauchy's Integral Formula. WLOG set $ |a_1| < |a_2| < ... < |a_n| $. Let $ I(\gamma) $ denote the interior of the closed curve $ \gamma $. Now there are $ n $ possible scenarios that could yield different values for the integral: $ a_1 \in I(\gamma) $, $ a_1 $ and $ a_2 \in I(\gamma) $, ... , $ a_1, a_2, ... , a_n \in I(\gamma) $. From the integral formula, each root $ a_i $ of $ p(z) = (z-a_1)...(z-a_n) $ will make a non-zero contribution iff $ a_i \in I(\gamma) $. Writing as partial fractions, we have: $ \frac{1}{p(z)} = \frac{A_1}{z-a_1} + \frac{A_2}{z - a_2} + ... + \frac{A_n}{z - a_n} $, which leads to $ A_1 (z-a_2)...(z-a_n) + A_2(z-a_1)...(z -a_n) + ... + A_n(z-a_1)...(z-a_{n-1}) = 1$ (*) And so we see that the possible values of the integral are $ 2\pi i \left( A_1 \right) $, or $ 2\pi i \left( A_1 + A_2 \right) $, or ... $ 2 \pi i \left( A_1 + ... + A_n \right) $. But the relationship (*) gives restrictions on the values of the $ A_i $. For example, $ A_1 + ... + A_n = 0 $ (by considering the coefficient of $ z^{n+1} $). I'm unsure about making the final leap to the answer - how should I count the possible values of the $n $ sums? I would greatly appreciate any advice, either in the form of pointing out mistakes in my reasoning so far or hints on where to go next. I'd rather not have a full answer (or a hint that makes my task trivial). Thanks.",['complex-analysis']
36069,"probability of at least one person having a gem of type $n$, etc.","(Probability Question) I have a number of $N$ types of gems that I have handed out to $M$ people, using some random probability function for each person. Thus:
