389907,Show that sequence approaches fixed point of a function,"Problem Let $f(x)$ be a differentiable function on $\Bbb R$ with $\left|\,f ' (x)\right| \leq r < 1$, where $r$ is constant.  Then consider the sequence $\{x_n\}$ such that $x_1 = 0$, $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$, $n\geq1$.  Show that $x_n \to x^*$ as $n$ approaches infinity.  Moreover, $x^* = f(x^*)$. Attempt I tried showing that when $f ' (x) = r$, then eventually you end up with $x_{n+1} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}r^n$.  That sum converges by the $p$ test, so then $f(x)$ should converge to some number $x^*$.  Then for $\epsilon>0$ there exists $N$ such that $n\geq N$ such that
$$
\left|\,f(x^*)-x^*\right| \leq \left|x_{n+1} - x_n\right| \leq \epsilon.
$$
Then to show for $f ' (x) < r$ use direct comparison test to say the bigger series converges so the smaller one must converge as well. I'm not sure if I can just do this or not, can someone let me know if I'm using the correct method or not?","['fixed-point-theorems', 'sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence', 'analysis', 'limits']"
389909,When are groups of order 12 non-abelian?,"I am currently reading http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/grouptheory/group12.pdf , and have a quick question about the group being non-abelian. Let me explain: Let $|G|=12=2^2\cdot 3$ and let $n_2,$ $n_3$ denote the number of Sylow $2,3$-subgroups respectively. By using Sylow's Theorems and counting elements we see that either $n_3=1$, or $n_3=4$ (and $n_2=1$). So we always have a normal Sylow $2$-subgroup or a normal Sylow $3$-subgroup. On page 2 the author turns to the case $n_2\ne 1$ (so $n_2=3$, $n_3=1$) and says "" Since $n_2\ne 1$, the group is non-abelian "". Why is this true?","['group-theory', 'abelian-groups']"
389913,Involution in $L^{1}(G)$ is isometric.,"(Sorry for asking so many questions of the same type.  There is an underlying issue that I think once resolved will allow me to understand them all at once.) Let $G$ be a locally compact group, and $f\in L^{1}(G)$.
I'm trying to verify that $\|f^{*}\|_{p} = \|f\|_{p}$, where the involution $*$ is defined by $f^{*}(x) = \delta(x)^{-1}\overline{f(x^{-1})}$. So my computations so far look like: \begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{G}f^{*}(y)\mu(dy) &=& \int_{G}\left|\delta(y^{-1})\overline{f(y^{-1})}\right|^{p}\mu(dy)\\
                        &=& \int_{G}\delta(y^{-1})^{p}\left|\overline{f(y^{-1})}\right|^{p}\mu(dy)\\
\end{eqnarray*} Here I am stuck at the central issue I am facing where the calculations stop making sense and I feel like I'm just throwing things around hoping it's true. How do I use the definition of the $\delta$ map: $$\text{the unique group homomorphism }\delta:G\to(0,\infty)\text{ such that }\\\delta(x)\mu(E) = \mu(Ex)\text{ for all Borel sets }E$$ when its argument is not independant of the variable of integration? Ted has already confirmed in his answer to: How to use the modular function of a locally compact group? that the definition of $\delta$ implies: $$\int_{G}\delta(x)f(y)\mu(dy) = \int_{G}f(y)\mu(dy\cdot x)$$ If I try to use that step in my current problem, I end up with \begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{G}\delta(y^{-1})^{p}\left|\overline{f(y^{-1})}\right|^{p}\mu(dy) &=& \int_{G}\left|\overline{f(y^{-1})}\right|^{p}\mu(dy\cdot (y^{-1})^{p})
\end{eqnarray*}
which I don't have any clue how to interpret, and I suspect is wrong.  What is the correct way to handle this function?  I dont know what measure to associate with the notation $\mu(dy\cdot (y^{-1})^{p})$. I think the answer to this question is what I really need to be able to finish the verifications I'm working on.

389945,Use the Handshake Lemma to determine the number of edges in GK_n,"In chess, a knight's move consists of two spaces either vertically or horizontally, followed by one space in the perpendicular direction. In this way, every knight's move results in an L shaped displacement from the original position. To model all of the legal knight's moves on an n x n chessboard, we can create a graph where each vertex represents a square on the board, and two vertices are adjacent if an only if a knight can legally move between the corresponding squares. 
Use the handshake lemma to determine the number of edges in GK_n Is GK_n always, sometimes or never Eulerian Does GK_n always, sometimes or never contain an Euler trail By use of the Handshake Lemma edges are twice the amount of degree sum so if you had a graph GK_4 with 16 vertices, it would have degree sum 48 and 24 edges.

What can we say about the image under the projection $\pi: \mathbb{A}^{n+m}_k\rightarrow \mathbb{A}^n_k$? We have the very general result from Chevalley's Theorem that $\pi(C)$ is a constructible set. Can we say more? For instance does it have a natural scheme structure? $\pi(C)$ is not necessarily closed, for instance when $C=(xy-1)\subseteq\mathbb{A}^2_k$. However in this case we do have that $\pi(C)$ is locally closed rather than being a finite union of locally closed subsets. Does this hold in general? The examples I can think of where the image of a nice subscheme is properly a constructible subset don't involve a morphism as nice as the projection from an affine space. Note that it doesn't seem that the image under $\pi$ of a locally closed set is locally closed. For instance take the standard ""constructible but not locally closed set"" example in $\mathbb{A}^2_k$ which is the complement of the $x$-axis, but including the origin (i.e. $\left(\mathbb{A}^2_k\setminus (y)\right) \cup (x,y)$).

390260,Do we really need polynomials (In contrast to polynomial functions)?,"In the following I'm going to call a polynomial expression an element of a suitable algebraic structure (for example a ring, since it has an addition and a multiplication)
that has the form $a_{n}x^{n}+\cdots+a_{1}x+a_{0}$ , where $x$ is
some fixed element of said structure, a polynomial function a function of the form $x\mapsto a_{n}x^{n}+\cdots+a_{1}x+a_{0}$ (where the same algebraic considerations as above apply) a polynomial an element of the form $a_{n}X^{n}+\cdots+a_{1}X+a_{0}$ with indeterminates $X$ (these
can be formalized, if we are in a ring, with strings of $0$ s and
a $1$ ). Note that when we are very rigorous/formal, polynomial expressions
and polynomials are something different (although in daily life we
often use them synonymously). Polynomial functions and expressions
are also different from each other although in this case the relationship
is a closer one, since every polynomials expression can be interpreted
as a polynomial function evaluated at a certain point (thus ""polynomial
functions"" are something more general than ""polynomial expressions""). My question is: Why do we use polynomials ? It seems to me that every
piece of mathematics I have encountered so far, one could replace
every occurrence of polynomials with polynomial expressions/functions
without any major change in the rest of the proof/theorem/definition
etc. My thoughts: The only reasons that I can see to use polynomials are the following
two: After one makes the idea precise that one can plug ""suitable""
elements into polynomials (which may lie a ring containing the ring
in which the coefficients live in), one can save time in certain setting,
by handling the ""plugging of suitable elements into polynomials""
more elegantly: For example in case of the theorem of Cayley-Hamilton,
which in its ""polynomial function"" version would look like: Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix over $K$ , whose characteristic
polynomial (function) is $x\mapsto a_{n}x^{n}+\cdots+a_{1}x+a_{0}$ .
Then $$
a_{n}A^{n}+\cdots+a_{1}A+a_{0}I=0.
$$ whereas the ""polynomial"" version looks more elegant: Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix over $K$ , whose characteristic
polynomial is $p_{A}\in K\left[X\right]$ . Then $$
p_{A}\left(A\right)=0.
$$ The only thing that polynomials can ""do"", but algebraic expressions/functions can't, is to be different, when the algebraic expressions/functions are the same (i.e. there's a theorem that tells us that the mapping of polynomials to polynomials expressions/functions
isn't injective, if the field is finite). Maybe this small difference makes a big enough difference
to consider polynomials after all, but as I said, I haven't encountered
any situation in which this difference could manifest itself. ( I'm guessing that maybe cryptography or higher number theory really needs
polynomials and not just polynomial expressions/functions. Since I don't know
anything about these subjects, I would be very happy with an example
of a theorem (whose content isn't merely technical as it is the case with the theorem above) involving polynomials, where these absolutely cannot
be replaced by polynomial expressions/functions. Conversely I would also be happy with an authoritative statement from someone knowledgeable that indeed we could dispense of polynomials, if we wanted to. )","['finite-fields', 'functions', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials', 'soft-question']"

390323,A photon in expanding Universe (a snail on a tree),"I want to know how far a snail can reach in expanding universe. It has a constant speed c = 1 and tree is expanding at speed $v= H_0 D$, with Hubble constant $H_0 = 1$. Here D(T) is the distance of snail from the origin that I am looking for. I want to know how it depends on time T. At every moment of time, t, D increases as $dD = H_0 D dt + c dt = (D + 1)dt$ because we add the tree growth to the snail speed. This is non-homogenous equation and I had to look into handbook to get the result $D(T) = e^T-1$. This looks right, as we have snail at the origin, D = 0, at time 0. However, I do not know how to compute inhomogeneity myself. I keep in mind only that exponentials are solutions of homogenous equations. For instance, the Hubble equation, $dD = r_0 D\:dt$, gives exponentially expanding Universe $D = r_0 e^t$. To avoid inhomogeneity (and differential equations altogether), I tried to derive the solution right in the closed form. I considered this way: in the first moment of time, snail travels $r_0 = dt$. This length starts expanding, according to Hubble law, $r(T-dt) = r_0 e^{T-dt} = e^{T-dt} dt$ to the snail's distance because it has $T-dt$ seconds to expand. This is the contribution of the first snail step to the resulting distance. During the next step, snail makes another $r_0 = dt$, but it has $dt$ less time to expand, resulting in contribution of $e^{T-2dt} dt$. The third step, will produce the same $r_0$, expanded to $e^{T-3dt} dt$ and so on, until, in the final step there will be no time to expand at all, $e^{T-T} dt = dt$. So, we need to sum up the infinitecimal plots, whose sizes grow exponentially with t. In the form $D(T) = \int r(t) dt$, where $r(t) = e^{T-\int dt = T-t}$. Likewise $\int_0^Y {y dy} = \int_0^Y {(Y-y) dy} $, I think that we'll get the same result if, instead of reducing expansion time linearly, from T to 0, it would be increased linearly, from 0 to T, $D = \int_0^T e^{T-t} dt = \int_0^T e^{t} dt = e^t|_0^T = e^T-1$ Surprisingly, while I typed this text, the closed form integral matched the diffeq solution above! I had a discrepancy on the paper. It seems not a question anymore. Is it ok to leave the solution on this site? You may just check if it is ok. So, photon with a constant speed, 1, in expanding Universe travels at $d(e^t-1)/dt = e^t$ -- exactly the speed of expanding Universe! Otherwise, you may answer why Ant on a rubber rope is consedered as a model of Universe expansion rather than my problem? I see that ant has it tree growing linearly, rather than exponintially, which cannot correspond to the Hubble Universe expansion.","['closed-form', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'recreational-mathematics', 'integration']"

Let $p$ be an arbitrary point in $M$ and choose a vector field $T$ around $p$ such that $\{T, \nabla_T T\}$ forms a local frame for $M$. In other words $$ \nabla_T T \not\propto T$$ We now immediately know that the integral curve $\gamma$ of $T$ through $p$ is not length extremizing. Thus there exists a variation $\tilde{\gamma}(t,s)$ of $\gamma$ and a vector field $N = \tilde{\gamma}_*(\partial/\partial s)$ such that $$L'(s) = \int_{-\epsilon}^\epsilon N_{\tilde{\gamma}(t,s)}|T_{\tilde{\gamma}(t,s)}|dt$$ is nonzero at $s = 0$.

390538,Group actions and natural isomorphisms,"Let $G$ be a group-as-category, and let $S$ be the image of $G$ by the $Hom(G,-)$ functor. The $Hom$ functor defines a bijection $\chi: G \to S$ between elements of $S$ and morphisms of $G$, and thus $S$ is equipped with a canonical group action $\psi$ given by $\psi(g,s) = \chi(g\cdot\chi^{-1}(s))$. However, one can define many other group actions, given an element $h$ of G, by $\psi'(g,s) = \chi(h \cdot g \cdot h^{-1} \cdot \chi^{-1}(s))$. It seems to me that these group actions are related to the natural isomorphisms of the $Hom(G,-)$ functor. If $h=(\chi^{-1}(s))^{-1}$, we can even get the right group action on $s$. My question is: what framework should I use if I'd like to use all these group actions on $S$ and not just the canonical one ?","['category-theory', 'group-theory']"

390580,Is restriction of compact operator always compact?,"Question 1: Is a compact operator $T:X\to Y$ 's restriction on a subspace $Z\subset X$ still compact? (I think I've got the answer) I think the compact operator's restriction on any subspace must still be compact since for any bounded sequence $\{ x_n\}\subset Z$, it's also bounded in $X$ since the subspace shares the norm. However a subspace can be equipped with a different norm. For example, it's not immediately clear whether the injection $i: (C^\infty,\| \cdot\|_\infty )\to (L^2,\| \cdot\|_{L^2})$ is compact. But we know that the injection: $i_2: (C^\infty,\| \cdot\|_{L^2} )\to (L^2,\| \cdot\|_{L^2})$ is compact by the above argument and $i_1: (C^\infty,\| \cdot\|_\infty )\to (C^\infty,\| \cdot\|_{L^2} )$ is continuous. Therefore $i=i_2\circ i_1$ is compact. (Such argument won't work for $H^1\to L^2$, you can try by yourself) The lesson is we can't discuss the operator's compactness ignoring the norm of the space. The definition of compactness heavily depends on them(bounded, convergent). Maybe someone can furnish us with an example that the operator is compact in one norm but not in the other. Question 2: From Fredholm alternative, we know that the range of $\lambda I -T$ is always closed if $\lambda \neq 0$. So how about the range of a compact operator itself? Is it always closed or open?

390708,Proof that ${\left(\pi^\pi\right)}^{\pi^\pi}$ (and now $\pi^{\left(\pi^{\pi^\pi}\right)}$) is a noninteger.,"Conor McBride asks for a fast proof that $$x = {\left(\pi^\pi\right)}^{\pi^\pi}$$ is not an integer.  It would be sufficient to calculate a very rough approximation, to a precision of less than $1,$ and show that $n < x < n+1$ for some integer $n$ .  But $x$ is large enough ( $56$ digits) that that method is not obviously practical without electronic computation tools. Is there a purely theoretic proof that works with no calculation at all, or is there a calculational argument that would be practical prior to $1950$ ? Edit : Let me phrase the question a little differently, as a spur to your mathematical imagination. I go back in time to $1847$ and have lunch with Carl Friedrich Gauss.  We are chatting about the developments in $20$ th and $21$ st-century mathematics, and because I am a horrible person, I mention that $(\pi^\pi)^{\pi^\pi}$ has been proven to be an integer. Gauss is incredulous, but I insist. After I leave, can Gauss convince himself that I am nothing but a troll? Edit : After I looked back at McBride's original question , I saw to my dismay that he had not asked about $x= (\pi^\pi)^{\pi^\pi}$ , but $$y=\pi^{\left(\pi^{\pi^\pi}\right)}$$ which is a rather different animal. The value of $x$ has $57$ decimal digits; the value of $y$ has $10^{57}$ digits .  So Alexander Walker's impressive display of direct numerical calculation will avail nothing for deciding that $y$ is not an integer, neither in $1873$ nor in $2013,$ and perhaps not in $2153$ either. (""We should attempt to destroy the aliens."") More powerful theoretical methods will be required.

390850,"Integrating $\int^{\infty}_0 e^{-x^2}\,dx$ using Feynman's parametrization trick","I stumbled upon this short article on last weekend, it introduces an integral trick that exploits differentiation under the integral sign . On its last page, the author, Mr. Anonymous, left several exercises without any hints, one of them is to evaluate the Gaussian integral
$$
\int^\infty_0 e^{-x^2} \,dx= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$
using this parametrization trick. I had been evaluating it through trial and error using different paramatrizations, but no luck so far. Here are what I have tried so far: A first instinct would be do something like:$$
I(b) = \int^\infty_0 e^{-f(b)x^2}\,dx
$$
for some permissible function $f(\cdot)$, differentiating it will lead to a simple solvable ode:
$$
\frac{I'(b)}{I(b)} = -\frac{f'(b)}{2f(b)}
$$
which gives:
$$
I(b) = \frac{C}{\sqrt{f(b)}}.
$$
However, finding this constant $C$ basically is equivalent to evaluating the original integral, we are stuck here without leaving this parametrization trick framework. A second try involves an exercise on the same page:
$$
I(b) = \int^\infty_0 e^{-\frac{b^2}{x^2}-x^2}dx.
$$
Taking derivative and rescaling the integral using change of variable we have:
$$
I'(b) = -2I(b).
$$
This gives us another impossible to solve constant $C$ in:
$$
I(b) = C e^{-2b}
$$
without leaving this framework yet again. The third try is trying modify Américo Tavares's answer in this MSE question :
$$
I(b) = \int^\infty_0 be^{-b^2x^2}\,dx.
$$
It is easy to show that:
$$
I'(b) = \int^\infty_0 e^{-b^2x^2}\,dx - \int^\infty_0 2b^2 x^2 e^{-b^2x^2}\,dx = 0
$$
by an integration by parts identity:
$$
\int^\infty_0 x^2 e^{- c x^2}\,dx = \frac{1}{2c}\int^\infty_0 e^{- c x^2}\,dx .
$$
Then $I(b) = C$, ouch, stuck again at this constant. Notice in that Proving $\displaystyle\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt \pi}{2}$ question, Bryan Yocks's answer is somewhat similar to the idea of parametrization, however he has to introduce another parametric integration to produce a definite integral leading to $\arctan$. Is there such a one shot parametrization trick solution like the author Anonymous claimed to be ""creative parameterizations and a dose of differentiation under the integral""?","['definite-integrals', 'improper-integrals', 'leibniz-integral-rule', 'integration']"

390864,Homomorphisms between $ \mathbb{Z} $ modules.,"Calculate $\newcommand\Hom{\operatorname{Hom}}\Hom(\mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z_{p^\infty},\mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z_{p^\infty})$. Where $ \mathbb Z_{p^\infty}= \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}\bar{\langle\frac1{p^k}\rangle}$ for $p$ prime. As $\mathbb Z$ and  $\mathbb Z_{p^\infty}$ are $\mathbb Z$-modules then applying the theorem $\Hom_A ( \bigoplus_{i \in I} M_i, \prod_{j \in J} N_j ) \cong\prod_{(i,j) \in I \times J} \Hom(M_i,N_j)$ because for finite indices have $\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n}M_i = \prod_{i=1}^n M_1$. Then the problem reduces to find those $\Hom$ where $$ \Hom(\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} $$
$$ \Hom(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_{p^\infty}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p^\infty}$$ 
but  $\Hom(\mathbb{Z}_{p^\infty},\mathbb{Z})$ and  $\Hom(\mathbb{Z}_{p^\infty},\mathbb{Z}_{p^\infty})$ not how to calculate them.","['modules', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
