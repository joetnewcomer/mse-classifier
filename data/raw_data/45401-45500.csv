454139,Limit of cosines product,"Let $\displaystyle P_n:=\prod_{k=1}^n \cos\frac{\pi}{k+2}$. Evaluate $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to \infty} P_n$. I've only shown that the limit is positive. Let $\vartheta_k:=\pi/(k+2)$. We have $\log P_n=\sum_{k=1}^n \log\cos\vartheta_k$. Now, 
$$\log\cos\vartheta_k=-\frac{1}{2}\log(1+\tan^2\vartheta_k)>-\frac{1}{2}\tan^2\vartheta_k=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\sin^2\vartheta_k}{\cos^2\vartheta_k}>-2\vartheta_k^2.$$
Therefore we can write that
$$\log P_n>-2\pi^2\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{(k+2)^2}>-2\pi^2\int_2^{\infty}\frac{dx}{x^2}=-\pi^2$$
i.e. $P_n>e^{-\pi^2}$.","['calculus', 'limits']"
454140,On the volume of a parallelepiped,"Let $P$ be a parallelepiped with all of its vertices lattice points. Define $A,B,C$ and $D$ as follows: $A$ = the number of lattice points  strictly inside $P$. $B$ = the number lattice points which are on the faces of $P$ but not on the edges. $C$ = the number of lattice points which are on the edges of $P$ but not on the vertices. $D$ = the number of lattice points which are on the vertices of $P$ (i.e., the number of vertices) Something interesting (at least for me) that I have read somewhere recently is that the volume of $P$ is equal to $A+\frac 12B + \frac 14C + \frac 18D$. I can not prove it. So if you know a proof, please let me know.",['geometry']
454158,writing the difference of two algebraic sets as an algebraic set,"Let $S$ be an algebraic set of $k^n$, where $k$ is a field and let $f \in k[x] \doteq k[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$. I am interested in expressing $Y \doteq S-Z(f)$ as an algebraic set, i.e. as the zero set of some polynomials. Intuitively i can see that $Y$ corresponds to $(I_S)_f\doteq I_S \left(k[x] \right)_f$, that is the ideal generated by the vanishing ideal of $S$ in the localized ring $\left(k[x] \right)_f$. In other words $Y=Z((I_S)_f)$. The problem with this expression is that $(I_S)_f$ is not an ideal in a polynomial ring, so that i am not sure whether $Y$ is an algebraic set, strictly speaking. Any way to resolve this?","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
454161,Knock-out tournament: pruning number of teams after each round,"Suppose I start with $N$ teams ($N$ is even) which are randomly paired with each other in the first round. $\frac N2$ teams progress into the next round. I want this process to repeat itself until one team remains. But this is problematic if we have an odd number of teams remaining after a round concludes. My questions: If the number of teams is odd after a round concludes, how should I adjust the number of teams? Obviously I could just eliminate an extra team, but is there a more efficient way to handle this so I don't have to keep eliminating teams after each round? I suppose I would have to try and get $N$ onto the pathway $(1,2,4,8,16,\dots)$? Given the pruning approach I adopt, how do I derive the number of rounds in the tournament?",['sequences-and-series']

454176,Hexagonal circle packings in the plane,"I have been reading the paper Spiral hexagonal circle packings in the plane (Alan F. Beardon, Tomasz Dubejko and Kenneth Stephenson, Geometriae Dedicata Volume 49, Issue 1, pp 39-70), which proves that “these ’coherent’ [Doyle] spirals, together with the regular hexagonal packing, give all possible hexagonal circle packings in the plane”. On the obvious reading, this claim is straightforwardly false.

454190,Approximate inverse matrix,"Does a method exist to calculate the approximate inverse matrix for a matrix whose elements are small?
To be clearer, let's suppose the elements of the matrix $A$ to be function of a small parameter, i.e. $a_{ij} = a_{ij} (\epsilon)$. Is it possible to obtain the elements of the inverse $A^{-1}$ avoiding to calculate it before and then to study the limit for $\epsilon \rightarrow0$.

454193,What is the difference between a discrete function and a continuous function,"Intuitively it seems that both concepts should be disjoint because if a function is discrete then it has some holes on it and if a function is continuous then it doesn't have holes. But now I'm not sure because, from my understanding, a function may be continuous at $x_{0}$ if $x_{0}$ is an accumulation point in its domain such that $\lim_{x\to x_0}f=f(x_{0})$. So for example the function $f:\mathbb{Q}\to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)=x$ is such that $\lim _{x\to x_0}f=x_{0}=f(x_{0})$ and then $f$ is continuous at any point in its domain but also it's discrete.

454194,Why are analytic functions functions of $z$ and not of $\bar{z}$?,"I was reading a note on complex analysis and was stuck on  one line: Cauchy-Riemann equations Alternatively, the C-R equations can be written as
  $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar z}=0,$$

Hint by Parth Thakkat : $$\int \dfrac {\sqrt{x+1}} {x^{7/2}} dx$$ $$ = \int \dfrac {\sqrt{x+1}} {x^{1/2}} \cdot \dfrac{dx} {x^{3}}$$ $$ = \int \sqrt{1+\dfrac 1 x} \cdot \dfrac{dx} {x^{3}}$$ Take $t^2 = 1 + \dfrac 1 x$ and note that $ \dfrac 1 x = t^2 - 1$ More Hint : $t^2 = 1 + \dfrac 1 x$ $\implies 2tdt = -\dfrac 1 {x^2}dx$ Next $$ = \int t dx/x^3$$ Since $dx = -2tx^2 dt$ $$= \int t(-2t)(t^2-1) dt$$
$$ = -2\int t^4-t^2 dt$$
$$ = -2(\dfrac{t^5} {5} - \dfrac{t^3}{3} + C$$

Is this correct? Because this sounds as if $\epsilon$ is just a dummy variable, and that there is such a thing as, say, a ""5-ball"" meaning $\{y\in M:d(x,y)<5\}$. Shouldn't the correct definition be something along the lines of ""The $\epsilon$-ball about a point $x$ in a metric space $M$ is the set $\{y\in M:$ for each $\epsilon >0, d(x,y)<\epsilon\}$."" ?","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'terminology', 'analysis']"

454279,Volume of the projection of the unit cube on a hyperplane,"Let $C_n\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be the $n$-dimensional cube with side $1$, and let $P_k$ be any $k$-dimensional plane, $k\leq n$. What is the maximal $k$-volume $V_{n,k}$ of the projection of $C_n$ on $P_k$? Quite obviously, the minimal area should be $1$, obtained by taking $C_n = [0,1]^n$ and projecting it on $\{\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n|x_{k+1}=\ldots=x_n=0\}$. I think the maximum should be obtained by projecting onto something orthogonal to one of the maximal diagonals of the cube, but I haven't found any proof of this, nor a formula for the volume so obtained. I am particularly interested in the case $k = n-1$. I got an upper bound for $V_{n,k}$. We can inscribe $C_n$ in the $n$-ball of radius $\sqrt{n}$. The projection of such a sphere on a $k$-plane is a $k$-ball of radius $\sqrt{n}$ containing the projection of $C_n$. Its volume is
$$V(n,k) = \frac{(n\pi)^\frac{k}{2}}{\Gamma\left(1+\frac{k}{2}\right)}\geq V_{n,k}$$
where $\Gamma$ is the Gamma function. Conjecture: As $n,k$ become big we have the asymptotical behavior $V(n,k)\sim V_{n,k}$. Would anyone care to try to prove this, if not to solve the initial problem? Assuming the conjecture to be true, we have the asymptotical behavior for $V(n,k)$ given by the estimate of the volume of the $k$-ball for $k\gg 1$:
$$V_{n,k}\sim V(n,k)\sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\left(\frac{2\pi e}{k}\right)^\frac{k}

COMMENT: The problem asks for a (infinite) sequence such that the first two numbers must be in different halves, The first three numbers must be in different thirds, the first four numbers must be in different fourths and so on. It is known that no sequence of length more that 17 can satisfy these conditions !!  See here . However, the proof is messy. I was hoping that showing that there is no infinite sequence with this property is much easier. And that's why I am posting this question, to see if there is any simpler proof for the infinite case.

By the linearity of $f$, $\|f(\lambda x)\| = \|\lambda f(x)\|$. Since $\|\cdot\|$ is a norm it is true. Finally we need to show the triangle inequality. Starting with the linearity of $f$, $\|f(x+y)\|=\|f(x)+f(y)\|$. Since $\|\cdot\|$ is a norm we can write:

Case 1: $0 \le \alpha < 1$ In this case, the section looks like a triangle, and the volume of interest is 1 minus the volume of the lower left tetrahedron, i.e., $$V = 1 - \int_0^\alpha \int_0^{\alpha-x} \int_0^{\alpha-x-y} dz\,dy\,dx = 1 - \frac{\alpha^3}{6}.$$ Case 3: $2 < \alpha \le 3$. Here, the section is again a triangle, and the volume of interest is the upper right tetrahedron, i.e., $$V = \int_{\alpha-2}^1 \int_{\alpha-x-1}^1 \int_{\alpha-x-y}^1 dz\,dy\,dx = \frac{(3-\alpha)^3}{6}.$$ Case 2: $1 \le \alpha \le 2$. This is where I'm sort of stuck. The section is a hexagon, with one of the inequalities being $\alpha-x-y \le z \le 1$, hence the innermost integral should be $\int_{\alpha-x-y}^1 dz$. The projection of the hexagon slice onto the $xy$-plane is described by $y \ge \alpha-1-x$ and $y \le \alpha-x$. Hence, the area of the hexagon projection is $$ A = \int_0^{\alpha-1} \int_{\alpha-x-1}^1 dy\,dx + \int_{\alpha-1}^1 \int_0^{\alpha-x} dy\,dx$$ Question: When I move from $A$ to $V$ am I allowed to distribute the innermost integral between the summing terms, i.e. is it correct to write $$V = \int_0^{\alpha-1} \int_{\alpha-x-1}^1 \int_{\alpha-x-y}^1 dz\,dy\,dx + \int_{\alpha-1}^1 \int_0^{\alpha-x} \int_{\alpha-x-y}^1 dz\,dy\,dx \quad ??$$ If not, what's the approach?

I find the probability as: P(multiple of 5) OR  P(odd number)=P(multiple of 5) + P(odd number)-[P(multiple of 5) AND P(odd number)]=2/10+5/10-[(2/10)(5/10)]=6/10 (which is the correct answer) Notice that I used the assumption that rolling a multiple of 5 is independent of rolling an odd number, since I essentially multiplied their probabilities to get the answer. However, rolling a multiple of 5 INVOLVES rolling an odd number in one case, namely rolling a 5. So did I get the correct answer by fluke? Can the multiplication rule also be used to describe non-independent events sometimes ?",['probability']
454624,Why base analysis on the natural numbers rather than on sets?,"I'm looking Bishop's Foundations of Constructive Analysis . I decided to look at the Amazon's page searching for some elucidative review about if it's a worthy read, I've found this review . The first phrase of the second paragraph says: The point is that, if you want, you can base analysis on the natural numbers rather than on sets. I don't get the specific meaning of this nor what difference it would make, we build sets of natural numbers on analysis, right? What's the point? A total avoidance of the concept of sets? For what purpose? Bishop mentions a lot about computational existence and computational ambiguity - I'm not really sure but I feel that they are connected with the basing of analysis on natural numbers (instead of sets) somehow.","['complex-analysis', 'foundations', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

It probably happened because I think of manifolds as subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ and most of the time for convenience $n=3$. Now that I realized that the same word is used to mean two different things: one is the coefficients with respect to a basis and one is a continuous function. I am starting to wonder whether there is any relation between the two. Is there?

454945,Remainders of binomial coefficients.,"Motivation: It is easy to notice that a polynomial map $f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ does not need to have only integer coefficient. For example, $f(x) = \frac{x(x-1)}{2}$ does have rational coefficients and maps $ \mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$. This gives an easy reason for an polynomial with integer coefficients not to give all possible remainders modulo some number $m$: for instance, $x^2 - x = 2\frac{x(x-1)}{2}$ is always $0$ modulo $2$, and in a similar spirit $f(x) = x^2$ is always $0$ or $1$ modulo $4$. More generally, one can show that  a polynomial map $f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of the polynomials $\binom{x}{d}$ for $d \in \mathbb{N}$. I am looking for a class of polynomials $f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ which have the property that for any $m \in \mathbb N$ and any remainder $r \in \{0,1,\dots,m-1\}$ there exists some $a \in \mathbb N$ such that $f(a) \equiv r \pmod{m}$.

The actual orders of the elements are:
(element, order) (1,1) (2,10) (3,5) (4,5) (5,10) (6,10) (7,10) (8,5) (9,5) (10,2) From this data, there are 4 elements of order 10, 4 elements of order 5, but only 1 element of order 2 and one element of order 1. Thus, the order appear to be skewed more towards higher values. In a general sense does this hold, or is is more uniform?","['group-theory', 'number-theory']"

455041,When does a polynomial take all possible residues modulo any integer?,"(This question is inspired by a question about remainders of binomial coefficients I asked recently.) Consider the polynomial maps $f:\ \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$. These include the polynomials with integer coefficients, but also functions like $f(x) = \frac{x(x-1)}{2} = \binom{x}{2}$. One can show that any such polynomial map $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of the polynomials $\binom{x}{d}$ for $d \in \mathbb{N}$. I am interested in polynomial maps which take on all residues modulo all integers. More precisely, a polynomial $f$ is interesting for me if for any integer $m \geq 2$ and for any integer $0 \leq r < m$ there exists an integer $n$ with $f(n) \equiv r \pmod{m}$. One such polynomial is $f(x) = x$. As explained in the mentioned other questions, polynomials $f(x) = x^d$ don't have the aforementioned property (for $d > 1$). I had a (naive) hope that the polynomials ${x \choose d}$ would do the trick, but they don't work either. After some more thought, I discovered that degree $2$ polynomials can never work. This is because for $f(x) = ax^2 +bx +c$ the condition $f(n) \equiv r \pmod{p}$ can be rewritten as $$\left(n+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 \equiv \frac{1}{a}\left(r-c+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right) \pmod{p}$$ (assuming numerators and denumerators of $a,b,c$ are coprime to $p$). Hence, $f(n)$ does not have the residue $r$ if $p$ is large enough and $\frac{1}{a}\left(r-c+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right)$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $p$. This leaves me doubtful about polynomials of higher degrees. I can't think of a general argument or an example of an interesting polynomial, though. Question: Does there exist a polynomial map $f:\ \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$, different than $f(x) = x$, with the aforementioned property that for any integer $m \geq 2$ and for any integer $0 \leq r < m$ there exists an integer $n$ with $f(n) \equiv r \pmod{m}$.","['abstract-algebra', 'number-theory']"

All candidates $f_i$ fixes $\mathbb{Q}$ and is obvious that all preserves sums, $f_1$ obviously preserves product also since is the identity, but is cumberstone to show that $f_i(xy)=f_i(x)_if(y)$ to conclude $f_i\in\Gamma(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}):\mathbb{Q})$.","['galois-theory', 'extension-field', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

455138,"Confidence interval for Uniform($\theta$, $\theta + a$)","I am encountering a difficulty with the following task.  Have I made a mistake, or is this an inherent flaw in the notion of confidence intervals?  (Other such flaws exist.) Consider a random sample $X_1,\ldots , X_n$ from a Uniform($\theta$, $\theta + a$) distribution, where $\theta$ is unknown and $a$ is known.  We wish to determine a confidence interval for $\theta$. The reader may verify the following details: The statistics $Y=\text{min}_i X_i$ and $Z=\text{max}_i X_i$ are jointly sufficient for $\theta$.  For  $\theta \le c_1 \le c_2 \le \theta + a$,
$P\{c_1 \le Y \le Z \le c_2\} = [(c_2 - c_1)/a]^n$.  For $0 < \gamma < 1$, set $d_1 =(1-\sqrt[n]\gamma)/2$ and $d_2 =(1+\sqrt[n]\gamma)/2$.  Then
$\gamma = P\{\theta + ad_1 \le Y \le Z \le \theta + ad_2\} = 
P\{Z -ad_2 \le \theta \le Y-ad_1\}$.  Thus, $[Z -ad_2, Y -ad_1]$ is a $\gamma$ confidence interval for $\theta$. Now here's the difficulty:  If we observe $Z - Y > a\sqrt[n]\gamma$, then $Z -ad_2 > Y -ad_1$, so our formula yields a nonsensical answer.  Have I made an error in my calculations?  Or is this one of those problems with confidence intervals? (Homework?  I guess so - but a homework problem that I wrote for my students.

455142,The Denjoy Theorem,"I'm currently studying Denjoy's theorem, which says the following: Theorem If $f$ is a diffeomorphism of $S^1$  with a irrational number rotation $ \rho$ and the variation of $f^{'}$ (denoted by $Var(f))$is bounded then $f$ is conjugated  with  the irrational rotation $R_{\rho}$. The heart of the proof of this theorem is an argument of limited distortion. Sketch of proof: By the classification theorem of Poincaré, we have the following dichotomy for  $ S^1 $ homeomorphisms   with irrational rotation number $\rho$, or $f$ is semi-conjugated ith  the irrational rotation $R_{\rho}$ or $f$ is conjugated  with  the irrational rotation $R_{\rho}$. More precisely, for all $x,y\in S^1$ we have $\omega(x)=\omega(y),$ and we  have only two options: Or $\omega(x)=S^1$ and $f$ is conjugated  with  the irrational rotation $R_{\rho}$ Or $\omega(x)=S^1$ is a cantor set and $f$ is semi-conjugated ith  the irrational rotation $R_{\rho}$ Our goal is to show that the (2.) can not occur. We assume by contradiction that 
$\omega(x)\neq S ¹$, then $S^1\setminus \omega(x)$ is a countable union of intervals.  Let be $I$ one of these intervals, then $I, f(I), \ldots, f^n(I)$ are all disjoint intervals. Put  $I_n=f^n(I)$ then we have \begin{eqnarray}
l(I_n)+l(I_{-n})&=&\int (f^n(t))^{'}dt+ \int (f^{-n}(t))^{'}dt
\\
&=&
\int [ (f^n(t))^{'}+(f^{-n}(t))^{'}]dt
\\
&\geq&
\int \sqrt{ (f^n(t))^{'}\cdot(f^{-n}(t))^{'} }dt
\end{eqnarray} The heart of the proof of this theorem is an argument of limited distortion: Lemma: Put $g=\log |f^{'}|$. Let $J$ be an interval in $S^1$ , and suppose the interiors of the  intervals $J, f (J ), . . . , f^{n−1}(J )$ are pairwise disjoint. Then for any $n ∈ Z$,
$$
Var(g) ≥ | \log(f^n)^{'}(x) − \log(f^n)^{'}(y)|=| \log(f^n)^{'}(x)\cdot\log(f^{-n})^{'}(y)|
$$
Using this lemma and some technicalities we obtain:
$$
l(I_n)+l(I_{-n})\geq \exp(-{\frac{1}{2}Var(g)})l(I)
$$
this is absurd because it implies that $\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}l(I_n)=\infty$
contradicting the fact that the intervals $I_n$ are disjoint. MY QUESTION: In the midst of this demonstration have a technical lemma, which enables us to work the idea of limited distortion in this proof: Let be $R_{\alpha}$ a irrational rotation, if $x\in S^1$ there are infinitely many indices $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that the intervals

I_{k}=R_{\alpha}^{k}(x,R_{\alpha}^{-n}x);~~0\leq |k|<n
