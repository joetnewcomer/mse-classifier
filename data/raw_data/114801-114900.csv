1679036,How do we know that $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{R}}$ exists at all?,"So i just had one of those existential crisis, i thought previously that the set of all functions (including functions from reals to complex, from matrices to sequences, and even from functions to functions) existed. but, recalling spivak's (1994, pg 47) formal definition of a function: A function is a collection of pairs of numbers with the following property:
  if $(a, b)$ and $(a, c)$ are both in the collection, then $b = c$; in other words, the
  collection must not contain two different pairs with the same first element. so the set of all functions would be $$\mathscr{A_F}=\{f|f\notin f\text{ and if } (a,b),(a,c)\in f\implies b=c\}$$ ($(f\notin f)$ since $f$ is a set per this definition)
i think that without too much difficulty we can show that $\mathscr{A_F}\in\mathscr{A_F}\iff\mathscr{A_F}\notin\mathscr{A_F}$, so, just like the proof by russel, the set of all functions is non existent. so i have like this doubt that not every arbitrary collection of functions is a set, more precisely, how can do we know that $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{R}}$ (set of all functions from R to R) exists at all,?

1679094,Proof using Cauchy Integral Theorem,"Suppose that I have the following integral: $$ \int_L \frac {dz}{z^2+1} $$ I need to show that this is equal to $0$ if $L$ is any closed rectifiable simple curve in the outside of the closed unit disc. Simply put, this is where $|z| > 1$. Initially, I thought that because ""closed rectifiable simple curve"" is a crucial part of the Cauchy Integral Theorem, the best way to go about this is to show that the rest of theorem must hold. That is, the domain, $|z|>1$, is a simply connected domain, and that $f(z)$ is analytic in this domain. However, the domain does not appear to be a simply connected domain, as everything on the inside of the unit disc would prevent it from being so. By definition, a simply connected domain is one where any simple curve in that domain can be shrunk to a point that's also in the domain, so therefore, it may be possible to shrink a curve in this domain to the inside of the circle! I must be missing a key part to this proof, because as of now, this contradicting statement has me stumped. Any thoughts/ideas?","['complex-analysis', 'complex-integration']"
1679115,Concerning an infinite server queue with Poisson arrivals,"Here's the statement of the problem (from Ross's Introduction to Probability Models ): For those unfamiliar with ""infinite server queues,"" they are described here . In this case, however, the service times are not exponentially distributed; rather, they are distributed according to some common distribution $G$. It follows that $X(t)$, the number of customers that have completed service by time $t$ and that arrived at time $s, s\le t,$ is Poisson distributed with mean $$E[X(t)]=\lambda \int_{0}^{t}G(t-s)ds=\lambda \int_{0}^{t}G(y)dy.$$ Similarly, the distribution of $Y(t)$, the number of customers being served at time $t$ and that arrived at time $s, s \le t,$ is Poisson distributed with mean $$E[Y(t)]=\lambda \int_{0}^{t}\bar G(t-s)ds=\lambda \int_{0}^{t}\bar G(y)dy$$ where $\bar G(t-s) = 1 - G(t-s)$. Now, for part $(a)$, let $A =\{\text{the first customer to arrive is also the first to depart} \}$, i.e., our desired event; and suppose the first customer arrives at time $0$ and departs at time $t$. Then, we consider the event $A$ conditioned on the event in which $0$ customers have completed service by time $t$, i.e., $$ \mathbb P[A | X(t) = 0] = \exp\left\{ -\lambda \int_{0}^{t}G(y)dy\right\}.  $$ Ok, I get that. But then, for some reason, the following is the answer: $$ \mathbb P[A] = \int_{0}^{\infty} \left( \exp\left\{ -\lambda \int_{0}^{t}G(y)dy\right\} \right) dG(t).  $$ And I don't really understand where this comes from. If anybody could shed some light on this, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.","['stochastic-processes', 'queueing-theory', 'probability', 'poisson-process']"
1679133,Computing normal closure and Galois group of quintic $x^5 - 3$,"Having trouble big time. I am asked to find the normal closure for the extension $\mathbb{Q}(a):\mathbb{Q}$ where $a$ is the fifth root of $3$ and real. Then I am asked to find Galois groups for the extension above and $N:\mathbb{Q}$, both. Now, I found $N$ to be $\mathbb{Q}(a,\omega)$ where $\omega=\cos{\frac{2 \pi}{5}}+i \sin{\frac{2 \pi}{5}}$, the fifth root of unity. Problem is, for this
$N:\mathbb{Q}=\mathbb{Q}(a,\omega):\mathbb{Q}$ extension, finding the Galois group, equivalently finding the automorphisms $Aut_{\mathbb{Q}}(\mathbb{Q}(a,\omega)$ is looking unbelievably tedious and difficult. I mean, the elements of $N=\mathbb{Q}(a,\omega)$ will be something like $p+qa+ra^2+...+ta^4+w\omega+x\omega^2+...+ba\omega+ca^2\omega+...+ga^3\omega^3$ where coefficients are in $\mathbb{Q}$. Basically, the form of the element is massive. Everything except $\omega^4$ terms appear(since $\omega^4=-(\omega^3+\omega^2+\omega+1)$. ..Am I right so far? If so, finding automorphisms on such elements must be so tedious...say, conjugates(if I should be calling them that), $p-qa+ra^2+...+ta^4+w\omega+x\omega^2+...+ba\omega+ca^2\omega+...+ga^3\omega^3$,$p+qa-ra^2+...+ta^4+w\omega+x\omega^2+...+ba\omega+ca^2\omega+...+ga^3\omega^3$ etc would still  be a $\mathbb{Q}$-automorphism so anything map as above would be in the Galois group, yes?

1679669,Show that $O$ traces out a circle in the pencil defined by $C$ and $M$,"Let $C$ be a circle and $M$ any point inside the circle. Consider a moving chord $AB$ of the circle which stuntedness a right angle at $M$. Let $O$ be the midpoint of this chord and let $H$ be the altitude from $M$ on $AB$ so that the angle of $BHM=90$degrees. If we consider $M$ as a degenerate circle of radius zero, show that $O$ traces out a circle in the pencil defined by $C$ and $M$ as the chord $AB$ moves around the circle. Furthermore, show that $H$ lies on the same circle. So I've already shown that $P_c(O)=-P_m(O)$. I can somewhat see that $O$ traces out a circle inside of $C$ with the point $M$ in the circle, but i don't really know how to explicitly show that $O$ traces out the circle using this power property.

Let $\Phi$ be the Thom class of $N_{Z/X}$ . The authors claim that $$\int_{S_x} \Phi = \int_{E_x} \Phi$$ , because $S_x$ and $E_x$ are homotopic modulo the region in $E$ where $\Phi$ is zero. In this context, this justification makes no sense. The unique possible theorem that they're alluding to is contained in the answer of invariance of integrals for homotopy equivalent spaces .

1680520,How to find the original coordinates of a point inside an irregular rectangle?,"I'm a third year computer science student. I'm working on a project Data-show touch screen In schools classrooms . I'll try to explain my problem as much as I can. The project has three main components; A computer, a Data-show and a webcam. The teacher will plug the data-show in the computer and the computer screen will appear on the wall of the classroom to all students. The main purpose of the project is to turn the image of the screen displayed on the classroom wall into interactive screen; when the teacher tabs with his finger on an image of a Button displayed on the wall, the webcam that is connected to the computer will capture the position of the teacher's finger and find his (x,y) coordinates for a reference point on the wall, and raise a click event in the related (x,y) position on the screen. The screen of the computer has two dimensions; Width->X and Height->Y . And for every point in the screen such as P , it could be located on the screen using two numbers (Px,Py) , where Px is the distance between the point P and the left side of the screen, and Py is the distance between the point P and the top side of the screen. In other words, the reference for all points in the screen is the top left corner of the screen. The data-show will display an irregular Quadrilateral shape of the screen on the wall. the shapes will not be regular squares or rectangles due to the angle that the teacher puts the data-show in. What I'm asking for are the equations that will calculate the (x,y) point on the screen that represents the (x,y) tapped point on the wall. There is mainly four shapes the data-show may display on the wall. For each shape of them the only known things are the coordinates of the four angles(corners) of the quadrilateral shape. 1. an optimal rectangle The displayed image on wall has a very low chance to shape an optimal rectangle, but it's the basic shape that could be formed. Suppose that the red point P'(Px',Py') represents the coordinates of the place the teacher tapped on with his finger. To get the original (Px,Py) coordinates from the point (Px',Py') on the wall, I can do the following. Calculate the width->X' and the height->Y' of the displayed image by the law of distance between two points. find the ratio between X & X' , and between Y & Y' . I'll call the first ratio rx and the second ratio ry . Multiply Px' by rx to get Px , and multiply Py' by ry to get Py . 2. an optimal trapezoidal. The displayed image on wall could also shape an optimal trapezoidal. I asked some of my friends from the applied mathematics college to help me to find the two equations to find the original coordinates of the point, and they did some calculations and came out with these two equations; In this shape To find X : and to find Y I can use the same way used in the rectangle; finding the ratio between Y and the height of the trapezoidal H . 3. an irregular quadrilateral. My question is about this shape, the data-show in most times will shape an irregular shape. Imagine this shape like None of the shape's lines is vertical or horizontal, all lines may have different lengths and they may have different angels from each other. My question is I'm searching for equations that will find the original P(x,y) point of the point P'(X',Y') .

For simplicity, suppose $f=2$, and let $f_1$ and $f_2$ represent the first and second columns of X (and so the first and second features), respectively. Suppose we have a positive correlation between the features: $r(f_1,f_2)>0$.  So then we can regress $f_2$ on $f_1$ to find $f_2 = \beta f_1 + \epsilon$ for some regression weight $\beta >0$ and where we may assume, if we'd like, that $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$. Now consider the first principal component scores for this dataset -- or, roughly speaking, the ""projection"" of the data onto the first principal component.  By this I mean that if we perform a singular value decomposition on $X$ to obtain $X=UDV'$, then we take the first column of $UD$ to be the score of each sample with respect to the first principal component.   We can refer to the first column as $d_1 \vec{u_1}$.

1680917,"In an extension field, is there any difference between the original field and its isomorphic copy in the extension field?","I recently came to the topic of field extensions in my abstract algebra course, and there has been a slight issue which has been bothering me that I was hoping I might be able to clear up. We have defined an extension field for a field F to be a field E such that $F \subseteq E$ and that $F$ is a field under the operations of $E$ restricted to $F$. Sounds easy enough and I realize that we have been using objects like this for a long time. For example we know that $\mathbb{C}$ is an extension field of $\mathbb{R}$. Something that has been bothering me a little bit though is that we have started proving theorems where we need to construct extension fields, but these extension fields don't seem to contain the original field $F$ but rather an isomorphic copy of $F$. For example if our field was $F$, then $F[x]/(p(x))$ is a field if $p(x)$ is irreducible, which contains a subfield isomorphic to $F$. It seems strange that in the theorems (Gallian's Text) that $F[x]/(p(x))$ is considered an extension field for $F$ even though it doesn't really contain $F$ as a subset, but rather another set which is isomorphic. I don't think I would have normally though this as being much of a problem, but I remember that earlier in the text Gallian seems to mention that even when structures are isomorphic and that they behave essentially the same, that we need to keep in mind that they are not exactly the same. If this distinction does matter, why not make the definition of an extension field just say that $E$ is an extension field of $F$ if $E$ has a subfield isomorphic to $F$? This would seem to include all cases.

However, neither the category of commutative rings nor the category of affine schemes are cartesian closed, so things like the tangent bundle don't seem to carry over. A comment to this question does seem to say that restricting to a subcategory of ""small"" affine schemes does yield cartesian closedness says: If you restrict to the category of $\Bbbk$-algebras of finite dimension over $\Bbbk$, then the answer is yes, since $\sf Hom$ scheme constructions work well for flat proper maps. I don't understand the explanation because I don't know enough algebraic geometry, but I would like to know whether we really need to work with schemes over a field, or can we use synthetic differential geometry for $\Bbbk$ a general ring. I guess what I'm really asking is: What is the cartesian closed category (topos, really) in which we should do
  differential geometry of schemes, and where can I read more about this? My hope is that the synthetic theory will provide the geometric intuition behind the impenetrable wall of formalism I see in most books. If we identify schemes with their functors of points then perhaps we can say our topos is the topos of sheaves on the big Zariski (?) site? Is the category of schemes actually cartesian closed (as a Grothendieck topos)?","['big-picture', 'synthetic-differential-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request', 'category-theory']"
1681272,Why does the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality even have a name?,"When I came across the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality the other day, I found it really weird that this was its own thing, and it had lines upon lines of proof . I've always thought the geometric definition of dot multiplication: 
$$|{\bf a }||{\bf b }|\cos \theta$$ is equivalent to the other, algebraic definition: $$a_1\cdot b_1+a_2\cdot b_2+\cdots+a_n\cdot b_n$$
And since the inequality is directly implied by the geometric definition (the fact that $\cos(\theta)$ is $1$ only when $\bf a$ and $\bf b$ are collinear), then shouldn't the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality be the world's most obvious and almost-no-proof-needed thing? Can someone correct me on where my thought process went wrong?","['inequality', 'terminology', 'inner-products', 'geometry', 'linear-algebra']"
1681284,$f'$ decreasing everywhere but not defined in one point. Is $f$ concave?,"Small issue: Suppose that $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function, differentiable except on a finite set of points, let say in one point $y$. For $x<y$ and $x>y$ we have $f''<0$. Moreover, $f'$ is larger on $[0,y[$ than on $]y,1]$. Overall: $f'$ is decreasing everywhere but not defined on $y$. Can I say that $f$ is concave? Why?

1681294,Significance of multiplying $-1$ by $-1$,"Maybe this is a weird question but it's been bugging me. In the childhood we were taught that $4 \times 3$ means $4+4+4$ i.e. adding 4, 3 times. My question is then how would you explain $-1 \times -1$ using some kind of mathematical logic? I want to know the significance in real life. It doesn't have a meaning when I say adding $-1$, $-1$ times.","['algebra-precalculus', 'arithmetic']"
1681303,"Probability of picking 3 numbers in sequence, with k random picks","I am struggling a bit with this problem, I think I am somehow close but I miss something. Let's assume we have numbers from $1$ to $30$, we pick $5$ random numbers (with repetition) and we want to know the probability to pick at least $3$ numbers in sequence. Denominator :
The total number of combinations without repetition should be $$30!/(5!*(30-5)!)$$ and with repetition: ( 5 5 6 7 8 ) is a valid sequence, this is what i am actually interested in $$(30+5-1)!/(5!*(30-1)!)$$ Numerator :
I should get the ways to pick $5$ numbers where at least $3$ are in a sequence.
There are $28$ ways to pick $3$ numbers in a row, if we just would pick $3$, but with $5$ I am having the problem. My approach is $28$ $+$ the way to pick the other $2$ numbers, that is $C(30+2-1,2)$ The flaw here I think is that I think I am counting twice some combinations. How can I get the number of combination of picking $3$ consecutive numbers with $5$ picks? Edit: To clarify
repetition is allowed, so $5\; 5\; 6\; 7\; 8$ is a valid pick.
Order is not important, so $5$ $5$ $6$ $7$ $8$ is the same as $6$ $7$ $8$ $5$ $5$.",['probability']
