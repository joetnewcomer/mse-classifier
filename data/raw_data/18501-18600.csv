153468,How does trigonometric substitution work?,"I have read my book, watched the MIT lecture and read Paul's Online Notes (which was pretty much worthless, no explanations just examples) and I have no idea what is going on with this at all. I understand that if I need to find something like $$\int \frac { \sqrt{9-x^2}}{x^2}dx$$ I can't use any other method except this one. What I do not get is pretty much everything else. It is hard to visualize the bounds of the substitution that will keep it positive but I think that is something I can just memorize from a table. So this is similar to u substitution except that I am not using a single variable but expressing x in the form of a trig function. How does this not change the value of the problem? To me it seems like it would, algebraically how is something like $$\int \frac { \sqrt{9-x^2}}{x^2}dx$$ the same as $$\int \frac {3\cos x}{9\sin^2 x}3\cos x \, dx$$ It feels like if I were to put in numbers for $x$ that it would be a different answer. Anyways just assuming that works I really do not understand at all what happens next. ""Returning"" to the original variable to me should just mean plugging back in what you had from before the substitution but for whatever unknown and unexplained reason this is not true. Even though on problems before I could just plug back in my substitution of $u = 2x$, $\sin2u = \sin4x$ that would work fine but for whatever reason no longer works. I am not expected to do some pretty complex trigonometric manipulation with the use of a triangle which I do not follow at all, luckily though this process is not explained at all in my book so I think I am just suppose to memorize it. Then when it gets time for the answer there is no explanation at all but out of nowhere inverse sin comes in for some reason. $$\frac {- \sqrt{9-x^2}}{x} - \sin^{-1} (x/3) +c$$ I have no idea happened but neither does the author apparently since there is no explanation.","['calculus', 'integration']"

153602,Question about Halmos' Naive Set Theory,"Halmos proves shortly before the cited paragraph that finite subsets are not equivalent to themselves. He then says the following: The number of elements in a finite set E is, by definition, the unique natural number  equivalent to E ; we shall denote it by #(E) . It is clear that if the correspondence between E and #(E) is restricted to the finite subsets of some set X , the result is a function from a subset of the power set $\mathcal{P}(x)$ to $\omega$. This is all clear (a specification on dom[$E \rightarrow \#(E)$] of $s : s \subset X$). He then continues: This function is pleasantly related to the familiar set-theoretic relations and operations. Thus, for example, if $E$ and $F$ are finite sets such that $E \subset F$, then $\#(E) \leq \#(F)$. (The reason is that since $E \cong \#(E)$ and $F \cong \#(F)$, it follows that $\#(E)$ is equivalent to a subset of $\#(F)$.) I do not follow his reasoning. The fact itself is clear, but I do not see the implication which he is suggesting. Is he indicating that $E$, as a subset of $F$, will be mapped by this function to some natural number which is a subset of $\#(F)$? Edit: The passage continues: Another example is the assertion that if $E$ and $F$ are finite sets, then $E \bigcup F$ is finite, and, moreover, if $E$ and $F$ are disjoint, then $\#(E \bigcup F) = \#(E) + \#(F).$ The crucial step in the proof is the fact that if $m$ and $n$ are natural numbers, then the complement of $m$ in the sum $m+n$ is equivalent to $n$; the proof of this auxiliary fact is achieved by induction on $n$. Similar techniques prove that if $E$ and $F$ are finite sets, then so also are $E \times F$ and $E^F$, and, moreover, $\#(E \times F) = \#(E) * \#(F) $ and $\#(E^F) = \#(E)^{\#(F)}$.","['set-theory', 'functions']"

153610,Any nonabelian group of order $6$ is isomorphic to $S_3$?,"I've read a proof at the end of this document that any nonabelian group of order $6$ is isomorphic to $S_3$, but it feels clunky to me. I want to try the following instead: Let $G$ be a nonabelian group of order $6$. By Cauchy's theorem or the Sylow theorems, there is a element of order $2$, let it generate a subgroup $H$ of order $2$. Let $G$ act on the quotient set $G/H$ by conjugation. This induces a homomorphism $G\to S_3$. I want to show it's either injective or surjective to get the isomorphism. I know $n_3\equiv 1\pmod{3}$ and $n_3\mid 2$, so $n_3=1$, so there is a unique, normal Sylow $3$-subgroup. Also, $n_2\equiv 1\pmod{2}$, and $n_2\mid 3$, so $n_2=1$ or $3$. However, if $n_2=1$, then I know $G$ would be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, but then $G\cong C_2\times C_3\cong C_6$, a contradiction since $G$ is nonabelian. So $n_2=3$.

153611,Probability that the last ball is white?,"A jar contains $m=90$ white balls and $n=10$ red balls, the balls are drawn under the following constraints: the ball is thrown away if it is white; the ball is put back if it is red and another ball is drawn; this time, the ball is thrown away no matter what color it is. The question is, what is the probability to exhaust all balls and have the last one in white color? My guess is $\frac{1}{2}$ but I might be wrong. Please show how you deduce the answer. Thanks! EDIT: Thanks for posting the solution and simulation, which are all appreciated. B. E. Oakley and R. L. Perry discussed a very similar problem in their A Sampling Process paper published on The Mathematical Gazette, Vol. 49, No. 367 (Feb., 1965), pp. 42-44 . The problem presented in the paper is: A bag contains m > 0 black balls and n > 0 white balls. A sequence of balls from the bag is discarded in the following manner: (i) A ball is chosen at random and discarded.
(ii) Another ball is chosen at random from the remainder. If its colour is different from the last it is replaced in the bag and the process repeated from the beginning (i.e. (i)). If the second ball is the same colour as the first it is discarded and we proceed from
(ii). Thus the balls are sampled and discarded until a change in colour occurs, at which point the last ball is replaced and the process starts afresh. The question is: what is the probability that the final ball should be black? Their induction gives $\frac{1}{2}$ which is what I have here. Apparently having no constraint on colors like what's in the paper changes the situation significantly. But the story hasn't ended. At the end of their paper, they proposed a seemingly more interesting problem: What is the solution if there are balls of 3 different colours and the sampling process is as before?",['probability']

153697,The Goldbach Conjecture and Hardy-Littlewood Asymptotic,"A source I am reading refers to the Goldbach conjecture (that every even number is the sum of two primes), and then immediately follows with the ""Hardy-Littlewood conjecture"" that $\sum \limits_{n \leq N} \Lambda(n) \Lambda(N-n) = 2 \prod \limits_{p \geq 3} \left(1-\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) \left( \prod \limits_{p | N} \frac{p-1}{p-2}\right)N^{1+o(1)}$ which is termed ""Goldbach for almost all even numbers"", and apparently this also $\Longleftrightarrow \prod \limits_{p | N} (\frac{p-1}{p-2}) N^{1+o(1)} = O(\log N)^c$. Here, $\Lambda(n)$ denotes the Von-Mangoldt function. It then states the following theorem: Let $A \in \mathbb{R}$. Then for all but $\frac{x}{\log^A x}$ even numbers $N \leq x$, we have $\sum \limits_{n \leq N} \Lambda(n) \Lambda(N-n) = 2 \prod \limits_{p \geq 3} \left(1-\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) \left( \prod \limits_{p | N} \frac{p-1}{p-2}\right)N (1+o_A(1))$, where $o_A$ denotes the fact that the constant in the limiting behaviour may depend on $A$. Now I can't see how this is the same as Goldbach at all really. I can see that if $N= p+q$ is the sum of 2 primes then the corresponding term on the LHS will be nonzero, but the Von-Mangoldt function is also nonzero for powers of primes, so it might be nonzero for some $N= P^i + Q^j$. I am beginning to think the RHS may be some sort of probabilistic slant on the conjecture, but can't quite see it. It may be the case that the Von-Mangoldt function is just negligible on all prime powers except the primes themselves (this is certainly often the case), but at the least it seems like this should have been stated somewhere since it certainly doesn't seem like a trivial deduction to me. Or is this simply an ""approximation to Goldbach""; namely a relationship which seems to imply that Goldbach might well be true, but as I have said doesn't remove the problem of the prime powers? (Obviously I am aware that Goldbach is unproved, but the text doesn't clarify whether this is a proved statement weaker than Goldbach, or an unproved statement equivalent to Goldbach: I suspect the latter.) I also can't see how the ""$\Longleftrightarrow$"" follows from the first conjecture; I'd be very grateful if someone could help me understand what's going on here, at least heuristically if not formally. Next, the text goes on to ""prove"" Vinogradov from the latter theorem which has been stated (I say ""prove"" because I can't see how the proof works). It says: Corollary (Vinogradov) Every sufficiently large odd number is the sum of 3 primes.
  Proof: Let N be odd. Then taking $A=2$ in the theorem, there is some prime $p\leq N/2$ for which the Hardy-Littlewood asymptotic holds. In particular, $N-p$ is the sum of 2 primes. Now this time I really can't see what's happening: the sum over the Von-Mangoldt function on the LHS will surely just go to zero almost every time $N-n$ is a sum of 2 primes (unless this sum of 2 primes is a prime power of course), and I don't see how the RHS tells us nothing about the LHS except that it is not ""extremely small"". Could anyone explain what's going on here to me? It is possible I transcribed some of this material wrong, though I do not see where I might have made an error which could have caused all my confusions simultaneously. Again, any insight you could provide would be desperately appreciated; many thanks in advance.","['prime-numbers', 'conjectures', 'number-theory']"
153701,how to solve differential equation $y^4 = k^2 (y^2 + y'^2\csc^2\alpha)$?,"What's the solution of the differential equation $y^4 = k^2 (y^2 + y'^2\csc^2\alpha)$, where $y$ is a function of $x$ and $\alpha$ is a constant? Polynomial solutions don't seem to work, because the LHS will always have higher degree than the RHS. Solutions of the form $A\cos(x\sin\alpha)+b\sin(x\sin\alpha)$ don't work either, but maybe something similar does? This comes from the 1st integral of the Euler-Lagrange equation for the functional $\int{y^2 + y'^2\csc^2\alpha)^{1/2}}dx$, which is the arc-length of a curve $r(\theta)$ on a cone with interior angle $2\alpha$, where $y=r$ and $x=\theta$.

153713,Baby Rudin Problem 7.16,"Problem 7.16: Suppose $\{f_n\}$ is an equicontinuous family of functions on a compact set $K$ and $\{f_n\}$ converges pointwise to some $f$ on $K$. Prove that $f_n \to f$ uniformly. Now for this problem I assume that $f_n,f : K \subset \Bbb{R} \rightarrow \Bbb{R}$ with the usual euclidean metric. Even though this is not assumed in the problem, I assume this to simplify matters first. Now I believe I have proven that $f_n$ is uniformly cauchy on $K$ as follows. By equicontinuity of the family $\{f_n\}$ I can choose $\delta> 0$ such that $|x-p_i|< \delta$ will imply that $|f_m(x) - f_m(p_i)| < \epsilon$, and $|f_n(x) - f_n(p_i)| < \epsilon$. Consider the collection $\{B_\delta(x)\}_{x \in K}$ that clearly covers $K$, by compactness of $K$ we get that there are finitely many points $p_1,\ldots p_n \in K$ such that $\{B_\delta(p_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ is a cover for $K$. Furthermore, because $f_n \rightarrow f$ pointwise for each $x \in K$ we get a cauchy sequence of numbers, so in particular given any $\epsilon > 0$, for each $p_i$ there exists $N_i$ such that $m,n \geq N_i$ implies that $|f_m(p_i) - f_n(p_i) | < \epsilon$. Taking $$N = \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} N_i$$ gives that $m,n\geq N$ implies that $|f_m(p_i) - f_n(p_i)| < \epsilon$ for all $i$. Now we can finally put everything together to prove uniform cauchyness, take any $x \in K$ so that $x \in B_\delta(p_j)$ for some $1 \leq j \leq n$. Then $$\begin{eqnarray*} |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| &\leq& |f_n(x) - f_n(p_i) | + | f_n(p_i) - f_m(p_i)| + |f_m(p_i) - f_m(x)| \\
&<& \epsilon + \epsilon + \epsilon \\
&=& 3\epsilon. \end{eqnarray*}$$ The first and last term being less than $\epsilon$ come from equicontinuity, the middle term being less than $\epsilon$ comes from the derivation just before. Now what I am thinking of doing now to prove uniform cauchyness is to take the sup on the left, is this something legal I can do? Also are there are any mistakes in the proof above? Here is some context why I want to prove uniform cauchyness: Suppose I know that $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly cauchy. Then I know that given any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N \in \Bbb{N}$ such that $m,n\geq N$ implies that $|f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < \epsilon$ for all $x \in K$. Now we do this trick of fixing one of the indices. Fix $n$ to be some integer greater than $N$ and let $m\rightarrow \infty$, we see that $$\begin{eqnarray*} |f_n - f| &=& \lim_{m\rightarrow \infty} | f_n - f_m| \\
&\leq& \epsilon \end{eqnarray*} $$ by the limit comparison test. Recall that $f$ was the pointwise limit of $\{f_n\}$. But then since $n$ was any arbitrary integer greater than $N$ we have that $f_n \rightarrow f$ uniformly.","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

153736,Generating function for Banach's matchbox problem,"Here's the description for Banach's matchbox problem from Concrete Mathematics EXERCISE 8.46 (edited) Stefan Banach used to carry two boxes of matches, one containing $m$ matches and the other one containing $n$ matches. Whenever he needed a light he chose a box at random, each with probability $\frac 1 2$, independent of his previous choices. After taking out a match he'd put the box back in its pocket (even if the box became empty -- all famous mathematicians used to do this). When his chosen box was empty he'd throw it away and reach for the other box. Once he found that the other box was empty too. What's the probability $p_{m,n}$ that this occurs? Generalizing your answer to part (a), find a closed form for the probability $p_{k,m,n}$ that exactly $k$ matches are in the other box when an empty one is first thrown away. The answer to these two problems only show two generating functions and the answer: (a) \[ P(w,z) = 1 + \frac 1 2 (wP(w,z) + zP(w,z)) = (1 - \frac 1 2 (w+z))^{-1} \tag 1 \] hence \[ p_{m,n} = 2^{-m-n} \binom {m+n} n \]
  (b) \[ P_k(w,z) = \frac 1 2 (w^k+z^k)P(w,z) \tag 2 \] hence \[ p_{k,m,n} = 2^{k-1-m-n} \left( \binom{m+n-k}m + \binom{m+n-k}n \right) \] where $P(w,z) = \sum_{m,n \ge 0} p_{m,n}w^mz^n$ and $P_k(w,z) = \sum_{m,n \ge 0} p_{k,m,n}w^mz^n$ is generating functions for $p_{m,n}$ and $p_{k,m,n}$. I'm confused that the two equations for generating functions come out first then we get the closed form. I don't know how they come directly. There might be a reasonable explanation for formula (1): We have $p_{m,n} = \frac 1 2 (p_{m-1,n} + p_{m,n-1}) + [m=n=0]$ for all integers $m,n$ where $p_{m,n} = 0$ whenever $m<0$ or $n<0$. $[P]$ is Iverson bracket . Multiplying $z^mw^n$, summing up over all integers $m,n$ we get equation (1), but equation (2) lacks evidence. Although we can interpret $p_{k,m,n} = \frac 1 2 (p_{m-k,n} + p_{m,n-k})$ combinatorially, we cannot explain why the generating function arises, because the preceding formula gives the closed-form directly, without generating function. So I guess that there's a direct way to obtain equation (1) and (2), without the assistant of recurrence relations, just like section 7.1 DOMINO THEORY AND CHANGE , or section 8.4 FLIPPING COINS . Any help? Thanks! Postscript: There's a combinatorial proof for (b). Mention that (a) is a special case of (b).
$\newcommand{\length}{\mathrm{length}}$ First, we define the probablility space for the matchbox problem. We use symbol $L$ indicating fetching a match from the left matchbox, and symbol $R$ from the right one. The elementary events are defined as strings of $L$ and $R$ which ends at an attempt of fetching the match from the empty matchbox. For example, when $m=2$ and $n=1$, we have the probability space $\Omega = \{LLL, LLRL, LLRR, LRLL, LRLR, LRR, RLLL, RLLR, RLR, RR\}$. The elementary event $LLRR$ means that the 1st and 2nd matches are from the left matchbox, and the 3rd is from the right one. The 4th time is trying to fetch the match from the right matchbox, but it's empty. $\length(\omega)$ indicates the length of elementary event $\omega$. We have $\Pr(\omega) = 2^{-\length(\omega)}$. Now let's try to enumerate all elementary events for the problem (b). There're two cases: Case 1, the right matchbox remains $k$ matches. We use $\Omega_1$ to indicate such elementary event. For each $\omega \in \Omega_1$, there're $m+1$ $L$'s in $\omega$, and $n-k$ $R$'s in it, and the last symbol of $\omega$ is $L$. For each $\omega \in \Omega_1$, $\Pr(\omega) = 2^{\length(\omega)} = 2^{-(m+n-k+1)}$, and $|\Omega_1| = \dbinom{m+n-k}m$. Case 2, the left matchbox remains $k$ matches, saying $\Omega_2$. We have $|\Omega_2| = \dbinom{m+n-k}n$, and for each $\omega \in \Omega_2$, we have $\Pr(\omega) = 2^{\length(\omega)} = 2^{-(m+n-k+1)}$. Thus
\begin{align*}
p_{k,m,n}
&= \sum_{\omega \in \Omega_1 \cup \Omega_2} \Pr(\omega) \\
&= \sum_{\omega \in \Omega_1} \Pr(\omega) + \sum_{\omega \in \Omega_2} \Pr(\omega) \\
&= 2^{-(m+n-k+1)} \left( \binom{m+n-k}{m} + \binom{m+n-k}{n} \right)

Consider the problem of gift-wrapping a three-dimensional object using an inextensible material, like paper. We can make the material conform to any surface with nonnegative Gaussian curvature by cutting and folding it. (At least, we can make an arbitrarily good polyhedral approximation.) But if we want to have negative Gaussian curvature, we have to make a cut and glue some extra material in there, which is awkward and cumbersome, so we forbid it. Now we want to perform this gift wrapping as tightly as possible, which suggests using the least amount of material. Formally, given a set $S$ of points in $\mathbb R^3$, we want to find the surface with minimum area that encloses all the points in $S$, subject to an additional condition that the Gaussian curvature of the surface is nonnegative everywhere.

I'm having difficulty following some of the combinatorial elements. Let $G$ be a finite group containing exactly two conjugacy classes of involutions. Let $u_1$ and $u_2$ be nonconjugate involutions in $G$. Let $c_i=|C(u_i)|$, the respective centralizers of the $u_i$. Let $S_i$ be the set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x$ conjugate to $u_1$, $y$ conjugate to $u_2$, and $(xy)^n=u_i$ for some $n$. Let $s_i=|S_i|$. Then $|G|=c_1s_2+c_2s_1$. The idea is to count the ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x$ conjugate to $u_1$ and $y$ conjugate to $u_2$ in two different ways. Is it somehow clear that this number is $(|G|/c_1)(|G|/c_2)$ right off the bat? I believe this follows since the possible choices of the $x$ is the cardinality of the orbit of $u_1$ under the conjugation action, which equals the index of the stabilizer in $G$, but the stabilizer is just the centralizer in this case. Likewise for the choices of $y$. On the other hand, I know that if the product $uv$ of two involutions $u$ and $v$ has odd order, then $u$ and $v$ are conjugate. So if $x$ and $y$ are not conjugate here, their product $xy$ has even order. Then $(xy)^n$ for $n=o(xy)/2$ is an involution, and thus conjugate to either $u_1$ or $u_2$. This exhausts all the pairs in question, but why does counting in this way give $(|G|/c_1)s_1+(|G|/c_2)s_2$? I only know that $(xy)^n$ is conjugate to some $u_i$ for some $n$, not that $(xy)^n=u_i$ as in the definition of the $s_i$. After that, the result will follow from the equality

I assume I am missing something completely obvious. Here is the theorem as I understand it so far. Theorem: Let $\{ f_n \}$ be a sequence of functions bounded by $M$, supported on a set $E$ of finite measure, and $f_n(x) \to f(x)$ a.e. $x$. Then $f$ is bounded measurable function supported on $E$ for a.e. $x$ and $\int |f_n(x) - f(x)|dx \to 0$ as $n \to 0$. Proof: Almost everywhere we have,
$$|f(x)| - |f_n(x)| \le |f(x) - f_n(x)| < \epsilon.$$
Therefore, $|f(x)| \le M$ almost everywhere, and $f(x) = 0$ for $x \in E$ almost everywhere. Let $\epsilon > 0$. By Egorov's theorem we can find a measurable set $A \subset E$ such that $f_n \to f$ uniformly on $A$ and $m(E - A) < \epsilon$. Thus $|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon$ for large $n$ for all $x \in A$. $$\int |f_n(x) - f(x)|dx \le \int_A |f_n(x) - f(x)| dx + \int_{E - A} |f_n(x) - f(x)| dx \le \epsilon m(A) + 2M \epsilon.$$ As $\epsilon$ is arbitrary, this completes the proof.

Preliminary definitons A semiring is a set with two operations $+$ and $\cdot$ which satisfy all axioms of a unitary ring except the axiom demanding the existence of additive inverses. A left semimodule over a semiring $R$ is a commutative monoid $M$ (whose operation is denoted by $+$ too) with a function $ R\times M\longrightarrow M$ satisfying all axioms of a module over a ring except the axiom demanding the existence of additive inverses. A right semimodule is defined analogously. Introduction There are two equivalent definitions of a basis of a left $R$-module $M$ for a nontrivial unitary ring $R$. Definition 1. A set $X\subset M$ is a basis of $M$ when $X$ is linearly independent (that is a linear combination of elements of $X$ is zero iff its coefficients are all zero), and $X$ generates $M$. Definition 2. A set $X\subset M$ is a basis of $M$ when for every left $R$-module $N$ and every function $f:X\longrightarrow N$ there exists a unique $R$-module homomorphism $\bar f:M\longrightarrow N$ such that $\bar f|_X=f.$ I will prove the equivalence of these definitions now so that I can show where I have problems with the analogous defintions for semimodules. Proof. Suppose $X$ satisfies Definition 1. Let $N$ be a left $R$-module and $f:X\longrightarrow N.$ We define $\bar f:M\longrightarrow N$ by $$\bar f\left(\sum_{i=1}^nr_ix_i\right)=\sum_{i=1}^nr_if(x_i).$$ Since $X$ generates $M$, this defines $\bar f$ for every $m\in M$. We have to show that it is well defined. Suppose $$\sum_{i=1}^nr_ix_i=\sum_{i=1}^ns_ix_i.$$ Then, by the linear independence of $X$, $$r_i=s_i$$ for all $i=1,\ldots,n.$ Therefore, $$\bar f\left(\sum_{i=1}^nr_ix_i\right)=\sum_{i=1}^nr_if(x_i)=\sum_{i=1}^ns_if(x_i)=\bar f\left(\sum_{i=1}^ns_ix_i\right).$$ We have proved the existence of $\bar f$. We need to show its uniqueness. Suppose $g:M\longrightarrow N$ is a homomorphism, and $g|_X=f$. Then $$g\left(\sum_{i=1}^nr_ix_i\right)=\sum_{i=1}^nr_ig(x_i)=\sum_{i=1}^nr_if(x_i)=\bar f\left(\sum_{i=1}^nr_ix_i\right),$$ and since $X$ generates $M,$ this proves the uniqueness of $\bar f.$ Conversely, suppose $X$ satisfies Definition 2. We will first prove that $X$ is linearly independent. Suppose $$\sum_{i=1}^nr_ix_i=0,$$ and $r_1\neq 0$. Let $f:X\longrightarrow R$ be defined by $$f(x)=\begin{cases}1 & \text {for } x=x_1,\\0 & \text {otherwise.}\end{cases}$$ Then there exists an $R$-module homomorphism $\bar f:M\longrightarrow R$ such that $\bar f|_X=f.$ We have $$0=\bar f(0)=\bar f\left(\sum_{i=1}^nr_ix_i\right)=\sum_{i=1}^nr_if(x_i)=r_1.$$ This is a contradiction, and $X$ must be linearly independent. We need to show that $X$ generates $M$. Let $M_1\subseteq M$ be the submodule generated by $X.$ Let $\bar f:M\longrightarrow M/M_1$ be the canonical homomorphism. Clearly, for all $x\in X,$ we have $\bar f(x)=0.$ Then $\bar f$ and the zero homomorphism restricted to $X$ are equal, and must therefore be equal. Hence $M/M_1=0,$ and so $M=M_1,$ which ends the proof. $\square$ Question As said in the question I linked to at the beginning, the definition of linear independence in semimodules requires a bit of tweaking. If I understand correctly what Bill Cook wrote in his answer and what I later read in a book on semirings, the correct definition is this: Definition 3. For a semiring $R$ and a left $R$-semimodule $M,$ a set $X\subset M$ is linearly independent iff for any two linear combinations of elements of $X$, their equality implies the equality of their coefficients. This gives us two possible definitions of a basis of a left $R$-semimodule $M$ over a semiring $R$ obtained by re-writing Definition 1 and Definition 2, but now considering $M$ to be a semimodule over a semiring $R$. Let's call these definitions Definition 1 s and Definition 2 s . Are these definitions also equivalent? I think they should be. Definition 1 s is part of the definition of a free semimodule given by J. S. Golan in Semirings and Their Applications . But a definition of a free semimodule using Definition 2 s should also be possible. However, it's difficult for me to generalize the proof I gave above. Most of it generalizes easily. I will not write those parts again, now for semimodules, but it is easy to check that Definition 1 s implies Definition 2 s by imitating the proof above. It also allows one to prove that Definition 2 s implies the linear independence of $X$. What doesn't seem to be working is the proof that Definition 2 s implies that $X$ generates $M$. The problem is that quotient structures are not very nice for semimodules. When we quotient out a submodule of a module over a ring, we use subtraction implicitly -- $m, m'$ being in the same coset means that $m-m'\in M_1.$ Quotient semimodules are generally defined not by subsemimodules, but by congruences. (As it is the case for semigroups.) I've found a definition of a quotient semimodule $M/N$ for a subsemimodule $N\subseteq M$, but I don't think it works here. It is defined by the so-called Bourne relation. Definition 4. Let $R$ be a semiring and $M$ a left $R$-semimodule. Let $N\subseteq M$ be a subsemimodule. We define the relation $\equiv_N$ on $M$ by $$m\equiv_N m'\iff (\exists n,n'\in N)\; m+n=m'+n'.$$ This relation can be shown to be a congruence. Now we simply define $M/N$ as $M/\equiv_N.$ This is easily seen to be equivalent to the standard definition in the case of modules over a ring. However, as far as I can see, under this definition, $M/N=0$ doesn't imply $M=N$ in the general case. And this is what we want to use...",['abstract-algebra']
154272,Are the Join and Meet operators on complete lattices both continuous?,"Suppose that $(A,\le)$ is a complete lattice, that means $(A,\wedge,\vee)$ is a lattice which satisfies $$\forall B \subseteq A[\bigwedge B\text{ and }\bigvee B\text{ exist}].$$ And of course $(\wp(A),\subseteq)$, in which $\wp(A)$ is the powerset of $A$, is a complete lattice too (let $\bigcap \emptyset=A$). Furthermore, Let $(D,\sqsubseteq)$ be a directed set, and $P \colon D \to \wp(A)$ s.t. $\forall \alpha,\beta \in D[\alpha \le \beta \Rightarrow P_{\alpha} \supseteq P_{\beta}]$.

154316,"Teaching permutations, How to?","I posed this question to my niece while teaching her permutations: Given four balls of different colours, and four place holders to put those balls, in how many ways can you arrange these four balls in the four place holders? She reverted with $(4!)^2$ while I was expecting to hear $4!$.  Her reasoning was so: I can select the first of any of the four balls in four ways.  Having picked one, I put this in any of the four place holders in four ways.  Now, I select the second ball from the three remaining ones in 3 ways.  I can place it in any of the remaining three place holders in 3 ways. ... and so on to produce $4^2 * 3^2 * 2^2 * 1^2$ How do I explain to her that only $4!$ arrangements are possible and this is regardless of which order she picks the balls?","['permutations', 'education', 'combinatorics']"

154343,When is a morphism of $S$-groupoids a monomorphism?,"According to ""Champs algébriques"" by Laumon and Moret-Bailley, and $S$-groupoid is a category $\mathscr{X}$ and a functor $a: \mathscr{X} \to (\mathrm{Aff}/S)$, where $(\mathrm{Aff}/S)$ is the category of affine schemes over a fixed scheme $S$. Moreover, it satisfies the properties that make $\mathscr{X}$ a fibered category over $(\mathrm{Aff}/S)$ where each fiber category $\mathscr{X}_U$ is a groupoid. Then the authors assert that a morphism $F: \mathscr{X} \to \mathscr{Y}$ is a monomorphism if each restriction to the fiber categories $F_U: \mathscr{X}_U \to \mathscr{Y}_U$ is fully faithful.  My question is the following: why is it not sufficient that each $F_U$ be only faithful? Why is fullness necessary?","['category-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'groupoids']"
