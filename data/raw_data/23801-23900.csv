208076,Counting the sum of cycles of the elements in $S_n$.,"Let $\sigma\in S_n$ be given. Let us write $\sigma$ in its disjoint cycle decomposition. Define by $w(\sigma)$ the number of cycles (for instance if we have the permutation $1\mapsto 2, 2\mapsto 4, 3\mapsto 3, 4\mapsto 1, 5\mapsto 5$ we write it as $(124)(3)(5)$ so $w(\sigma)=3$). I was asked to find $$A_n=\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}w(\sigma)$$I found the recursive formula $$A_n=n!+(n-1)!\left[\frac{A_{n-1}}{(n-1)!}+\frac{A_{n-2}}{(n-2)!}+\ldots+\frac{A_{1}}{1!}\right]$$ I was trying to tinker around with it to see if I could get a formula that does not rely on recursion, but failed at it.

208250,Integral of sinc function multiplied by Gaussian,"I am wondering whether the following integral $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  \frac{\exp( - a x^2 ) \sin( bx )}{x} \,\mathrm{d}x$$ exists in closed form. I would like to use it for numerical
calculation and find an efficient way to evaluate it.
If analytical form does not exist, I really appreciate
any alternative means for evaluating the integral.
One method would be numerical quadrature including
Gaussian quadrature, but it may be inefficient when
the parameters $a$ and $b$ are very different in scale. EDIT : In view of this discussion, we have decided to add OP's self-answer to the end of the question, for it does not qualify as an answer yet contains vital details. The copying is unabridged. Thanks very much for your comments, and the following result was obtained including the case for $x_0 \ne 0$ : $$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx \exp[-a(x-x_0)^2] \frac{ \sin(bx) }{ x }
= \pi \exp(-a x_0^2) \mathrm{Re}\left(\mathrm{erf}\left[\frac{b+2iax_0}{2\sqrt{a}}\right] - \mathrm{erf}\left[\frac{2iax_0}{2\sqrt{a}}\right]\right)
$$ where $a\gt0, b, x_0$ are assumed to be all real.
(note: coefficients etc may be still wrong...) This integral appears in a type of electronic structure calculation
based on a grid representation (sinc-function basis). I believe
the above result should be definitely useful. Thanks much!!

  than polynomial time , yet not so slow as to be exponential time .
  The worst case running time of a quasi-polynomial time algorithm is
  $2^{O((\log n)^c)}$ for some fixed $c$. I found in an earlier table on the same page , quasi-polynomial means $2poly(\log n)$. Can I suppose the two definitions are the same? I was wondering if quasi-polynomial time algorithms should run
faster than polynomial time, yet not so fast as to be exponential
time instead? From Wikipedia In mathematics, a quasi-polynomial (pseudo-polynomial) is a
  generalization of polynomials. While the coefficients of a polynomial
  come from a ring, the coefficients of quasi-polynomials are instead
  periodic functions with integral period. A quasi-polynomial can be
  written as $q(k) = c_d(k) k^d + c_{d-1}(k) k^{d-1} + \cdots + c_0(k)$,
  where $c_{i}(k)$ is a periodic function with integral period. Is quasi-polynomial time complexity for algorithms not related to

Here it is: Let $X = A \cup B$, $A$ and $B$ are subspaces of $X$. Let $f:X \rightarrow Y.$ Suppose that the restricted functions $f_{|A}:A \rightarrow Y$ and $f_{|B}:B \rightarrow Y$ are continuous. Show that if both $A$ and $B$ are closed in $X$, then $f$ is continuous. Our definition of continuity is: $f$ is continuous at $x \in X$ if for each open set $V$ of $Y$ containing $f(x)$, there is an open set $U$ of $X$ containing $x$ such that $f(U) \subset V$. $f$ is continuous if it is continuous at each point of its domain. What I've tried so far: Suppose $A$ and $B$ are closed in $X$. Suppose $A \cap B = \emptyset$. Then $X -A$ is open in $X$. But $X - A = B$ which is closed in $X$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $A \cap B \ne  \emptyset$. I'm not sure if this will be useful in the problem or not. If $x \in X$, then it's either in $A$ or in $B$. Suppose without loss of generality that it's in $A$. Then for all open sets $V$ of $Y$ s.t. $f(x) \in V$, $\exists$ an open set $U_{1}$ of $A$ s.t. $U_{1} \subset A, a \in U_{1}$ and $f(U_{1}) \subset V$. This is almost what we want, except that we want to find an open set $U$ of $X$ s.t. $U \subset A, a \in U$ and $f(U) \subset V$. This is because $U_{1}$ being open in $A$ does not necessarily mean that it's open in $X$ because $A$ is closed in $X$. (i know how to expand this argument out if needed) My idea now is to try to find a subset $U$ of $U_{1}$ such that $U$ is open in $X$. We have two cases: (1) $U_{1}$ does not intersect the boundary of $A$. (2) $U_{1}$ intersects the boundary of $A$. Now I'm not sure what to do.

I have no problem with it if $\sin\frac{1}{x}$ where $x$ is real, because just taking values $x=\frac{2}{(2n-1)\pi}, x=\frac{1}{n\pi}, x=\frac{2}{(2n+1)\pi}$ it is clear, for example, by Cauchy criterion.

I am pretty sure that this limit doesn't exist. The graph of this function goes from $-1$ to $0$ to $\,1$ and so on infinitely many times as $\frac{1}{n}$ approaches $0$.

We know that the full iterate is always larger, since $x^2+c>x^2$, for $c>0$, and $x>1$. Intuitively, one would think that the half iterate of $x^2+c$ would also always be larger, but I believe I have found some counter examples.

For $c=0$, this is the equation for the superfunction which can be used to calculate fractional iterations.  $f(x)=x^2$, and $g(x) = f^{o x}$, $g(z) = 2^{2^z}$.  For $c=0.25$, this is the parabolic case, which has been studied a great deal in understanding the mandelbrot set, and the superfunction is entire, and I presume there is a uniqueness criteria.  For $c>0.25$, the problem becomes trickier because $x^2+c$ has complex fixed points, and I am also looking for any literature on unique solutions to calculating real valued fractional iterates for $c>0.25$. What I am also interested in is the abel function of $x^2$, which is $\text{abel}(z) = \log_2(\log_2(z))$.   I am interested in the abel function of $x^2$ composed with the superfunction of $x^2+c$.
$$\theta(z)=\text{abel}_{x^2}(\text{superfunction}_{x^2+c}(z))-z$$ As real $z$ increases, if $\theta$ converges to a $1$-cyclic function, as opposed to a constant, then there are counter examples like the one I gave, and sometimes the superfunction is growing slower than $2^{2^z}$, and othertimes it is growing faster, with the two function intersecting each other an infinite number of times.

209031,"Is there an idea of ""primeless isomorphism"" studied somewhere in finite group theory?","What I mean by ""primeless isomorphism"" is essentially a relation on finite groups by identifying groups whose structure differs only in which primes divide the groups' orders.  The groups aren't exactly isomorphic , but they are close to it;  I'm having trouble formulating the idea rigorously, so I think it might be best to explain what I mean through examples. In the simplest case, take cyclic groups $C_{p}$ and $C_q$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q$ .  Obviously these aren't isomorphic, but they would be ""primeless isomorphic"" as the only difference in the group structure is what the primes actually are .  By contrast, $C_{p}$ and $C_n$ would not be considered primeless isomorphic for composite $n$ , because $C_n$ has proper nontrivial subgroups and $C_p$ doesn't -  a structural difference independent of which primes divide $n$ . For another example, we could look at the class of Frobenius groups $C_pC_q$ where $C_q$ acts fixed point freely on $C_p$ (again with distinct primes $p,q$ ).  There are constraints on what these primes can be in that $q$ has to divide $p-1$ for the group to exist, but among those groups that do, it doesn't seem like they are qualitatively different.  Groups of order $p^3$ have been classified in exactly the way that I mean; the same thing goes for Dihedral groups $D_{2n}$ of squarefree order, which split into different ""primeless isomorphism classes"" depending on the number of prime divisors. The set of all groups with order $p^3$ for some prime $p$ would be divided into seven equivalency classes: $[C_{p^3}],[C_{p^2}\times C_p],[(C_p)^3],[Q_8],[D_8],[\text{Heis}\,Z_p],$ and $[G_p]$ (where for the last two classes $p$ is odd). It's hard to say precisely what I mean, but hopefully you get my drift. Has it been studied?  Is there a name for it? If not, is that because it is somehow logically difficult (or impossible) to define? If nobody's heard of this, Can anyone think of a good way to formulate a definition for two groups to be ""primeless isomorphic?""

Some additional background info: My intention is to investigate the feasibility of a type of additive sound synthesis wherein the sine waves are not stored as discrete waves, but instead as a spectrogram that represents the amplitude of each partial within the signal and converting that directly into the resulting waveform, which allows for evaluating the partials by only calculating the sine of one angle, no matter how many partials there are. So the first thing I need is a function that peaks at a specified input value and quickly drops to near-zero, which I'll call $R(f)$. Each partial will also be capable of changing amplitude and frequency over time, so each partial, p will be represented by $A_p(t)R(f_p(t))$, where $A_p(t)$ represents the amplitude of the partial at time t and $f_p(t)$ represents its frequency. Now what we do is add several of these together to get a function where each x-value corresponds to a frequency and the y-values correspond to its amplitude: $y(f) = \sum_{p=1}^n R_p(f)$ Finally, to obtain the waveform, multiply by $\sin(2\pi f t)$ and integrate with respect to f and sample to result at distinct values of t to recreate the waveform: $\int_0^{20000} y(f) sin(2\pi f t) df$ (20000Hz is about the limit of human hearing) Some interesting things happen if $R(f)$ can be represented as a polynomial of f. Namely, y(f) will also be a polynomial of f of the same degree. Then if we instead approximate its multiplication by $sin(2\pi f t)$ with another polynomial function, evaluating the integral is trivial. There are some optimizations that can be applied to make this not so computationally demanding. For example, if we assume that the amplitude and frequency of the partials remain fairly constant, the integral can instead be evaluated by integrating by parts and only recalculating the value given by the part involving y(f) every few-hundred samples. Now if you're wondering why I need the function to be valid from -20000 to 20000, that's because a function peaking at +20000 must still be near-zero at x=0, 20000 units to the left and when centered at x=0, in should be near-zero 20000 units to the right. So the function should extend 20000 units on either side. Also, the requirement for 99% of the area to be within $[-2, 2]$ comes from the fact that each partial should ideally be just 1 frequency. In the case of it actually being spread across a full 4Hz, it creates an interference pattern with itself that causes its amplitude to be modulated in undesirable ways, although it can be somewhat countered by an intelligent $A_p(t)$","['optimization', 'functions', 'polynomials']"

$$ This is left as an exercise in my textbook. The book says that I should use the method of ""differentiating parameters"" by using the provided Leibniz Formula (?): Prerequisite: Function $f(x,y)$ and its partial derivative $f_x(x,y)$ are both continuous on region $R=[a,b]\times[c,d]$. Function $\alpha(x)$ and $\beta(x)$ are both differentiable on intervl $[a,b]$ while
  $$ c \le \alpha(x) \le d,\quad c \le \beta(x) \le d \quad (a\le x\le b),$$ Conclusion: The Function $\displaystyle\Phi(x)=\int_{\alpha(x)}^{\beta(x)} f(x,y) \,\mathrm d y$ is differentiable on interval $[a,b]$, and
  $$\begin{align}
  \Phi^\prime(x) &= \frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d x} \int_{\alpha(x)}^{\beta(x)} f(x,y) \,\mathrm d y \\
   &= \int_{\alpha(x)}^{\beta(x)} f_x(x,y) \,\mathrm d y + f\left[x,\beta(x)\right]\beta^\prime(x)-f\left[x,\alpha(x)\right]\alpha^\prime(x).
  \end{align}$$ First, I'd like to ask: What is the correct name of this theorem? Next, here's my (failed?) attempts at solving the question. Following one of the textbook examples on the same topic, I tried: $$ \begin{align}
I&=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \left[\ln(1+y)\right]_{-a \cos x}^{a \cos x} \frac{\mathrm d x}{\cos x} \\
\\
&= \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \int_{-a \cos x}^{a \cos x} \frac{\mathrm d y}{1+y} \frac{\mathrm d x}{\cos x}. \\
&=\int_{-a}^{a} \frac{1}{1+y} \int_{0}^{\arccos\left|y/a\right|}\,\mathrm d x \mathrm d y \\
&=\int_{-a}^{a} \left.\left[\ln\left|\tan x + \sec x\right|\right]\right|_0^{\arccos(y/a)}
\end{align}
$$ And I don't know what to do next. Also I tried to substitute $u=a \cos x$ but I don't know how to proceed.

Suppose the radius of convergence of $f$ is $1$, and $f$ is convergent at every point of the unit circle. Question :If $f(z)=0$ for every $|z|=1$, then can we draw the conclusion that $a_n=0$ for all nonnegative integer $n$? I think the answer is yes , but I failed to prove it. My approach is concerning about the function $F_\lambda(z):=f(\lambda z)$ for $0\leq\lambda\leq 1$, $|z|=1$. Abel's theorem shows that $F_\lambda$ converge to $F_1$ pointwisely as $\lambda\rightarrow 1$ on the unit circle. If I have the property that $f$ is bounded in the unit disk, then I can apply Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem to prove $a_0=0$, and by induction I can prove $a_n=0$ for all $n$.

I am trying to get my head around why there are (at least) three different notions of differentiation. I suppose my confusion can be summarised by the following question. What does each one do that the other two can't? I don't just mean which objects can they act on that the other two can't, I would like a deeper explanation (if it exists, which I believe it does). In terms of their geometric intuition/interpretation, does it make sense that we need these different notions?

Secondly, pardon me if I sound ignorant (I'm learning this as a hobby so I don't have much background or time for it) but isn't it a really obvious/self-evident concept? I mean essentially, it is saying that if you have a collection of non-empty sets, then you can pick an element out of each set. I realize that there are difficulties when we cannot make explicit choices because we cannot create an explicit algorithm for the choice function (for example the collection of all nonempty subsets of the real line), but does that really matter?
