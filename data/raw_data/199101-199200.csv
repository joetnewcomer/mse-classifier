3868366,Geometry of typical sets,"A common construction in statistics is the distribution of $n$ iid random variables, for $n$ arbitrarily large. For large enough $n$ the distribution is  approximately uniform over a highly regular typical set in $n$ -space. The ""letter-typicality"" definition essentially resembles a quotient of a large permutation group, or more properly the disjoint union of relatively few highly similar quotients. Information theory often studies covering, packing and projection of these sets. These spatial intuitions are not studied directly in any presentation I have seen.
Does anyone know of any articles or books that make this connection precise?
It would be especially useful to see an approach that clarifies the essential structure across many trials of two or more jointly-distributed random variables.","['statistics', 'geometry', 'information-theory', 'reverse-math', 'combinatorics']"

u(x,-1)&=u(x,1)=f(x)

$$ where $f:[-1,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ is even, strictly decreasing on $[0,1]$ , and satisfies $f(\pm 1)=0$ .  Show that $u$ has a saddle point at $u(0,0)$ and that $u(0,0)>0$ . I gave a rather hand-wavy argument about symmetry and the partial derivatives that I don't think is entirely accurate: Note that $f$ is even and decreasing on $[0,1].$ Since $f:[-1,1]\to \mathbb{R},$ $f$ has a maximum at $x=0,$ i.e. $f$ has a critical point there (since $f$ has bounded variation, and is increasing on $[0,1]$ , $f$ is differentiable a.e.). Since $u\equiv 0$ if $x=\pm 1,$ the directional derivative of $u$ pointing into $\Omega$ from the boundary is positive. In particular, $u$ has a critical point at $(0,0)$ by symmetry; from $x=\pm1$ it is increasing, but from $x=0,y=\pm1$ it is decreasing. Therefore $u(0,0)>0$ and $u$ has a saddle point there. I also graphed the problem for $f(x)=\{|1-x|,1-x^2,\cos(\pi/2 x)\}$ and used Mathematica's NDSolve to make numerical plots of the solution; each appeared geometrically to have a saddle point at $(0,0)$ . For example, with $f(x) = 1-x^2$ the solution looks like: I'd be interested in a proper solution, if only to satisfy my curiosity.","['boundary-value-problem', 'multivariable-calculus', 'harmonic-functions', 'partial-differential-equations']"
3868465,What's this distribution?,"Suppose you have a row of $n$ switches with two states each, on ( $1$ ) or off ( $0$ ), as well as a coin that shows heads with probability $p$ and tails with prob. $q=1-p$ . Initially, all switches are off. You flip the coin, and if you see tails, you randomly toggle one of the switches (when it's on, you turn it off, and vice versa) and then flip the coin again. If you see heads, you stop and count the number of switches that are on. Q: What probability distribution does this number $K$ of activated switches follow? I found this is a very easy to simulate but tricky to formalize probability distribution.
My thoughts and insights so far: $K$ obviously has support in $\lbrace 0,\dots,n\rbrace$ . The number of total flips $M$ follows a geometric distribution with parameter $p$ . The probability of switch $i$ being toggled $a_i$ times is the probability of drawing $i$ exactly $a_i$ times out of a uniform distribution over $\lbrace 1,\dots,n\rbrace$ in $M$ tries, so $$P(a_i)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty P(M=m)\cdot{m\choose a_i}\left({1\over n}\right)^{a_i}\left({n-1\over n}\right)^{m-a_i}$$ with $P(M=m)=q^{m}\cdot p$ . Now the probability for $K=k$ is the probability that among all $(a_i)_{i\in [n]}$ exactly $k$ are odd. This is where I don't know how to continue, I haven't been able to come up with a closed form solution to this problem. Some insights: For $p\searrow 0$ , $P(K=k)$ approaches a uniform binomial distribution over $\lbrace 0,\dots,n\rbrace$ (EDIT: Thanks to Henry for the correction) For large $n\gg \mathbb{E}[M]={1\over q}$ , the probability $P(a_i)=1$ approaches $q$ , which is by design, i.e. the process simulates flipping all switches independently with probability $q$ . My questions: Do you, by any chance, recognize this as a known distribution? Do you have an idea for how to find a closed form expression for $P(K=k)$ , if it exists at all?

Or is it just an existence result? Nash embedding is still isometric, meaning I can measure tangent vectors.

Moreover, with $Q=\lambda I_n$ , $\lambda\in\mathbb R$ , since it commutes with $B$ , we have $$\forall \lambda\in\mathbb R,\quad \det(B-\lambda A)=0,$$ so if $\det(A)\ne 0$ , we have $$\forall \lambda\in\mathbb R,\quad\det((BA-\lambda I_n)A^{-1})=\det(BA-\lambda I_n)\det(A)^{-1}=0,$$ which means that every $\lambda\in\mathbb R$ is an eigenvalue of $BA$ (since for all $\lambda\in\mathbb R$ , $\det(BA-\lambda I_n)=0$ ), which is absurd.

It is clear that this is indeed a sheaf but I can't see how it satisfies the universal property of the sheafification. I thought about doing it in the following way: I really think that this construction is functorial in $\mathscr{F}$ . Supposing that, given a morphism $\mathscr{F}\to\mathscr{G}$ we should have an induced morphism $\widetilde{\mathscr{F}}\to\widetilde{\mathscr{G}}$ which coincides with our original morphism when restricting to $\mathscr{F}$ .

Prove your claim. Note: $f(x)^3=f(x)\cdot f(x)\cdot f(x)$ . My attempt: I rewrote the expression like this: $$f(x)^3+3f(x)^2+3f(x)=x^3-2x$$ Function $g(x):=x^3-2x$ is surjective and differentiable, so I thought the same holds for the LHS and hence for $f(x)$ . I factorized the LHS as $f(x)(f(x)^2+3f(x)+3)$ . I argue $f(x)^2+3f(x)+3>0,\forall x\in\Bbb R$ because the parabola $t^2+3t+3$ doesn't have any real roots and is convex. Since $g(x)$ on the RHS is surjective and $f(x)^2+3f(x)+3>0$ , $f(x)$ has to be surjective, too. Let $h(x)=f(x)^3+3f(x)^2+3f(x)$ . $\begin{aligned}(h(x))'&=3f(x)^2f'(x)+6f(x)f'(x)+3f'(x)\\&=3f'(x)(f(x)^2+2f(x)+1)\\&=f'(x)\underbrace{(f(x)+1)^2}_{\ge 0}.\end{aligned}$ Next: $(g(x))'=3x^2-2$ $\begin{aligned}3x^2-2&=0\\\iff x&=\pm\sqrt{\frac23}\\\implies g'(x)&<0, x\in\left(-\sqrt{\frac23},\sqrt{\frac23}\right).\end{aligned}$ This means $h'(x)<0$ on the same interval and $h'(x)=f'(x)(f(x)+1)^2<0\iff f'(x)<0$ , so $f(x)$ should be decreasing on $\left(-\sqrt{\frac23},\sqrt{\frac23}\right)$ as well, and increasing on $\left(-\infty,-\sqrt{\frac23}\right]\cup\left[\sqrt{\frac23},+\infty\right)$ . Function $g(x)=x^3-2x$ , from the beginning, is odd, so $h(x)=f(x)^3+3f(x)^2+3f(x)$ should also be odd. I think $f(x)$ shouldn't be odd, because $3f(x)^2$ would be even (while $f(x)^3$ and $f(x)$ would be odd) preventing $h$ from being odd.

And we can say $f(0) = (0,0), f(1) = (0,1), f(2) = (1,0), f(3) = (0,2), f(4) = (1,1) ...$ , going diagonally all the way through. I'm trying to find an explicit function for $f$ though. The most I've come up with is that: $0$ maps to $(0,0)$ $1$ and $2$ get mapped to the points $(a,b)$ with $a,b \in \{ 0,1 \}$ , and $a + b = 1$ . $3,4,$ and $5$ get mapped to points $(a,b)$ with $a,b \in \{ 0,1,2 \}$ and $a+b = 2$ . $6, 7, 8$ , and $9$ get mapped to points $(a,b)$ with $a,b \in \{ 0,1,2,3 \}$ and $a + b = 3$ . How can we write an explicit formula for $f(n)?$ I'm aware there are many other ways to show these sets are the same, but I'd like to stick with this technique for now.

But there's another form for the Cauchy-Riemann equations using Wirtinger derivatives: $$\frac{\partial}{\partial \overline{z}} f(z) = 0$$ Doing it this way I get $$\begin{align} \frac{\partial}{\partial \overline{z}} \ln|z| &= \\

[...]
Recall that a function $\phi\in\mathcal{V}$ is called elementary if it has the form $$\phi(t,\omega)=\sum_j e_j(\omega)\cdot\chi_{[t_j, t_{j+1}]}(t)\tag{1}$$ [...] Statement Let $g\in\mathcal{V}$ be bounded and $g(\cdot,\omega)$ continuous for each $\omega$ .

Then, $\phi_n$ is elementary since $g\in\mathcal{V}$ , and $$\int_S^T(g-\phi_n)^2dt\to0\hspace{1.5cm}\text{as }n\to\infty\text{ for each }\omega$$ since $g(\cdot,\omega)$ is continuous for each $\omega$ . Hence $\mathbb{E}\left[\int_S^T(g-\phi_n)^2dt\right]\to0$ as $n\to\infty$ by bounded convergence. My questions : Why does definition of continuity of $g(\cdot,\omega)$ imply that $$\displaystyle{\int_S^T(g-\phi_n)^2dt}\to0\hspace{1.5cm}\text{as }n\to\infty\text{ for each }\omega\hspace{3.5cm}\text{?}$$ My interpretation : I think I am allowed to conceive $\phi_n$ as a kind of step-function, whose value at time $t_n$ corresponds to the value of the continous and bounded function $g$ at time $t_n$ . Does that mean that if I shrink the differential of time $[t_j,t_{j+1})$ , continuity of $g$ implies that $|g-\phi_n|<\varepsilon\text{ for }|t_j-t_{j-1}|<\delta$ (which implies that $\displaystyle{\int_S^T(g-\phi_n)^2dt}\to0\hspace{0.5cm}\text{as }n\to\infty\text{ for each }\omega$ )?

( $A\sim B$ means $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality or there exists 1-1 correspondence $\phi$ between A and B.) The proof is done as follow: If $A\sim B^* \subset B,B\sim A^*\subset A$ ,let $\phi$ be a 1-1 function between $A$ and $B^*$ , $\psi$ be a function between $A^*$ and $B$ . Let $A_0=A^*, B_0=B^*, A_1=A-A_0.$ Define: $$B_1=\phi(A_1)\equiv\{y|y=\phi(x),x\in A_1\}$$ $$A_2=\psi(B_1)\equiv\{x|x=\psi(y),y\in B_1\}$$ (1) $\color{red}{\text{Since}\ A_2\subset A_0}$ , we have $A_1\cap A_2=\emptyset$ . (2) Also, let $B_2=\phi(A_2)$ , since $\phi$ is 1-1, $B_1\cap B_2=\emptyset.$ (3) $\color{red}{\text{In general, if we have constructed } A_1, A_2,..., A_n\ \textbf{pairwise disjoint}, B_1,B_2,...,B_n \ \textbf{pairwise disjoint,}} $$A_{i+1}=\psi(B_i),B_i=\phi(A_i),i=1,2,...,n-1,$ let $$A_{n+1}=\psi(B_n),B_{n+1}=\phi(A_{n+1}).$$ (4) Becuase $\psi$ is 1-1, from $B_1,...B_n$ pairwise disjoint, we know that $\color{red}{A_{n+1}\text{ and } A_2,...,A_n\text{ are pairwise disjoint.}}$ (5) Also, since $A_{n+1}\subset A_o$ , $A_{n+1}$ and $A_1$ are pairwise disjoint. (6) Now, since $\phi$ is 1-1, $A_1,...,A_{n+1}$ are pairwise disjoint, $B_{n+1}$ and $B_1,...,B_n$ are pairwise disjoint. (7) We obtain two sequences of pairwise disjoint sets $\{A_n\}^\infty_{n=1}$ , $\{B_n\}^\infty_{n=1}$ ï¼ $A_{i+1}=\psi(B_n),B_{n+1}=\phi(A_{n+1}),i=1,2,3...$ . Therefore $\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}A_n\sim^\phi\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}B_n$ . (8) Also, through $\psi$ , $B\sim A_0, B_k\sim A_{k+1}$ , therefore $$B-\bigcup^\infty_{k=1}B_k\sim^\psi A_0-\bigcup^\infty_{k=1}A_k=A_0-\bigcup^\infty_{n=2}A_n.$$ (9) $A_1=A-A_0$ , $A_0\subset A\Rightarrow A_0=A-A_1$ . Therefore $$A_0-\bigcup^\infty_{n=2} A_n= A-\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}A_n,$$ therefore \begin{align}
A & = (A-\bigcup^\infty_{n=1} A_n)\cup(\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}A_n)\\

 & \sim (B-\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}B_n)\cup(\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}B_n) \\
 & = B 
\end{align} Starting from (1) and (2). When I first attempted to follow the proof myself, I wrote something: $A_1$ is a subset of $A$ where the one-to-one correspondence does not hold. Therefore, $B_1=\phi(A_1)$ may or may not be in $B_0$ . But then I don't see why $A_2\cap A_1=\emptyset$ . I think I am not quite sure if $\phi$ is the 1-1 function between $A_0$ and $B$ , what exactly is $\phi(A_1)$ . Where will $\phi$ map $A_1$ onto? In my understanding, $A_2\cap A_1=\emptyset$ only if $B_1\subset B_0$ , if so, why?
Did I misunderstand some very important concepts or I misunderstand the proof?. Proceed to line (3), if we iterate the process, we could obtain $A_1\cap A_2=\emptyset$ ï¼ $A_2 \cap A_3=\emptyset$ , so on and so force. It is a weaker condition as compared to pairwise disjoint. Are we simply suppose $A_1,A_2,...,A_n$ are pairwise disjoint? (Similarly, to $B_n$ , 1,...,n.) If that's the case, what makes it supposition legitimate? It first occur to me line (3) to (7) is proof by induction, but I tried to follow the iterative procedure but cannot see why $A_1,A_2,...,A_n$ and $B_1,B_2,...B_n$ are pairwise disjoint. I am pretty lost at the end of the proof. It seems each step other than (1) and (3) are true but I don't know what exactly this proof is showing in each step.

3870113,"Describe all the compact subsets of $\ell^{1}$ -- General Result Proved, Example Needed.","The space $\ell^{1}$ the space of all infinite sequence $\mathbf{x}:=(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},\cdots)$ such that the infinite sum of the coordinate is absolutely convergent. That is, $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}|x_{i}|<\infty$ . We give this space a metric defined as $$d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}):=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}|x_{i}-y_{i}|,$$ and I want to study on the compactness of this space and its subsets. I read several online notes and post in the stackexchange, but what I got was mostly the subsets that are not compact. For example, http://math.stanford.edu/~ksound/Math171S10/Hw7Sol_171.pdf this note shows that $\ell^{1}$ itself is not compact. This post Closed and bounded but not compact subset of $\ell^1$ shows that even closed and bounded subset of $\ell^{1}$ is not compact (so our adorable closed unit ball is not compact). The only thing I got is the page 24 of this note: https://www.math.kit.edu/iana3/~schnaubelt/media/fa14-skript.pdf , but it only gives a sufficient and necessary condition for a subset $K\subset\ell^{p}$ to be relatively compact in $\ell^{p}$ , not compact. Is there a way to describe the compact subsets of $\ell^{1}$ ? Or is there any sufficient (and/or necessary) condition of a subset of $\ell^{1}$ to be compact? Thank you! Edit 1: As commented by Alessandro, I have known the sufficient conditions of relative compact. A subset $K$ that is relatively compact in $\ell^{1}$ has the closure $\overline{K}$ compact in $\ell^{1}$ . Therefore, if I require additionally the set to be closed, then the closure is the set itself and thus the set is compact in $\ell^{1}$ . Therefore, combining the Proposition 1.45 in the page 24 of the note I linked above. We have the following proposition: Proposition. Let $p\in[1,\infty)$ . A set $K\subset\ell^{p}$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded, and $$\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\sup_{(x_{j})\in K}\sum_{j=N+1}^{\infty}|x_{j}|^{p}=0.$$ However, I don't know if such a set truly exists. Is it possible to construct a set $K\subset\ell^{p}$ such that it satisfies all these requirements? Edit 2: As mentioned in the above edition, we have found a general sufficient condition. However, I am not sure if such a set really exists. As commented by ""Kavi"", one such set can be $\{\mathbf{0}\}$ . Indeed, it is clearly bounded. Any singleton is closed with respect to any metric space, proved here: are singletons always closed? . This set contains only zero sequence, so clearly it satisfies $$\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\sup_{(x_{j})\in K}\sum_{j=N+1}^{\infty}|x_{j}|^{p}=0.$$ Therefore, $\{\mathbf{0}\}$ is a compact subset of $\ell^{p}$ . However, is this the only set? Are there any other examples? ""Kavi"" commented that $\{\mathbf{0}\}$ is the only linear subspace that is compact in $\ell^{p}$ , why is this true? Does this mean $\{\mathbf{0}\}$ is the only compact subset? why? Thank you!","['general-topology', 'lp-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'compactness']"

3870206,Geometric Similarity of Functions,"I am a 16 year old high school student and recently I have written a paper on a numerical approximation of distinct functions. I have shown my teachers this and they do not understand it. My questions: Is this a valid theorem to use to estimate functions with differently based functions? Has something similar already been created? Is it all useful/publishable? Any tips on how to improve? I will give an outline but you can find it here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/xjqhfgvrcrbj Definitions Geometric similarity refers to the dilation of a particular shape in all its dimensions. Proofs of geometric similarity are included in congruence proofs of triangles with AAA (Angle-Angle-Angle) proofs. Knowing the sizes of all sides of both triangles: $\triangle{ABC}$ and $\triangle{A'B'C'}$ , to find the dilation factor and prove geometric similarity the following must be true: $\frac{\mid A' \mid}{\mid A \mid} =\frac{\mid B' \mid}{\mid B \mid}=\frac{\mid C' \mid}{\mid C \mid}$ . Interpreting functions as shapes on the Cartesian plane and using geometry, geometrically similar functions can be calculated. Analytically this would imply for a function $y=f(x)\; \{x_0\leq x \leq x_1\}$ a geometrically similar function would be of the form $ny=f(nx)\;\{\frac{x_0}{n}\leq x \leq \frac{x_1}{n}\}$ where $n\in {\rm I\!R}$ . This is because the function is scaled by the same factor in the $x$ and $y$ direction thus would be geometrically similar. $y_1=\sin(x)\;\{0\leq x \leq 2\pi\}$ and $y_2=\frac{1}{2}\sin(2x)\; \{0 \leq x\leq \pi\}$ "" /> However to compare two functions which are distinct, multiplying $x$ and $y$ by $n$ will not suffice for proving similarity. The formula to find the dilation factor can be used to prove similarity between two functions. By describing a function geometrically it has three superficial 'edges' which can be represented as sets. Two of the edges are the two axis $x$ and $y$ . The length of the side ' $y$ ' is the $\max \{ f(x) : x = 1 .. n \}-\min \{ f(x) : x = 1 .. n \}$ and the length of the side $x$ is $b_1$ - $a_1$ where $b_1$ is the upper bound and $a_1$ is the lower bound. Finally the third side of the function will be the arc length over the interval $\{a_1\leq x\leq b_1\}$ . Another characteristic for two shapes to be geometrically similar is the area is increased by the dilation factor squared.Thus from the formula for the dilation factor for two similar triangles the following theorem can be derived: Theorem Let $y_1\;\{a_1\leq x \leq b_1\}$ and $y_2\;\{a_2\leq x \leq b_2\}$ be functions whose derivative exists in every point. If both functions are geometrically similar then the following system holds: \begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\big(b_1-a_1\big)}\int_{a_1}^{b_1}  \sqrt{1+\bigg( \frac{dy_1}{dx}  \bigg) ^{2} } dx= \frac{ 1 }{ \big(b_2-a_2\big) } \int_{a_2}^{b_2}  \sqrt{1+\bigg( \frac{dy_2}{dx}  \bigg) ^{2} } dx
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\big(b_1-a_1\big)^2} \int_{a_1}^{b_1} y_1 dx= \frac{1}{\big(b_2-a_2\big)^2}\int_{a_2}^{b_2} y_2dx 
\end{equation} Similarity Between Distinct Functions When describing a function as distinct it denotes that the functions have different bases, i.e. sinusoidal and exponential. As mentioned above, for geometric similarity to exist of a function $y=f(x)$ the resultant function will become $ny=f(nx)$ . However if comparing functions of different bases, equations (1) and (2) are necessary to find the bounds of similarity. For example, the problem: Find the bounds $b$ and $a$ where $e^x\;\{0\leq x\leq 1\}$ is similar to $x^2 $ . To see examples go to the above link.

Consider $c \in M_2$ . beacuse $f$ is bijective so there is $x \in M_1$ which $f(x)=c$ so $c*f(e_1)=f(x)*f(e_1)=f(x.e_1)=f(x)=c$ and by doing the same for $f(e_1)*c$ we get $c*f(e_1)=f(e_1)*c=c$ and as I said $f(e_1)=e_2$ .

Question 1: With analysis I never know if my argument is complete, so is it complete here? Am I missing something? To show that it is bounded, We know that since $n\in \mathbb{N}$ , we have that $0 < \frac{1}{n} \le 1$ , and so $1 < 1+\frac{1}{n} \le 2$ . Hence it is bounded. Question 2: Another analysis question, how do I even know that I am not using things that have not been defined yet? Like, have I taken things for granted in my proof above? Finally, to find the limit, Can we just say that since this is a monotonically decreasing sequence, that is also bounded we can say that: $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} x_{n} = inf$ ${x_{n} : n \in \mathbb{N}}$ , we can say that the limit in this case would be 1? Question 3: I feel like this is not enough, and we would still have to show officially that 1 is the infimum of this sequence, which I am not sure how I can prove without saying that it makes intuitive sense for me? So if someone could tell me what the official proof of this part would be that would be great. Final Question: Is what I have so far correct or have I made any assumptions that one should not make while solving analysis questions?!","['sequences-and-series', 'monotone-functions', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

First question : how can I rewrite this pullback as a map $f^*\omega:\mathfrak{X}(M)\times...\times \mathfrak{X}(M)\to \Gamma(M,f^*E)$ ?
My problem is that $df:\mathfrak{X}(M)\to \mathfrak{X}(N)$ is well defined as long as $f$ is a diffeomorphism. However, $df:\mathfrak{X}(M)\to \Gamma(M,f^*TN)$ is actually well defined. Then, I know that the connection $f^*\nabla$ on $f^*E\to M$ is uniquely determined by $$(f^*\nabla)(f^*s):=f^*(\nabla(s))\in \Omega^1(M,f^*E)$$ Second question: In some books, I saw the notation $$(f^*\nabla)_X(f^*s)=f^*(\nabla_{df(X)}(s))=\nabla_{df(X)}(s)\circ f$$ but as long as $f$ is not a diffeomorphism $df(X)$ is not a vector field on $N$ so it doesn't make sense writing $\nabla_{df(X)}$ .

Consider the ring of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space $X$ (taking $X=[0,1]$ is also fine as far as this question is concerned), denoted $C(X)$ . Let $I$ be a proper ideal. Is $I=I(S)$ for some $S$ , where $I(S):=\{f\in C(X)\mid  f(s)=0\, \forall s\in S\}$ ?? My naive approach: We know that $I$ is contained in some maximal ideals which are of the form $I(p)$ for some point $p\in X$ according to the above notation. We take all such maximal ideals containing $I$ and intersect them. So $I\subset \bigcap I(p)=I(\bigcup \{p\})$ . I was hoping to show an equality here, but I am not sure how to approach this or whether it is even true that they are equal?? I wonder if taking $f\in \bigcap I(p)$ and $f\notin I$ leads to a contradiction by breaking some maximality condition; like now we have $I\subset (I,f)\subset I(\bigcup \{p\})$ an so on...

This is my first question after the ban and it would make me happy if you don't down-vote if you think that my question is not good or not understandable since I'm probably getting banned again. Please write suggestions for improvement in the comments. Thank you and sorry for this way too long introduction. So here we go :) What do I want to solve? I want to calculate $$I = \cfrac{1}{2\pi i}\int \limits_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\cfrac{\log(s-1)}{s^2}\,x^s \mathrm{d}s,$$ where $c>1$ along the same contour as in ""Applications of integral theorems"", example 5: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_integration#Example_5_â_the_square_of_the_logarithm . To implement our integral $I$ we modify our desired closed contour integral to $$\oint_\mathcal{C}= \left(\int_{R_1}+\int_{R_2}+\int_M+\int_N+\int_r+\int\limits_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\right)\cfrac{\log(s-1)}{s^2}\,x^s\mathrm{d}s,$$ where $R_1$ ends at $c+i\infty$ and $R_2$ ends at $c-i\infty$ .
The whole integral is actually an Inverse laplace transform, if we define $t=\log(x)$ . If we put $\frac{\log(s-1)}{s^2}$ in this online calculator https://www.emathhelp.net/calculators/differential-equations/inverse-laplace-transform-calculator/?f=ln%28s-1%29%2Fs%5E2 we get $-t\operatorname{Ei}(t)+e^t-1 \Longleftrightarrow-\log x\operatorname{li}(x)+x-1$ . How I tried to solve it The integrals $R_1,R_2$ and $r$ tend to zero (I use the same notation as in the Wikipedia link). The closed contour is also equal to zero since $0$ is excluded from the contour. After parameterizing $s=-s_\mathcal{R}+i\varepsilon$ for $M$ and $s=-s_\mathcal{R}-i\varepsilon$ for $N$ we get: $$I + \int\limits_{0}^{\infty}\cfrac{\log\lvert-s_\mathcal{R}+i\varepsilon-1\rvert + i\pi}{(-s_\mathcal{R}+i\varepsilon)^2}\,x^{-s_\mathcal{R}+i\varepsilon}\mathrm{d}s_\mathcal{R}-

Our new expression is $$\begin{align}
    I + \int\limits_{0}^{\infty}\cfrac{\log(s_\mathcal{R}+1) + i\pi}{s_\mathcal{R}^2}\,x^{-s_\mathcal{R}}\mathrm{d}s_\mathcal{R}-
    \int\limits_{0}^{\infty}\cfrac{\log(s_\mathcal{R}+1) - i\pi}{s_\mathcal{R}^2}\,x^{-s_\mathcal{R}}\mathrm{d}s_\mathcal{R}
    =0,
\end{align}$$ which is the same as saying that $$I = -2\pi i\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}\cfrac{1}{x^{s_\mathcal{R}}s_\mathcal{R}^2}\mathrm{d}s_\mathcal{R}$$ And now the disappointment: If I put ""integral from 0 to infinity of 1/(a^x*x^2)"" into Wolfram Alpha it returns ""(integral does not converge)"". I can't find the mistake I did while evaluating. Please give me a small hint what I should correct to get the desired result. Thank you :)! Edit: I want to thank Maxim for helping me with my question. My mistake was the definition of the branch of $\log(s-1)$ .

To be clear, I understand why conjugacy is important in certain examples. For instance: In $GL(n, \mathbb{F})$ , for example, if two matrices are conjugate then they have the same rank, nullity, trace, determinant, and so on. In $S_n$ , two permutations are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle type.

The constant on the integral must be 0 to retain the initial conditions. $$y(z) = e^{\int \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} dz}$$ Multiply by $\frac{k(z)'}{k(z)}$ on  both sides $$y(z) \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} = \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} e^{\int \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} dz}$$ Integrate across. $a$ is some constant. $$\int y(z) \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} dz + a = \int \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} e^{\int \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} dz} dz$$ The right hand side evaluates to e^{\int \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} dz}, so we have$$ $$\int y(z) \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} dz + a = e^{\int \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} dz}$$ But we know that $e^{\int \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} dz} = y(z)$ so we have $$y(z) = \int y(z) \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} dz + a$$ Now we'll recurse once $$y(z) = \int \Bigl( \int y(z) \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} dz + a  \Bigr) \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} dz + a$$ And now we take a derivative $$y(z)' = \Bigl( \int y(z) \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} dz + a  \Bigr) \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)}$$ And move that fraction over. $$y(z)' \frac{k(z)}{k(z)'} = \int y(z) \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} dz + a $$ And one more derivative. $$y(z)'' \frac{k(z)}{k(z)'} + y(z)' \Bigl( 1 - \frac{k(z)''}{k(z)'^2} \Bigr) = y(z) \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)}$$ Lets subtract the right hand side over now $$y(z)'' \frac{k(z)}{k(z)'} + y(z)' \Bigl( 1 - \frac{k(z)''}{k(z)'^2} \Bigr) - y(z) \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} = 0$$ And multiply by $ \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} $ across the whole equation. $$y(z)'' + y(z)' \Bigl( \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} - \frac{k(z)''}{k(z)'} \Bigr) + y(z) \Bigl( -\frac{k(z)'^2}{k(z)^2} \Bigr) = 0$$ If you check this with $ y(z) = k(z),$ you will find that it yields a correct solution. $$y(z)'' + \frac{y(z)'^2}{y(z)} - y(z)'' - \frac{y(z)'^2}{y(z)} = 0$$ Just a heads up, when I say and function, I mean those functions which are differentiable and integrable. Okay, thats neat. This seems to me like it should be pretty fool proof for any function. If you know k(z), then you automatically know y(z), because they are the same. Just set $\Bigl( \frac{k(z)'}{k(z)} - \frac{k(z)''}{k(z)'} \Bigr)$ to f(z) and $\Bigl( -\frac{k(z)'^2}{k(z)^2} \Bigr)$ to g(z). Both of those are easy enough to solve. Here's the thing though, it doesn't work. Also, in setting to two above coefficients to f(z) and g(z) respectively, you have two equations and can solve for f(z) in terms of g(z). It comes out to be $\,2f(z) = g(z)'/g(z)\,$ if you're interested, and this doesn't hold for any of the examples I tried. I even tried going through and solving an example with constant coefficients and then reverse plugging into the equation I just explained. I wondered if maybe the coefficients would pop out and the rest would cancel, but nope. No dice. I was left with something of the form $$\frac{1}{c_1e^{az} + c_2e^{-az}}$$ So my question is, why doesn't this work? If I have $y(z) = k(z)$ and I make any other substitution for k(z), it could always be re-substituted back with k(z) at the end. And if I try to substitute in and other function for f(z) or g(z), it will always be able to be re-substituted back in at the end also. As far as I can tell, I haven't broken any rules. I feel very confused about this and strangely anxious. If anyone is able to shed some light on why this doesn't work, I'd be very grateful.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

By symmetry I got $$I_n = 2n\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\int_0^\infty xe^{-x^2}\operatorname{erf}(x)^{n-1}\,dx,$$ and then by integration by parts, for $n\ge2$ , $$I_n = \frac{2\sqrt2}{\pi}n(n-1)\int_0^\infty e^{-2x^2}\operatorname{erf}(x)^{n-2}\,dx,$$ where $\operatorname{erf}$ is the error function. These two formulas give me $$I_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}},\quad I_2 = 2\sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}},\quad I_3 = \frac{12}{\pi\sqrt\pi}\arctan\frac{\sqrt2}{2}.$$ In this step, I think a general closed-form is almost impossible, so I post here to see if anyone has a better approach (at least for $I_4$ ). Update Series expansion of $I_4$ : $$I_4 = \frac{8\sqrt2}{\pi^2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac43\right)^n\frac{n!}{(2n+1)!}\,\Gamma(n+3/2)\,{}_2F_1(1/2,-n;3/2;1/4).$$ By the way $$I_n = \sqrt2n\int_0^1t^{n-1}\operatorname{erf}^{-1}(t)\,dt \,=\!\!\!?\; \sqrt2n\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k \left(\frac{\sqrt\pi}{2}\right)^{2k+1}\frac1{2k+n+1},$$ where $a_k$ is the $k$ -th coefficient of the Maclaurin series of $\operatorname{erf}^{-1}(2x/\sqrt\pi)$ (see InverseErf ). Well, I don't really know the behavior of $(a_k)$ , but numerically the series does converge. I don't think this will lead to anything though. Let me explain a little about this problem. Imagine we have $n$ points to throw at 0 at the real axis, and the resulted position of one point is determined by $\mathcal N(0,1)$ . We want to study the behavior of the farthest distance from 0. This distance $D = \|G\|_\infty$ is determined by the density function defined below $$f:x \mapsto n\sqrt{\frac2\pi}\,\exp\left(-\frac{x^2}2\right) \operatorname{erf}^{n-1}\frac{x}{\sqrt2} \mathbb1_{x\ge0}.$$ (For fun one can check that $\int_0^\infty f(x)\,dx=1$ .) And now, what we want to know is, how to calculate $\mathbb E(D)$ (at least when $n=4$ )? @YuriNegometyanov has given a formula for $\mathbb E(\|G\|_2)$ . Even though it's not quite the topic, let's write it down as well: $$\mathbb E(\|G\|_2) =\sqrt2\,\frac{\Gamma\left(\dfrac{n+1}2\right)}{\Gamma\left(\dfrac n2\right)}.$$ A jupyter notebook to calculate numerical results. So from the series expansion of $I_4$ mentioned above (and tons of calculation), I got: $$I_4 = \frac{24}{\pi\sqrt\pi}\arctan\frac{1}{2\sqrt2}.$$ This is kind of interesting since the form is similar to $I_3$ .

Then the intersection $\bigcap\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} Q_{k}$ is closed and nonempty. Proof : Let $S=\bigcap\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} Q_{k} .$ Then $S$ is closed [As intersection of an arbitrary collection of close sets is closed]. To show that $S$ is nonempty, we exhibit a point $x$ in $S .$ We can assume that each $Q_{k}$ contains infinitely many points; otherwise the proof is trivial. Now form a collection of distinct points $A=\left\{{x}_{1}, {x}_{2}, \ldots \right\},$ where ${x}_{k} \in Q_{k}, $ since $A$ is an infinite set contained in the bounded set $Q_{1},$ it has an accumulation point, say $x$ . We shall show that $x \in S$ by verifying that $x \in Q_{k}$ for each $k .$ It will suffice to show that $x$ is an accumulation point of each $Q_{k},$ since they are all closed sets. But every neighborhood of ${x}$ contains infinitely many points of $A,$ and since all except (possibly) a finite number of the points of $A$ belong to $Q_{k},$ this neighborhood also contains infinitely many points of $Q_{k}$ . Therefore $x$ is an accumulation point of $Q_{k}$ and the theorem is proved.

In his book Algebraic Groups and Class Fields , chapter IV Â§3, Serre introduces the module $\underline{\Omega}_Q'$ of regular differentials at $Q$ . A differential $\omega \in D_k(K)$ is called regular, iff \begin{equation}\sum_{P \mapsto Q} \operatorname{Res}_P(f \omega) = 0 \quad \text{for all} \  f\in \mathcal{O}_Q'.\end{equation} Similarly to $\mathcal{O}_Q$ , Serre defines $$ \underline{\Omega}_Q = \bigcap_{P \mapsto Q} \Omega_P.$$ Since every differential $\omega \in \underline{\Omega}_Q$ has no poles at any point $P \mapsto Q$ , clearly $\operatorname{Res}_P(f \omega) = 0$ for $f \in \mathcal{O}_Q'$ , so that $\underline{\Omega}_Q \subset \underline{\Omega}_Q'$ . Now to my question: The mapping \begin{align}
\mathcal{O}_Q / \mathcal{O}_Q' \times \underline{\Omega}_Q' / \underline{\Omega}_Q & \to k \\
(f, \omega) & \mapsto \sum_{P \mapsto Q} \operatorname{Res}_P(f \omega)
\end{align} is clearly bilinear and well-defined. Serre claims that it is a perfect pairing, but I don't know why. I think we have to show two things: If $f \in \mathcal{O}_Q$ , with the property that for each $\omega \in \underline{\Omega}_Q'$ , one has $\sum_P \operatorname{Res}_P(f \omega) = 0$ , then in fact $f \in \mathcal{O}_Q'$ . If $\omega \in \underline{\Omega}_Q'$ , such that for each $f \in \mathcal{O}_Q$ , one has $\sum \operatorname{Res}_P(f \omega) = 0$ , then $\omega \in \underline{\Omega}_Q$ , i.e. $\omega$ is regular at every $P \mapsto Q$ . Any help would be appreciated :)","['algebraic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'singularity-theory']"
3872260,Solution to a differential equation in a specific format,"I am having trouble getting the solution that this problem is asking for. The problem is:
""Show that the general solution to the differential equation $$x \frac{dy}{dx} = y \ln(x)$$ is $$ y = Cx^{\ln(\sqrt{x})}$$ I used separation and got: $$ \int \frac 1y dy = \int \frac{\ln(x)}{x} dx $$ Integrating both sides I got: $$ \ln (y) = \frac{({\ln(x)})^2}{2} +c $$ Then I raised both sides as a power of e and considered e to the power of c as my constant C and got: $$ y = Ce^{\frac{({\ln(x)})^2}{2}}$$ Then I considered the portion containing e as: $$ (e^{({\ln(x)})^2})^\frac 12 $$ This finally gave me : $$ y= C\sqrt {(x^{\ln(x)})} $$ I do not know how the form in the problem was reached.","['calculus', 'algebra-precalculus', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
3872314,Meaning of directional derivative of a vector field,"Suppose I have a vector field $ \vec{B} (x,y,z)$ then do $ \frac{ \partial B}{ \partial n}$ where n is the direction vector of a line denote the directional derivative of the vector in the direction of $n$ ? The reason I ask is that I recently encountered this in a physics textbook but all the gradients and directional derivatives that I've seen till now were defined for scalar fields. Edit: The real quantity that I started with was the one from this mse post : $$ (\nabla B_i) n_i $$ I thought this would be the directional derivative since it looked like one but then I later realized this is actually a vector field.

3872443,Weak markov property question,"I have a doubt concerning the definition of Weak Markov Property: Weak Markov Property: For every initial distribution $\mu$ and every $(X_1, ... , X_n)$ we have $E_\mu (h(X_{n+1},X_{n+2},...) | x_0, x_1, ..., x_n ) = E_{x_n} (h(X_1,..., X_n) )$ provided the expectation exists. My textbook says that, when $h()$ is the indicator function, this property boils down to the very Markov chains definition property, i.e. $P((X_{n+1} | x_0, ... , x_n )=P(X_{n+1} | x_n )$ I see that if $h() = 1_A () $ then
the weak markov property gets $P_\mu ((X_{n+1},X_{n+2},...) \in A | x_0, x_1, ..., x_n ) = P_{x_n} ((X_1,..., X_n) \in A)$ , but I am not sure how to go from here to $P((X_{n+1} | x_0, ... , x_n )=P(X_{n+1} | x_n )$ . Can someone help? Thanks!","['probability-theory', 'markov-chains']"

3872515,Reference Request: Witt Vectors,"I'm interested in a nice (and possibly gentle) introduction to Witt vectors . It doesn't need to go into too much detail, for now, I'd just like to roughly know what they are about. So essentially my wish is something along the following lines: a definition/construction along with some motivation and possibly some suggestive examples/applications. (Though I would fancy references that do not satisfy all of this points.) The Wikipedia article seems decent but I'm interested to know where members from MSE first learned about Witt vectors and what you would recommend. (I was surprised by the way that there was no reference request about Witt vectors on MSE or MO. Usually, those forums would be the first place for me to check when I am looking for good book suggestions.)","['number-theory', 'p-adic-number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'reference-request']"
