334028,What is true for a ring with exactly two right ideals,"This is question #66 from http://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/practice_book_math.pdf Let $R$ be a ring with a multiplicative identity. If $U$ is an additive subgroup of $R$ such that $ur \in U$ for all 
  $u \in U$ and for all $r \in R$ , then $U$ is said to be a right ideal of $R$. If $R$ has exactly two right ideals, which of 
  the following must be true? I. $R$ is commutative. II. $R$ is a division ring (that is, all elements except the additive identity have multiplicative inverses). III. $R$ is infinite. Here is my reasoning: Because $R$ is a ring, $R$ is also a additive group with some identity element $0$. We have a theorem that says $0r = 0 $ in any ring, so $\{0\}$ is a right ideal of $R$. Also, $R$ is a right ideal of $R$. Now I have found two different right ideals and there mustn't be any more. Edit: As mentioned in the comments, the example below is not a ring, so it is not applicable to the problem. I could not fix it by taking additive closure because that introduced more than two ideals. A possible candidate for $R$ could be the set of $2\times2$ matrices $\{0,I,-I,a,-a\}$ where $a = [[^1_0] ,[^0_0]]$. The only right ideals are $R$ and $\{0\}$. This ring satisfies only property I, but the answer key says that II is the correct answer.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Then prove that every irrducible component of $Y\cap H$ has dimension $r-1$ Here is my idea to prove : Suppose that $Y\cap H =\cup U_i$ then $I(Y\cap H)=I(\cup U_{i})$ . It is not hard to check that $f \in I(Y\cap H)$ then $(f)\subseteq I(U_{i})$ for each $i$ . Since $U_i$ is irreducible then $I(U_{i})$ is a prime ideal. Then if $I(U_i)$ is minimal over $(f)$ then we can use Krull Principal Ideal Theorem to prove that ht $I(U_i)=1$ , then dim $U_i=r-1$ I have two question : Is my strategy wrong ? If I am on the right way, how can I show that $I(U_{i})$ is minimal over $(f)$ ? Thank for reading my question.",['algebraic-geometry']

$$\begin{bmatrix} \epsilon & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}. $$ But then it seems small changes in the entries of $A$ correspond to equally small changes in the Jordan form of $A$. Did I do something wrong?

My second question is: given some composite p, you can still construct a ring (now with zero divisors) that can be constructed as the inverse limit of $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$. Any such p has a finite prime factorization, so is there a way to construct this non-integral-domain ring of composite p-adics by taking some sort of product of the rings of p-adics of its prime factors? For instance, can you construct the 10-adics by taking the direct product of the 2-adics and the 5-adics, or perhaps is it the tensor product, or...? My last question is: I haven't seen much about taking tensor products about p-adic integers in general; I've only seen stuff about taking direct products, as in the case of the profinite completion $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ of the integers. However, I find the tensor product to be of particular interest, since it's a coproduct in the category of commutative rings. So what, in general, do you get if you take the tensor product of two rings of p-adic integers? And I'm especially curious to know, what do you get if you take the tensor product of all of the rings of p-adic integers, rather than the direct product in the case of $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}$?","['tensor-products', 'ring-theory', 'p-adic-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

A formal language is p-regular (also: a pure-group language) if it is accepted by a permutation automaton. The transition monoid of an automaton is the set of all functions on the set of states
induced by input strings. See the page for more details. The transition monoid can be regarded as a monoid acting on the set of states. See this Wiki page for more details. In many literatures, an automaton is called strongly connected when the monoid action is transitive, i.e. there is always at least one transition (input string) from one state to another state. The transition monoid of a permutation automaton can be regarded as a permutation group acting on the set of states. If the action is transitive, then the transition monoid is a transitive permutation group.

Here my own ideas: Notice that we have a sphere, thus every curve seperates the surface and $\chi(F)=2$ (in addition these two facts are equivalent). But then, cutting along a curve must give:
$$2=\chi(F_1)+\chi(F_2)$$
But $\chi(F_i)\leq2$ because the Euler-characteristic is always lower of equal to $2$. But then we have two possbilities: $2=2+0$ or $2=1+1$. The first can not be true because every curve seperates the sphere. Thus it must be the second one. But then we may conclude that we have two discs.

Let $X$ be a compat hausdorff space and let $A$ be the ring ($\mathbb{R}$-algebra) of continuous functions $X\to \mathbb{R}$. We define $Y=MaxSpec(A)$ to be the set of maximal ideals of $A$ and we can endow it with the subspace topology induced from $Spec(A)$ with the usual Zariski topology. Now, for each point $x\in X$ the subset $\mathfrak{m}_x\subseteq A$ of functions vanishing at $x$ is a maximal ideal and therefore we can define a function $\mu:X\to Y$ by $\mu(x)=\mathfrak{m}_x$. It is known that $\mu$ is a homeomorphism (so far, this is an exercise in Atiyah-
Macdonald). Now, $X$ can be turned into a locally-ringed space by taking the structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X$ to be the sheaf of continuous real functions. For each point $x\in X$ we can look at the stalk $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ at $x$ and it turns out (if I am not mistaken) that it is exactly $A_{\mathfrak{m}_x}$ (there is a canonical isomorphism). So, is it possible to turn $Y$ into a locally ringed space such that the stalk at $\mathfrak{m}$ will be exactly $A_\mathfrak{m}$ (like with the usual $spec$)? and if it is, $\mu$ will be an isomorphism of locally-ringed spaces, right? what will $MaxSpec(A)$ be as a locally-ringed space for general rings?

334702,"Geometric intuition for Jordan normal forms (invariant subspaces, shearing, scaling, etc.)","I'm trying to visualize what a linear operator does to a vector space if that operator can be put into Jordan normal form. For concrete motivation, let's take $V = \mathbb{R}^3$, with some linear operator $T: V \rightarrow V$, and let's assume $T$ can be written as an upper-triangular matrix $M$. Then $T$ stabilizes a complete flag: there's a nested sequence of invariant subspaces $U \subset W \subset V$, with $\dim U = 1$ and $\dim W = 2$. Geometrically,  $T$ fixes a line and a plane containing that line. This already tosses out lots of transformations; I would like to know what possibilities are left. For starters, I think $T$ can't be a rotation around a line contained in $W$, since that would move $W$, and it also can't be a rotation around a line passing through $W$, since that would move $U$; so apparently $T$ can't be a rotation at all (except possibly by $\pi$ or $2\pi$). However, it seems like certain combinations of shearing, reflecting and scaling would work, although even there I must be careful. (The exact combinations allowable seem complicated.) Is this it? Am I missing anything? Suppose I further want $M$ to be diagonalizable. If I 'pin down' another line in $W$, I think this would rule out shearing of $W$ along any line it contains (although shearing of $V$ along the plane $W$ would still be OK) and $M$ would become slightly more diagonal: a 2x2 upper-triangular matrix and an eigenvalue sitting in the corner. Finally, if I 'pin down' a line passing through $W$, I think it would toss out shearing of $V$ altogether and $M$ would finally be diagonal. Is this right? Next, let's turn to a general n-dimensional $V$ with $T: V \rightarrow V$, and assume its $n$ x $n$ matrix $M$ is Jordan. Then $T$ stabilizes a flag; but also, every $m$ x $m$ Jordan block corresponds to some $m \le n$ - dimensional invariant subspace which itself contains a nested sequence of invariant subspaces, so I think $T$ in fact stabilizes many different flags! Is this right? Is it correct to say that $T$ would then act on each of these subspaces as described above? Can we describe the process of diagonalizing $T$, if possible, as equivalent to finding more and more invariant subspaces of progressively smaller dimension (eventually dim 1), collapsing each Jordan block as we go and ruling out more and more transformations (rotations, shears, etc.) until all that's left is scaling along each 1-dimensional subspace?

$z = \cos{\frac{k\pi}{2}} + i\sin{\frac{k\pi}{2}}$, where $k$ is a positive integer less than $4$.  These numbers can be represented solely with the integers.  If we want to add discrete angles that are multiples of $30^\circ = \frac{2\pi}{12}$, we need a quadratic extension of the integers so that we have quadratic (algebraic) integers of the form $a + b\sqrt 3$.  This allows us to represent the twelfth roots of unity as x and y coordinates.  If we wish to double the number of angles to $15^\circ = \frac{2\pi}{24}$ multiples, we must extend our field again, forming a tower of quadratic extensions with numbers of the form $(a + b\sqrt 3) + (c + d\sqrt 3)\sqrt 2$.  Numbers of this form allow us to represent the $24^{th}$ roots of unity. How does this work in a finite field?  Can I choose a finite field such that I can exactly represent the $n^{th}$ roots of unity in a manner analogous to the above?  I'm particularly interested in constructable numbers , which feature only quadratic extensions (and multiquadratic extensions like $\sqrt{5 + \sqrt 5}$).  In particular this means that $n$ is restricted to having factors of 2 and Fermat primes .  I restricted myself to powers of $2$ and Fermat prime $3$ in my example above.  Both $12$ and $24$ have factors of only $2$ and $3$. - Edit - To try to clarify what I'm struggling with.  I do not see how to find or use a finite field that has been extended twice or more (e.g. angles of $\frac{\pi}{12}$ as described above), as the relationship to the complex plane in a finite field setting seems to blur as the tower of extensions grows. This is a new subject for me, so I'd really appreciate an example or two to go along with any explanations.","['galois-theory', 'trigonometry', 'finite-fields', 'roots-of-unity']"

334812,Original Formulation of Hilbert's 14th Problem,"I have a problem seeing how the original formulation of Hilbert's 14th Problem is ""the same"" as the one found on wikipedia . Hopefully someone in here can help me with that. Let me quote Hilbert first: Es sei eine Anzahl $m$ von ganzen rationalen Funktionen $X_1,\dots,X_m$ der $n$ Variablen $x_1,\dots,x_n$ vorgelegt:
  \begin{equation}\begin{split}X_1&=f_1(x_1,\dots,x_n)\\&\vdots\\X_m&=f_m(x_1,\dots,x_n).\end{split}\end{equation}
  (He calls this system of substitutions (S)). Jede ganze rationale Verbindung von $X_1,\dots,X_m$ wird offenbar durch Eintragung dieser Ausdrücke notwendig stets eine ganze rationale Funktion von $x_1,\dots,x_n$. Es kann jedoch sehr wohl gebrochene rationale Funktionen von $X_1,\dots,X_m$ geben, die nach Ausführung jener Substitution (S) zu ganzen Funktionen in $x_1,\dots,x_n$ werden. Eine jede solche rationale Funktion von $X_1,\dots,X_m$, die nach Ausführung der Substitution (S) ganz in $x_1,\dots,x_n$ wird, möchte ich eine relativganze Funktion von $X_1,\dots,X_m$ nennen. Jede ganze Funktion von $X_1,\dots,X_m$ ist offenbar auch relativganz; ferner ist die Summe, die Differenz und das Produkt relativganzer Funktionen stets wiederum relativganz. Das entstehende Problem ist nun: zu entscheiden, ob es stets möglich ist, ein endliches System von relativganzen Funktionen von $X_1,\dots,X_m$ aufzufinden, durch die sich jede andere relativganze Funktion in ganzer rationaler Weise zusammensetzen läßt. Okay, unfortunately this is in German. Here's what I made out of it, but can't guarantee it is right: Start with $f_1,\dots,f_m\in k[x_1,...,x_n]$ for some field $k$. For every $g\in k[X_1,\dots,X_m]$, $g(f_1,\dots,f_m)$ is then a polynomial in the $x_i$. But there can be $\varphi\in k(X_1,\dots,X_m)$ such that $\varphi(f_1,\dots,f_m)\in k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, which Hilbert calls ""relativganz"". Every polynomial in the $X_i$ is of course already relativganz, as well as sum, difference, and product of functions which are relativganz. The problem: Is it always possible to find finitely many r-g functions $g_1,\dots,g_s$ in $k(X_1,\dots,X_m)$ such that every r-g function $\varphi$ can be expressed in the $g_i$ in a polynomial way? Now the formulation as it is mentioned on wikipedia: Let $k$ be a field, and $K\subseteq k(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ be a subfield. Is the ring $R=K\cap k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ finitely generated as a ring? So, as for the original formulation, we can choose $R$ to be the ring of r-g functions. But what is $K$ in this case? I feel like the choice of $f_1,\dots,f_m$ should correspond one-to-one to the choice of the subfield $K$. Is it possible, given the second formulation, to translate this back to the notion of ""relativganz"", i.e., can I always interpret $R$ as a ring of r-g functions? Are they really equivalent? Sorry for the many question in this last paragraph, but I want to really understand how to translate between those two seemingly different formulations :-) Thank you very much in advance!","['commutative-algebra', 'invariant-theory', 'math-history', 'abstract-algebra']"
