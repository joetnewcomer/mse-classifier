585965,Condition for meromorphic to imply rational,"Let $f(z)$ be meromorphic on $\mathbb{C}$, and suppose there exists an $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $f^{-1}(w)$ has at most $m$ points for all $w\in\mathbb{C}$. I want to show that $f(z)$ is a rational function. The first claim I want to show is that, for $w_0$ where the number of points in $f^{-1}(w_0)$ is maximum, $f(z)$ attains values near $w_0$ only near points in $f^{-1}(w_0)$. The inverse function theorem should work well to establish this claim provided $f'(z_0)\neq 0$ for some $z_0\in f^{-1}(w_0)$. But I cannot see why that has to be true. Is the inverse function theorem a good approach to this?",['complex-analysis']
586001,Could anyone clarify this definition?,"In Michael Spivak's Calculus to explain limits, he uses such an example: We're given a function $f(x) = \left\{0, \quad \quad \quad \quad x \,\,\, \text{irrational} \\ \quad\quad\quad\quad\frac{1}{q}, \quad \quad \quad x = \frac{p}{q} \,\,\,\text{in lowest terms},\,\, 0<x<1  \right\}$ And we are told that to prove that for any number $a$ with $0<a<1$ the function approaches a at $a$, we consider any number $\epsilon > 0$ and any natural number $n$ large enough, that $\frac{1}{n}\leq \epsilon$. And here is the part I don't get: that $1/n\le\varepsilon$. Notice that the only numbers $x$ for which $|f(x)-0|< \varepsilon$ could be false are: $$\frac{1}{2};\frac{1}{3};\frac{2}{3};\frac{1}{4};\frac{3}{4};\frac{1}{5};\frac{2}{5};\frac{3}{5};\frac{4}{5};\ldots;\frac{1}{n},\ldots,\frac{n-1}{n}.$$ (If $a$ is rational, then $a$ might be one of these numbers.) However many of these numbers there may be, there are, at any rate, only finitely many. What does he mean by only finitely many ? Can't I just go on $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 
\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{500}, \frac{1}{5000000000}, \frac{1}{500000000^{5000000000}}$ and so on? Also then he says that if the distance between $x$ and $a$ is less than the distance between the difference between the closest rational number betewen $0$ and $1$, and $a$, then $x$ is not one of the rational numbers between $0$ and $1$ or in other words: Set $A$ contains all rational numbers between $0$ and $1$ From all members of $A$, $\frac{p}{q}$ is closest to $a$ $|\frac{p}{q} - a| = \delta$ if $|x - a| < \delta$, then $x$ does not belong in $A$ I don't get it - why doesn't $x$ belong in $A$?It all seems like random assumptions coming out of nowhere, I'm not sure I'm following.Could someone clarify this here?","['intuition', 'functions']"

586015,Question on Proof of Shoelace Formula,"I was looking for a way to prove the shoelace formula when I found this proof: For this clockwise order to make sense, you need a point O inside the polygon so that the angles form $OA_{i}A_{i+1}$ and $OA_{n}A_{1}$ are all positive.

587186,"Are systems of equations inherently ""more expressible"" than single equations?","The main, broader question is whether a solution set of a system of equations can ever be such that it can't be described by a single equation.

587189,Riemannian Manifolds with $n(n+1)/2$ dimensional symmetry group,"Given a $n$-dimensional connected Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, its symmetry group $G$ can be considered as a subbundle of orthonormal frame bundle of $M$ (which I call $F_OM$), yielding: $$\dim G\le \dim F_OM=\dim M +\dim O(n)={n+n(n-1)\over 2}=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$ (Here the embedding $\phi:G \hookrightarrow F_OM$ is defined by singling out an arbitrary point $p \in M$ and orthonormal frame $(v_1,...,v_n) \in F_{O,p} M$ and defining $\phi: g \mapsto (gp,g_*v_1,...,g_*v_n)$. However, it takes some work to verify that this map is indeed injective.) These considerations made me wonder which manifolds have a maximally large symmetry group, i.e. which $M$ do satisfy $\dim G= \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Of, course $\Bbb R^n,\Bbb S^n$ and $\Bbb H^n$ have got this property, but are there any other exotic examples? (Some thoughts of mine on this problem: One can see that $M$ is homogenuous and isotropic. Each stabiliser of a point has to be isomorphic to either $SO(n)$ or $O(n)$. In particular, $M$ has constant curvature, which implies that $M$ has to be one of $\Bbb R^n,\Bbb S^n$ and $\Bbb H^n$ if $M$ is complete and simply-connected.)","['riemannian-geometry', 'manifolds', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"
587201,"Where does Klein's j-invariant take the values 0 and 1, and with what multiplicities?","I tried to solve the following problem from Ahlfors' text, please verify my solution: Where does the function $$J(\tau)=\frac{4}{27} \frac{(1-\lambda+\lambda^2)^3}{\lambda^2(1-\lambda)^2} $$
  take the values $0$ and $1$, and with what multiplicities? Here $\lambda$ is the modular $\lambda$ function, defined by $$\lambda(\tau)=\frac{e_3-e_2}{e_1-e_2} $$
where $e_1=\wp(\omega_1/2),e_2=\wp(\omega_2/2),e_3=\wp((\omega_1+\omega_2)/2).$ My attempt: First part - solving $J(\tau)=0$ Since $\lambda$ is holomorphic in the upper half plane, and never takes the values $0,1$ it follows that $J(\tau)=0 \Longleftrightarrow 1-\lambda+\lambda^2=0 \Longleftrightarrow \tau \in \lambda^{-1} \{\exp(\pm 2 \pi i/6) \}$. After examining this picture from Wikipedia: I've speculated that $\lambda(\exp(2\pi i/6))=\exp(2 \pi i/6),\lambda(\exp(2 \pi i/3))=\exp(- 2 \pi i/6)$. ( However, I have no idea how to prove it ) Since the region bounded by the lines $\Re \tau= \pm 1$ and the upper semi circles $|\tau \mp 1/2|=1/2$ is a fundamental region for $\lambda$ (""half"" of the boundary needs to be included) it follows that $\exp(2 \pi i/6)$ and $\exp(2 \pi i/3)$ are the only two zeros there, and due to the cube in the numerator of $J(\tau)$ it's clear that they are zeros of order $3$ each. Using additional symmetries of the j-invariant, such as $1$-periodicity, and the Schwarz reflection principle about the upper semi-circles $|\tau-n-1/2|=1/2$ all other zeros are found and they are all of order $3$ as well. Second part - solving $J(\tau)=1$ Well, $J(\tau)=1 \Longleftrightarrow 4(1-\lambda+\lambda^2)^3-27 \lambda^2 (1-\lambda)^2=0 \Longleftrightarrow (2 \lambda-1)^2(\lambda-2)^2 (\lambda+1)^2$. This shows that $J(\tau)=1 \Longleftrightarrow \tau \in \lambda^{-1} \{1/2,2,-1\}$, and at each such $\tau$ the value $1$ is taken with multiplicity 2. Now, in the fundamental region I suppose we have $\lambda(i)=\frac{1}{2},\lambda(1/2+1/2 i)=2,\lambda(1+i)=-1$, and all other solutions can be found by the symmetries of $J$. My doubts: I am not entirely sure that my approach is correct. I don't know how to prove any of the equations of the form $\lambda(\tau_0)=w_0$ above. Please tell me if the above is correct, and help me prove the equations $\lambda(\tau_0)=w_0$. Thanks! EDIT: The end of this file might have some value.

  $$f(z)=\frac{\sin z}{z},\quad\text{for }z\in\mathbb{C}.$$
  What is the maximum of $f$ in the closed unit disc
  $$D:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|\leq 1\}?$$ Of course, we can apply the Maximum Modulus Principle to get that
$$\max_{z\in D}|f(z)|=\max_{|z|=1}\frac{|\sin z|}{|z|}=\max_{|z|=1}|\sin z|$$
But then I don't see any easy way to find the maximum of $\sin z$ on the unit circle. I ploted the graph and I found that it is
$$|\sin i|=\frac{e-e^{-1}}{2}$$
Here is my attempt to prove it: Let $F(\theta)=|f(e^{i\theta})|^2$. Then,
\begin{align}
F(\theta) &= |\sin(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)|^2 \\
&= |\sin(\cos\theta)\cosh(\sin\theta)+i\cos(\cos\theta)\sinh(\sin\theta)|^2 \\
&= \sin^2(\cos\theta)\cosh^2(\sin\theta)+\cos^2(\cos\theta)\sinh^2(\sin\theta) \\
&=\sin^2(\cos\theta)\cosh^2(\sin\theta)+(1-\sin^2(\cos\theta))\sinh^2(\sin\theta) \\
&=\sin^2(\cos\theta)\big(\cosh^2(\sin\theta)-\sinh^2(\sin\theta)\big)+\sinh^2(\sin\theta) \\
&= \sin^2(\cos\theta)+\sinh^2(\sin\theta) 
\end{align}
Hence,
\begin{align}
F'(\theta) &= -2\sin(\cos\theta)\cos(\cos\theta)\sin\theta+2\sinh(\sin\theta)\cosh(\sin\theta)\cos\theta \\
&=\sinh(2\sin\theta)\cos\theta-\sin(2\cos\theta)\sin\theta
\end{align}
which vanishes whenever
$$\theta=\frac{n\pi}{2},\quad n\in\mathbb{Z}.$$
Then, we try and find
$$F(0)=\sin^2 1,\quad F(\pi/2)=\sinh^2 1,\quad F(\pi)=\sin^21,\quad F(3\pi/2)=\sinh^21$$
But $\sin^21<\sinh^21$ (which I am not sure how to justify with only pen and paper) so the maximum is with $\theta=\pi/2$ or $3\pi/2$. This gives the desired result. This seems overly complicated for this kind of problem. Is there a better way?","['complex-numbers', 'complex-analysis', 'analysis']"

Then: $2^{{14}^{45231}}$ (mod $31$) = $2^{{14}^{45231} (\textrm{mod}30)}$ (mod $31$) Since $30 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \quad $ I need to solve: $$\begin{matrix} 14^{45231} \equiv a_1 \; (\textrm{mod} \; 2) \\ 14^{45231} \equiv a_2 \; (\textrm{mod} \; 3) \\ 14^{45231} \equiv a_3 \; (\textrm{mod} \; 5) \end{matrix}$$ That means to solve: $$ \begin{matrix} x \equiv 0 \; (\textrm{mod} \; 2) \\ x \equiv -1 \equiv 2 \; (\textrm{mod} \; 3) \\ x \equiv -1 \equiv 4 \; (\textrm{mod} \; 5) \end{matrix}$$ Let $N = 30 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$; $n_1=2$; $n_2=3$; $n_3=5$, since $\textrm{gdc}(n_i,n_j) = 1 \; \forall i \neq j \; ; \; i,j \in (1,2,3)$, I can use the chinese remaider theorem which gives me that: $$x = \sum_{i=1}^{3}a_i \cdot N_i \cdot y_i \; (\textrm{mod} \; n_1 \cdot n_2 \cdot n_3)$$ Where $N_i = \frac{N}{n_i}$; $y_i=N_i^{-1} \; (\textrm{mod} \; n_i)$; $a_1=0$; $a_2=2$ and $a_3=4$. Applying the formula I found that: $x=44 \equiv 14 \; (\textrm{mod} \; 30)$ Going back to the beginning I made: $2^{{14}^{45231}}$ (mod $31$) = $2^{{14}^{45231} (\textrm{mod}30)}$ (mod $31$) = $2^{{14}} \equiv 2^4 \equiv 16$ (mod $31$) And because of that I can say that the remainder of the division of $2^{{14}^{45231}}$ by $31$ is $16$. I have two doubts about this resolution: 1) Is it right? If not, could you please point out where I made a mistake? 2) Is there another way to solve nested exponents other than using Euler's Totient Function?

Prove that $\angle DAE = 45^{\circ}$ The obvious thing was to construct a right angled triangle with $BD, EC, DE$ as its sides. So, we draw a circle around $BD$ with $D$ as centre and a circle around $EC$ with $E$ as centre. Let the intersection of the circle in the interior of the triangle be $F$. Join $FD$ and $EC$. Clearly, $DF = BD$ and $FE = EC$. Also, $\angle DFE = \frac{
\pi}{2}$ If we can prove that $F$ is the circumcenter of $\Delta DAE$, we are done, since the angle at the centre is double the angle anywhere else on the circle and hence $\angle DAE$ has the desired measure. We can prove this by proving that $AF = FE = FD$. Another way to approach the problem is: Let $\angle FED = \theta$. $$\implies \angle FEC = 180 - \theta$$ $$\angle EFC = \angle ECF = \frac{\theta}{2}$$ $$\angle EDF = 90 - \theta$$ $$\angle BDF = 90 + \theta$$ $$\angle DBF = \angle DFB = 45 - \frac{\theta}{2}$$ If we can prove that $BDFA$ and $FECA$ are cyclic, $\angle FCE = \angle FAE = \frac{\theta}{2}$. $\angle DBF = \angle DAF = 45 - \frac{\theta}{2}$.

587761,"With the branching rules of subalgebra, how can I write down explicit matrix elements for a representation?","I'm looking for a way to construct a representation for a simple Lie group such that one particular subgroup is manifest. I learned the branching rules from Cahn, Georgi and Slansky, but I'm still not sure how to derive the explicit representation from the weight system deformed by extended Dynkin diagram? To decompose a irreducible representation under a maximal regular subalgebra, we look at the extended Dynkin diagram, which has one more node from the minus highest root added on the original Dynkin diagram, and we then eliminate another node to deform the extended Dynkin diagram into the Dynkin diagram for the maximal regular subalgebra. The key point is to replace the Dynkin coefficient corresponding to the eliminated node by the one corresponding to the extra node of the minus highest root. Thus, deforming the weight system of the given irrep with above replacement gives us the branching rules and the Cartan matrices for the subalgebra in the given irrep. For example, under the subgroup $SU(2)\times SU(2)\times SU(2) \Subset SO(7)$, we have the 8 dimensional irrep of SO(7)  deformed as $8 \rightarrow (1,2,2) + (2,1,2)$, see P33-34 LieART . To construct the explicit matrix representation, we define the coordinates for each simple roots in an orthonormal basis (Cartan-Weyl basis) and therefore the coordinates for the fundamental weights as well. Thus, the generators corresponding to Cartan matrices have its matrix entries as the coordinate of every weights. Now, my question is what are the fundamental weights for the deformed Dynkin diagram? Should I keep the old fundamental weights except the replaced one or the new fundamental weights are resolved from the deformed Dynkin diagram? Most importantly, what's the new fundamental weight corresponding to the extended root? I would also need help to reveal how generators of the subalgebra are in the subset of generators of the mother algebra. When I replace the Dynkin coefficient with the extended root, how could the corresponding Cartan matrix belong to linear combination of Cartan matrices of the mother algebra?

There are no non-trivial automorphisms of $\mathbb{Q}$ ( Proof ). If $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ is the field of $p$ elements ($p$ is prime), then there are no nontrivial automorphisms of $\mathbb{F}_{p}$.

Indeed, the set of all matrices with $k$ particular entries set to $0$ is an $(n^2-k)$-dimensional vector space, hence its orbit under $A\mapsto O^TAO$ ($O$ orthogonal) has at most $n^2-k+\frac12 n(n-1)$ dimensions. (Hausdorff dimension can be used here to make this rigorous.) On the other hand, the answer by Omnomnomnom gives a lower bound 
$$k(n)\ge \left\lceil \frac12 n(n-2) \right\rceil \tag{2}$$
A gap remains here. It is easy to see that $k(2)=0$ (e.g.,  a generic rotation of the plane  has full matrix  in every orthonormal basis), so (2) is sharp in this case. For $n=3$, the inequalities give $2\le k(3)\le 3$; which one is   sharp? The same question could be asked for complex matrices and unitary equivalence. Let $k_{\mathbb C}(n)$ denote the analog of $k(n)$ for this case. Since the real dimension of $U(n)$ is $n^2$, it follows that 
$$k_{\mathbb C}(n) \le \left\lfloor \frac12 n^2 \right\rfloor\tag{3}$$
In the opposite direction, Omnomnomnom pointed out the lower bound
$$k_{\mathbb C}(n)\ge \frac12 n(n-1)   \tag{4}$$
There is a gap here too.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'orthonormal']"
588468,Proving a multi variable function is injective,"For a function $f : N \times N \rightarrow N$, such as $f(x,y)=2^{x-1}(2y-1)$ how would you go about proving the function is injective?

$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac1n = 0$ and 
$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac1n = \infty$. I was just wondering, is there a sequence ($a_n =\dots$) that converges ""faster"" (I am not entirely sure what's the exact definition here, but I think you know what I mean...) than $\frac1n$ to $0$ and its series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{a_n}= \infty$? If not,  is there proof of that?","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"
