1693443,Interpretation of Eulerian numbers using the principle of inclusion-exclusion,"Eulerian numbers, denoted $e_{n,k}$, are defined as the number of permutations of $[n]$={1,2,...,n} such that there are k ""ascents"". (For example, the permutation 23541 of [5] would have 3 ascents, 235, 4,  and 1) How can the principle of inclusion exclusion be used so that: $e_{n,k}=\sum_{i=0}^k(-1)^i {n+1 \choose i}(k-i)^n$ I will update this as I make progress. We can think of the permutation as containing k groups of ascents. So, say for $e_{n,2}$, the first value of the alternating sum is ${n+1 \choose 0}(2-0)^n=2^n$ This makes sense since we are placing n objects into 2 groups. Now we need to make up for the fact that each group must be an ascent.","['inclusion-exclusion', 'combinatorics', 'eulerian-numbers']"
1693453,Bounding a solution of an ODE with a small source,"I have an ODE of the form $$ f''(x) + f(x) = \epsilon g(x)$$ with initial conditions $$ f(0) = f'(0) = 0 $$ $g(x)$ is $O(1)$ as $\epsilon \to 0$, and $g(x)$ is as smooth as necessary.  Is there a way I can bound $f(x)$?  In particular, I would like to be able to claim that $f(x)$ must be $O(\epsilon)$ as $\epsilon \to 0$ for all $x>0$, but I'm not sure if this is true or how to approach this.  Any hints/advice would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: I also know that $g(0) = g'(0) = 0$, if that helps with anything. EDIT2: Upon seeing the answers, I think we can see that the values of $g$ and $g'$ at $0$ are irrelevant as long as $g(x) = O(1)$.","['asymptotics', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

1693490,"When is it ok to use ""="" instead of "":=""?","I am having difficulty whilst writing my equations, deciding when I should be using the equals symbol ""="" , and when I should be using the defined as symbol "":="". In particular, I am talking about equations for probabilities, when those probabilities are really approximations to the true probabilities. I am an engineer rather than a mathematician, so these approximations are common! For example, if I was using Bayes rule in my equation, I would write $p(x|y) = \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}$, because the two are equivalent. On the contrary, suppose I was using a very naive and heuristic score, and then using that score as a probability in my future calculations. I might write, for example, $p(x) := 0.5 + 0.5 * (z/10)$ where $z$ are some observations I have made about $x$, and $0 < z < 10$. This is because $p(x)$ is clearly just a score being forced into a probability, and so it would not be accurate to use the ""="" symbol. However, what about the cases between these two examples? Should you only use the ""="" symbol when the probability is derived purely and directly by maths? Or are there cases when the approximation is only small, and therefore ""="" is appropriate? The reason I ask is that in engineering, almost all probabilities are approximations, but it would look odd to have every single equation using the "":="" symbol. For example, suppose I decided to use a naive Bayesian model, where $x = \{a, b, c, d\}$. Would it be ok to write $p(x) = p(a)p(b|a)p(c|a)p(d|a)$, or would I have to write $p(x) := p(a)p(b|a)p(c|a)p(d|a)$?

1693493,Maximal twist in braid group product,"Suppose I have the $s_i$ and $s^{-1}_i$ as generators, satisfying the braid relations. I call the $s_i$ ""right twists"" and their inverses ""left twists"". Any element $w$ in the braid group can be written as a product of generators (but not in a unique way). Suppose this representation is reduced, meaning that the number of elements in this product is minimized.
Let $rt(w)$ be the maximal exponent of an element $s_i$
in all possible products representing $w$. 
Think of this as the maximal right-twisting of two strands.
Similarly, $lt(w)$ is the maximal exponent of an $s^{-1}_i$. Now, let $R$ be a product of right twists, meaning it is a product of entries in $\{s_i\}$ but not inverses of these,
and let $L$ be a product of left twists.
Now let $RL$ be the product of $L$ and $R$. I want to prove that $rt(R) \geq rt(RL)$
or equivalently, $lt(L) \geq lt(RL)$. In other words, adding left twists to a braid cannot increase the maximal right twist. A reference would be superb! This is not a homework problem, but for my research but it seems so simple that there should be an easy proof.","['permutations', 'group-theory']"

Moreover, $C$ is a double cover of a line $l = \phi(C)$ branched in $n$ points of $l \cap \Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the branch locus. Then he just says that $g=2$ implies $n=6$.

If we have the first strict inequality for all cases then the construction is obvious, but we could get the second strict inequality, in which case I don't see a way to construct the sequence. So how is this possible? This question stems from the following proof in showing that if two norms are not equivalent then they do not generate the same topology. Now suppose that $\|\cdot\|$ and $\|\cdot\|'$ are not equivalent. Then without loss of generality there exists a sequence of points $x_n\in V$, $n\ge 1$, such that $\|x_n\|/\|x_n\|' \to 0$ as $n\to+\infty$. Set $y_n=x_n/\|x_n\|'$. Then $y_n\to0$ in $(V,\|\cdot\|)$ but $I(y_n)$ does not converge to $0$ in $(V,\|\cdot\|'$ (since $\|y_n\|'=1$ for all $n$). Thus $I$ is not continuous, so there exists $U$ which is $\|\cdot\|'$-open such that $U=I^{-1}(U)$ is not $\|\cdot\|$-open, i.e., the topologies are different.","['functional-analysis', 'normed-spaces']"

1694268,Two congruent segments does have the same length?,"The answer to the question in the title seems an obvious ''Yes by definition !''. And this really is the definition from Wikipedia : Two line segments are congruent if they have the same length. But in Hilbert's Foundations of Geometry congruence is defined without use of metric notions, by the axioms of Group IV (chapter 6). I don't report here these axioms that can be found on the book (or on the Wiki page )
and essentially say that congruence is an equivalence relation and that congruence is conserved when we add adjacent segments. Usually these axioms are illustrated with a figure that use two segments $AB$ and $A'B'$ that have the same length, as in this case. but I think that this illustration is only dictated by our intuition of congruence as equality of length, and it's not justified by the axioms. Look at the second figure, where $a$,$a'$ and $a''$ are straight lines and $E$ is a point that does not belong to these lines. Projecting from $E$ the points $A,B,C$ of $a$ to the other lines, we can define the relation:
$$
AB \equiv A'B' \quad BC \equiv B'C'
$$ 
and
$$
A'B' \equiv A''B'' \quad B'C' \equiv B''C''
$$ and we can see that this relation satisfies all axioms of congruence. But, clearly, it doesn't satisfies our intuition that congruent segments have the same length. This construction is essentially the same that Hilbert uses (in the chapter 24) for the  construction of an ''Algebra of Segments'', ( where the point $E$ is ''at infinity''). Obviously ''to have the same length'' is a congruence relation, but only in a metric space, and, in the same space, different congruence relations can be defined that are not equivalent to ''have the same length''. And more, we can have different metric (and different ''length'') for a geometry that satisfies the Hilbert's axioms. So my question is, at first, if my reasoning is correct or if I've misunderstood something of fundamental, and, if I'm right, what are the axioms that we need for exactly represent our intuitive concept of congruence? A final notice: this question is related to What really is ''orthogonality''? , where a similar question is posed for angles.","['congruence-relations', 'axioms', 'geometry']"

Maybe there is a mistake in my assumption that it can be expressed in that way. So I'll give the reason behind it Waves can be expressed as $$y_{1}=A_{1}\sin(kx+\omega t+\delta_{1})$$ and $$y_{2}=A_{2}\sin(kx+\omega t+\delta_{2})$$ Let net be $y$ Therefore, $$y=y_{1}+y_{2}$$ Clearly,
 $$\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = -k\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$$ So, y can be expressed as a linear combination of x and t (leading to the conclusion that sum of two propogatory waves in the same direction fives another propogatory wave). Its probably a sine or cos function as we are adding up two sines. While we were doing superposition of waves, we assumed same amplitude for mathematical simplicity but I can vaguely remember my teacher telling me it was trivial for different amplitudes but I can't figure it out now.

1694290,What is the optimal strategy when driving to my university: Wait or take alternative route and (possibly) wait?,"When bicycling to my university, I'm faced with a difficult decision. The situation is shown here: I have to get to point marked with the $\times$, but in order to do so, I must cross a big road with a traffic light at both places where crossing is possible. If the first traffic light (at the bottom) is green, then there's no debate; I simply cross and go up $A$ with no waiting time at all. The choice arises when it is red (as is always the case anyway), since I can choose to wait for the first light to change, or go up a smaller road $B$ and then try to cross at the second light. Let's assume that the two traffic lights are identical w.r.t. the percent of the time they are red (let's call this quantity $\Theta$), but that the second is phase-shifted with $\tau$ w.r.t. the first, s.t. the second changes to e.g. green a time $\tau$ after the first. The length $L$ of the paths are identical and I bicycle with a constant speed $v$ (although I suspect these last two are irrelevant to the solution). I don't know anything about the light before I arrive at it. The question then becomes If I arrive at a random time during which the first traffic light is red, given $\Theta$ and $\tau$ (and $L$ and $v$), should I wait at the first light and go by path $A$, or should I go by path $B$ in order to minimize waiting time? The type of solution I'm looking for can better be formulated if we first look at two examples: The $\mathbf{I}$'s represent the time during which the traffic light is red - the space in between them represent the green lights. The drawn lines represent my position if I chose to go by $B$. If I arrive at the first red light during the blue stretch, I should go by $B$; if I, on the other hand, arrive during the red stretch, I should go wait and go by $A$. As can be seen from the two scenarios $(a)$ and $(b)$ (where the lines represent my position should I choose path $B$, and where the slope is determined by $L$ and $v$), my choice depends on $\tau$, which is the only parameter that has been changed. If we call the length of the blue strip $t_{\text{go}}$ and the length of the red strip $t_{\text{wait}}$, s.t. $t_{\text{go}}+t_{\text{wait}}=\Theta$, the solution should be of the form $$t_{\text{go}}(\tau)$$ I don't think $v$ and $L$ should play a role, since the effect of changing these can be incorporated into $\tau$, so we could probably set $v=L=1$. I'm guessing there should be a pretty simple geometric way of solving this, but for the time being it is eluding me. Some random observations: If $v=\frac{L}{\tau}$ it doesn't matter what I choose. Also, if the second light was independent of the first, I should always go by $B$, since there I will at least have a $1-\Theta$ chance of getting a green light.

1694518,Non reduced cone point in affine cone of a projective variety?,"Let $X$ be an integral closed subscheme of projective $n$ space over a field. Let $X'$ be its affine cone. Is it possible that $X'$ is nonreduced at the cone point? If so, what is an example? Edit: I don't think it can happen. By taking global sections of the twists of the closed subscheme exact sequence, we have an embedding of the homogeneous coordinate ring of $X$ into $R = \oplus_{n \geq 0} \Gamma(X, O_X(n))$. I have convinced myself that this ring $R$ is reduced if $X$ is, and a domain if $X$ is integral. Pf: If $f,g \in R$ are such that $fg = 0$, by choosing highest degree terms we can assume $f \in O(n)$ and $g \in O(m)$. Then we know that $X = V(fg) = V(f) \cup V(g)$, so without loss assume that $V(f) = X$. But then this means that in each trivialization $O(n)$ to $O_X$, the image of $f$ in $O_X$, $\tilde{f}$, vanishes at all primes. Hence $\tilde{f} = 0$, since the local rings are all reduced. Hence $f = 0$, since trivializations are in particular isomorphisms. If $f \in R$ is such that $f^n = 0$, again assume $f \in O(n)$. After passing to some cover of trivializations which send $f$ to $\tilde{f}$, we can consider $\tilde{f}^n$ in each local ring, and reducedness implies that $\tilde{f} = 0$. But then this implies that $f = 0$. Edit: I thought I was making a mistake, but then realized that at any rate this counter example isn't valid. I'll leave it here. If $R = k[x,y]/(xy,x^2)$, then $Spec R$ is reduced at the origin, but $Proj R$, for example computed on the chart $D(y)$ (on $D(x)$ it is empty), is just isomorphic to $Spec k[y]$, so it is reduced. The issue with this counter example: $R$ is not the homogeneous coordinate ring of $Y = Proj(R)$, because $\Gamma_* = \oplus_{n \geq 0} \Gamma(I_Y(n))$ of the ideal sheaf $I_Y$ is larger than $(xy,x^2)$. In particular, $I_Y(1)$ contains $x/y$ on the patch $D(y)$ and $x/x$ on the patch $D(x)$, so we get $x \in \Gamma(I_Y(1))$. (In other words, $(xy,x^2)$ is not saturated.)",['algebraic-geometry']

I wondered, if there were some kind of ""best"" approach to run all through those  permutations without too many repetitions, for example the algorithm makes sure one gets any permutation at most $n$ times. I don't know the answer yet and probably won't have it anytime soon. However I would be quite interested in seeing this algorithm and thus I hope the question has been asked before and been solved.

   (-1)^j       & \text{if $k$ is a product of $j$ distinct primes}\end{cases}$$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. I have previously noted a surprising connection between products of the form $$\prod_{k=1}^{n} k^{\mu(k)}$$ and harmonic numbers (see http://oeis.org/A130087 ). Letting $H_{n} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n}$ denote the $n^{\text{th}}$ harmonic number, I noted that the denominator (in lowest terms) of this product is equal to the denominator (in lowest terms) of $H_{n}^{2}n!$ for all $n < 897$.  For example, letting $n = 11$, we have that $$1^{\mu(1)} \cdot 2^{\mu(2)} \cdot \cdots \cdot 11^{\mu(11)} = \frac{2}{77},$$ and $$H_{11}^{2}11! = \frac{28030126084}{77}.$$ This property does not hold for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and the first counterexample occurs in the case whereby $n = 897$. Letting $\text{den}(q)$ denote the denominator in lowest terms of $q \in \mathbb{Q}_{> 0}$, it is not obvious to me why the equality $$\text{den}\left(\prod_{k=1}^{n} k^{\mu(k)}\right) = \text{den}\left(H_{n}^{2}n!\right)$$ holds for the first several hundred natural numbers. So it seems natural to me to ask: (1) Is there some simple number-theoretic explanation as to 'why' this equality holds for the first several hundred natural numbers? (2) Is there some simple number-theoretic interpretation as to 'why' this equality does not hold in general (which specifically explains the counterexample in the case whereby $n = 897)$?

1694790,Obscuring squares of Rubik's cube,"This is a combinatorial question related to Rubik's cube $3\times3\times3$ (and, in the end, its generalizations $n\times n\times n$ ). I assume that the readers are familiar with this puzzle. Let's recall some basic terminology and conventions to rule out possible ambiguities. In the following, we use the words state and configuration interchangeably, as exact synonyms. We are only interested in configurations of Rubik's cube where it has the shape of a cube (so, we consider rotations of its layers by an angle of $90^\circ$ as atomic transformations, and no incomplete rotations are allowed). Also, we consider configurations that can be obtained from one another by solid rotations of the cube as a whole (without any relative movements of its parts) as identical. The cube has $6$ faces, each one of them is a $3\times3$ grid of squares — $9$ squares per face, and $54$ squares in total. Each square is of a solid color. Orientation of every single square is irrelevant (in fact, this rule has significance only for central squares). There are $6$ different colors, and there are $9$ squares of each color. There is a single selected state where each face consists of all squares of the same color — this state is called the solved state. A state that can be reached from the solved state by a sequence of valid rotations of layers is called a valid state (the solved state, of course, is a valid state too). As a side note, if we allowed disassembling the cube into its parts and reassemling them, then we would get the number of possible states $12$ times larger than the set of valid states (this larger set would be a disjoint union of $12$ equivalence classes under valid rotations, each of the classes called an orbit ). We are only interested in valid states in the following. Usually, it is assumed that colors of all squares on the cube are visible. Let's consider a possibility that some squares may be obscured (e.g. completely covered by an opaque colorless sticker), so that their colors are not visible. In general, obscuring some squares can result in some states becoming visually indistinguishable . As trivial examples, obscuring all $54$ squares makes all states indistinguishable, but obscuring only $1$ square (no matter which one) does not make any states indistinguishable. What maximal number of squares in Rubik's cube $3\times3\times3$ can be obscured without making any states indistinguishable? What maximal number of squares in Rubik's cube $2\times 2\times 2$ can be obscured without making any states indistinguishable?

1694865,help understanding a paragraph from Linear Algebra Done Right,"I am attempting to work my way through the 3rd edition of ""Linear Algebra Done Right"", but there's a paragraph on page 14 that I don't understand.  I have struggled with it myself for a few hours and have come to the conclusion that I need some help.  But first some background. Axler lets $\textbf{F}$ stand for either the set of real or complex numbers.  (He mentions fields but doesn't use them directly.)  He also uses the term ""list"" instead of ""tuple"". The problematic paragraph is preceded by this: If $S$ is a set, then $\textbf{F}^S$ denotes the set of functions from $S$ to $\textbf{F}$. For $f, g \in \textbf{F}^S$, the sum $f + g \in \textbf{F}^S$ is the function defined by
  $$(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$$
  for all $x \in S$. For $\lambda \in \textbf{F}$ and $f \in \textbf{F}^S$, the product $\lambda f \in \textbf{F}^S$ is the function defined by
  $$(\lambda f)(x) = \lambda f(x)$$
  for all $x \in S$. As an example of the notation above, if $S$ is the interval [0,1] and $\textbf{F} = \textbf{R}$, then $\textbf{R}^{[0,1]}$ is the set of real-valued functions on the interval [0,1]. So far, so good.  This is where I get lost: Our previous examples of vector spaces, $\textbf{F}^n$ and $\textbf{F}^\infty$, are special cases of the vector space $\textbf{F}^S$ because a list of length $n$ of numbers in $\textbf{F}$ can be thought of as a function from {1, 2, ..., $n$} to $\textbf{F}$ and a sequence of numbers in $\textbf{F}$ can be thought of as a function from the set of positive integers to $\textbf{F}$.  In other words, we can think of $\textbf{F}^n$ as $\textbf{F}^{\{1,2,...,n\}}$ and we can think of $\textbf{F}^\infty$ as $\textbf{F}^{\{1,2,...\}}$. The general idea seems straightforward to me.  Let $S$ be the set of all tuples in $\textbf{F}^n$ or $\textbf{F}^\infty$, and now $\textbf{F}^S$ is a vector space.  Is it really that simple?  But what is he saying?

For $N=10000,$ graphically there is a zero at approximately $1783.07,$ and this agrees with Mathematica's 1321st zero, about $1783.08.$ Mathematica has a built-in analytic continuation for $\zeta(s),$ but I don't think that is being engaged here. Does this property evaporate for very large $N$ or is there a reason we should in principle be able to approximate $\zeta(s)$ at $\sigma = 1/2$ for finite $N$ on a suitable range of $t?$ Since this property may not hold for large $N$ there is little point in broadening the question.","['complex-analysis', 'analytic-continuation', 'riemann-zeta']"

1695223,Absolute value in integrating factor of First-Order Linear Differential Equation,"Question states:
$$ y' + \frac{y}{x} = 6x+2$$
Obviously x cannot be zero. If we assume that $x$ is positive (i.e. $x>0$), we find the integrating factor as $$u(x)=e^{\int \frac{1}{x} dx}$$ which is equal to $x$. Then the solution is $$y(x)= \frac{1}{u(x)} \int (6x+2)(u(x)) dx = \frac {1}{x} \int 6x^2+2x \ dx = 2x^2+x+\frac{C}{x}.$$
Now, we assumed that $x$ is positive. But I couldn't get the same answer when I didn't make this assumption; that is, the integrating factor is $$u(x)=e^{\int \frac{1}{x} dx} = e^{ \ln \lvert x\rvert} = \lvert x\rvert.$$
Then this problem gets way more complicated, as the solution becomes
$$y(x)= \frac{1}{u(x)} \int (6x+2)(u(x)) dx = \frac {1}{\lvert x\rvert} \int 6x \lvert x\rvert +2\lvert x\rvert \ dx.$$
My calculus textbook omitted the absolute value altogether; that is, the textbook indicated that the integrating factor was just $x$. Because the textbook is written by quite reputable and trustworthy authors (Ron Larson and Bruce Edwards), I was wondering (1) if treating the integrating factor as just $x$ is acceptable, and/or (2) How the solution is still correct if we must use the integrating factor as $\lvert x\rvert$. If we can omit the absolute value sometimes, how do we know when we can omit the absolute value sign and when we shouldn't? (As a side note, I fully understand why there's absolute value sign for the antidervative of $ \frac{1}{x} $).",['integration']

Consider the following statement: If $\mathscr G_y\ne 0,$ then $\operatorname{Supp}(\mathscr G)=Y.$ I know this holds for $X=Y$ but I think it isn't correct otherwise because I can take $Y=y$ to be a closed point and $\mathscr G = \mathscr O_X$ and violate the statement. But unless I am reading it wrong, the proof of the ""lemme de dévissage"", Theorem 3.1.2 in EGA III, and even more explicitly the statement of Corollary 3.1.3 which follows it, both claim just the above statement.

Edit: Let me elaborate on what bugs me. Theorem 3.1.2 only contains the condition that for every irreducible closed subset $Y\subset X$ with a generic point $y$ there should exist a sheaf $\mathscr G\in \mathbf K'$ such that $\mathscr G_y$ is a one-dimensional vector space over $k(y).$ But then in the proof when $\mathscr G$ is called upon (second paragraph on p. 116) there is a passage: Par hypothèse, il y a un $\mathscr O_X$-Module cohérent $\mathscr  G$ (nécessairement de support $Y$) tel que $\mathscr G_y$ soint un $k(y)$-espace vectoriel de dimension $1.$ Then in the course of the proof this is used in the proof and the fact that $\mathscr G^m$ has support inside $Y$ is reiterated.
Then finally the statement of Corollary 3.1.3 literally contains the following: ... est remplacée par $\mathscr G_y\ne 0$ (ce qui équivaut à $\operatorname{Supp}(\mathscr G) = Y$).
