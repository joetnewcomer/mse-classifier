2650960,A fun Valentine's day chocolate box optimization problem...,"Today I received a small box with chocolate almonds in it. Here's a photo: The top and bottom of the box are held together by a band that ""cuts across"" alternating corners. It got me thinking: ha, I'll make this into a fun little calculus optimization problem: what distance $x$ from the corner should the band cross each edge as to minimize the total length of the band? And more specifically, what is this distance in terms of the length, width, and height of the box? We're defining $x$ as the following (view from the top of the box, bands are red): Let's call $b_T$ the total band length, $b_h$ the sum of the portions of the band on the top and bottom of the box, $b_l$ the sum of the portions of the band on the side $l$ of the box, and $b_w$ the portions of the band on the side $w$ of the box. And of course, $b_T = b_h + b_l + b_w$. Considering just the top and bottom, we can see: $b_h = 4x\sqrt2$. Similarly, since the total side length of two sides of the box are $l$ and the other two are $w$, and the height of the box is $h$, using the Pythagorean Formula we can get the following two formulas: $$b_w=2\sqrt{h^2+(w-2x)^2}$$ $$b_l=2\sqrt{h^2+(l-2x)^2}$$ Thus, our total band length in terms of x is: $$b_T = 4x\sqrt2 + 2\sqrt{h^2+(w-2x)^2} + 2\sqrt{h^2+(l-2x)^2}$$ Since this is an optimization problem and we wish to find the minimum value of $b_T$, we will differentiate and set equal to zero: $$b_T' = 4\sqrt2 + \frac{-4(w-2x)}{\sqrt{h^2+(w-2x)^2}} + \frac{-4(l-2x)}{\sqrt{h^2+(l-2x)^2}}$$ $$0 = 4\sqrt2 + \frac{-4(w-2x)}{\sqrt{h^2+(w-2x)^2}} + \frac{-4(l-2x)}{\sqrt{h^2+(l-2x)^2}}$$ By rearranging a bit more, we can rationalize it to: $$\left(2+ \frac{(w-2x)^2}{h^2+(w-2x)^2} - \frac{(2x-l)^2}{h^2+(l-2x)^2}\right)^2 = \frac{8(w-2x)^2}{h^2+(w-2x)^2}$$ Remember, the goal is to find, given the dimensions of the box, some optimum placement of the band. So we need to rearrange this formula to get $x$ in terms of $l$, $w$, and $h$. This is where I am at a total loss. Distributing out the left side would give us too many terms to keep track of; even substituting each terms for $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively, distributing that, and then plugging back in results in a ridiculous number of terms. This would be absurd; how can we do this a better way and get $x$ in terms of $l$, $w$, and $h$? (Also, I hope I haven't messed up any of the formulas while typesetting them. I don't think I did, but you never know...)","['algebra-precalculus', 'optimization', 'calculus']"

2650979,Differential forms: $dx \wedge dy$ vs $dx dy$,"When evaluating the integrals of differential forms over a parameterized manifold, you often end up with something like: $$\int _{|\gamma(s)|} dx\wedge dy + y dx \wedge dz = \iint_{[a,b] \times [c,d]} f(s,t)\,ds\,dt$$ However, this led me to a conceptual contradiction: the left hand side involves the wedge product of differential one forms, and is thus an expression involving differential two-forms. The right hand side, however, has differentials (presumably differential one-forms) just multiplied together. Traditionally, I would interpret $ds dt$ as just representing an ""infinitesimally"" small square in the s-t plane.

2651199,Generalization of the chain rule using upper derivatives,"I'm having trouble with the following exercise, taken from Chapter 6 of Royden and Fitzpatrick's Real Analysis : Let $f$ be defined on $[a,b]$ and $g$ a continuous function on $[\alpha, \beta]$ that is differentiable at $\gamma \in (\alpha, \beta)$ with $g(\gamma) = c \in (a,b)$. Show that if $g'(\gamma) > 0$, then $\bar D(f \circ g)(\gamma) = \bar D f(c) \cdot g'(\gamma)$ where $$\bar Df(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \sup_{0 < |t| \leq h} \frac{f(x + t) - f(x)}{t}$$ If $g$ were linear, the problem is straight-forward:
\begin{multline}
\bar D(f \circ g)(\gamma) = \lim_{h \to 0}\sup_{0 < |t| \leq h}\frac{f(c + g'(\gamma)\cdot t) - f(c)}{t} = \\\lim_{h \to 0}\sup_{0 < |s| \leq g'(\gamma)\cdot h}\frac{f(c + s) - f(c)}{s}\cdot g'(\gamma) = \bar D f(c) \cdot g'(\gamma)

2651363,How can a point that makes the ODE undefined be included into a domain of any solution?,"To illustrate the problem that I'm having, consider the following ODE: $$y' = \frac{y}{1+x}$$ To solve this ODE, my professor had done the followings: Assuming $y(x) \not = 0$, and $x \not = -1$ (actually, he never stated these), then we can arrange the ODE as $$\frac{dy}{y} = \frac{dx}{1+x} \\
\ln|y| = \ln|x+1| + \ln|c| \\
y = c(x+1). \quad \text{(The General solution)}$$ And later, while introducing some initial values to this ODE, he gave the case where $y(-1) = 0$, and claimed that since when $x = -1$, for any values of $c\in \mathbb{R}$, we get different solutions from the ""general solution"", there exists infinitely many solutions satisfying this initial condition. However, (even if we skip how we found $y = c(x+1)$) to verify that $y = c(x+1)$ is indeed a solution (for some $c$) to this ODE, when we plug it in to the ODE, in order to cancel the terms $1+x$ in the denominator and in the numerator, we need to assume that $x \not =-1$, otherwise it would also mean we are calcelling zero's, which is not valid since, in the algebra that we are doing, zero do not have any multiplicative inverse.Therefore, any solution of the form $y = c_0(x+1)$ cannot contain the the point $x = -1$, so how can we say that ""there are infinitely many solution of this ODE satisfying the initial condition $y(-1) = 0$"" ? With my logic, there exists no such solution satisfying this initial condition, so which one of us is right, and why? A Further Question: As we have done it in this particular case, to reach some solutions of a given ODE, we need to do some arrangements to the form of the ODE, such as collection same variables to the same side, but this generally requires some assumptions, such as $y \not= 0$, so in such cases, the result that we get should not be applicable to the cases, for example, in the above case, it there was any other point other than $x = -1$ where $y = 0$, say $y(x_1) = 0$ the solutions that we got from the equation $y = c(x+1)$ should not contain that point $(x_1, 0)$ also, right ?","['singularity', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'fundamental-solution']"

When $c$ = $1$ The statement is equivalent to Wilson's Theorem .

It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Wilson Primes. However, if there exists a fourth Wilson prime $p$ , then $p>2 \cdot 10^{13}$ . When $c \geqslant 3$ There are no known primes for which $p^3 \mid (p-1)!+1$ as if there is, then $p$ also has to be a Wilson Prime. $(5-1)!+1 = 25 \equiv 25 \pmod{5^3}$ $(13-1)!+1 = 479001601 \equiv 676 \pmod{13^3}$ $(563-1)!+1 \equiv 91921010 \pmod{563^3}$ It is most likely due to following evidence that there exists an upper bound $M$ for which: $$c \geqslant M \implies p^c \nmid (p-1)!+1$$ where $M \geqslant 3$ . We consider $(p-1)!+1 \pmod{p^c}$ We assume that every remainder divisible by $p$ (Wilson's Theorem) is equally probable. Thus, the probability of required remainder $0$ is $\frac{1}{p^{c-1}}$ Thus, probable number of primes for given constant $c$ is: $$\sum{\frac{1}{p^{c-1}}} = P(c-1)$$ where $P(x)$ is the Prime Zeta Function When $c=2$ , the expected number of Wilson primes is $P(1)$ . $$P(1)=\sum{\frac{1}{p}}$$ This sum is divergent. Thus, it is probable that there exist infinitely many Wilson primes. Proof: Define $N(x)$ to be the number of positive integers $n \leqslant x$ for which $p_i \nmid n$ , where $i > j$ for constant $j$ and $p_i$ is the $i$ th smallest prime. Then, we write: $$n=k^2m$$ where $m$ is square-free. As $m$ is square-free, and the only primes that divide it are $p_i$ for $1 \leqslant i \leqslant j$ , it has $2^j$ possibilities. $n^2 \leqslant x \implies n \leqslant \sqrt{x}$ , thus giving $n$ a maximum of $\sqrt{x}$ possibilities. $$\implies N(x) \leqslant 2^j\sqrt{x}$$ Assume the contrary, then for some $j$ : $$\sum_{i=j+1}^\infty \frac{1}{p_i} < \frac{1}{2}$$ We also have $x-N(x)$ is the number of numbers less than or equal to $x$ divisible by one or more of $p_i$ for $i>j$ . $$x-N(x) \leqslant \sum_{i=j+1}^\infty \frac{x}{p_i} < \frac{x}{2}$$ $$\implies 2^j\sqrt{x} > \frac{x}{2}$$ which is untrue for $x \geqslant 2^{2j+2}$ Thus the sum diverges. The divergence is similar to $\log{\log{x}}$ (Which is very slow). Probable Answer To Problem When $c \geqslant 3$ , the sum converges and is less than $1$ . When $c=3$ , $P(c-1) \approx 0.45$ When $c=4$ , $P(c-1) \approx 0.17$ When $c=5$ , $P(c-1) \approx 0.07$ When $c=6$ , $P(c-1) \approx 0.03$ When $c=7$ , $P(c-1) \approx 0.002$ We now go on to show why there most probably exists a constant $M$ such as the one in the problem. Consider: $$\sum_{i=3}^\infty P(i-1)$$ We have: $$\sum_{i=3}^\infty P(i-1) < \sum{\frac{1}{n(n+1)}} = \sum{\biggl(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}\biggl)} = 1$$ Thus, the probable sum of the number of primes that satisfy the statement for $c \geqslant 3$ , including a prime $p$ , $n-2$ times, if the maximum $c$ satisfied is $n$ , is less than $1$ . However, if the answer to the problem is false, then, the sum would be infinite. Thus, it is highly unlikely for there to be a solution for $c \geqslant 3$ as the probable answer is less than $1$ but the actual answer would be a positive integer. However, it is almost impossible for the answer to the problem to be false, as the probable answer is less than $1$ but the actual answer would be infinite!

2651822,What are $q$-deformations?,"This question has already appeared in a lot of different ways and here is another one. First of all, many people know the typical quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ by generators and relations. This thing is often called a $q$-deformation of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. The first baby question is whether anyone can give a more general definition of what a $q$-deformation is without generators and relations. Immediately I want to give two remarks: People wrongly call the quantized universal enveloping algebras $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a finite-dimensional complex semi-simple Lie algebra, Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras. Why do I say that this is wrong? Well, the algebras $U_h(\mathfrak{g})$ defined in a similar fashion are the real Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras. In chapter XVIII of 'Quantum Groups' by Kassel, he defines $h$-deformations. Moreover, there are rigidity-results for these algebras. One can truly say that a Drinfeld-Jimbo algebra is the unique quantization of the underlying Lie algebra in very precise sense (again see Kassel's book). In fact, the Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras have a nice categorical interpretation (see corollary XIX.4.3 of his book). Many people often claim that these rigidity results hold for the $q$-deformations as well. I have yet to see a proof of such claims! Moreover, I believe that people often claim this because they refer to both $q$ and $h$-deformations as Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras. This explains my wrongly . Assuming that these results are easily copied to $q$-setting is not a good hope. The $h$-rigidty results depend on the fact that $h$-deformations $U_h(\mathfrak{g})$ have a quasi-triangular structure. This is simply not true for $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. (Categorically this correspond to the representation category of $U_h(\mathfrak{g})$ having a braiding whereas $U_g(\mathfrak{g})$-Mod is not braided). With these considerations in mind, any reasonable definition of a $q$-deformation must be seriously different than the one with generators and relations. Indeed, one can only talk about rigidity meaningfully if $q$-deformations aren't intrinsically uniquely defined (specifying generators and relations tells you what the object is, uniquely). Lastly, given a nice Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. One can look at the finite-dimensional representations $U(\mathfrak{g})$-Mod. This category is a monoidal category. One should be able to 'monoidally deform' this category in essentially one way. Applying reconstruction theorems to the deformed category should give you a quantization of $\mathfrak{g}$. What cohomology is used for this monoidal deformation? What is the quantization you recover? Is it an $h$-deformation? Or is this what $q$-deformations should be? After some looking around, I think the so called Davydov-Yetter cohomology might be an interesting cohomology to look at. I'm having troubles understanding this cohomology though. (Etingof's book on tensor categories explains what it is, but not everything is defined).

(ii) Suppose that $\mathcal{D}$ is maximal with respect to the countable intersection property. Then countable intersections of elements in $\mathcal{D}$ are in $\mathcal{D}$ . Furthermore, if $A \subseteq X$ intersects every element of $\mathcal{D}$ , then $A \in \mathcal{D}$ . Show that products of LindelÃ¶f  spaces are LindelÃ¶f, and then show that (ii) holds. Okay. This problem is giving some trouble. It's clear that the intention of this problem is to show (i) is false by reductio, and this can be adequately done by considering just the product of two LindelÃ¶f spaces (since I have a counterexample for this case). In the problem before this, I proved that $X$ is a LindelÃ¶f space if and only if for every $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ having the countable intersection property (CIP), it follows that $\bigcap_{A \in \mathcal{A}} \overline{A} \neq \emptyset$ , so I'm going to try using this in proving $X \times Y$ is LindelÃ¶f, where each factor is LindelÃ¶f. Suppose that $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X \times Y)$ has the CIP, but $\bigcap_{A \in \mathcal{A}} \overline{A} = \emptyset$ . Then there exists $\mathcal{D} \supset \mathcal{A}$ which is maximal with respect to the CIP. If all my calculations are right, both $\{\pi_1 (A) \mid A \in \mathcal{A} \}$ and $\{\pi_2(A) \mid A \in \mathcal{A} \}$ have the CIP, which means there exists $\mathcal{D}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ and $\mathcal{D}_2 \subseteq \mathcal{P}(Y)$ containing the respect set which are maximal with respect to the CIP.... At this point, I don't know what to do. My whiteboard is messy with many failed attempts...I was thinking that considering the set $\{D_1 \times D_2 \mid D_i \in \mathcal{D}_i \}$ might lead to some desired contradiction, perhaps contradicting the fact that $\mathcal{D}$ is maximal in $X \times Y$ , but I presently cannot see how.

2651925,Is stopping time directed convergence in probability equivalent to a.s. convergence?,"Let $X,X_1,X_2,...$ be random variables on the probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$. Let $S$ denoted the set of all bounded stopping times on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, (\mathcal{F}_n))$, where $\mathcal{F}_n = \sigma(X_1,...,X_n)$. $S$ is a directed set under the pointwise partial order $\leq$, so we can speak of stopping time directed nets of random variables. We write $X_\tau \xrightarrow{p} X$ to mean: for all $\epsilon, \delta > 0$, there exists $\sigma \in S$ such that $\tau \geq \sigma$ implies
$$P\Big( \Big\{\omega: |X_{\tau(\omega)}(\omega) - X(\omega)| > \delta  \Big\} \Big) < \epsilon. $$ It's clear that if $X_n \xrightarrow{a.s.} X$, then $X_\tau \xrightarrow{p} X$. A paper I was reading seemed to claim that the converse is also true and obvious, but I cannot see it.

2651991,Maximizing Winnings - Dice Roll Strategy,"Letâ€™s consider a simple dice game. Two fair 6-sided dice are rolled. Let $X$ is the sum of the two dice. If $X = 7$, then the game ends and you win nothing (winnings = 0). If $X \neq 7$, then you have the option of either stopping the game and receiving $X$ (what you rolled on your last roll) or starting the whole process over again. Now consider this strategy to play: pick a number $i$, where $2 \leq i \leq 12$, and stop playing the first time that a value greater than or equal to $i$ is rolled (or until you are forced to stop as a result of rolling a 7). Define $Y_i = $  winnings when you use this strategy with chosen value $i$. We are interested in the value $i$ that maximizes the expected winnings $\mathbb{E}[Y_i]$ over the all possible choices of $i$. To make a long story short, it turns out that the value of $i$ that maximizes the expected winnings $\mathbb{E}[Y_i]$ for the game is $i = 8.$ For this problem, what we actually want is for you to explicitly compute the expected winnings $\mathbb{E}[Y_i]$ for $i = 5, 6, 8$ and $9$ to show why the expected winnings is maximized when $i = 8$.

How many sub-square matrices does a square matrix have and is there a simple formula for it? The other problem is, after checking several videos I am not sure what counts as a sub-square matrix. I thought I could use the formula for the sum of squares, i.e.
$$S(n) = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$ But this gives sixteen $(1 \times 1)$ matrices, nine $(2 \times 2)$ matrices, four $(3 \times 3)$ matrices and one $(4 \times 4)$ matrices, i.e. a total of $30$ sub-square matrices. \begin{pmatrix}

2652184,Using bounds for an analytically intractable differential equations problem,"Exercise 2.8.6 from Strogatz's Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos with Applications asks us to consider the initial value problem $\dot x = x+e^{-x}$, $x(0)=0$ $\left(\dot x\, \text{means}\, \frac{dx}{dt}\right)$, which cannot be solved analytically. Part (b) of the exercise states as follows: Using some analytical arguments, obtain rigorous bounds for the value of $x$ at $t=1$. In other words, prove that $a<x(1)<b$ for $a$, $b$ to be determined. By being clever, try to make $a$ and $b$ as close together as possible. I was given a hint from my professor that, in other words, we want to approximate $$\psi(x) \leq x+ e^{-x} \leq \phi(x) $$ for $\phi(x),\,\psi(x) \geq 0$, and that essentially what we want to do is solve the following three IVPs:
$$(1) \qquad\frac{dx}{dt} = \psi(x) \\ \qquad x(t_{0})=x_{0}, $$
$$ (2) \qquad  \frac{dx}{dt} = x+e^{-x} \\ \qquad x(t_{0}) = x_{0},$$
and 
$$ (3) \qquad \frac{dx}{dt} = \phi(x) \\ \qquad x(t_{0})=x_{0} .$$
Then, if we call the solution to $(1)$ $a(t)$, the solution to $(2)$ $x(t)$, and the solution to $(3)$ $b(t)$, the problem boils down to showing that $$a(1) \leq x(1) \leq b(1). $$ In that regard, I am very close to finding $b(1)$. To get there, I considered the Taylor expansion for $$e^{-x} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^{n} \frac{x^{n}}{n!} =1-x + \frac{x^{2}}{2} - \frac{x^{3}}{3!}+ \cdots$$ so that $x+e^{-x} = x + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^{n}\frac{x^{n}}{n!}.$ As a bound, I decided to show that $x+e^{-x} \leq 1 + \frac{x^{2}}{2}$ $\forall x \geq 0.$ To that effect, I let $h(x) = x + e^{-x} - 1 - \frac{x^{2}}{2}$, and then I considered $h^{\prime}(x) = 1 - e^{-x} - x$ and $h^{\prime \prime}(x) = e^{-x} - 1$. Since $h^{\prime \prime}(x) > 0$ for $x < 0$, $h^{\prime}(x)$ is increasing on $(-\infty, 0)$. Since $h^{\prime \prime}(x) < 0$ for $x > 0$, $h^{\prime}(x)$ is decreasing on $(0, \infty)$. But, $h^{\prime}(x) = 0$ for $x = 0$, so $h^{\prime}(x) < 0$ for $x<0$ and $h^{\prime}(x) < 0 $ for $x > 0$ as well - the only time $h^{\prime}(x)$ is not negative is when $x=0$, and there it is simply $=0$. Therefore, $h$ is everywhere decreasing, and since $h(x)=0$, $h > 0$ for $x<0$ and $h < 0$ for $x > 0$, so we have that $h(x) = x + e^{-x} - 1 - \frac{x^{2}}{2} \leq 0$ for $x \geq 0$, which implies that $x + e^{-x} \leq 1 + \frac{x^{2}}{2} $, as desired. So, then I let $\phi(x) = 1 - \frac{x^{2}}{2}$, and I need to solve Equation $(3)$ above. Using separation of variables, I have that $\frac{dx}{dt} = 1 - \frac{x^{2}}{2}$ becomes $\displaystyle \int \frac{1}{\displaystyle 1 - \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^{2}} dx = \int dt$, which comes out to be 
$$\ln \left(1 + \frac{x}{\sqrt{2}} \right) - \ln \left(1 - \frac{x}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \sqrt{2}t + C, $$ And then, exponentiating both sides, we get $$\frac{1+\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}}{1-\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}}= Ce^{\sqrt{2}t} $$ From here, I don't know what to do . The problem tells us what the initial condition when $t=0$ is - it tells us that $x(0) = 0$, but it doesn't tell us what it is for $t=1$. And since we're trying to find bounds for $x(1)$, I'm assuming that for Equation (3) (actually in all three of the equations), we want $t_{0} = 1$, right? The only problem is that I can't figure out what $x_{0}$ is in that case, so how do I solve for $C$? Also, if you could help me out on the left bound (i.e., solving for $\psi(x)$), I would appreciate that very much!

Since $\alpha$ has degree $4$ over $\Bbb Q$ and $\sqrt[5] 3,\sqrt[5] 7$ have degree $5$ over $\Bbb Q$, we have that the degrees of these splitting fields are $20$.

Then, $J_{p}$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-linear map and $J_{p}^{2}=-\text{Id}$, so $J_{p}$ has two eigenvalues: $i$ and $-i$ If $T_{1,0}$ is the $i$-eigenspace and $T_{0,1}$ is the $-i$-eigenspace (which are complex subspaces), it can be proved that $TM\otimes_{\mathbb R}\mathbb{C} \cong T_{1,0}\oplus T_{0,1}$. Similarly, $T^{*}M\otimes_{\mathbb R} \mathbb{C} \cong T^{1,0}\oplus T^{0,1}$.
Then, $\bigwedge^{k}(T^{*}M\otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C})$ equals $\oplus_{m+l=k}(\bigwedge^{m}(T^{1,0})\otimes \bigwedge^{l}(T^{0,1}))$. My question is: I believe that the last tensor product should be taken over $\mathbb{C}$, since $T^{1,0}$ and $T^{0,1}$ are vector spaces over $\mathbb{C}$. Am I right? Moreover, how do elements of $\bigwedge^{m}(T^{1,0})\otimes \bigwedge^{l}(T^{0,1})$ look like?

2652393,Derivatives of Infinite Product that Diverges to 0,"Consider the function given by $$f_n(x) = \prod\limits_{k=2}^n \left( 1-\frac{x}{k} \right).$$ Then for all $x \in (0,2)$, we have that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\; f_n(x) = \prod\limits_{k=2}^\infty \left( 1-\frac{x}{k} \right) =0. $$
This follows from the fact that if $q_k \in [0,1)$ for all $k$, then $\prod\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} (1-q_k) = 0$ if and only if $\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty q_k$ diverges (See for example here and here ). I am interested in the derivatives of this function $f_n$. For instance, let $f_n^{(j)}$ denote the $j$-th derivative of $f_n$. Is it true that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f_n^{(j)}(x) = 0$ for all $x\in(0,2)$? Considering the first derivative, we have that from the product rule:
$$ f_n'(x) =  \sum\limits_{k=2}^n \frac{-1}{k} \prod\limits_{i \neq k} \left(1-\frac{x}{i} \right)\tag1 \label 1 .$$
Now, we have that 
\begin{align}\prod\limits_{i \neq k} \left(1-\frac{x}{i} \right) &\leq \prod\limits_{i =2}^{n-1} \left(1-\frac{x}{i} \right)\\
&= \exp\left\{ \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} \log\left(1-\frac{x}{i} \right)  \right\} \\
&\leq \exp\left\{ \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} -\frac{x}{i} \right\} \tag2  \\
&\leq \exp\left\{-x\log(n)+x \right\}\tag3\\
&= {\left(\frac{e}{n}\right)}^x.\end{align}
Where (2) above follows from the fact that $\log(1-y)\leq -y$ for all $y<1$, and (3) follows from $\sum\limits_{i=2}^{n-1}\frac{1}{i} \geq \log(n)-1$. Now, by noticing all the terms in the sum in $\ref1$ are nonpositive, we have the following
\begin{align*}
 f_n'(x) \geq {\left(\frac{e}{n}\right)}^x\sum\limits_{k=2}^n \frac{-1}{k} \geq -{\left(\frac{e}{n}\right)}^x \log(n)
\end{align*}
Finally, because $f_n'(x)\leq 0$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty}  {\left(\frac{e}{n}\right)}^x \log(n) = 0$, we are able to conclude that $\lim \; f_n'(x) = 0$ for all $x \in (0,2)$. Now, is there a way to show this for the $j$-th derivative $f_n^{(j)}$? I am unable to even currently show that the second derivative is zero (in my simulations it seems to approach zero, but at a rate slower than the first derivative). An idea that I have briefly considered using is considering the differentiation of the infinite product (see here and similarly here ). However in my case my infinite product diverges to zero, so I am not sure how useful this will be. Also, I am interested in the higher order derivatives of this infinite product, not just the first derivative. I appreciate any input on this problem!","['derivatives', 'infinite-product']"

My instinct is that it is not possible, but I don't know how to show it. To make it clear, there are $27$ unit cubes, that is, $6\times27$ sides to be colored with blue, green, or red. Then you need to arrange them so that they form a $3\times3\times3$ cube, whose surfaces are blue. Then you rearrange unit cubes, so that they form a $3\times3\times3$ cube, whose surfaces are green. Then you rearrange them again, this time get a red $3\times3\times3$ cube. More generally, can you color $n^3$ unit cubes with $n$ colors, so that after arraging, they can form $n$  $n\times n\times n$cubes, each cube's surfaces is in a different color? When $n=1,2$, the answer is yes and the solution is obvious. But when $n$ is bigger, the problem seems complex, and I totally have no clue.","['puzzle', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Firstly he makes assumption that the curve is of parameter $t= \frac{\pi s}{l}$. $\gamma $ is a unit sped curve and having the period $\pi$. Also makes the assumption that curve begins and ends at origin. The he starts with parametric equations $x=rcos \theta$ and $y= rsin \theta$ and proves the inequality. I cannot understand why he uses the the parametric equation of a circle for general curve.

I do not understand the last paragraph of the proof. How did he go from the $\sqrt{n}$-consistency to the last conclusion?

2653096,upper semicontinuity of fiber dimension with target dimension 0,"I have problem with Ravi Vakil's FOAG, Theorem 11.4.2.

He proves this by induction on $\operatorname{dim} Y$, and says it is obvious when the dimension is 0. I couldn't figure out the reason why it is obvious.

2653102,Is there a closed totally disconnected space meeting every component?,Suppose $X$ is compact Hausdorff and has infinitely many components. It seems there should be a way to select at least one point from each component so the resulting set is totally disconnected and closed. But it seems harder than I thought. Brute force approach: Let $C$ denote the family of components of $X$. For each $c \in C$ choose a point $x(c) \in c$. Then the set $D = \{x(c): c \in C \}$ has only one point from each component. But it might not be closed. So redefine $D$ as the closure of $\{x(c): c \in C \}$. Then $D$ is closed but might not be totally disconnected. Any tips?,"['general-topology', 'compactness', 'connectedness']"

\end{align} where $\vec{x}(0)=(1,1)^T$ . The only issue here, that separates it from a standard non-homogeneous linear system of ODEs ( see here ), is the presence of the exponential vector term. This 2D system is a reduction of a larger ODE system and this is as simple as I can get it. There does exist a small parameter ( $\alpha\simeq\beta\sim O(1/\varepsilon)$ , where $0<\varepsilon\ll1$ and all other terms are $O(1)$ ), however I would rather consider an exact solution as asymptotic analysis on similar systems as this has proved not useful past small/intermediate time in the parameter spaces of interest. If I make any progress on this I will add it below, if this system has been solved before I would really appreciate a reference, or a reference to a more general solution. EDIT 1 Ok, so thank you all for your help. I have consulted with my colleagues, discussed their ideas and your suggestions, we believe we have proven that you can't find a solution in terms of elementary functions, even in a reduced case (which is what I need). With the aid of some biological arguments I can restrict my parameter regimes of interest to ones that allow the following expression to be surprisingly accurate: $$y = \frac{1}{1+\gamma e^{-\lambda t}}$$ where $\gamma>0$ and can be expressed in terms of the other coefficients in this model. This reduces the system to a single ODE, as follows: \begin{align}
\frac{\text{d}x}{\text{d}t}
%%%
&=
%%%
-\left( A + \alpha e^{-\lambda t}\right)x + \frac{B}{1+\gamma e^{-\lambda t}} + x_0
\end{align} with $x(0)=1$ . NOTE 1: If we define $\bar{M}$ as follows \begin{align}
\bar{M} = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
-(A-1)  &  B/\delta \\
\delta C  & -(D-1)
\end{array}\right)
\end{align} where $\delta\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ , then the eigenvalues of $\bar{M}$ are $-|\lambda|$ and $-|\mu|$ , where $0<\lambda\ll\mu$ . If we consider the similar system: \begin{align}
\frac{\text{d}\vec{z}}{\text{d}t}
%%%
&=
%%%
\bar{M}
\vec{z}
\end{align} where $\vec{z}=(z_1(t),z_2(t))^T$ and $\vec{z}(0)=(0,1)^T$ . Then this system has approximate solution \begin{align}
\vec{z} &\simeq
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\alpha \\
\beta
\end{array}\right)
e^{-\lambda t}
\end{align} This solution does not hold for $t\ll1$ , as can be seen from the initial conditions, however for all intents and purposes it can be treated as exact.
