3497,Algebra structure of tensor product of two Galois extensions,"Sorry if this question is too basic. It is from Fröhlich and Taylor's ""Algebraic Number Theory"". Let $E/F$ be a finite Galois extension of fields, with $G=Gal(E/F)$, and let $K$ and $L$ be two subfields of $E$, containing $F$, such that $K/F$ and $L/F$ are both Galois. Let $M=Gal(E/K)$ and $N=Gal(E/L)$ be normal subgroups of $G$. Suppose ${\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_n}$ is a transversal for $MN$ in $G$, with $n=[G:MN]$. If $C$ is the compositum $KL$ in $E$, how can I show the map
$$ k\otimes l\mapsto (k^{\gamma_1}l,\ldots,k^{\gamma_n}l) $$ induces an isomorphism between $K\otimes_F L$ and $\prod_{i=1}^n C$? It is clear to me that this map is an $F$-algebra homomorphism, and that they both have the same dimension over $F$.  Thus surjectivity, or injectivity, would be enough.  I have not been able to figure out what the idempotents of $\prod_{i=1}^n C$ should look like in $K\otimes_F L$, so I have not been able to show surjectivity.  Meanwhile, I think injectivity should be easier to show, because if we have
$$ k_1\otimes l_1 + \cdots + k_m\otimes l_m\mapsto 0,$$
then we get a system of equations
$$ k_1l_1 + \cdots + k_ml_m=0$$
$$ \cdots$$
$$ k_1^{\gamma_n}l_1 + \cdots k_m^{\gamma_n}l_m=0.$$
Summing up the columns, I get
$$ \sum_{i=1}^m(\sum_{j=1}^n k_i^{\gamma_j})l_i=0 $$
and all this is happening in $L$.  But I can't seem to finish this argument.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.","['field-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'number-theory']"

3508,Determinant of a polynomial matrix,"A matrix determinant (naively) can be computed in $O(n!)$ steps, or with a proper LU decomposition $O(n^3)$ steps. This assumes that all the matrix elements are constant. If, however the matrix elements are polynomials (say univariate of max order $p$) at each step of the LU decomposition an element is multiplied by another element producing (on average) ever larger polynomials. Each step therefore takes longer and longer - is the cost perform the decomposition still a polynomial? EDIT : To clarify my reasoning a bit, if polynomial (using FFT as J.M. suggests in the comments) takes $O(m \log m)$, and we must perform $O(n^3)$ operations to get the LU decomposition, each step the polynomial could effectively double in degree at each multiplication*. The running time would look something like $$ \approx O \left ( \sum_{k}^{n^3} (p \ln p)^{2k} \right ) .$$ * (it doesn't quite do that, and this is where I'm stuck)","['asymptotics', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"

3528,Beta function derivation,"How do I derive the Beta function using the definition of the beta function as the normalizing constant of the Beta distribution and only common sense random experiments? I'm pretty sure this is possible, but can't see how. I can see that $$\newcommand{\Beta}{\mathrm{Beta}}\sum_{a=0}^n {n \choose a} \Beta(a+1, n-a+1) = 1$$ because we can imagine that we are flipping a coin $n$ times.  The $2^n$ unique sequences of flips partition the probability space.  The Beta distribution with parameters $a$ and $n-a$ can be defined as the prior over the coin's bias probability $p$ given the observation of $a$ heads and $n-a$ tails.   Since there are ${n \choose a}$ such sequences for any $n$ and $a$, that explains the scaling factor, and we know that it all sums to unity since the sequences partition the probability space, which has total measure 1. What I can't figure out is why: $${n \choose a} \Beta(a+1, n-a+1) = \frac{1}{n+1} \qquad \forall n \ge 0,\quad a \in \{0, \dots, n\}.$$ If we knew that, we could easily see that $$\Beta(a + 1,n - a + 1) = \frac{1}{(n+1){n \choose a}} = \frac{a!(n-a)!}{(n+1)!}.$$","['probability-theory', 'special-functions', 'statistics']"

In classical mechanics, are we allowed to say that angular momentum is a vector because particles only rotate along a single axis? Or do we make some kind of argument that you can assign angular velocity to an object because you can approximate it locally as being along a single rotation axis and so its ""locally commutative"" and hence appropriate to call it a vector? If that is the case what happens if we have a particle rotating in a way that isn't differentiable? Is there some physical reason that particles can't rotate in that sort of way?

Permutation group on a set is the set of all permutations of elements on the set. Aren't these two things the same thing? On one of the discussion pages, someone suggested that permutation groups don't have to include all permutations: they just have to be collections of permutations on the set, closed under composition etc. But this seems weird. First, that's not how I was taught it, and second (thanks to Cayley's theorem) it looks like it's redundant: all groups are ""permutation groups"" on this reading.

I've tried to look for examples of Gröbner bases in action, but have been unable to find any (that can be easily understood). I could go ahead and just ask for an explanation with examples from people, but I'll go one step further. General plane conics can be represented by the Cartesian equation $$ax^2+2bxy+cy^2+dx+fy+g=0$$ One common problem in dealing with conics is finding out if two conics intersect, and if so, where the intersection point(s) are. Usually one can do all this by eliminating variables accordingly.

3565,Split up $n \in \mathbb{N}$ into sum of naturals with maximum LCM,"Question : Given some natural number, we can of course split it up into various sums of other naturals (e.g. $7 = 6 + 1 = 1 + 4 + 2 = \ldots$) More precisely, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we can a find distribution sequence (or partition ) $s_0,\ldots,s_u \in \mathbb{N}$ with $$\sum_{i=0}^{u}s_i = n$$ Now how can I find the partition $s$ for which the overall least common multiple of all elements is maximal.
Or differently formulated the maximum product of distinct prime factors of all elements. Example: $$ 7 \mapsto (3, 4); \Pi_{lcm} = 12 $$
$$ 7 \mapsto (1, 2, 4); \Pi_{lcm} = 4$$ 
$$ \ldots $$ Here, the first solution is the desired one. Background: The background of my question is: How can I split up a sequence/string into contiguous subsequences that, when repeated and zipped together , will yield the longest possible resulting sequence. For the above example, I could split up a string of length $7$ in the following way: 7: abcdefg 7:  abcdefg

1: aaaa    3: abcabcabcabc
2: bcbc    4: defgdefgdefg
4: defg Of course, using the second distribution, the resulting sequence has a much greater period. So: What algorithm/approach can I use to solve this problem and maximize the product? Is this some known problem and how complex would calculating a solution be? It's not NP, I hope?! Edit: Partial solution As @KennyTM pointed out in the comments, Landau's function $g$ describes the maximum LCM, i.e. $g(7) = 12$. So this actually becomes: How to actually produce the partition?

3579,Why are the only numbers $m$ for which $n^{m+1}\equiv n \pmod{m}$ is true also unique for $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{m}{n^m}\equiv 1 \bmod m$?,"It can be seen here that the only numbers for which $n^{m+1}\equiv n \pmod{m}$ is true are 1, 2, 6, 42, and 1806. Through experimentation, it has been found that $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{m}{n^m}\equiv 1 \bmod m$ is true for those numbers, and (as yet unproven) no others. Why is this true? If there is a simple relation between $n^{m+1} \bmod{m}$ and $n^m \bmod{m}$, that would probably make this problem make more sense. It is obvious that $n^m \equiv 1 \pmod{\frac{m}{d}}$ (dividing out $n$ from both sides gives this result) for all $n$ on the interval $[1,m]$ where $d$ is a divisor of $m$. As a result of this, $n^m \bmod{m}$ takes on only values of the form $1+k \frac{m}{d} \pmod m$ where $k = -1, 0, 1$.

3602,A naive approach for nonlinear optimization on several real variables and one natural variable. Give examples of (potential) failure,"Motivation: Example . To solve a problem on evaluating the maximum of a product of $n$ real variables subject to an equality constraint on its sum $S$ ($=100$), I used the Lagrange multipliers method (which can be improved by adding the adequate conditions on the second order partial derivatives). Doing so I got a ""solution"" $x^*=(x_1,x_2,\dots ,x_n)\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $x_1=x_2=\dots=x_n=100/n$. I proceeded by maximizing the single real variable function $u(t)=(100/t)^t$: the maximum is at $36\lt t^*\lt 37$. Finally I computed $u(36)\lt u(37)$. Hence, the optimum occurs at $n=37$. In spite of having come to the correct solution to the problem, I was told that such an approach does not guarantee the correct solution, in the general case . Question: In order to see some limitations of treating optimization problems as illustrated by the above example but with greater generality, a few examples in which this method fails would be appreciated. Remark : I hope this edited text improves the question. EDIT: The case I have in mind is that of finding the maximum/minimum of an objective function $f(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$ subject to at least one constraint $g(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)=0$ This is a kind  of generalization of the linear programming simplex problem , two differences being a nonlinear optimization and one integer variable .","['optimization', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'nonlinear-optimization', 'analysis']"

3609,Is there a natural model of Peano Arithmetic where Goodstein's theorem fails?,"Goodstein's Theorem is the statement that every Goodstein sequence eventually hits 0.  It is known to be independent of Peano Arithemtic (PA), and in fact, was the first such purely number theoretic result.  It is provable in ZFC. One way of phrasing this is that the theory ""PA + Goodstein's theorem is false"" is consistent (assuming PA is). By Godel's completeness theorem, there must exist a model of PA in which Goodstein's theorem fails.  In fact, applying the downward Lowenheim-Skolem theorem, we may assume this model is countable. However, in the interest of speaking about this result to a group of grad students (of various interests), I'd like to run this backwards.  So, is there some known, obvious, or easy to construct countable nonstandard model of $PA$ in which Goodstein's theorem fails? In answering this, I'm willing to accept the ""foundational"" first order logic theorems:  Godel's completeness and compactness results, the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem. Here is the kind of answer I'd really like:  There is an explicit countable collection $\Sigma = \{\phi_n\}$ of first order sentences (possibly in a slightly larger language) such that $\mathbb{N}$ is a model of $PA + \Sigma_0$ for any finite $\Sigma_0\subseteq \Sigma$, and such that $PA + \Sigma$ implies Goodstein's theorem is false. One approach I've thought of is to first enlarge the language by adding a constant symbol c.  Next, let $\phi_n$ be the statement ""The Goodstein sequence for $c$ takes longer than ""n"" steps to terminate"".  (While I do not personally know how to encode ""the Goodstein sequence for $c$"" in first order language, I am confident it can be done, for otherwise, one could not even formulate ""PA proves the Goodstein sequence converges"".) In this case, $\mathbb{N}$ is a model of any $PA + \Sigma_0$ by simply setting c = n+1, where n is the largest subscript of a $\phi_k$ in $\Sigma_0$ (which exists because $\Sigma_0$ is finite). By Godel's and Lowenheim-Skolem theorems, $PA + \Sigma$ has a countable model $M$.  Then the interpretation of $c$ in this model satisfies $\phi_n$ for all $n$, and hence the Goodstein sequence doesn't terminate for $c$ in this model. However, since the independence of Goodstein's theorem was so difficult to prove, I'm quite certain there's a mistake in this line of reasoning (though I don't know where).  I'd love for someone to patch this up into something correct.

3675,Question on Riemann's rearrangement theorem,"Let there be given some conditionally convergent infinite series $S$.  Then let $R$ be some real number, and $Q_k$ a rearrangement of $S$ such that the sum is equal to $R$. Is $Q_k$ unique?  In other words, is there some other rearrangement $W_k$ for which the sum of $S$ is also $R$? I believe the answer is that $Q_k$ is in fact unique, because the cardinality of the set of permutations of the natural numbers (i.e. the positions of each element of the series $S$), is the same as the cardinality of the real numbers; and therefore the mapping from the real numbers to the rearrangements should be $1-1$.

3684,When does a finite ring become a finite field?,"I'm relatively new to ring theory so this is probably a simple question. Its easy to see that a finite ring that is commutative and has no-zero divisors (i.e. an integral domain) must have multiplicative inverses. I am wondering if we can rearrange these properties and always get implication or produce finite rings with only 2 of the above properties. Explicitly my questions are: 1) Does a finite ring that is commutative with multiplicative inverses always have no-zero divisors?
(EDIT: this one is pretty easy too, let $xy=0$ and assume $x\neq 0$ . then $x^{-1}xy=x^{-1}0$ . Hence, $y=0$ as desired.) 2) Is a finite ring that has multiplicative inverses and no zero divisors always commutative?

This is strange because a prime ideal of a ring is, by convention, a proper ideal but not necessarily non-zero (see wikipedia ).

3723,Integrate product of Dirac delta and discontinuous function?,"Consider the piecewise constant function $\psi:I=[-1,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ given by $$\psi(x) = \begin{cases} \psi_1 & x \leq 0, \ \psi_2 & x > 0 \end{cases}$$ for some constants $\psi_1, \psi_2 \in \mathbb{R}$.  I would like to evaluate the integral $$\int_I \delta(x) \psi(x) dx$$ where $\delta$ is the Dirac delta distribution centered at $x=0$.  Of course, if we think about distributions in the usual way then you might say that $\delta(\psi) = \langle \delta, \psi \rangle = \psi(0) = \psi_1.$  But then the result depends on a fairly arbitrary choice when defining $\psi$: should the left- or right- half of the interval be closed?  This question doesn't seem to have a meaningful answer when dealing with a problem that arises from a physical system (say). Instead, consider a family of distributions $\phi_\epsilon(x)$ such that $\phi_\epsilon(x)=\phi_\epsilon(-x)$, $\int_I \phi_\epsilon(x)=1$ for all $\epsilon$, and $\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \phi_\epsilon = \delta$, i.e., any family of even distributions with unit mass that approaches the Dirac delta distribution as $\epsilon$ approaches zero.  (For instance, you could use the family of Gaussians $\phi_\epsilon(x) = \frac{1}{\epsilon\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-x^2/\epsilon^2}$.) I can now think of my integral as $$\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \int_I \phi_\epsilon(x) \psi(x) dx.$$ For some $\epsilon > 0$, the integral inside the limit can be expressed as $$u(\epsilon) = \psi_1 \int_{-1}^0 \phi_\epsilon(x) dx + \psi_2 \int_0^1 \phi_\epsilon(x) dx = \frac{1}{2}\left( \psi_1 + \psi_2 \right) = \bar{\psi},$$ where $\bar{\psi}$ is the mean of the constant values.  Can we say, then, that $\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} u(\epsilon) = \bar{\psi}$?  It would seem so: for any $\mu > 0$ there exists an $\epsilon_0$ such that $\epsilon < \epsilon_0$ implies $|u(\epsilon) - \bar{\psi}|<\mu$ (namely, $\epsilon$ is any positive constant!).  But clearly I've got a problem somewhere, because $\bar{\psi} \ne \psi_1$, i.e., this result does not agree with my earlier interpretation. So what's the right thing to do here?  The latter answer ($\bar{\psi}$) agrees more with my ""physical"" intuition (because it's invariant with respect to deciding which half-interval is open), but I'm concerned about rigor. Edit: Since the problem as stated is not well-posed ($\delta$ cannot be evaluated on discontinuous functions), let me give some motivation.  Imagine that I have a pair of piecewise linear functions $f,g:I^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which are again discontinuous only at $x=0$.  I would like to integrate the wedge product of $df$ and $dg$ over the domain: $$\int_{I^2} df \wedge dg = \int_I \int_I \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} dx dy.$$ Consider just the first term $(\partial f/\partial x)(\partial g/\partial y)$ and consider just the inner integral $\int_I \cdot dx$.  We now have (almost) the original problem: $\partial f/\partial x$ can be thought of as a $\delta$ (plus a piecewise constant), and $\partial g/\partial y$ is simply piecewise constant along the $x$-direction. So, the problem could be restated as: how do I integrate the wedge product $df \wedge dg$ of piecewise linear 0-forms $f$ and $g$ defined over a planar region?  Formally this problem may again be ill-posed, yet it is a real problem that comes up in the context of finite element analysis where basis functions are nonsmooth or even discontinuous.","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

Suppose $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$, and $f$ is not identically zero. Suppose $f$ has a holomorphic logarithm on $\Omega$, which means that there is a function $g$ holomorphic on $\Omega$ such that $e^g=f$. Then it is easy to show that $f$ has holomorphic $n$-th roots on $\Omega$ for each $n$, which means that for each integer $n$, there exist a function $g_n$ holomorphic on $\Omega$ such that $(g_n)^n = f$. Is the converse true? i.e. if $f$ has holomorphic $n$-th roots on $\Omega$ for all $n$, then can we find a function $g$ holomorphic on $\Omega$ such that $f=e^g$? A few remarks : One can prove that if $f$ has holomorphic $n$-th roots on $\Omega$ for all $n$, then $f$ does not vanish on $\Omega$. Therefore, we can define a holomorphic logarithm locally , but is it possible to find a global holomorphic logarithm?

Other solutions using ordinary calculus, trigonometry, algebra of conic sections, and so on are also possible. The problem is usually stated in the form of a letter from an Aunt and Uncle: Dear niece/nephew, How are things
  going for you and your folks?  We hear
  you are doing quite well it school. 
  Keep it up!  Given this success, we
  were hoping you could help us figure
  out a little dilemma.  As you know,
  our home is heated by fuel oil, and we
  have a big tank buried in the side
  yard.  The tank is a cylinder, 20 feet
  long and 10 feet in diameter, lying on
  its side five feet deep, with a narrow
  tube coming to a fill cap at ground
  level.  Your uncle has a 15 foot
  length of old pipe that we'd like to
  utilize as a dip stick in order to
  know when we are getting close to
  needing a fill-up.  We know that 0
  feet is empty, 5 feet is half full,
  and 10 feet is completely full. 
  Trouble is, we don't know how to mark
  any other points. We are pretty sure
  they will not be uniformly spaced. 
  What we really want is to know, within
  the nearest 0.01 foot, where to mark
  the dip stick for every multiple of
  10% from 0% to 100%.  Can you figure
  this out for us?  Of course, we will
  want to see details of your solution
  and check it ourselves, and it would
  especially help if you could draw us a
  scale model of the dip stick. Love,
  Auntie Flo and Uncle Jim That last sentence shows the teacher influence on the problem.
So, my challenge to this community is not to find any old solution, but to find the solution at the lowest possible grade level, so to speak. Thanks.

3777,Is there a function with a removable discontinuity at every point?,"If memory serves, ten years ago to the week (or so), I taught first semester freshman calculus for the first time.  As many calculus instructors do, I decided I should ask some extra credit questions to get students to think more deeply about the material.  The first one I asked was this: 1) Recall that a function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is said to have a removable discontinuity at a point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ if $\lim_{x \rightarrow x_0} f(x)$ exists but not does not equal $f(x_0)$.  Does there exist a function $f$ which has a removable discontinuity at $x_0$ for every $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$? Commentary: if so, we could define a new function $\tilde{f}(x_0) = \lim_{x \rightarrow x_0} f(x)$ and it seems at least that $\tilde{f}$ has a fighting chance to be continuous on $\mathbb{R}$.  Thus we have successfully ""removed the discontinuities"" of $f$, but in so doing we have changed the value at every point! Remark: Lest you think this is too silly to even seriously contemplate, consider the function $f: \mathbb{Q} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ given by $f(0) = 1$ and for a nonzero 
rational number $\frac{p}{q}$, $f(\frac{p}{q}) = \frac{1}{q}$.  It is easy to see that this function has limit $0$ at every (rational) point! So I mentioned this problem to my students.  A week later, the only person who asked me about it at all was my Teaching Assistant, who was an older undergraduate, not even a math major, I think.  (I hasten to add that this was not in any sense an honors calculus class, i.e., I was pretty clueless back then.)  Thinking about it a bit, I asked him if he knew about uncountable sets, and he said that he didn't.  At that point I realized that I didn't have a solution in mind that he would understand (so still less so for the freshman calculus students) and I advised him to forget all about it. So my actual question is : can you solve this problem using only the concepts in a non-honors freshman calculus textbook?  (In particular, without using notions of un/countability?) [ Addendum : Let me say explicitly that I would welcome an answer that proceeds directly in terms of the least upper bound axiom.  Most freshman calculus books do include this, albeit somewhere hidden from view of the casual readers, i.e., actual freshman calculus students.] If you can't figure out how to answer the question at all, I think the following related question helps. 2) Define a function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ to be precontinuous if the limit exists at every point.  For such a function, we can define $\tilde{f}$ as above.  Prove/disprove that, as suggested above, $\tilde{f}$ is indeed continuous.  [Then think about $f - \tilde{f}$.] Now that I think about it, there is an entire little area here that I don't know anything about, e.g. 3) The set of discontinuities of an arbitrary function is known -- any $F_{\sigma}$ set inside $\mathbb{R}$ can serve.  What can we say about the set of discontinuities of a ""precontinuous function""?  [Edit: from the link provided in Chandru1's answer, we see that it is countable.  What else can we say?  Note that taking the above example and extending by $0$ to the irrationals, we see that the set of points of discontinuity of a precontinuous function can be dense.]","['calculus', 'real-analysis']"

3897,Evaluating a convergent improper triple integral over the unit sphere,"In Exercise 5 (f) of Angus Taylor's Advanced calculus (p. 659) one is asked to find the value of the following integral if convergent: $$I:=\underset{R}{\iiint}\dfrac{x^2 y^2 z^2}{r^{17/2}}\mathrm dV$$ where $R$ is the unit sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2\leq 1$ and $r^2=x^2+y^2+z^2$. Observing that $\dfrac{x^2 y^2 z^2}{r^{17/2}}\leq \dfrac{r^6}{r^{17/2}}=r^{-5/2}$ I proved that $I$ is convergent. Using spherical co-ordinates $r$, $\theta $, $\phi $ i.e. $$\begin{align*}x&=r\sin \phi \cos \theta\\y&=r\sin \phi \sin \theta\\z&=r\cos \theta\end{align*}$$ I transformed the integral $I$ into $$I=\int\nolimits_0^{2\pi }\left(\int_0^{\pi }\left(\lim_{\delta \to 0}\int_{\delta }^1\left(r^2 \sin \phi\right)\dfrac{x^2 y^2 z^2}{r^{17/2}}\;\mathrm dr\right)\;\mathrm d\phi \right)\;\mathrm d\theta$$ $$=\lim_{\delta \to 0}\left( \int_{\delta }^1 r^{-1/2}\mathrm dr\right)\int_0^{2\pi }\cos^4 \theta \sin^2 \theta \mathrm d\theta\int_0^{\pi }\sin^5 \mathrm d\phi $$ $$=2\cdot \dfrac18 \pi \cdot \dfrac{16}{15}=\dfrac4{15}\pi $$ In the solutions the answer is $\dfrac8{105}\pi$. Since sometimes there
are a few book typos (in the exercises) to prevent undue copying, I ask the
following Question: What is the correct solution, $\dfrac4{15}\pi $ or $\dfrac8{105}\pi $? UPDATE (Correction) : instead of $z=r\cos \theta $ it is $z=r\cos \phi $ See a comment from whuber . The integral $I$ is transformed into $$I=\int_0^{2\pi }\left(\int_0^{\pi }\left(\lim_{\delta \to 0}\int_{\delta }^1\left(r^2 \sin \phi\right)\dfrac{x^2 y^2 z^2}{r^{17/2}}\;\mathrm dr\right)\;\mathrm d\phi \right)\;\mathrm d\theta$$ Since $$(r^2 \sin \phi )\dfrac{x^2 y^2 z^2}{r^{17/2}}=(r^2\sin \phi )\dfrac1{r^{17/2}}\left( r\sin \phi \cos \theta \right)
^{2}\left( r\sin \phi \sin \theta \right) ^{2}\left( r\cos \phi \right) ^{2}$$ $=r^{-1/2}\cos ^{2}\theta \cdot\sin ^{2}\theta \cdot\cos ^{2}\phi \cdot\sin ^{5}\phi $, the transformed integral becomes (if I am right): $$I=\left(\lim_{\delta \to 0} \int_{\delta
}^1 r^{-1/2}\mathrm dr\right)\int_0^{2\pi }\cos^2\theta\cdot\sin^2\theta \;\mathrm d\theta
\int_0^{\pi }\cos^2 \phi \cdot\sin^5 \phi \;\mathrm d\phi$$ $$=2\cdot \dfrac14 \pi \cdot \dfrac{16}{105}=\dfrac8{105}\pi$$ The correct solution will be $\dfrac8{105}\pi $ as in the book.","['multivariable-calculus', 'improper-integrals', 'calculus', 'integration']"

3913,"The right ""weigh"" to do integrals","Back in the day, before approximation methods like splines became vogue in my line of work, one way of computing the area under an empirically drawn curve was to painstakingly sketch it on a piece of graphing paper (usually with the assistance of a French curve) along with the axes, painstakingly cut along the curve, weigh the cut pieces, cut out a square equivalent to one square unit of the graphing paper, weigh that one as well, and reckon the area from the information now available. One time, when we were faced with determining the area of a curve that crossed the horizontal axis thrice, I did the careful cutting of the paper, and made sure to separate the pieces above the horizontal axis from the pieces below the horizontal axis. Then, my boss suddenly scooped up all the pieces and weighed them all. I argued that the grouped pieces should have been weighed separately, and then subtract the weights of the ""below"" group from the ""above"" group, while my boss argued that we were calculating the total area, and thus, not separating the pieces was justifiable.

3923,The orthogonal complement of the space of row-null and column-null matrices,"I propose the following lemma and its proof. It is related to row-null and column-null matrices - i.e. matrices whose rows and columns both sum to zero. Could you please give your opinion on the plausibility of the lemma, and the validity of the proof? Lemma: Let $Z\in\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ be a general $n\times n$ real matrix, and let $Y\in\mathcal{S}(n,\mathbb{R})$, where $\mathcal{S}(n,\mathbb{R})$ is the space of row-null column-null $n\times n$ real matrices. Then $\text{Tr}(ZY)=0$ for all $Y$ in $\mathcal{S}(n,\mathbb{R})$ if and only if $Z$ has the form $$Z_{ij}=\left(p_{j}-p_{i}\right)+\left(q_{j}+q_{i}\right)$$. Proof: Consider the space of row-null and column-null matrices $$\mathcal{S}(n,\mathbb{R})= \left\{ Y_{ij}\in GL(n,\mathbb{R}):\sum_{i}Y_{ij}=0,\sum_{j}Y_{ij}=0 \right\} $$ Its dimension is
$$\text{dim}(S(n,\mathbb{R}))=N^{2}-2N+1$$
since the row-nullness and column-nullness are defined by $2N$ equations, only $2N-1$ of which are linearly independent.
Consider the following space $$\mathcal{G}(n,\mathbb{R})=\left\{ Z_{ij}\in GL(n,\mathbb{R}):Z_{ij}=\left(p_{j}-p_{i}\right)+\left(q_{j}+q_{i}\right)\right\}$$ Its dimension is $$\text{dim}(\mathcal{G}(n,\mathbb{R}))=2N-1$$
where $N-1$ is the contribution from the antisymmetric part and $N$ is from the symmetric part. Assume $Y\in\mathcal{S}$ and $Z\in\mathcal{G}$, then the Frobenius inner product of two such elements is
$$
\text{Tr}(ZY) =\sum_{ij}\left[\left(p_{j}-p_{i}\right)Y_{ji}+\left(q_{j}+q_{i}\right)Y_{ji}\right]
$$
$$
=\sum_{j}(q_{j}+p_{j})\sum_{i}Y_{ji}+\sum_{i}(q_{i}-p_{i})\sum_{j}Y_{ji}=0
$$
Since $\text{dim}(\mathcal{G})+\text{dim}(\mathcal{S})=\text{dim}(GL)$ and $\mathcal{G}\perp\mathcal{S}$, then $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ must be complementary in $GL$. Therfore, if $Y$ is orthogonal to all the matrices in $\mathcal{S}$, it must lie in $\mathcal{G}$. PS: How can I get the curly brackets {} to render in latex mode?",['linear-algebra']

The above problem came from my friend. Or so I thought, it really came from me incorrectly remembering his problem.

With probability 3/4 (call this heads) you win a dollar and with probability 1/4 (call this tails) you lose a dollar. What is the probability you eventually run out of money? (Suppose the house has as many dollar bills as needed). I know how to solve this problem in the following way:
First observe the number of tails must equal the number of heads plus one. If a string of Hs and Ts satisfy this property, call it Good. Now we want to count the number of Good strings that don't have Good proper prefixes. For a string of length 2n-1 this is just the nth Catalan number. Now we just take the appropriate summation and we arrive at the probability we eventually run out of money which turns out to be 1/3. Now when my friend told me this problem, he said he was able to apply a clever trick and solve it almost instantly. The thing is, he doesn't remember how he did it. He says he vaguely remembers using a recurrence relation and then telescoping a sum. (Which sounds very plausible) So can you come up with a short and sweet solution?
