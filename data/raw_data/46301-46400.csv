464244,Composition and definition of functions,"I have an excercise which i don't understand what a i doing wrong. Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the rational numbers set. Let $h$ and $g$ be functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$:
$$
g(x)=x+1;\quad h(x)=2x-1
$$
Then I have to compose $h \;\mathrm{o}\; g$ or $h(g(x))$:
$$
h(g(x))=h(x+1)=2(x+1)-1
$$
Then the question is: if $h \;\mathrm{o}\; g$ is defined from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$, the answer is Yes but I don't know why. We know that $0$ isn't an element in $\mathbb{R}$ so:
$$
2x+1=0\quad x=-0.5

464346,Why does this ratio of sums of square roots equal $1+\sqrt2+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt2}=\cot\frac\pi{16}$ for any natural number $n$?,"Why is the following function $f(n)$ constant for any natural number $n$? 
$$f(n)=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n^2+2n}\sqrt{\sqrt{2n+2}+{\sqrt{n+1+\sqrt k}}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n^2+2n}\sqrt{\sqrt{2n+2}-{\sqrt{n+1+\sqrt k}}}}=1+\sqrt2+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt2}=\cot {\frac{\pi}{16}}.$$ I've been asking the following question at MSE: Simplify $$\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{2499}\sqrt{10+{\sqrt{50+\sqrt{k}}}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{2499}\sqrt{10-{\sqrt{50+\sqrt{k}}}}}.$$ Simplify $\left({\sum_{k=1}^{2499}\sqrt{10+{\sqrt{50+\sqrt{k}}}}}\right)\left({\sum_{k=1}^{2499}\sqrt{10-{\sqrt{50+\sqrt{k}}}}}\right)^{-1}$ I've just got the following result:$$\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{2499}\sqrt{10+{\sqrt{50+\sqrt k}}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{2499}\sqrt{10-{\sqrt{50+\sqrt k}}}}=1+\sqrt2+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt2}.$$ Proof : Suppose that $\sum$ represents $\sum_{k=1}^{2499}$. Let the numerator and the denominator be $A$ and $B$ respectively. Letting $a_k=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50+\sqrt k}}, b_k=\sqrt{10-\sqrt{50+\sqrt k}}$, we can represent $A, B$ as $A=\sum a_k, B=\sum b_k.$ Letting $p_k=\sqrt{50+\sqrt k}$ and $q_k=\sqrt{50-\sqrt k}$, since ${p_k}^2+{q_k}^2=10^2$ and $p_k\gt0, q_k\gt0$, there exists a real number $0\lt x_k\lt \frac{\pi}{2}$ such that $p_k=10\cos x_k, q_k=10\sin x_k$. Then, we get $$a_k=\sqrt{10+10\cos x_k}=\sqrt{10+10\left(2{\cos^2{\frac{x_k}{2}}}-1\right)}=\sqrt{20}\cos \frac{x_k}{2},$$$$b_k=\sqrt{10-10\cos x_k}=\sqrt{10-10\left(1-2{\sin^2{\frac{x_k}{2}}}\right)}=\sqrt{20}\sin \frac{x_k}{2}.$$ Then, since $\sum a_k=\sum a_{2500-k}$, let's consider $a_{2500-k}$.$$a_{2500-k}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50+\sqrt{(50+\sqrt k)(50-\sqrt k)}}}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50+{p_kq_k}}}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50+100\cos {x_k}\sin {x_k}}}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50(\cos {x_k}+\sin {x_k})^2}}=\sqrt{10+\sqrt{50}\cdot\sqrt2\sin \left(x_k+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}=\sqrt{10+10\cdot2\cos \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\sin \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)}=\sqrt{10\left(\cos \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)+\sin \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\right)^2}=\sqrt {10}\left(\cos \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)+\sin \left(\frac{x_k}{2}+\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\right)=\frac{\left(\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)+\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\right)a_k+\left(\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)-\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\right)b_k}{\sqrt2}=\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt2+1}{2\sqrt2}}a_k+\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt2-1}{2\sqrt2}}b_k.$$ Hence, $$A=\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt2+1}{2\sqrt2}}A+\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt2-1}{2\sqrt2}}B.$$
So, the proof is completed with $$\frac AB=1+\sqrt2+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt2}. $$ After a while, I got the following theorem in the same way as above. Theorem : For any natural number $n$, $$\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n^2+2n}\sqrt{\sqrt{2n+2}+{\sqrt{n+1+\sqrt k}}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n^2+2n}\sqrt{\sqrt{2n+2}-{\sqrt{n+1+\sqrt k}}}}=1+\sqrt2+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt2}=\cot {\frac{\pi}{16}}.$$ Note that the case $n=49$ in this theorem is the question at the top. I was surprised to get this theorem. Here is my question. Question : Why is the function $f(n)$ constant for any natural number $n$? How can we explain this theorem in a geometrical aspect? Is there any geometrical background ? My question is about the background of this equation, and about the reason, not about the proof of it. This theorem has been already proved. Though I've already proved it, I wonder why it is constant. Any help would be appriciated.","['geometry', 'sequences-and-series', 'fractions', 'trigonometry', 'summation']"

464372,Is this proof that the vectors are colinear correct?,"I was solving the following exercise: ""Let $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be nonzero such that if $z$ is orthogonal to $x$ then $z$ is orthogonal to $y$. Prove that $x$ and $y$ are colinear"". My idea was: since $x$ is nonzero, we know that we can write $y =\alpha x + z$ where $z$ is orthogonal to $x$. But, by hypothesis, being orthogonal to $x$ implies being orthogonal to $y$, so that taking the inner product on both sides with $z$ we have: $$\left\langle y,z \right\rangle=\alpha\left\langle x,z \right\rangle + \left\langle z,z \right\rangle = 0,$$ but since $\left\langle x,z\right\rangle = 0$ this implies $|z|^2 = 0$ so that by properties of norm, we must have $z = 0$ proving that $y = \alpha x$.

I am interested in approximating the distribution of $Y_n=\frac{X_1+\ldots+X_n}{\sqrt{n}\sigma}$ by the standard normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.  By Berry-Esseen Theorem we know that the total variation distance between the c.d.f. $F_n(x)$ of $Y_n$ and the c.d.f. $\Phi(x)$ of $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is upper-bounded as follows: $$\tag{1}|F_n(x)-\Phi(x)|\leq \frac{C\rho}{\sigma^3\sqrt{n}}$$ where $\rho=E[|X_i-\mu|^3]$ is the absolute third moment of $X_i$ and $C$ is a constant.

464446,"For $a > 0$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, show that $x \mapsto \frac{ax}{\sqrt{a^2 - |x|^2}}$ is smooth","Let $a > 0$, and set $B_a = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : |x|^2 < a \}$. Let $\phi : B_a \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be given by $\phi(x)  = \frac{ax}{\sqrt{a^2 - |x|^2}}$. Prove that $\phi$ is a diffeomorphism of $B_a$ onto $\mathbb{R}^n$. This problem is from Guillemin and Pollack's book on Differential Topology. I'm working through it as a self-study. It's clear that $\phi(x)$ is invertible, one can directly compute the inverse and find it to be $\phi^{-1}(y) = \frac{ay}{\sqrt{a^2 + |y|^2}}$ (check out this post: What is the inverse of the function $x \mapsto \frac{ax}{\sqrt{a^2 - |x|^2}}$? ).

Now, it's mostly obvious to me that each $\frac{ax_i}{\sqrt{a^2 - |x|^2}}$ is indeed smooth. Practically speaking, we should be able compute partial derivatives of this expression for as long as we like. We'd just have to use the quotient rule over and over, and we'd never have any singularities causing us trouble. But I'm looking for a more formal method for showing that $\phi$ is smooth. Any suggestions? Maybe there is a general technique/theorem for showing that ""nice"" component functions like these, which contain nothing more than fractions or radicals, are smooth?

464451,Understanding the right-exactness of the tensor product using *only* its universal property and the Yoneda lemma,"I would like to get an intuition for why $(-)\otimes N$ is right-exact using its universal property involving bilinear maps, not by appealing to higher-level observations such as ""left-adjoints preserve colimits"". The argument below is the best I could do towards this goal, but clearly it is in need of rigorization (if indeed something along these lines is correct). I have indicated two spots in the argument below that I would like to ask for detailed explanations of how to rigorize and/or fix. This is an attempt to re-ask an earlier question of mine , which apparently was easy to misinterpret. Basic idea: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. For any object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$, let $h^X:\mathcal{C}\to\mathsf{Set}$ be the covariant hom functor:
  $$h^X(Y):=\mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y),\qquad h^X\left(Y\xrightarrow{\;f\;}Z\right)=\mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)\xrightarrow{\;f\,\circ\, -\;}\mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Z)$$
  The Yoneda lemma implies that a natural transformation $\gamma:h^X\Rightarrow h^W$ must come from a morphism $g:W\to X$; that is, we must have that $\gamma_Y(k)=k\circ g$ for some such $g$. If $\gamma_Y$ is injective for all objects $Y$ of $\mathcal{C}$, the corresponding $g$ is an epimorphism (by definition). Let $A$ be a ring, and fix an $A$-module $N$. If an $A$-module map $\psi:M_1\to M_2$ is surjective, then $(\psi,\mathrm{id}_N):M_1\times N\to M_2\times N$ is surjective, so that for all $A$-modules $P$, the map
$$\mathrm{Hom}(M_2\otimes N,P)\underset{\text{natural}}{\cong}\mathrm{Bilin}(M_2,N;P)\xrightarrow{-\circ(\psi,\mathrm{id}_N)}\mathrm{Bilin}(M_1,N;P)\underset{\text{natural}}{\cong}\mathrm{Hom}(M_1\otimes N,P)$$ is injective. Therefore (?) the induced map $M_1\otimes_AN\to M_2\otimes_AN$ is an epimorphism, which is equivalent to being a surjection for $A$-modules. A short exact sequence
$$M_1\xrightarrow{\;\psi\;}M_2\xrightarrow{\;\rho\;} M_3\longrightarrow 0$$
is equivalent to having a surjective map $\rho:M_2\to M_3$ and a surjective map $\psi:M_1\to\ker(\rho)$. Because the functor $(-)\otimes_AN$ ""preserves surjectivity"", it must therefore (?) be right-exact.","['abstract-algebra', 'tensor-products', 'category-theory', 'exact-sequence', 'commutative-algebra']"

My approach was the following: By definition of the euclidean norm, we have that
$$|u+v|^2=\left\langle u+v,u+v\right\rangle=|u|^2+2\left\langle u,v\right\rangle+|v|^2,$$
but by hypothesis $|u+v|^2=(|u|+|v|)^2=|u|^2+2|u||v|+|v|^2$ so that equating those two we must have $\left\langle u,v\right\rangle = |u||v|$ and so $|\left\langle u,v\right\rangle| =|u||v|$ so that by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality there must be $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $v=\alpha u$. Since I've not shown that $\alpha \geq 0$ in this proof, I thought it was wrong, but the answer in the book gives the same proof and says that all of this implies $\alpha \geq 0$.

Indeed, if $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^2$ are simply $x=(1,1)$ and $y=(-2,-2)$ then $y=-2x$ and indeed $|\left\langle x,y\right\rangle| = |x||y|$, so by this example we see that Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality doesn't imply that the scalar that multiply one vector to get the other must be positive. So, how this $\alpha$ is shown to be greater or equal to zero? Thanks very much in advance! EDIT: I think I've found the answer. I've shown that $\left\langle u,v\right\rangle =|u||v|$ and thus $|\left\langle u,v\right\rangle| = |u||v|$ by Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality we must have $v=\alpha u$, but since $\alpha = \left\langle u,v\right\rangle /|u|^2$, since the inner product itself is a positive number (because it's a product of two norms), then $\alpha$ must be positive.

464553,Universal property of de Rham differential.,"Suppose $A$ is a commutative algebra over a field $k$. It is well known that there is a module that generalizes the notion of differential $1$-forms. It is denoted $\Omega^1_{k}(A)$ and is called the module of Kahler differentials. By definition, it is a module over $A$ generated by symbols $da,a\in A$ satisfying $dc=0$ if $c$ is ""constant"", i.e. $c\in k$ viewed as a subset of $A$. $d(a+b)=da+db$ $d(ab)=(da)b+a(db)$ $(da)b=b(da)$ There is also a map $d\colon A\to \Omega^1_{k}(A)$, $d(a):=da$ called the de Rham differential. It is well-known that $\Omega^1_{k}(A)$ and $d$ can be defined by a universal property. Recall first that a map $\phi\colon A\to M$ for some $A$-module $M$ is called a derivation of $A$ with values in $M$ if $\phi(ab)=\phi(a)b+\phi(b)a$. Then $\Omega^1_{k}(A)$ and $d$ are characterized by the property that for any derivation $X\colon A\to M$, there exists unique morphism $\mu_X\colon \Omega^1_{k}(A)\to M$ such that $X=\mu_x\circ d$. You can read all this in details here . My question is the following. Is there a similar universal description of the de Rham differential $d^1\colon \Omega^1_{k}(A)\to \Omega^2_{k}(A)$? What about $d^n\colon \Omega^n_{k}(A)\to \Omega^{n+1}_{k}(A)$? I would like to see a description like this: $d^1\colon \Omega^1_{k}(A)\to \Omega^2_{k}(A)$ is a map satisfying some properties, such that any other map $\Omega^1_{k}(A)\to M$ satisfying these properties factors through $d^1$.

464604,Bounds of $|f(z)|$ for specific z via Schwarz Lemma and the such,"I'm trying to brush up on some complex analysis for a qualifying exam. I'm quickly realizing that I have never done many applications of Schwarz. In particular I don't have much experience with those types of questions that ask to find a bound for $|f(z_0)|$ for some specified $z_0$. So my questions are (1) Can you suggest any texts, preferably accessible online, that gives examples of such problems with good explanations? (2) So far, in reviewing past quals, I have only come upon one of these questions, so I have only one example to illustrate the type of problem. I think I was able to solve it, but I was mostly fumbling through it, are there general ways to approach it that would be better? The question was, suppose that $f(z)$ is a holomorphic on $|z| <1$ and satisfies $|f(z)| < 1$ and $f(1/2)$ = 0. Use Schwarz Lemma to show that $|f(4/5)| \le 1/2$. I know that in general $\frac{a-z}{1-\bar{a}z}$ maps $a$ to $0$ and maps the unit disk to the unit disk. So $g(z) = f(\frac{1/2-z}{1-\bar{1/2}z})$ has $g(0)=0$. And for all $z$ s.t. $|z|<1$, since that above function maps the unit disk to the unit disk $\frac{1/2-z}{1-\bar{1/2}z} \in$ the unit disk. Thus $|g(z)| = |f(\frac{1/2-z}{1-\bar{1/2}z})| \le 1$. So Schwarz lemma applies to $g$ and we can conclude $|g(z)| \le |z|$. But $z = 1/2 \rightarrow \frac{1/2-z}{1-\bar{1/2}z}=4/5$ so the desired bound follows. Can you suggest better approaches?

464605,"""Coordinate functions"" on the structure-sheaf definition of a smooth manifold","I've been reading Bredon's Topology and Geometry recently; what an excellent book! He defines smooth manifolds in two distinct ways and then shows they are in fact equivalent. The ""non-standard"" definition is in terms of some sheaf-like ""functional structure $F_X$ "" on the underlying space $X$, satisfying the following properties: for every open set $U \subset X,$ we have $F_X(U)$ is a subalgebra of the algebra of continuous real-valued functions on $U$; $F_X(U)$ contains all constant functions; $V \subset U, f \in F_X(U) \implies f|_V \in F_X(V)$; $U = \bigcup U_{\alpha}$ and $f|_{U_{\alpha}} \in F_X(U_{\alpha})$ for all $\alpha \implies f \in F_X(U).$ A morphism of functionally structured spaces $(X,F_X) \rightarrow (Y,F_Y)$ is a map $\phi:X \rightarrow Y$ such that $f \mapsto f \circ \phi$ carries $F_Y(U)$ into $F_X(\phi^{-1}(U))$. Then a smooth $n$-manifold is a second countable, functionally structured, Hausdorff space $(M^n,F)$ which is locally isomorphic to $(\mathbb{R}^n,C^{\infty}).$ My question: to familiarize myself with the definition I have attempted the following exercise: Show that a second countable Hausdorff space $X$ with a functional structure $F$ is an $n$-manifold $\iff$ every point in $X$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that there are functions $f_1,\ldots,f_n \in F(U)$ such that a real-valued function $g$ on $U$ is in $F(U) \iff$ there exists a smooth function $h(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ of $n$ real variables such that $g(p) = h(f_1(p),\ldots,f_n(p))$ for every $p \in U.$ The only part that I haven't been able to complete is the ""$\Longleftarrow$"" direction. That is, given the $n$ ""coordinate functions"" $f_i$, and given a point $x \in X$ and a neighborhood $U \ni x$ I, have constructed a morphism $\phi:(U,F_U) \rightarrow (\phi(U),C^{\infty})$ via $\phi(x) = (f_1(x),\ldots,f_n(x)).$ But for the life of me, I don't see how I could show that this is actually an isomorphism.

Since we already know that $A$ has a least upper bound $\alpha$ and that $\alpha=b$, doesn't this mean that $b$ is in $A$ hence $f$ is bounded on every $x$ in $[a,b]$ including $x=b$?

There is $x_0$ in $A$ such that $b-\delta < x_0 < b$.Thus $f$ is bounded on $[a,x_0]$ and also on $[x_0,b]$, so $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$.

\det\left(\frac{\partial (x_j)_{j=1}^n}{\partial(r,(\phi_j)_{j=1}^{n-2},\theta)}\right)=r^{n-1}\prod_{j=1}^{n-2}\sin^{n-j-1}\phi_j.
\end{align*} While this result is “standard,” I have had a hard time proving it. Technically, the problem is that the Jacobian matrix of
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial (x_j)_{j=1}^n}{\partial(r,(\phi_j)_{j=1}^{n-2},\theta)}
\end{align*}
is a Hessenberg matrix: that is, it is “almost triangular,” but there is one extra diagonal set of nonzero elements just above the main diagonal. This makes computing the determinant directly extremely tedious. I tried induction and the Laplace expansion, too, to little avail. Are any of you familiar with the canonical proof of this result, or any standard reference? Thank you for your assistance in advance.","['differential-geometry', 'multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"

465390,Expectation of composition of functions with density as R-N derivative,"In prior probability courses, I've always seen and used the fact that, for a continuous random variable X and a function $\phi$, $E[\phi(X)]=\int_{ \mathbb{R}}\phi(x) f_X(x)dx,$ but I cannot find a rigorous statement of such a theorem listing all of the necessary assumptions on $X$ or $\phi$ in any of my probability references. I'm currently trying to reconcile my previous probability knowledge and what I've learned in my measure theory course, using Rudin's ""Real and Complex Analysis"" and would like to prove this result. My questions are: Is my understanding of the set up correct, and is the proof of my result below correct? Can the theorem below be strengthened? Theorem: Let $(X, \mathcal{M}, \mu)$ be a positive measure space with $\mu(X)=1$, and let $g \in L^1(\mu)$ be a real ""absolutely continuous"" function with density $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. If $\phi: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is absolutely continuous on $[a,b]$ for every $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\lim_{t \to -\infty} \phi(t)=0$ with $\phi' \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$, then
$$\int_X \phi \circ g d\mu = \int_{\mathbb{R}}\phi f dm.$$ SET UP: Define $F: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $F(x) = \mu(g \leq x)$, the distribution function of $g$. Keeping things general, let $F_-$ be the left continuous function agreeing with $F$ on all points of continuity (this function won't matter once absolute continuity is defined, but it is necessary in general). Define $\Lambda: C_c(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{C}$ by $\Lambda(h)=\int_{\mathbb{R}} h dF_-$ (the Riemann-Stieltjes integral). Since $F$ is bounded and monotone, $F \in BV$, so $\Lambda$ is well defined and forms a positive linear functional. The Riesz representation theorem implies the existance of a measure $F_*$ on $\mathbb{R}$ so that $F_-(b)-F_-(a) = F_*([a,b))$ for all real $a < b$. (as in Rudin's exercise 7.12). We say $g$ is ""absolutely continuous"" if $F_* << m$, in which case the density of $g$ is $f:= dF_*/dm.$  Note that if $g$ is absolutely continuous, it follows that $F_-=F.$ Proof I first show that $\int_X \phi \circ f d\mu=\int_{\mathbb{R}}\mu(g > t) \phi'(t)dt$, and the proof closely follows that of Rudin's theorem 8.16 about distribution functions. Define $E=\{(x,t): g(x) > t\} \subset X \times \mathbb{R}$, which Rudin argues is measurable for positive $g$, so taking the positive and negative parts of $g$ implies that $E$ is measurable. Also, observe that $\int_X \int_{\mathbb{R}} |\chi_E(x,t) \phi'(t)|dt d\mu(x) \leq \int_X ||\phi'||_{L^1(\mathbb{R})} d\mu < \infty.$ Therefore, Fubini's theorem implies that 
$$\int_{\mathbb{R}}\mu(g>t)\phi'(t)dt =\int_{\mathbb{R}}\int_X \chi_E(x,t)\phi'(t) d\mu(x) dt =\int_X \int_{\mathbb{R}} \chi_E(x,t) \phi'(t)dt d\mu(x) =$$ $$\int_X \int_{-\infty}^{g(x)} \phi'(t) dt d\mu(x) .$$ Since $\phi' \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$, the dominated convergence theorem and absolute continuity imply that this equals $\int_X \phi(g(x))-\phi(-\infty) d\mu(x)= \int_X \phi \circ g d\mu.$ Also, $$\int_{\mathbb{R}}\mu(g > t) \phi'(t)dt = \int_{\mathbb{R}}(1-F(t)) \phi'(t)dt = \int_{\mathbb{R}}\int_{t}^{\infty}f(x)\phi'(t)dx dt.$$ A similar argument as before implies that Fubini's theorem applies to this integral, and therefore
$$\int_X\phi \circ g d\mu= \int_{\mathbb{R}}\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(x) \phi'(t) dt dx = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x)(\phi(x)-\phi(-\infty))dx=\int_{\mathbb{R}}\phi f dm.$$ Note that the second to last equality holds again by the dominated convergence theorem, since $\phi$ is absolutely continuous and $\phi' \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$.","['measure-theory', 'random-variables', 'probability-theory', 'real-analysis', 'probability-distributions']"
465407,"Sufficient conditions for $M(X \times Y, Z)$ to be homeomorphic to $M(X, M(Y, Z))$","Let $Y^X$ denote the set of all functions $f: X \to Y$. If $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, let $M(X,Y)$ denote the set of all continuous maps $f: X \to Y$, endowed with the compact-open topology. Consider the functions $\varphi: Z^{X \times Y} \to (Z^Y)^X$ and $\psi: (Z^Y)^X \to Z^{X \times Y}$ defined by $\varphi(f)(x)(y) = f(x,y)$ and $\psi(g)(x,y) = g(x)(y)$, for all $f \in Z^{X \times Y}$, $g \in (Z^Y)^X$, $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$. Is easy to verify that $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are mutual inverse functions. In Aguilar's Algebraic Topology from a Homotopical Viewpoint , we find the following results: 1.3.1. Theorem . If $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are topological spaces with $Y$ Hausdorff and locally compact, then the image of $M(X \times Y, Z)$ under $\varphi$ is $M(X, M(Y,Z))$, whereas the image of $M(X, M(Y,Z))$ under $\psi$ is $M(X \times Y, Z)$. Therefore, the restrictions $\varphi \restriction M(X \times Y, Z)$ and $\psi \restriction M(X, M(Y,Z))$ are inverse bijections between $M(X \times Y, Z)$ and $M(X, M(Y,Z))$. 1.3.2. Theorem . If $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are topological spaces such that $X$ and $Y$ are Hausdorff and $Y$ is locally compact, then $\varphi \restriction M(X \times Y, Z)$ is a homeomorphism onto $M(X, M(Y,Z))$. My doubt is about the last theorem above. I cannot see in its proof where the condition of $X$ being Hausdorff come into play. Is this condition really important? Here is a picture showing this proof and its context in the book: To confuse me further, Dugundji's Topology presents the following: 5.3 Theorem (chapter XII). If $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are topological spaces with $Y$ Hausdorff locally compact and $X$, $Z$ arbitrary, then $\varphi \restriction M(X \times Y, Z)$ is a homeomorphism onto $M(X, M(Y,Z))$. I have adapted the terminology and notation in this statement, but the word ""arbitrary"" really appears there in the book. So, is the condition of $X$ being Hausdorff dispensable? Why did Aguilar et al. include this condition in the statement of Theorem 1.3.2?","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"
