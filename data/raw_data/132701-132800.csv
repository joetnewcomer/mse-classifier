2079172,Functional analysis proof of Ramanujan's Master Theorem,"According to mathworld , Ramanujan's master theorem is the statement that if $$f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\phi(k) (-z)^k}{k!}$$ for some function (analytic or integrable) $\phi$, then $$\int_0^{\infty} x^{n-1} f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = \Gamma(n) \phi(-n).$$ As written it is obviously false as the values of an (analytic or integrable) function $\phi$ at natural numbers do not determine its values anywhere else. However it turns out that $$\int_0^{\infty} x^{s-1} f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = \Gamma(s) \phi(-s)$$ for arbitrary $s$ under growth conditions on $\phi$. Recently I came across an elementary ""proof"": if $T$ denotes the shift operator $T\phi(s) := \phi(s+1),$ then we can write $$f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-z)^kT^k \phi(0)}{k!} = e^{-zT}\phi (0)$$ such that $$\int_0^{\infty} x^{n-1} f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = \int_0^{\infty} x^{n-1} e^{-xT} \phi(0) \, \mathrm{d}x = \Gamma(n) T^{-n}\phi(0) = \Gamma(n) \phi(-n),$$ by plugging $T$ into the Gamma integral $$\int_0^{\infty} x^{n-1} e^{-xs} \, \mathrm{d}x = \Gamma(n) s^{-n}.$$ I am curious whether this argument can be made rigorous with functional analysis on an appropriate function space (which necessarily would have to have some growth conditions).","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'operator-theory', 'gamma-function']"

2079276,What are the mathematical foundations of the renormalisation group?,"Briefly, RG refers to mathematical tools that allows systematic investigation of the changes of a physical system as viewed at different distance scales. These methods are very important in quantum field theory and statistical mechanics. I'm currently taking a statistical physics course so I'm very curious about this. Sarada Rajeev , a physicist at the University of Rochester, says that 'a new integral calculus of functions of an infinite number of variables is needed' in order to give these methods a rigorous mathematical foundation. Update : In a correspondence where I was discussing how this would be different from variational calculus, I got the following reply from Professor Rajeev, Variational calculus is the differential calculus of an infinite
  number of variables: paths. The corresponding integral calculus is the
  ""path integral"" one pioneered by Weiner and Feynman. Although we have
  the theory of integration over paths ( the space of functions of one
  variable  (good enough for Stochastic ODEs and Quantum Mechanics) we
  do not have it for for fields (functions of several variables).
  Renormalization theory gives us hints on when such a theory is likely
  to exist. Constructing it would be at least as important as the
  discovery of Lebesgue integration. This statement by professor Rajeev is very interesting as it highlights the importance of such mathematical foundations(to him and many other mathematical physicists).","['quantum-field-theory', 'reference-request', 'integration', 'mathematical-physics']"
2079278,A slight strengthening of Iwasawa's criterion,"Iwasawa's criterion can be stated in the two following forms : 1° Let $G$ be a perfect group acting faithfully and primitively on a set $X$ with a least two elements. Assume that there exists an element $x$ of $X$ such that the stabilizer $G_{x}$ of $x$ has an abelian subgroup $A$ which is normal in $G_{x}$  and such that the conjugates of $A$ in $G$ generate $G$. Then $G$ is simple. 2° Let $G$ be a perfect group acting primitively on a set $X$ with a least two elements. Assume that there exists an element $x$ of $X$ such that the stabilizer $G_{x}$ of $x$ has an abelian subgroup $A$ which is normal in $G_{x}$  and such that the conjugates of $A$ in $G$ generate $G$. Then the quotient of $G$ by the kernel of the action of $G$ on $X$ is simple. By use of Iwasawa's criterion, one can prove the following statement : 3° if $n$ is a natural number $\geq 2$, if $F$ is a field, if we don't have simultaneously $n = 2$ and $\vert F \vert \leq 3$, then $PSL(n, F)$ is simple. Statement 3° can also be deduced from the following theorem : 4° if $n$ is a natural number $\geq 2$, if $F$ is a field, if we don't have simultaneously $n = 2$ and $\vert F \vert \leq 3$, if $L$ is a normal subgroup of $SL(n, F)$ not contained in the center of $SL(n, F)$, then $L = SL(n, F)$. If I'm not wrong, 4° cannot be obained as a straightforward consequence of 3°, thus 4° is ""stronger"" than 3°. Robinson, A Course in the Theory of Groups, 2d edition, p. 74-78, gives a proof of 4° which doesn't rely on Iwasawa's criterion (and not even on group actions) but which involves many calculations difficult to memorize. In fact, analyzing the manner in which 3° is deduced from Iwasawa's criterion in Rotman, 4th edition, 1999, p. 279, one sees that 4° can be easily deduced from the following strengthening of Iwasawa's criterion : 5°  Let $G$ be a perfect group acting primitively on a set $X$. Assume that there exists an element $x$ of $X$ such that the stabilizer $G_{x}$ of $x$ has an abelian subgroup $A$ which is normal in $G_{x}$  and such that the conjugates of $A$ in $G$ generate $G$. If $L$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ not contained in the kernel of the action of $G$ on $X$, then $L = G$. This strengthening of Iwasawa's criterion can be proved by a straightforward extension of the proof of Iwasawa's criterion given in Rotman, p. 263-264. My question is : do you know a reference to the literature for the strengthening of Iwasawa's criterion (i.e. for 5°) ?  Thanks in advance. Edit (2 January 2017) Here is a sketch of the proof of statement 5°. Lemma 1. Let $G$ be a group acting primitively on a set $X$, let $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$ not contained in the kernel of this action. Then the action of $H$ on $X$ is transitive. Proof. Easy extension of the proof of Rotman, 4th edition, 1999, theor. 9.17, (i), p. 258. Our Lemma 1 can also be deduced from this theorem by considering the associated faithful action. Lemma 2. Let $G$ be a group, let $H$ and $S$ be subgroups of $G$ such that $G = HS$. If $K$ is a normal subgroup of $S$ whose conjugates in $G$ generate $G$, then $G$ is generated by $H$ and $K$. If in addition $H$ is normal in $G$ and $K$ abelian, then $H$ contains the commutator subgroup of $G$. Proof. Implicitly in Rotman, proof of theor. 9.27, p. 263-264. Proof of 5°. By Lemma 1, the action of $L$ on $X$ is transitive. By the generalized Fattini argument (Rotman, exerc.  4.9 (i), p. 81), $G = L G_{x}$, where $x$ is as in the hypothesis of 5°. By hypothesis of 5°,  $G_{x}$ contains an abelian subgroup $A$, normal in  $G_{x}$ and such that the conjugates of $A$ in $G$ generate $G$. Thus, by Lemma 2, $L$ contains the commutator subgroup of $G$. But $G$ is assumed to be perfect, thus the commutator subgroup of $G$ is the whole $G$, thus $L = G$.

2079311,Equivalence of definitions for $L_\infty$ norm via essential range and essential supremum,"I have the following two norms for mesurable complex valued functions $f \colon X\to \mathbb{C}$: $$\|f \|_1 := \inf \big\{ c \geq 0 \colon \mu (\{ x \in X \colon |f(x)| > c \}) = 0 \big\}$$
and
$$\|f\|_2 := \sup \big\{ |\lambda| \colon \lambda \in r_{\mathrm{ess}}(f)\big\},$$
where
$$
r_{\mathrm{ess}}(f) := \big\{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} \colon \forall \varepsilon > 0: \mu(f^{-1}(B_\varepsilon(\lambda)) > 0 \big\},$$
where $B_\varepsilon(\lambda)$ denotes the open ball with radius $\varepsilon$ centered at $\lambda$. It is easy to show, that $\|f\|_2 \leq \|f\|_1$ but I have not been able to prove the converse. Any suggestions? I think the problem boils down to showing that $\mu\big(\;f^{-1}(\mathbb{C} \setminus r_{\mathrm{ess}}(f))\big) = 0$. EDIT One possible proof could be like this: We exhaust the set $S := \mathbb{C}  \setminus \overline{ B_{\|f\|_2}(0)}$ in two steps: 
First for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$ by annuli
$$
S_{m,n} := S_{\|f\|_2 + \frac{1}{m}, \|f\|_2 + n} := \bigg\{ \lambda \in \mathbb{C} \colon \|f\|_2 + \frac{1}{m} \leq |\lambda | \leq \|f\|_2 + n\bigg\}
$$
with $\mu(f^{-1}(S_{m,n})) = 0$, i.e. for
$$
S_m := \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} S_{m,n}
$$
we get  $\mu(f^{-1}(S_{m}))  = 0$. Secondly, by considering
$$
S = \bigcup_{m \in \mathbb{N}} S_{m}
$$
we show the claim. Proof .
Let $m,n$ be given. 
Then, for all $\lambda \in S_{m,n}$ there exists $\varepsilon_\lambda > 0$ such that 
$$\mu\bigg(\big\{f^{-1}\big(B_{\varepsilon_\lambda}(\lambda)\big)\big\}\bigg) = 0.$$ But $S_{m,n}$ is compact, i.e. we get $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_k$ such that
$$
S_{m,n} \subseteq \bigcup_{i = 1,\dots,k} B_{\varepsilon_{\lambda_i}}
(\lambda_i).
$$
Hence (assuming completeness of $\mu$) we have that $f^{-1}(S_{m,n})$ is a set of measure zero, as well as the countable union of all $S_{m,n}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
So, for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$ the sets $f^{-1}(S_m)$ are of measure zero and the fact that $S = \bigcup_{m \in \mathbb{N}}$ gives the claim: We have
$$\mu (\{ x \in X \colon |f(x)| > \|f\|_2 \}) = 0$$
i.e.
$\|f\|_2 \geq \|f\|_1$. $\square$ What do you think?","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"

F_\delta(x)=\sup_{h\in(0,\delta)\cap\mathbb{Q}}\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}.

2079446,Connection Between the Traditional Equation of a Line ($y = mx + c$) and the Vector Equation of a Line,"My textbook says, ""... an equation of the line through $A$ and $B$ is $x = u + tw = u + t(v — u)$, where $t$ is a real number and $x$ denotes an arbitrary point on the line. An illustration of this is shown below: Since $x = u + tw$ is the equation of a line, I presume that it is equivalent to the equation $y = mx + c$, where $m$ is the slope, $x$ is the x-intercept (when $y = 0$), and $c$ is the $y-$intercept (when $x = 0$). 
Therefore, in the equation $x = u + tw$, $w$ must represent the $x-$intercept $($when $x = 0), u$ must represent the y-intercept (when $w = 0$), and $t$ must represent the slope. It is clear that there is a connection between the traditional equation of a line, $y = mx + c$, and the vector equation of a line, $x = u + tw = u + t(v — u)$. However, I am struggling to clearly understand the connection between the vectors and the traditional equation: How can these vectors represent slope ($m$)? How can these vectors represent x- and y-intercepts? When I look at the diagram and the vector equations of a line, there does not seem to be a clear indication of how they relate to the cartesian illustration of the traditional equation of a line ($y = mx + c$). For instance, the vectors $w$ and $u$ in $x = u + tw$ would represent the $x$ and $y$ intercepts; But how can a vector represent the $x$ or $y$ intercepts? This makes no sense to me. To provide further context, take the vector equation of a line $x = (-2,0.1)-t(6,5,2)$. In this case, $(-2,0.1) = u$ and $(6,5,2) = w$; But in what way do the vectors $u$ and $w$ represent $y$ and $x$ intercepts? This is not clear to me. I would greatly appreciate it if the knowledgeable members of MSE could please take the time to clarify the connection between these two forms of a line.

2079712,Numerical stability of Winograd short convolution algorithm,"Similar to how Strassen matrix multiplication is an asymptotically faster matrix-multiplication algorithm, there exists a similar idea for convolution by (short) filters called Winograd convolution [1,2] that lowers the number of multiplications required below that of the naive, direct-form convolution. To do this, Winograd convolution uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem over polynomials to convert real-valued data and filters to a real-valued transform space, pointwise multiplies, then transforms back the output. The FFT convolution does something similar but uses Fourier space and complex numbers. It is worth noting at this point that like the FFT, Winograd convolution is linear and ""correct"" (if a convolution using these algorithms were symbolically performed, the exactly correct result, and not a mere approximation, would be obtained). And yet, a properly implemented FFT is numerically stable, while Winograd convolution acquires hideous roundoff errors. I've attempted to determine empirically using Numpy where, if anywhere, I could perform the steps for Winograd convolution (6, 3) (See [2]: indicates 6 outputs, 3 filter taps) in reduced precision while still maintaining high output precision. I used random, normally-distributed inputs and filter taps, and the $A, B, G$ matrices suggested by the authors on Github for NNPACK [3]. The answer was, nowhere : If IEEE 754-2008 float (23+1 bit mantissa) is used throughout, the output appears to have around 12 bits precision. If double (52+1 bit mantissa) is used throughout, the output appears to have about 25 bits precision. If I cheap out and use float anywhere in the double -precision evaluation, I get 12 bits precision. So my question is, Why does Winograd convolution halve the precision of the computation? Because of Winograd's (and FFT's) linearity and correctness, I don't know how to isolate what causes the numerical instability in Winograd. Whatever the input and filters, both algorithms nominally give 0 error, and the perturbation in the outputs is linear in the perturbations at the inputs and filters; Yet Winograd halves precision and FFT does not. I would love it if any answer could address how numerical analysts go about proving error bounds due to roundoff in such linear, ""correct"" algorithms.

2080896,What is the relationship between big O notation and the limits of functions?,"Say we have two functions: $f(n) = n$ and $g(n) = 2n$. $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n}{2n} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$$ Therefore, according to the answer here , function $g(n)$ grows faster than $f(n)$ because: $$0 \leq \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} < 1$$ But with big O notation: $f(n) = O(n)$ and $g(n) = O(n)$ Which means that both functions grow at the same rate (in an apparently different magnitude). I realise that this is only happening because the coefficient of the largest term is ignored with big O notation but I want to know if you can use limits to give information about the big O notation of a function and vice versa because I find some of this terminology and these concepts hard to differentiate.

2080930,Generalized Taylor derivatives test,"I am seeking for a proof of the generalized derivative test to find inflection points, minima and maxima.
I am seeking for a proof that I read some time ago but can't find anymore. The thesis was that if the first derivative in a point is zero, and also the second derivative is zero, then you have to continue the derivation until you get an n-th derivative with a non-zero value. If that derivative is of an even order, then you have to check if it is positive or negative and subsequently you deduct that it is a minimum or a maximum. If the order of the derivative is odd then it is an inflection point.
The proof used the Taylor formula.
I am sure it is a well known subject and that many questions were asked about this, but I can't find a rigorous complete proof, I found only descriptive talks.

I will write $P$ for the set of all positive prime numbers. Question: If $\phi$ is Euler's Phi Function, we want to find all $n \in \mathbb{Z^+}$ such that $\phi(n)=4$ . Answer: Let $n=p_1^{n_1}\dotsb p_k^{n_k}\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ be the factorisation of $n$ in to primes. Then $$\phi(n)=p_1^{n_1-1} \dotsb p_k^{n_k-1}(p_1-1) \dotsb (p_k-1)=4.$$ So, for any $i \in \{1,2,\cdots,k\}$ we have $p_i-1|4$ . Hence, $$p_i-1\in\{1,2,4\} \iff p_i\in \{2,3,5\} \subset P.$$ Now, we can see the primes that $n$ contains: $n=2^{n_1}3^{n_2}5^{n_3}$ , where $n_1,n_2,n_3 \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ . So, \begin{align*}
\phi(2^{n_1}3^{n_2}5^{n_3})=4 \iff \phi(2^{n_1})\phi(3^{n_2})\phi(5^{n_3})=4  \tag{$*$}
\end{align*} The possible cases for $n_i$ are: $n_1=1,2,3\implies \phi(2)=1,\phi(2^2)=2, \phi(2^3)=4$ respectively $n_2=1 \implies \phi(3)=2$ $n_3=1 \implies \phi(5)=4$ All the posible combinations for the relation $(*)$ are $\phi(5)$ , $\phi(5)\phi(2)$ , $\phi(3)\phi(2^2)$ , $\phi(2^3)$ .

I take the usual affine charts $ u = 1, v = 1, t = 1$ . In the first chart with coordinates $(x,v,t)$ , the equations become $z = xt, y = xv$ so $x^2(1+v^2) = x^2t^2$ .

2081063,Determining expected number of rounds,"I'm trying to determine a formulation for the expected number of rounds for a game of chance based on dice.

For each round each player will roll their die once The mean of the rolls is determined Any player that rolled a value less than the mean is eliminated from the game The rounds are repeated until their is only player left. My question is how does one determined the expected number of round in terms of $N$. My thinking is that for any round the expectation is that half of the players will be eliminated. This leads to a continuous halving of the number of players, which seems to suggest that $\text{E}(\text{Rounds}) \approx \log_2 {N}$, or specifically: $$ \lim_{N \to \infty}  \text{E}(\text{Rounds}) =\log_2 {N} $$ I wasn't able to formulate a definitive relation, so I ran a simple monte-carlo of the game, for numbers of players ranging from 2 players to 200 players, one million simulations per game size.

In the $z^{-1}C_{G}(Y)z \subset C_{G}(z^{-1}Yz)$  direction, let $w \in z^{-1} C_{G}(Y) z$. Then, $z^{-1}(wy)z = z^{-1}(yw)z$,  $\forall y \in Y$.

Multiplying both sides of  $z^{-1}(wy)z = z^{-1}(yw)z$ by things isn't getting me anywhere, and I am a loss at what to try next. Sometimes these proofs involve clever little tricks I wouldn't have thought of, and so I am asking whether I am missing something here, and if so (and even if not!) how I should proceed.

2081200,Intuition of a tangent vector being a line segment in the context of integration,"Following my previous question on the meaning of dx , and my read on A geometric approach of differential forms , I was trying to work out the intuition on paper. tldr of the post : $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ the tangent vector can be thought as a line segment. $dx$ can be though as evaluating the length of a vector (i.e line segment) and takes the value 1 on the basis vector. So let's say we want to generalize integration on manifolds, in the nice case of a Riemannian manifold with euclidean structure, we chop the coordinates axis, evaluate the volume of the little pieces and multiply that by the value of the function. So for the 1D case :
\begin{align}
\sum f(x_i)\Delta_i 
\end{align} with $\Delta_i = x_{i+1} - x_i$. The integral is taken by taking the limit when $\Delta_i \rightarrow 0$
This is pretty intuitive and geometric. So on a manifold (let's say we are working on a local patch and do not worry of partition of unity etc...) we have no way to chop up the manifold into little pieces to compute the volume. So we decide to approximate the manifold by a linear space known as the Tangent space $T_pM$. Elements of $T_pM$ are vectors which are directional derivative operators. I know that when you take the directional derivative of a function you find the linear approximation of the function. So I do not understand why $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ would be this object since no function are involve. I understand the object $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ as a basis vector of the Tangent space, but not as a representative of the linear approximation of the manifold. This is my number (1) issue. Let's say now that elements of the tangent space are indeed locally (using an euclidean structure which is always possible on a manifold locally ) represent line segments. Then we have no notion of length in $T_pM$ so we introduce differential forms that eat a Vector and spit out a number. We call this number the ""length"" of the vector. This work out good because everything is linear as we expect. Just the value is completely arbitrary (but at least is consistent with addition and scaling). So looking at the littles $\Delta_i$ from the beginning we can replace them by $\omega(X_i)$ where $\omega$ is a volume form and $X_i$ a Tangent vector at the point $i$. This way we form the sum : \begin{align}
\sum f(x_i)\omega(X_i)
\end{align} We can incorporate the function f with the volume form to form a differential 1 form (using $dx$ as basis) and we have : \begin{align}
\sum f(x_i)dx_i(X_i)
\end{align} Now comes my number (2) issue. I know that $dx_i(X_i) = 1$ by definition, but the goal of the Rieamann sum is to make something goes to 0 to have a better and better approximation of the sum. So My guess is that $dx_i(X_i)$ has to go to $0$. So here is my way to do it. We can multiply $X_i$ by $\frac{1}{n}$ and make $n\rightarrow \infty$. So : \begin{align}
\sum f(x_i)dx_i(\frac{1}{n}X_i) = \sum \frac{1}{n}f(x_i)dx_i(X_i)
\end{align} Now this last expression os attractive but I do not know how to proceed. We can always cancel $dx_i(X_i) = 1$ but then we are left with what seems to be ill-defined under change of coordinates. So to sum up : Why $X_p \in T_p M$ can be seen as a line element ? It is an operator and when we plug in a function, it is the best linear approximation of the function at $p$. How come we can interpret it as being the best linear approximation of the manifold ( also supported by the drawing of an arrow attached to $p$ pointing in the Tangent direction of the manifold ) How to derive a well defined Riemann sum for arbitrary manifold (since we can't integrate function on manifold) and how all of this fits together (intuition of volume, differential forms, and integration using Sums) I appreciate any suggestions / references !","['reference-request', 'integration', 'differential-geometry', 'riemann-sum']"

The only zero of $x$ is the point $(0,0)$ (as $x=0$ immediately gives $y=0$).

Furthermore, $N_{\overline{B(n,1/2)\cap X}}(\epsilon_n)$ is obviously a neighborhood of each of its points, so it is open in $X\cup \epsilon(X)$. Hence, from the resulting open cover of $X\cup \epsilon(X)$ cannot be extracted a finite subcover, because it would have just a finite amount of $N_{\overline{B(n,1/2)\cap X}}(\epsilon_n)$, and hence it would include just a finite amount of ends, while $\epsilon(X)$ is infinite.

2081325,Real-valued Expected Value Probability Question,"I'm stuck on answering a problem in the famous Berteskas & Tsitsiklis probability book: The premise Imagine a TV game show where each contestant i spins an infinitely
  calibrated wheel of fortune, which assigns him/her with some real number with a
  value between 1 and 100. All values are equally likely and the value obtained by each
  contestant is independent of the value obtained by any other contestant. Let N be the integer-valued random variable whose value is the index of the first
  contestant who is assigned a smaller number than contestant 1. As an illustration,
  if contestant 1 obtains a smaller value than contestants 2 and 3 but contestant 4
  has a smaller value than contestant 1 (X4 < X1), then N = 4. Find P(N > n)
  as a function of n. What I did for the first part, finding $P(N > n)$, I saw that it was a geometric distribution, with the chance that a number is larger than a given $n$, is $(100-n)/99$, since the random variable of the wheel # is uniformly distributed. Thus, for the given geometric distribution, if we want $N$-th roll to be the roll where the number is first lesser than the 1st roll , we must give the following probability: $P(N \gt n) = ((100-n)/99)^{N-1} ((n-1)/99)$
Which is effectively saying we want the first $N-1$ rolls to be greater than the first roll, and the last one to be the complement, or:$1-(100-n)/99 = (n-1)/99$. So now that we have this, assuming it's correct, I'm stuck on the following: Find E[N], assuming an infinite number of contestants. I know that the expected value formula is the following: $ sum_{x=2}^{\infty} xp_x(x)$ where x is the index of the contestant. However, the contestant's probability also relies on the value of the initial value of the first spin. Is the next logical step to decompose into a double sum and evaluate that? Or is it something completely different?","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'statistics']"

If the Hilbert polynomial is known, what relations must the  $f_i$ satisfy? Can we get $n$ independent equations? I know that the Hilbert series determines these degrees, but we lose information when passing to the Hilbert polynomial. I am trying to argue by Grobner degeneration to an initial ideal: the hilbert polynomial doesn't change, but I'm not sure if the degeneration is still a complete intersection and moreover if we can get a generating set for the initial ideal from the leading terms of a generating set - though if it is the case then one knows the degrees of the hypersurfaces from their initial ideals. If it is, then one just needs to argue for the case of monomial ideals. This case is also not obvious, so maybe one can find a counter example among monomial ideals.

homotopic to a proper smooth map between said manifolds. Let $M$ and $N$ be the manifolds with $F:M \to N$ a proper continuous map.  Since $F$ is continuous we automatically have the Whitney Approximation theorem: we can embed $N \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n$ and that $F$ is $\delta$ -close to a smooth map $\widetilde{F}: M \to \mathbb{R}^n$ .  Because $\widetilde{F}(M)$ can fit into some tubular neighborhood $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ of $N$ , we have there is a mapping $r: U \to N$ which is a retraction and a submersion into $N$ .  We can then take our homotopy to be $H: M\times [0,1] \to N$ given by $$
H(x,t) \;\; =\;\; r \left ( (1-t) F(x) + t\widetilde{F}(x) \right ).
$$ The theorem shows that $F$ is homotopic to a smooth map $r\circ \widetilde{F}$ , but we want to show that $r\circ\widetilde{F}$ is proper . I'm somewhat lost as to proof strategies and need some help.  Lee hints that we need to show that $\tilde{F}$ is proper, and hopefully $r$ can easily show to be proper.  Where I'm getting stuck is in picking an arbitrary $K \subseteq N$ which is compact; how do we show $\widetilde{F}^{-1}(K)$ is compact as well?  I think we can pick a sequence in $\widetilde{F}^{-1}(K)$ and find a convergent subsequence.  Somewhere in there I'm assuming we need to use the fact that $||F(x) - \widetilde{F}(x)|| < \delta(x)$ for all $x \in M$ , given $\delta:M \to \mathbb{R}_+$ . Any help is appreciated on this.
