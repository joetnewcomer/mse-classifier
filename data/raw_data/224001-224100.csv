4609001,Definition about probability mass function by Rober V. Hogg,"The following definition of pmf is on page51 from Probability and statistical inference by Robert V. Hogg, etc. The pmf $f(x)$ of a discrete random variable X is a function that satisfies the following properties: (a) $f(x)\gt 0, x\in S;$ (b) $\sum_{x\in S}f(x)=1;$ (c) $P(X\in A)=\sum_{x\in A}f(x),$ where $A\subset S$ . My question is about part(c). X is a random variable, and A is a subset of sample space S, how can $X\in A$ . Moreover, how can ${x\in A}$ ? In my opinion, the LHS of part(c) just means that we want to compute the probability of a single event, and the RHS of part(c) just means that we sum up all the related possibilities that we need. For example, if X: numbers of the sum of a fair six-side dice. Then P(X=3)=P({(1,2),(2,1)})=1/36+1/36=2/36, where A is a subset of S. Am I right? And could someone explain more about part(c)? It's better if someone can give me an example.","['statistical-inference', 'statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"
4609011,"For a finite extension $K/\mathbb{Q}_2$, the extension $K(\sqrt{-1})/K$ is always totally ramified","Let $K$ be a finite extension of the $2$ -adic numbers $\mathbb{Q}_2$ , and suppose that $-1$ is not square in $K$ . Write $K(i)$ for the quadratic extension $K[X]/(X^2 + 1)$ , where $i^2 = -1$ . Is it true that $K(i)/K$ is always a totally ramified extension? If so, how do you prove it? My attempt My first idea was to find an Eisenstein polynomial defining the extension. The element $i$ has minimal polynomial $f(X) = X^2 + 1$ over $K$ , so I wanted to find $a \in K$ such that $f(X + a) = x^2 + 2aX + a^2 + 1$ is Eisenstein. This is equivalent to having $v_K(a^2 + 1) = 1$ . The existence of such an $a$ is equivalent to there being some unit $u \in \mathcal{O}_K^\times$ such that $a^2 = u\pi_K - 1$ , so we need $u\pi_K - 1$ to be square for some unit $u$ . I am unsure how to show that such a $u$ always exists. Another idea is to consider the unique unramified quadratic extension of $K$ , and show that it does not contain a square root of $-1$ . I know that an unramified extension is always obtained by adjoining an $m^\mathrm{th}$ root of unity for $(m,p) =1 $ , but I don't know how to show that $-1$ won't be square in that extension.","['local-field', 'number-theory', 'p-adic-number-theory', 'ramification']"
4609026,Evaluate $\int \frac{\sqrt{1+x^4}}{1-x^4}dx$,"How to evaluate $$\int \frac{\sqrt{1+x^4}}{1-x^4}dx.$$ If we substitute $x=\sqrt{\tan{\theta}}$ , it becomes $$\int \frac{1}{2\cos{\theta}\cos{2\theta}\sqrt{\tan{\theta}}}d\theta.$$ What can I do next ? Edit Are these steps correct ? $$=\int \frac{1}{2\cos{\theta}\cos{2\theta}\sqrt{\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}}}d\theta$$ $$=\int \frac{1}{2\cos{2\theta}\sqrt{\cos^2 \theta\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}}}d\theta$$ $$=\int \frac{1}{2\cos{2\theta}\sqrt{\cos^2 \theta\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}}}d\theta$$ $$=\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\cos{2\theta}\sqrt{\sin{2 \theta}}}d\theta$$ Now If we substitute $t=\sin{2\theta}$ , it becomes $$=\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}(1-t^2)\sqrt{t}}dt$$ $$=\int \frac{\frac{1}{t^2}}{\sqrt{2}\frac{(1-t^2)}{t}\sqrt{\frac{t}{t^2}}}dt$$ $$=\int \frac{\frac{1}{t^2}}{\sqrt{2}(\frac{1}{t} -t)\sqrt{\frac{1}{t}}}dt$$ Now If we substitute $u^2=\frac{1}{t}$ , it becomes $$=\int \frac{-2u}{\sqrt{2}(u^2 -\frac{1}{u^2})u}du$$ $$=\int \frac{-u^2}{\sqrt{2}(u^4 -1^2)}du$$ $$=\int \frac{-u^2}{\sqrt{2}(u^2 +1)(u^2-1)}du$$ $$=-\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\int \frac{u^2+1+u^2-1}{(u^2 +1)(u^2-1)}du$$ This can be solved easily now and we will get an elementary solution. But Wolfram alpha gives a solution in non elementary functions. Therefore I am confused. I guess the above solution is correct only for some restricted values of x.","['integration', 'indefinite-integrals']"
4609028,Derivation of entropy inequality for scalar conservation laws from viscous equation - discontinuous or infinite integrand,"I am self-studying Numerical Methods for Conservation Laws by LeVeque. I have a question about the derivation of the entropy inequality for the convex scalar conservation law $$
u_t+f(u)_x=0\tag{1}
$$ which allows us to select unique weak solutions. I am sure that my question has been answered somewhere on stack exchange, but I haven't been able to express the mathematical verbiage that would allow me to find it. Background Let $\eta(u)$ be our ""entropy"" function which satisfies a conservation law of the form $$
\eta(u)_t+\psi(u)_x=0
$$ where $\psi(u)$ is some ""entropy flux"" function. Assume that both $\eta(u)$ and $\psi(u)$ are convex. Multiplying (1) by $\eta'(u)$ , we have $$
\eta'(u)u_t+\eta'(u)f'(u)u_x=0
$$ from which we infer $\psi'(u)=\eta'(u)f'(u)$ . Since we care about weak solutions admitting initial data with discontinuities in $u$ , we consider the viscous equation for (1) as $\epsilon \to 0$ . $$
u_t+f(u)_x=\epsilon u_{xx}
$$ From which we can write $$
\eta(u)_t+\psi(u)_x=\epsilon\eta'(u)u_{xx}
$$ Manipulating the right-hand side, we have $$
\eta(u)_t+\psi(u)_x=\epsilon(\eta'(u)u_x)_x-\epsilon \eta''(u)u_x^2
$$ Now, consider a rectangle $[x_1,x_2] \times [t_1,t_2]$ where $u(x,t)$ has some discontinuity in the limiting solution as $\epsilon \to 0$ . $$
\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \eta(u)_t+\psi(u)_x dxdt = \epsilon \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\int_{x_1}^{x_2} (\eta'(u)u_x)_x dxdt -\epsilon \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \eta''(u)u_x^2 dxdt
$$ LeVeque writes As $\epsilon \to 0$ , the first term on the right hand side vanishes. (This is clearly true if $u$ is smooth at $x_1$ and $x_2$ , and can be shown more generally.) The other term, however, involves integrating $u_x^2$ over $[x_1,x_2] \times [t_1,t_2]$ . If the limiting weak solution is discontinuous along a curve in this rectangle, then this term will not vanish in the limit. The entropy condition for weak solutions $$
\eta(u)_t+\psi(u)_x\leq 0
$$ follows. Question Can you help me understand why $$
\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\left[\epsilon \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\int_{x_1}^{x_2} (\eta'(u)u_x)_x dxdt\right]=0
$$ but $$
\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\left[\epsilon \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \eta''(u)u_x^2 dxdt\right]\neq 0

4609029,Criterion on a region to be a triangle in the three dimensional space.,"Given the real numbers $a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,c_1,c_2\in [0,1]$ .

Let $V\subset [-1,1]$ be the set of points whose image has its first return in $\Sigma$ .. We define the real function $f:V\to (-1,1)$ as follows $v\in (-1,1)$ is carried by $\sigma$ to $\sigma(v )\in\Sigma$ then the first return to $\Sigma$ from $\sigma(v)\in\Sigma$ is $\varphi(t_{\sigma(v)},\sigma(v))$ now it we return to $(-1,1)$ by $\sigma^{-1}$ .

f(x)=\ln(x)\qquad\textrm{ and }\qquad g(x)=1, 0\leqslant x\leqslant e.
$$ To this end, I first determined that $A=e-1$ , because $B=\int_{1}^e\ln(x)\, dx=1$ . Hence $C=A+B=e$ . Now, the $x$ -coordinate $x_c^C$ of the centroid of $C$ , which is a rectangle satisfies $$
x_c^C=\frac{(x_c^A\cdot A)+(x_c^B\cdot B)}{C}=\frac{e}{2}.

x_c^B=\frac{1}{B}\int_1^e x\ln x\, dx=\frac{1}{4}(e^2+1),

4609152,How would one go about integrating $\int x^2y'dx$ ?? - Implicit Integration??,"My friend and I are attempting to do some crazy integral stuff which he came up with but I am still having trouble getting my head around, but here's the general gist of what he is trying to get at: Propose we have a function: $f(x)={\sqrt{x}}$ . This of course is easy enough to integrate in of itself but what we're trying to figure out is if we make it so ${y^2}=x$ then integrate both sides of the function, can we still get the same answer. Here's how he computed it: $y^2=x$ $y^2y'=xy'$ $\int y^2y'dx=\int xy'dx$ The $\int y^2y'dx$ can be solved using u-substitution because recall that y is a function with respect to x rather than a constant. Additionally, the $\int xy' dx$ can be solved using integration by parts where one can arrive at $\int xy'dx=xy-\int y dx$ note how that $\int ydx = Y$ so now we have: $\frac{1}{3}y^3=xy-Y$ Now we solve for $Y$ : $Y=xy-\frac{1}{3}y^3$ $Y=\frac{2}{3}y^3$ This is the correct answer, but it's just in terms of y, substituting $y=\sqrt{x}$ into the equation, we arrive at: $Y=\frac{2}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}}$ which is the correct answer if we'd just used the power rule of integrals. Now that was just an example to see if it worked the true problem arrises from when we take a new line, notably: $x^2+y^2=1$ and ""implicitly integrate"", note the quotations, just a made up name. If we do what we normally do: $x^2y'+y^2y'=y'$ $\int x^2y'dx + \int y^2y'dx = \int y'dx$ $\int x^2y'dx + \frac{1}{3}y^{3} = y$ Our problem occurs when we attempt to integrate that $x^2$ guy. After preforming 2 integrations by parts the integral ends up containing $Y$ which is just something that we don't want to happen. So if anyone knows what to do and we're just not seeing something painfully obvious please do tell. Addendum This is work we've done on $\int x^2y'dx$ and some other stuff as per the request of StinkingBishop: If $u=x$ , $du=dx$ and $dv=xy'$ , $v=\int xy'dx$ and then by subbing into the IBP formula we arrived at: $x(xy-Y)-\int (xy-Y)dx$ which is where problems arise because now we're integrating $Y$ . Additionally, we tried taking derivatives and manipulating the equation but the furtherest we got was: (Differentiation) $2x+2yy'=0$ then $y'=\frac{-x}{y}$ $x^2+y^2=1$ $\frac{x^2}{y}+y=\frac{1}{y}$ (Recall: $y'=\frac{-x}{y}$ ) $-xy'+y=\frac{1}{y}$ (Integrating) $-(xy-Y)+Y=\int \frac{dx}{y}$ and this is where we got stuck again, if anyone can help that would be great.","['integration', 'calculus']"

So there is no explicit example of a complete norm $\|\cdot\|$ not dominated by $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ .

Now, consider the limit $G =\lim_{r\to0} (\frac{1}{r^{2}}-\frac{1}{\sin^{2}r})$ . If we apply the above logic to this question, we will get $G=0$ , which is wrong. So why is the same logic not applicable in the second case?","['limits', 'trigonometry']"

4609451,Confusion about the point at infinity with respect to inversion in geometry.,"I was studying inversion in Olympiad geometry, and they (Evan Chen's book EGMO) mentioned that we can extend the Euclidean plane by adding a point $P_{\infty}$ such that each line passes through it, and no circle passes through it. The reason for this they said was that now two parallel lines meet at that point only, and the center can go there on inversion. But now I have a really stupid confusion: Does this mean that all non parallel lines meet at two points and parallel lines meet at only one? I am very confused by this part now, I tried looking up some things on Wikipedia but they had defined very different things and it just made me more confused. I would really appreciate if anyone could clear this really dumb doubt of mine, Thank you!","['contest-math', 'definition', 'projective-geometry', 'geometry']"
4609474,Is $\sigma$-finiteness necessary for the uniqueness part of Hahn‚ÄìKolmogorov theorem?,"I'm reading Hahn‚ÄìKolmogorov theorem which states that ""if $\mu$ is $\sigma$ -finite, then the extension is unique"" . However, I did not use the assumption of $\sigma$ -finiteness in below theorem. Theorem Let $\mathcal X$ be an algebra on $X$ and $\mu:\mathcal X \to [0, \infty]$ . If $\nu, \nu'$ are measures on $\sigma (\mathcal X)$ such that $\nu|_{\mathcal X}  = \nu'|_{\mathcal X} = \mu$ , then $\nu=\nu'$ . Could you confirm if my proof is fine or I miss something...? Proof Let $\mathcal A := \sigma (\mathcal X)$ and $$
\mathcal D := \{A \in \mathcal A : \nu (A) = \nu' (A)\}.
$$ Then $\mathcal X \subset \mathcal D \subset \mathcal A$ . Let's prove that $\mathcal D$ is a monotone class . Let $(A_n) \subset \mathcal D$ such that $A_n \subset A_{n+1}$ . Let $A := \bigcup A_n$ . By continuity of measure from below, we have $$
\nu (A) = \lim_n \nu (A_n) = \lim_n \nu' (A_n) = \nu' (A).
$$ As such, $A \in \mathcal D$ . Let $(A_n) \subset \mathcal D$ such that $A_{n+1} \subset A_{n}$ . Let $A := \bigcap A_n$ . By continuity of measure from above, we have $$
\nu (A) = \lim_n \nu (A_n) = \lim_n \nu' (A_n) = \nu' (A).
$$ As such, $A \in \mathcal D$ . Let $m(\mathcal X)$ be the smallest monotone class containing $\mathcal X$ . By monotone class theorem , $m(\mathcal X) = \mathcal A$ . On the other hand, $m(\mathcal X) \subset \mathcal D$ . So $\mathcal A \subset \mathcal D$ . This completes the proof.",['measure-theory']

4609679,Galois action on rational points vs. base change of a scheme,"Let $k\newcommand{\Spec}{\operatorname{Spec}}\newcommand{\id}{\operatorname{id}}$ be a field, let $K/k$ be a Galois extension, let $G = \operatorname{Gal}(K/k)$ , and let $X$ be a $k$ -scheme. I want to understand the connections between two different actions of $G$ on objects relating to $X$ . I will begin by stating their definitions and what I know about them. There are two natural ways to define a left action of $G$ on $X(K)$ . The first is to let $\sigma\in G$ act on a point $x\in X(K)$ by post-composition: to $\sigma$ , there is an associated morphism $\sigma^\flat\!:\Spec{K}\to\Spec{K}$ , and we set $\sigma x := x\circ\sigma^\flat$ . It is then not hard to check that this is a left group action. A different approach is to use the identification of $X(K)$ with pairs $(x,j)$ , where $x\in X$ and $j\!:\kappa(x)\hookrightarrow K$ is an embedding of the residue field at $x$ into $K$ . One can then define the action by $(x,j)\mapsto (x,j\circ\sigma)$ . Now, it is not too hard to check that these two approaches give the same action (for example by inspecting the proof of the identification used in the second approach). One can also define a right action of $G$ on the $k$ - scheme $X_K := X\times_k\Spec{K}$ (with the composition $X_K\to\Spec{K}\to\Spec{k}$ as the structure map) by assigning to $\sigma\in G$ the map $\id_X\times_k\sigma^\flat\!:X_K\to X_K$ which acts trivially on $X$ and applies $\sigma^\flat$ to $\Spec{K}$ . That this is a right action is not unexpected, since $\Spec$ is contravariant. Essentially what we now have is a map $\newcommand{\op}{\text{op}}\newcommand{\Aut}{\operatorname{Aut}}G^\op\to\Aut_k(X_K) = \{k\text{-isom. }X_K\to X_K\}$ . My problem is in trying to relate these two approaches. I'm aware that one can get a left action on $X_K$ by switching from $\sigma$ to $\sigma^{-1}$ , but this seems like the wrong direction to go. On the other hand, I have seen no other ways to get a left action out of the right action on $X_K$ . Basically, my question is: is it actually possible to relate the right action on $X_K$ to the left action on $X(K)$ , and if so, how? Furthermore, as this comes up in identifying $X(k)$ as the fixed points of the left action on $X(K)$ , is there an analogous such result for the action on $X_K$ ?","['algebraic-geometry', 'arithmetic-geometry']"
4609681,The taxonomy of real functions of one real variable,"In treatments like Spivak's Calculus , and in Pete Clark's notes here , the motivation is to describe a set of real functions of one real variable with ""sufficiently nice properties"" -- that is to say, a taxonomy of such functions. It seems to me that we can think of this taxonomy as analytic $\subset$ infintely differentiable $\subset$ n-times differentiable $\subset$ continuous $\subset$ general functions. I am trying (I think) to understand the jump from infinitely differentiable to analytic. I am at the end of Spivak's Chapter 24 where the statement is made that ""a convergent power series is always the Taylor series of the function which it defines"". That is (WLOG considering Maclaurin rather than Taylor series), if in some interval $J=(-R,R)$ we have that the function $f(x) = \sum_0^\infty a_n x^n$ converges, then it is in fact equal to its Taylor series $$a_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}.$$ But as noted in Prof. Clark's notes, we can ask the more general question: Question 12.5. Let $f : I ‚Üí R$ be an infinitely differentiable function and $T(x) = \sum_0^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} x^n$ be its Taylor series. We may then ask:
a) For which values of $x$ does $T(x)$ converge?
b) If for $x \in I$ , $T(x)$ converges, do we have $T(x) = f(x)$ ? I want to ask whether the following are the only possibilities other than $f$ being analytic (I think this means equal to it's Taylor series?) everywhere it's defined: The interval of convergence $J$ of the Taylor series of $f$ is a subset of $I$ (the interval on which $f$ is defined), but $f$ is given by its Taylor series on $J$ . I believe this is given e.g. by $f(x) = \textrm{ln}(1+x)$ . I have not yet studied later chapters in Spivak but I suspect this case arises when the complex version of the function encounters a singularity at that radius. The interval of convergence $J$ of the Taylor series of $f$ equals $I$ (the interval on which $f$ is defined), but $f$ is NOT given by its Taylor series on all of $J$ . I believe this is given e.g. by $f(x) = e^{-1/x^2} \ \textrm{for} \ x \neq 0, f(0) = 0$ . Further, with respect to question 2, I'm wondering if it's possible to comment on ""what goes wrong"". Prof. Clark provides sufficient conditions for analyticity in his Theorem 12.6, but I can't quite understand why something that has the limit of its Taylor remainder converge (so that the limit of Taylor polynomials converges) would equal anything other than the function from which the Taylor polynomials were constructed? I suspect this has something to do with uniform convergence but I'm not sure. Edit: With respect to the question in the last paragraph, I suppose a possibility is that the Taylor polynomials $P_{n,f}$ of $f$ converge to some function which is not $f$ , so that the remainder $R_{n,f}$ converges too (unlike in possibility 1 above, where I think the reason the sequence of Taylor polynomial does not converge is because the remainder blows up), but it does not converge to 0?",['calculus']

4609696,Relationship between the Radon Nikodym derivative with respect to two measures in both directions,"Background The Radon-Nikodym Theorem tells us that for two sigma finite measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ , that $\nu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$ if and only if there exists a function $f$ such that it is the Radon-Nikodym derivative $\frac{d \nu}{d \mu}.$ In my course on Measure Theory (and the corresponding textbook ‚ÄúMeasure Theory‚Äù by Donald Cohn), there is not much exploration into the Radon-Nikodym derivative itself and so I am left wondering more about when it exists and the implications of this. Question Assuming that the two measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ are both absolutely continuous between one another and are sigma finite on the measurable space $(\Omega, \mathscr{F})$ , then by the Radon-Nikodym Theorem, both $\frac{d \nu}{d \mu}$ and $\frac{d \mu}{d \nu}$ are guaranteed to exist.

And if there is an easy way to calculate one from the other (which can sometimes be done with derivatives in other areas of mathematics). I would be grateful for any guidance here.

4609760,Prove / Disprove / Complete the proof That $f$ is Infinitely Differentiable,"THE NEW (MUCH SHORTER) POST My original post perhaps was too long for most people, and understandably not a lot of people tried to go over it. In this new post my question is much shorter please prove or disprove that following function is infinitely differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$ , or alternatively answer my original post (it is below here), which basically means helping me completing my proposed proof. Even if you don't want to answer my original post because it 's too long, it might be worth at least looking at some of it, because it could be useful. Let $E$ be some closed set of real numbers. Then, we define $f$ by 3 cases: $\quad$ (I) If $x \in E$ , $f(x) = 0$ . $\quad$ (II) If $x \in (a,b)$ , where $a,b \in E$ and $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$ , define $$F_{a,b}(x) = \frac{\pi}{b-a}\left(x + \frac{3b-5a}{2}\right),$$ $\quad$ and then $$f(x) = X_{a,b}\cos^{F_{a,b}(x)}\left(F_{a,b}(x)\right),$$ $\quad$ where $X_{a,b}$ is some constant real based on $a, b$ , which you need to define appropriately (probably different for every $(a,b)$ ), to prove that $f$ is infinitely differentiable, or if you want to prove that $f$ is not infinitely differentiable, you need to show that this is true for every choice for $X_{a,b}$ . $\quad$ (III) If $E$ is bounded above, $M=\sup E$ , then $f(x)=e^{-\frac{1}{(x-M)^2}}$ for $x > M$ . Similarly, $f(x)=e^{-\frac{1}{(x-N)^2}}$ if $E$ is bounded below and $\quad N=\inf E$ . MY ORIGINAL POST: Baby Rudin Ex. 5.21 - Assessment of a Proposed Partial Solution and Help Completing It This exercise is driving me crazy.
I'm honestly ashamed to tell you how long I actually stack with this problem not continuing to study mathematics until I solve it. In many points a long the way I was very close to giving up and in many points I thought that I finally managed to solve the problem but then realized there is some mistake or a missing piece in the proof. The proposed solution here is the closest I managed to get at this point. At this point I decided it's time to ask for help on the last part missing from this proof and get some people to critic this partial proof in general. The Problem: Ex. 21, Chap. 5 Let $E$ be a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ . We saw in Exercise 22, Chap. 4, that there is a real continuous function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}$ whose zero set is $E$ . Is it possible, for each closed set $E$ , to find such an $f$ which is differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$ , or one which is $n$ times differentiable, or even one which has derivatives of all orders on $\mathbb{R}$ ? My Idea (Informally) I think such an infinitely differentable function does exist. I want to give you a visual explanation of how I thought of constructing this function before going to the formal solution. We obviously set $f$ to be 0 for all points of $E$ . For every open interval of points of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ , where the end points are points of $E$ , $f$ is a ""wave"" that smoothly approches 0 in the end points so that the derivative of any order on those end points is always 0. The shorter this open interval is, the smaller the maximum point of this ""wave"". If $E$ is bounded above, $f$ is just some increasing function after $\sup E$ , so that it smoothly approches 0 at $\sup E$ (the same goes if $E$ is bounded below).
I drew an illustration of this idea: The red parts are points of $f(E)$ , the blue parts are points of $f(\mathbb{R} \setminus E)$ . $P$ is a limit point of $E$ . My Partial Solution My proof uses two previous results from the book and two additional lemmas. I shall present them here (and prove the lemmas) before going to the main proof. Ex. 5.9. Let $f$ be a continuous real function on $\mathbb{R}$ , of which it is known that $f'(x)$ exists for all $x \neq 0$ and that $f'(x) \to 3$ as $x \to 0$ . Does it follow that $f'(0)$ exists? In the solution to this exercise we saw that $f'(0)$ does in fact exists and is 3. In general to any real continuous function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}$ for which the derivative is known to exist except for a specific point $a$ and $f'(x) \to D$ as $x \to a$ , we can use the same proof we use in this exercise to show that $f'(a)$ exists and $f'(a)=D$ . Theorem 4.15. If $f$ is a continuous mapping of a compact metric space $X$ into $\mathbb{R}^k$ , then $f(X)$ is closed and bounded. Thus, $f$ is bounded. Lemma 1. Let $f, g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable functions. Then, $$\left(f(x)^{g(x)}\right)' = f(x)^{g(x)}\left[g'(x)\ln(f(x)) + g(x)\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\right]$$ Proof. Let $h(x)=f(x)^{g(x)}$ , then $$\ln(h(x)) = \ln\left(f(x)^{g(x)}\right) = g(x)\ln(f(x)).$$ Differentiating both sides we get: $$\frac{h'(x)}{h(x)} = g'(x)\ln(f(x)) + g(x)\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}.$$ Thus, $$h'(x) = f(x)^{g(x)}\left[g'(x)\ln(f(x)) + g(x)\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\right].$$ Lemma 2. Let $f,g : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ infinitely differentiable functions. Then, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ : $\quad$ (a) $f+g$ is infinitely differentiable and $$(f+g)^{(n)}(x)=f^{(n)}(x)+g^{(n)}(x)$$ . $\quad$ (b) $f\cdot g$ is infinitely differentiable and $$(f\cdot g)^{(n)}(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{2^n} f^{\left(\alpha_{n_i}\right)}(x)\cdot g^{\left(\beta_{n_i}\right)}(x),$$ $\quad$ where $\{\alpha_{n_i}\}$ , $\{\beta_{n_i}\}$ are sequences of non-negative integers. $\quad$ (c) $\frac{f}{g}$ is infinitely differentiable whenever $g(x) \neq 0$ and $$\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)^{(n)}(x)=\frac{F_n(x)}{g^{2^n}(x)},$$ $\quad$ where $F_n$ is some infinitely differentiable function. $\quad$ (d) $f\circ g$ is infinitely differentiable and $$(f\circ g)^{(n)}(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{z_n}\prod_{i=1}^{m_{n_j}}t_{n_{j_i}},$$ $\quad$ for some $z_n \in \mathbb{N}$ , $m_{n_1} and \dots, m_{n_{z_n}} \in \mathbb{N}$ and where each term $t_{n_{j_i}}$ is either of the form $f^{(m)}(g(x))$ or $g^{(m)}(x)$ , $m$ a non-negative $\quad$ integer. Proof. We use induction for all 4 of the sections of this lemma. $\quad$ (a) For $n=1$ , $(f+g)'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)$ . Suppose that $(f+g)^{(k)}(x)=f^{(k)}(x)+g^{(k)}(x)$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ . Then, $$(f+g)^{(k+1)}(x)=\left(f^{(k)}(x)\right)' + \left(g^{(k)}(x)\right)' = f^{(k+1)}(x) + g^{(k+1)}(x).$$ $\quad$ (b) For $n=1$ , $(f \cdot g)'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$ . Suppose that for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ , there are sequences $\{\alpha_{k_i}\}$ , $\{\beta_{k_i}\}$ of non-negative integers such that $(f\cdot g)^{(k)}(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{2^k} f^{\left(\alpha_{k_i}\right)}(x)\cdot g^{\left(\beta_{k_i}\right)}(x)$ . Then, $$(f\cdot g)^{(k+1)}(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{2^k} f^{\left(\alpha_{k_i}+1\right)}(x)\cdot g^{\left(\beta_{k_i}\right)}(x) + f^{\left(\alpha_{k_i}\right)}(x)\cdot g^{\left(\beta_{k_i}+1\right)}(x).$$ Now, let $$\alpha_{\left(k+1\right)_i} = \begin{cases}
\alpha_{k_i+1}, \quad 1 \leq i \leq 2^k\\
\alpha_{k_{\left(i-2^k\right)}}, \quad 2^k + 1 \leq i \leq 2^{k+1},
\end{cases}$$ $$\beta_{\left(k+1\right)_i} = \begin{cases}
\beta_{k_i}, \quad 1 \leq i \leq 2^k\\
\beta_{k_{\left(i-2^k\right)}+1}, \quad 2^k + 1 \leq i \leq 2^{k+1}.
\end{cases}$$ Thus, $$(f\cdot g)^{(k+1)}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{2^{k+1}}f^{\left(\alpha_{(k+1)_i}\right)}(x)\cdot g^{\left(\beta_{(k+1)_i}\right)}(x).$$ $\quad$ (c) For $n=1$ , $\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)'(x) = \frac{f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)}{g^2(x)}$ . Suppose that for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ , $\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)^{(k)}(x) = \frac{F_k(x)}{g^{2^k}(x)}$ , where $F_k$ is some infinitely differentiable function. Then, if we put $F_{k+1}(x) = F_k(x)g^{2^k}(x)-2^kg^{2^k-1}(x)g'(x)F_k(x)$ , we get the desired result that $$\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)^{(k+1)}(x) = \frac{F_{k+1}(x)}{g^{2^{k+1}}(x)}.$$ $\quad$ (d) For $n=1$ , $(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ . Suppose that for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ , $(f\circ g)^{(k)}(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{z_k}\prod_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}$ for some $z_k \in \mathbb{N}$ , $m_{k_1} and \dots, m_{k_{z_k}} \in \mathbb{N}$ and where each term $t_{k_{j_i}}$ is either of the form $f^{(m)}(g(x))$ or $g^{(m)}(x)$ , $m$ a non-negative integer. Then, $(f\circ g)^{(k+1)}(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{z_k}\left(\prod_{s=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_s}}\right)'$ . We then prove by induction $$\bullet \quad \left(\prod_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)' = \sum_{i=1}^{m}\left(\frac{t_{k_{j_i}}'}{t_{k_{j_i}}}\prod_{s=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_s}}\right) + \prod_{i=1}^{m}t_{k_{j_i}}\left(\prod_{i=m+1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)',$$ for every $m,j \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $j \leq z_k$ and $m < m_{k_j}$ . For $m=1$ , $\left(\prod_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)' = t_{k_{j_1}}'\prod_{i=2}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}} + t_{k_{j_1}}\left(\prod_{i=2}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)'$ . Suppose that $\bullet$ is true for some natural $m < m_{k_j}-1$ . Then, $$\begin{align*}
\left(\prod_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)' 
& = \sum_{i=1}^{m}\left(\frac{t_{k_{j_i}}'}{t_{k_{j_i}}}\prod_{s=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_s}}\right) + \prod_{i=1}^{m}t_{k_{j_i}}\left[t_{k_{j_{m+1}}}'\left(\prod_{i=m+2}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right) + t_{k_{j_{m+1}}}\left(\prod_{i=m+2}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)'\right]\\
& = \sum_{i=1}^{m+1}\left(\frac{t_{k_{j_i}}'}{t_{k_{j_i}}}\prod_{s=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_s}}\right) + \prod_{i=1}^{m+1}t_{k_{j_i}}\left(\prod_{i=m+2}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)'.
\end{align*}$$ Then, if we put $m=m_{k_j}-1$ we get that $$\left(\prod_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_i}}\right)' = \sum_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}\left(\frac{t_{k_{j_i}}'}{t_{k_{j_i}}}\prod_{s=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_s}}\right).$$ Since $t_{k_{j_i}}'$ is either of the form $f^{(u)}(g(x))g'(x)$ or $g^{(u)}(x)$ , $u \in \mathbb{N}$ , $$
(f \circ g)^{(k+1)}(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{z_k}\sum_{i=1}^{m_{k_j}}\left(\frac{t_{k_{j_i}}'}{t_{k_{j_i}}}\prod_{s=1}^{m_{k_j}}t_{k_{j_s}}\right)
$$ can clearly be arranged in our desired form. The main proof. Yes, such a function which is infinitely differentiable exists. We shall construct an example. Let $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be closed. Defining $f$ For the trivial case that $E=\emptyset$ take $f(x)=1$ . Otherwise, we define $f$ by 3 cases: $\quad$ (I) If $x \in E$ , $f(x) = 0$ . $\quad$ (II) If $x \in (a,b)$ , where $a,b \in E$ and $(a,b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$ , define $$F_{a,b}(x) = \frac{\pi}{b-a}\left(x + \frac{3b-5a}{2}\right),$$ $\quad$ and then $$f(x) = X_{a,b}\cos^{F_{a,b}(x)}\left(F_{a,b}(x)\right),$$ $\quad$ where $X_{a,b}$ is some constant real based on $a, b$ , which for now is irrelevant. We shall define $X_{a,b}$ later in the proof when its value will be $\quad$ relevant. $\quad$ (III) If $E$ is bounded above, $M=\sup E$ , then $f(x)=e^{-\frac{1}{(x-M)^2}}$ for $x > M$ . Similarly, $f(x)=e^{-\frac{1}{(x-N)^2}}$ if $E$ is bounded below and $\quad N=\inf E$ . Clearly $f$ is defined for every $x \in E$ . $f$ is also defined for every $x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus E$ because such $x$ have some neighborhood in $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ , otherwise $x$ would be a limit point of $E$ and therefore contained in $E$ . $E$ is the zero-set of $f$ To show that $E=Z(f)$ , we need to show that $x \not\in E$ implies $f(x) \neq 0$ . For $x$ in case (II) $$* \quad \frac{3}{2}\pi < F_{a,b}(x) < \frac{5}{2}\pi, $$ therefore $f(x)>0$ . For $x$ in case (III) clearly $f(x)>0$ as well. $f$ is infinitely differentiable we treat points of $E$ and points of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ separately. Points of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ : $\quad$ For $x$ in case (II), $f(x)=X_{a,b}\cos^{F_{a,b}(x)}\left(F_{a,b}(x)\right)$ . To derive $f'(x)$ , we first note that $$F_{a,b}'(x)=\frac{\pi}{b-a}$$ and using lemma 1 $$\left(\cos^x(x)\right)' = \cos^x(x)\left(\ln\left(\cos x\right)-x\tan x\right).$$ We now prove by induction that for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , $f^{(n)}(x)$ exists and $f^{(n)}(x) = f(x)\cdot f_n(x)$ , where $f_n$ is some infinitely differentiable function. For $n=1$ , $$f'(x) = f(x)\left[\ln\left(\cos F_{a,b}(x)\right) - F_{a,b}(x)\tan F_{a,b}(x)\right]\frac{\pi}{b-a},$$ and we denote $f_1(x) = \frac{\pi}{b-a}\left[\ln\left(\cos F_{a,b}(x)\right) - F_{a,b}(x)\tan F_{a,b}(x)\right]$ . From $*$ it follows that $\cos F_{a,b}(x) > 0$ , hence $\ln\cos F_{a,b}(x)$ is well defined and is infinitely differentiable by lemma 2(d). Then, additionally using lemmas 2(a),(b),(d) we see that $f_1$ is infinitely differentiable. Suppose that for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ $f^{(k)}(x)=f(x)f_k(x)$ , where $f_k$ is some infinitely differentiable function. Then, $$\begin{align*}
f^{(k+1)}(x)
&= f'(x)f_k(x) + f(x)f_k'(x)\\
&= f(x)(f_1(x)f_k(x) + f_k'(x)).
\end{align*}$$ Denoting $f_{k+1}(x) = f_1(x)f_k(x)+f_k'(x)$ , it's clear from lemmas 2(b),(c) that $f_{k+1}$ is infinitely differentiable. $\quad$ For $x$ in case (III), suppose without loss of generality that $E$ is bounded above and $x > M$ . Then, since $e^x$ and $-\frac{1}{(x-M)^2}$ are infinitely differentiable (for $x \neq M$ ) we can use lemma 2(d) to get that $f(x)$ is infinitely differentiable. Points of $E$ : We shall describe the area ""to the left"" and ""to the right"" of $x$ . Given $d > 0$ , we denote $l_d=(x-d,x)$ and $r_d=(x,x+d)$ . Then, we claim that there is some $\varepsilon_0>0$ , such that at least one of the following must be true: $\quad$ (1) $\quad$ $l_{\varepsilon_0} \subseteq E$ . $\quad$ (2) $\quad$ $l_{\varepsilon_0} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \setminus E$ . $\quad$ (3) $\quad$ For all $0<\varepsilon\leq \varepsilon_0$ , there's some $t \in l_\varepsilon$ such that $t \in E$ . And the same goes for ""the right side"" of $x$ . To show that one of these options must be true, suppose by contradiction that they're all false. Then, since (3) is false, (2) is true and that's a contradiction. $\quad$ We shall prove that for every non-negative integer $n$ , $f^{(n)}(t) \to 0$ as $t \to x$ . Then we use it to prove by induction that $f^{(n)}(x)=0$ and therefore $f^{(n)}(x)$ exists. Here is this induction proof: For $n=0$ we already know that $f(x)=0$ . Suppose that for some non-negative integer $k$ , $f^{(k)}(x)=0$ . Then, since $f^{(k)}(t) \to 0$ as $t \to x$ it follows that $f^{(k)}$ is continuous at $x$ and since we know that $f^{(k+1)}$ exists for points of $\mathbb{R} \setminus E$ , $f^{(k)}$ is continuous. Then, since $f^{(k+1)}(t) \to 0$ as $t \to x$ , using Ex.9 it follows that $f^{(k+1)}(x)=0$ . $\quad$ If (1) is true, then $f$ is $0$ constant in $l_{\varepsilon_0}$ , therefore for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ $f^{(n)}$ is 0 constant as well. Thus, for every non-negative integer $n$ , $f^{(n)}(t) \to 0$ as $t \to x$ for $x \in l_{\varepsilon_0}$ . This argument of course can be applied to $r_{\varepsilon_0}$ as well. $\quad$ If (2) is true, then either $x=N=\inf E$ or $x=b$ for some $(a,b)$ as in case (II). If $x=b$ , denote $w(z)=X_{a,b}\cos^{F_{a,b}(z)}\left(F_{a,b}(z)\right)$ , for $z \in [a,b]$ (note that $w=f$ on $[a,b]$ ). Then, since $w$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ (composition of continuous functions is continuous, $\lim_{t \to x}f(t) = 0$ , for $t \in l_{\varepsilon_0}$ . Since $w^{(n)}(t) = w(t)\cdot f_n(t)$ and $w^{(n+1)}(t)$ exists for all non-negative integer $n$ and $t \in [a,b]$ , it follows that $w^{(n)}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ , therefore $f^{(n)}(t) \to w^{(n)}(x) = 0$ as $t \to x$ for $t \in l_{\varepsilon_0}$ . If $x=N$ , then $f(t)=e^{-\frac{1}{(t-N)^2}}$ , for $t \in l_{\varepsilon_0}$ . Then, we show that $f^{(n)}(t) = f(t)\cdot p_n(t)$ , where $p_n(t)$ is some polynomial of $\frac{1}{t-N}$ . We use induction: For $n=1$ , $f'(t) = f(t)\cdot 2\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^3$ . If for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$ , $f^{(n)} = f(t)p_k(t)$ , where $p_k(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{i}c_j\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^j$ , $i \in \mathbb{N}$ and $c_0, \dots, c_i \in \mathbb{R}$ . Then, $$\begin{align*}
f^{(k+1)}(t) 
&= f(t)2\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^3\sum_{j=0}^{i}c_j\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^j + f(t)\sum_{j=0}^{i}jc_j\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^{j-1}\\
&= f(t)\underbrace{\left[\sum_{j=0}^{i}2c_j\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^{j+3} + \sum_{j=0}^{i}jc_j\left(\frac{1}{t-N}\right)^{j-1}\right]}_{\text{clearly a polynomial of } \frac{1}{t-N}}
\end{align*}$$ Now, if we prove that $\lim_{t \to N}\frac{f(t)}{|t-N|^m} = 0$ , for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$ , then clearly $f^{(n)}(t) \to 0$ as $t \to x$ for $t \in l_{\varepsilon_0}$ . $$
\lim_{t \to N}\frac{f(t)}{|t-N|^m} = \lim_{t \to N}\frac{e^{-\frac{1}{|t-N|^2}}}{|t-N|^m} = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{e^{-\frac{1}{h^2}}}{h^m} = \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{n^{\frac{m}{2}}}{e^n}.
$$ If $m=2z$ , for some $z \in \mathbb{N}$ , we apply l'H√¥pital's rule $z$ times and get that $$\lim_{t \to N}\frac{f(t)}{|t-N|^m} = \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{z!}{e^n} = 0.$$ If $m=2z-1$ , for some $z \in \mathbb{N}$ , we apply l'H√¥pital's rule $z$ times and get that $$\lim_{t \to N}\frac{f(t)}{|t-N|^m} = 
\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\left(\frac{m}{2}\right)\left(\frac{m}{2}-1\right)\cdots\frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{n}e^n} = 0.$$ In a very similar way we can prove this for $r_{\varepsilon_0}$ when either $x=a$ or $x=M=\sup E$ . The missing piece from the proof The last thing left to prove which I didn't mange to prove is that $f^{(n)}(t) \to 0$ as $t \to x$ for points $x \in E$ for which (3) is true. I should show how I tried to do it and what I did manage to show, that perhaps could be useful: $\quad$ Suppose (3) is true (but (1) is false). We should now define $X_{a,b}$ . Let $n_{a,b} \in \mathbb{N}$ be the smallest integer such that $\frac{1}{n_{a,b}} < b-a$ . Since $f_n$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$ , $f_n$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ , therefore by Theorem 4.15, there's some $M_n \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\left|f_n(t)\right| \leq M_n$ for all $t \in [a,b]$ (notice that $f_n$ is independent of the value of $X_{a,b}$ ). Similarly, there is some $M_* \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\left|\cos^{F_{a,b}(t)}\left(F_{a,b}(t)\right)\right| \leq M_*$ for all $t \in [a,b]$ . Put $M_{a,b} = \max \{M_n|n \leq n_{a,b}\}$ . Finally, we define $$X_{a,b} = \frac{1}{n_{a,b}M_*M_{a,b}}.$$ We shall now use this definition of $X_{a,b}$ to demonstrate that for every $d > 0$ , there is some $\delta > 0$ such that if $t \in l_\delta$ and $t \not\in E$ , then $|f^{(n)}(t)|< d$ . Given $d > 0$ , there is some $x_d \in l_d$ , such that $x_d \in E$ . Put $\delta = x - x_d$ . If $t \in l_\delta$ and $t \not\in E$ , then $t \in (a,b)$ as in (II), where $b-a \leq \delta$ . Thus $$
|f^{(n)}(t)|=
X_{a,b}|f_n(t)|\left|\cos^{F_{a,b}(t)}\left(F_{a,b}(t)\right)\right|
\leq \frac{1}{n_{a,b}M_*M_{a,b}}M_*M_{a,b}
= \frac{1}{n_{a,b}}
< b-a \leq \delta
< d
.$$ For points $t$ for which (1) is true we know that $f^{(n)}(t) = 0$ , so there's no problem there. But the problem is points for which only (3) is true. We don't know that they are 0 (we only think they suppose to be 0), but how can we prove this? It seems a bit circular. What I'm Asking For I have a few questions / things I want to get in an answer to this question: General assessment / critique of the incomplete proof (ignore the missing piece): I would like to get your opinion about every aspect of this proof - soundness, rigor, style, clarity and any other possible aspect you can think of.
And most importantly is there some big unfixable mistake in this proof? Do you have a proposal to solve the missing piece? If needed feel free to change the definition of the coefficient $X_{a,b}$ as you see fit. If you think there's no way to solve this missing piece and this construction simply doesn't work, please don't suggest me a completely different solution to this exercise, I can look for solutions online, that's not a problem. Instead, please prove why this construction can't work for any choice of $X_{a,b}$ . How long does such a question should take to solve for a first time analysis student? Does it make sense that a single exercise would take so much time and effort, even when we talk about Rudin?","['proof-writing', 'smooth-functions', 'real-analysis', 'solution-verification', 'derivatives']"
4609792,Contest Math Question on Logarithms,"I am trying to solve a question from the AoPS Vol. 2 book.
The question is as follows: Suppose the $p$ and $q$ are positive numbers for which: $$\log_9 p = \log_{12}q = \log_{16}(p+q)$$ What is the value of $q/p$ ? (AHSME 1988) I only have knowledge of a few of the basic log identities/properties to work with, but they are not getting me anywhere, I find myself only coming up with some obvious equalities that do not lead me closer. One thing I tried was to rewrite the equalities as: $$\frac{\log p}{\log 9} = \frac{\log{q}}{\log 12} = \frac{\log(p+q)}{\log 16}$$ where $\log = \log_{10}$ . Then, rearranging the first equality shows: $$\log_q p = \log_{12} 9$$ I thought at first that I could just take $q=12$ and $p=9$ directly via substitution, but substituting in these values does not satisfy the equality given in the problem statement since $\log_{16} 21 \neq 1$ . (What's actually going on here by the way? Is it because you can have multiple values of $p$ and $q$ besides $12$ and $9$ that satisfy the equality?) I feel that I am missing some key step in my approach to be able to solve this that is beyond just manipulating the formulas/identities. I am wondering if someone can point me in the right direction about how to approach this, and perhaps explain how one would reach such an approach.

4609805,Behavior of the solutions to a system of linear differential equations,"Let $x(t)=(x_1(t),\cdots,x_n(t)):\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ be differentiable and satisfy: $$x'(t)=Ax(t)$$ where $A=(a_{ij})_{n\times n}$ is a real matrix. I have known that if the real part of all eigenvalues of $A$ are strictly negative, then $\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow+\infty}x(t)=0$ . However, if we assume $\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow+\infty}x(t)=0$ and $x_1(t),\cdots,x_n(t)$ are linearly independent, what can we say about the matrix $A$ ? I guess the real part of all eigenvalues of $A$ should be strictly negative, but I cannot deal with the case that the eigenvalue $\lambda$ is purely imaginary number. In this case, $x_i(t)$ may be like this: $$c_1\sin \mu_1t+c_2\sin\mu_2t+\cdots+c_2\sin\mu_kt$$ where $\mu_k>0$ I guess this is impossible since $\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow+\infty}x(t)=0$ , but I don't know how to prove it. By the way, the original problem is that if all $a_{ij}\geqslant0$ and $\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow+\infty}x(t)=0$ , prove that $x_1(t),\cdots ,x_n(t)$ cannot be linearly independent. The solution is that use Perron's theorem to find a non-negative eigenvalue $\lambda$ and its eigenvector $(\alpha_1,\cdots ,\alpha_n)$ . Let $y(t)=\alpha_1x_1(t)+\cdots+\alpha_nx_n(t)$ and we will find that $y'=\lambda y$ and $\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow +\infty}y(t)=0$ , so $y(t)\equiv0$ , which means $x_1(t),\cdots,x_n(t)$ are linearly dependent.","['linear-algebra', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'real-analysis']"

\operatorname{Var}_{[a, b]} f = f_1(b)-f_1(a)+f_2(b)-f_2(a).

4609959,Kolmogorov complexity of primes vs. composites in the limit?,"If we take two natural numbers of roughly equivalent magnitude where one is prime and the other is composite, will the Kolmogorov complexity of one or the other tend to be higher as we approach infinity? I originally suspected primes would be incrementally more complex (I believe this is true for small numbers), but I have no idea about what to expect with arbitrarily large numbers. My one observation is that if you take $p\in\mathbb P$ large enough, then its K-complexity immediately has an upper bound of $K(\pi(p))+C$ , where $C$ is some constant necessary to encode the enumeration of primes, so we do know that every sufficiently large prime is at least somewhat compressible. Since many nearby composites are bound to be algorithmically random, perhaps there's a case to be made that primes are actually simpler in the limit. On the other hand, if you're considering the mean complexity over some range of numbers, it seems likely there are similar counterarguments about exploiting the factorability of composites.","['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'kolmogorov-complexity', 'prime-numbers', 'computer-science']"

$ I'm interested in the $\chi^2$ -divergnce, as a way of comparing probability distributions. There are two ways I've seen it defined. Are they equivalent? Let $P,Q$ be two probability measures on a set $\mathscr X$ with some sigma algebra, and $p,q$ be their densities with respect to some dominating measure denoted $\dee x$ . The first definition I've seen is $$\D{P}{Q} \equiv \int_{\mathscr X}\frac{(p(x)-q(x))^2}{p(x)}\dee{x}$$ This definition makes the relationship with the Chi-squared test clear. The second definition I've seen is $$\D{P}{Q} \equiv \E{Q}{{\left(\frac{\dee{P}}{\dee{Q}}-1\right)}^2} = \int_{\mathscr X}{\left(\frac{\dee{P}}{\dee{Q}}-1\right)}^2\dee{Q}$$ where $\frac{\dee{P}}{\dee{Q}}$ is the RN-derivative of $P$ with respect to $Q$ .  This definition is used in the context of defining $\chi^2$ divergence as an $f$ -divergence ( $\Df{P}{Q}\equiv\E{Q}{f(\frac{\dee{P}}{\dee{Q}})}$ with $f(t)=(t -1)^2$ ).

Anyways, I realized that I could use this to prove that $$-\int_0^1\ln\left(\ln \frac{1}{x}\right)dx=\gamma$$ Where $\gamma$ is the Euler-mascheroni constant. Here is my proof: Take the derivative of $\int_0^1(-\ln x)^sdx$ with respect to $s$ . To do this, move the differentiation operator inside the integral sign, meaning that we need to take the derivative of $\ln^sx$ . This is the same as $e^{s\ln\ln \frac{1}{x}}$ . By chain rule we get that the derivative of $(-\ln x)^s$ is $\ln(-\ln x)(-\ln x)^s$ . Setting $s=0$ back in the original equation, we get that $\int_0^1\ln\frac{1}{\ln \frac{1}{x}}dx=-\gamma$ since the derivative of the analytic continuation of the factorial function at zero is $-\gamma$ .

4610345,Formalizing some items in an electrostatics computation,"Consider the question attached (Example 3.4 from Zangwill's Modern Electrodynamics , Ch 3). I can follow the solution quite easily using ""physics math"" but, having just recently finished Spivak's Calculus , I want to formalize the operations performed and am hoping someone can help me with two items in particular. Note that I will refer to the equations in the attached picture as (1) through (6), in the order they appear. The only niceties which I intend to ignore in this ""formalization"" are the rigorous developments of the improper integrals and also the $\epsilon_0$ factor. All integrands etc. are continuous so all of the theorems I invoke apply. For equation (3), I noted that Zangwill is choosing to evaluate the line integral along the path $ \boldsymbol\ell $ which is parametrized as $ \boldsymbol\ell  =  \boldsymbol\ell(r') = r' \mathbf{\hat{r}} $ in the conventional spherical coordinate system, and we are evaluating from $r'=\infty$ to $r' = r$ . But I wanted to challenge myself to compute this line integral via the ""opposite"" path and to show that the same result obtains (as it must, since the line integral from a point to a point is independent of the parametrization of the path which we choose). Thus I tried to consider the parametrization $ \boldsymbol\ell  =  \boldsymbol\ell(u) = r'(u) \mathbf{\hat{r}} $ where $r'(u) = -u$ (perhaps this is my first error -- this was what I thought was appropriate for a path which ""starts"" at infinity and goes radially towards 0) where we go from $u = -\infty$ to $u = -r$ . Thus $ d\boldsymbol\ell  =  \frac{d\boldsymbol\ell}{du}du = -\mathbf{\hat{r}}du $ . Would this process be correct if I plugged it into the LHS equality of equation (3)? More importantly, I want to follow the u-substitution which is performed using the physicist shorthand of ""changing the integration variable"". More rigorously (I think), I could observe that the middle expression in equation (3) is written as (I change the integration variable to $x$ so there is no confusion with derivatives) $$\int_\infty^r dx \ g'(x) (f\circ g)(x)$$ where $$f (x) = \int_0^{1/x} ds \ s^2 \rho(s)$$ $$g(x) = 1/x$$ $$g'(x) = -1/x^2$$ so that by the u-sub theorem (Spivak Theorem 19-2) I have $$\int_\infty^r dx \ g'(x) (f\circ g)(x) = \int_{g(\infty)}^{g(r)} dx f(x)=\int_{0}^{1/r} dx \int_0^{1/x} ds \ s^2 \rho(s)$$ Integrating by parts (Spivak Theorem 19-1), I find then that the integral is given by $$\int_{g(\infty)}^{g(r)} dx f(x)=\int_{0}^{1/r} dx \int_0^{1/x} ds \ s^2 \rho(s) = \left(x\int_0^{1/x} ds \ s^2 \rho(s) \right)\Big|_0^{1/r} - \\ \int_{0}^{1/r} dx \ x (-1/x^2) (1/x)^2 \rho(1/x) = \frac{\int_0^{r} ds \ s^2 \rho(s)}{r} + \int_{0}^{1/r} dx \  \frac{\rho(1/x)}{x^3}$$ where in the last step I've tried to use the fundamental theorem of calculus (Spivak Theorem 14-1) and the chain rule to evaluate the derivative with respect to $x$ of the inner integral. I can then observe that the second term integral in the above has an integrand of the form necessary for u-substitution, with $f(x) = x \rho (x), g(x) = 1/x, g'(x) = -1/x^2$ so that I obtain $$\frac{\int_0^{r} ds \ s^2 \rho(s)}{r} + \int_{0}^{1/r} dx \  \frac{\rho(1/x)}{x^3} = \frac{\int_0^{r} ds \ s^2 \rho(s)}{r} - \int_{\infty}^{r} dx \ x \rho(x) = \frac{\int_0^{r} ds \ s^2 \rho(s)}{r} + \\ \int_{r}^{\infty} dx \ x \rho(x) $$ which is the correct final answer.

4610367,Issue with proof of theorem 2.1.11 in Audin-Damian,"The theorem in question is as follows: Let $V$ be a closed smooth manifold and $f: V\to \mathbb{R}$ a Morse function.

This is done by taking a Morse chart $(U,h)$ of a neighborhood of $a$ and an $\epsilon>0$ such that $f^{-1}([\alpha-\epsilon,\alpha+\epsilon])$ is compact and $U$ contains a ball of radius $\sqrt{2\epsilon}$ with center $0$ and using a smooth function $\mu:\mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}\to \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$ such that \begin{align}

4610394,Showing $x^4 + 1$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.,"Clearly, none of the roots are in $\mathbb{Q}$ so $f(x) = x^4 + 1$ does not have any linear factors. Thus, the only thing left to check is to show that $f(x)$ cannot reduce to two quadratic factors. My proposed solution was to state that $f(x) = x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + i)(x^2 - i)$ but $\pm i \not\in \mathbb{Q}$ so $f(x)$ is irreducible. However, I stumbled across this post $x^4 + 1$ reducible over $\mathbb{R}$... is this possible? with a comment suggesting that $x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + \sqrt{2}x + 1)(x^2 - \sqrt{2}x + 1)$ which turns out to be a case that I did not fully consider. It made me realize that $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ being a UFD only guarantees a unique factorization of irreducible elements in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ (which $x^2 \pm i$ nor $x^2 \pm \sqrt{2} x + 1$ aren't in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ ) so checking a single combination of quadratic products is not sufficient. Therefore, what is the ideal method for checking that $x^4 + 1$ cannot be reduced to a product of two quadratic polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ ? Am I forced to just brute force check solutions of $x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)$ don't have rational solutions $(a,b,c,d) \in \mathbb{Q}^4$ ?","['irreducible-polynomials', 'number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"
4610400,A proof of a sufficient condition to have that $f : A\subset\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable,"Consider $f : O\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}$ a function continuously differentiable on $O$ an open set of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is all its partial derivatives exist on $O$ and they are continuous. We want to show that it is a sufficient condition to have that $f$ is differentiable on $O$ . To do this, we consider the open set $N(X_0, r)$ where $X_0\in O$ . The idea is to use the theorem discussed here : Kind of Taylor expansion for functions of several variables? This theorem says the following : Consider $f:A\subset\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ where all its partial derivatives exists on the open ball $N(X_o, r)$ with $X_0\in A$ . Consider $Z$ a vector of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\lVert Z\rVert\leq r$ . Then we have $f(X_0 + Z) = f(X_0) + \sum_{i}^{n}f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0 + V_i)z_i$ with $V_i=(z_1, ..., z_{i-1}, \theta z_{i}, 0, ..., 0),\quad 0<\theta<1$ Now, consider $Z\in\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\lVert Z\rVert < r$ . Then, we can use the theorem  above at the point $X_0$ , it follows that $f(X_0 + Z) = f(X_0) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0 + V_i)z_i$ . If we consider the approximation $f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0)$ instead of $f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0 + V_i)$ we can write the following : $\epsilon(X_0, Z) = f(X_0 + Z) - f(X_0) - \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0)z_i $ And then we make appear the equality of interest for the differentiability that is : $\epsilon_1(X_0, Z) =\frac{1}{\lVert Z\rVert}\left[ f(X_0 + Z) - f(X_0) - \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0)z_i\right] $ Using the fact that $f(X_0 + Z) - f(X_0) = \sum_{i}^{n}f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0 + V_i)z_i$ we have : $\lvert\epsilon_1(X_0, Z)\rvert =\left\lvert\frac{1}{\lVert Z\rVert}\left[ \sum_{i}^{n}f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0 + V_i)z_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0)z_i\right]\right\rvert$ $\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad = \left\lvert\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{z_i}{\lVert Z\rVert}\left[f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0 + V_i) - f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0)\right]\right\rvert $ $\quad\quad\quad\quad\;\;\;\leq\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left\lvert\frac{z_i}{\lVert Z\rVert}\right\rvert\left\lvert\left[f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0 + V_i) - f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0)\right]\right\rvert\leq\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left\lvert\left[f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0 + V_i) - f_{x_i}^{'}(X_0)\right]\right\rvert $ But $\forall 1\leq i\leq n : \lVert V_i\rVert\leq\lVert Z\rVert\implies\lim_{Z\to 0_{\mathbb{R}^n}} V_i =0$ Thus using the continuity of the absolute value and of $f_{x_i}^{'}$ at $X_0$ we get $\lim_{Z\to 0_{\mathbb{R}^n}}\lvert\epsilon_1(X_0, Z)\rvert = 0 $ And this holds for all $X\in O$ , which concludes the proof.

4610453,Coming up with reasonable estimate for dice EV problem,"There's this question on 100-sided die probability: The question is as follows: You are given a 100-sided die. After you roll once, you can choose to either get paid the dollar amount of that roll OR pay one dollar for one more roll. What is the expected value of the game? There is no limit on number of rolls. There's an answer here: If the expected value of this game is $a$ , then at a die roll of $X$ you have the choice of either collecting $X$ or paying a dollar and restart, which gives you an expected value of $a-1$ .
To maximize the expected value, you should take $X$ if $X> a-1$ and start over if $X\le a-1$ (it does not really matter what we do when $X=a-1$ ).
We obtain therefore $$ a = \frac1{100}\left(\lfloor a-1\rfloor\cdot a+\sum_{k=\lfloor a-1\rfloor+1}^{100}k\right)
=\frac1{100}\left(\lfloor a-1\rfloor\cdot a+\frac{100\cdot101}{2}-\frac{\lfloor a-1\rfloor \cdot\lfloor a\rfloor}{2}\right).
$$ I find numerically (didn't do much code checking, but the results are somewhat plausible) $$a\approx87.3571 $$ which seems to be exactly (and of course the true result must be rational) $$a=87\frac{5}{14}.$$ But I'm sure you can do the justification after the fact, i.e. show that the strategy that consists in continuing until you roll at least $87$ gives you $87\frac{5}{14}$ as expected value. Question: Is there a good way to quickly estimate something reasonably close to $87$ without writing a program, using WolframAlpha, or doing a calculation using scratch paper?","['estimation', 'expected-value', 'combinatorics', 'inequality', 'probability']"

The problem: If we additionally assume that $R$ is a local ring (that is, $R$ is a local domain), is the following statement true? "" $P$ is torsion-free if and only if $P$ is projective."" Some facts I know/encountered and the result of my search... I apologize if this might be messy but I want to ensure everybody is on the same page as me. If $R$ is just an integral domain then the statement is not necessarily true. If $R$ is a principal ideal domain (PID) then the statement is true (easily proven using the structure theorem of modules over PIDs). If $R$ is a local ring and we drop the integral domain assumption then the statement is not necessarily true. If $R$ is a discrete valuation ring (= local ring + PID) then the statement is true (since it is a module over PID). Discrete valuation rings are valuation rings but the converse is not necessarily true. Valuation rings are integral domains and local rings. A valuation ring is Noetherian if and only if it is a discrete valuation ring or a field. (Thus, the statement above is true for Noetherian valuation rings) An integral domain is a valuation ring if and only if it is a B√©zout ring and a local ring. [Proposition 1.5, Krull] A local ring is a B√©zout domain if and only if it is a valuation ring. A B√©zout domain is a Pr√ºfer domain.

(Converse direction ""A finitely generated torsion-free module $M$ over a Pr√ºfer domain $R$ is projective."" proven in textbook [Theorem 2.7, Modules over Non-Noetherian Domains by Fuchs & Salce, original result proven by Kaplansky]) The conclusion I have from all the statements above is: $$\{ \textit{discrete valuation ring} \} \supset \{ \textit{valuation ring} \} \supset \{ \textit{local rings} \} \cap \{ \textit{B√©zout rings} \} \supset \{ \textit{local rings} \}  \cap \{ \textit{Pr√ºfer domain}\}$$ and any ring in any collection above will make the statement true. The subquestions I am currently thinking about in hopes to answer the question above: If $R$ is a local domain, then is $R$ a Pr√ºfer domain? If this is true, then we are done. If it is not true, I am hoping to construct a counter-example...

\min_x \frac{1}{2} x^TP^TAPx+\frac{\gamma}{2} x^T(I-P)^T(I-P)x-x^TP^Tb
$$ And since $P$ is a projection matrix, it is symmetric and idempotent, it can be simplified to: $$
\min_x \frac{1}{2} x^T(PAP+\gamma(I-P))x-x^TPb
$$ This results in an unconstrained optimization, and the result is obtained by solving: $$(PAP+\gamma(I-P))x=Pb$$ This formulation is particularly handy because the matrix $(PAP+\gamma(I-P))$ is still positive definite for any positive $\gamma$ value (which is in fact the eigenvalues of the constraint subspace), so it can be solved numerically using the conjugate gradient method. In practice, it works very well, but to be honest, I don't know if there is a flaw in my intuition, and I haven't found any resources on the subject.

I may assume the shape paramter $k\in\mathbb{R}_+$ and the sample mean $\bar{x}$ , but not the sample variance, are known. To avoid confusion the Gamma(k, $\theta$ ) density function used here is $f(x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(k) \theta^k} x^{k-1} e^{-\frac{x}{\theta}}.$ I am trying to calculate the Maximum-Likelihood Estimator $\hat{\theta}$ and then find an asymptotic 95% Confidence Interval for that estimate. The MLE was no problem but I'm not sure about the asymptotic CI and would be very grateful, for corrections if I made a mistake there.

After some google searches, I have stumbled upon Sequential Quadratic Programming which (from what I've read off of Wikipedia) would allow one to numerically estimate solutions to nonlinear programming problems. Furthermore, I have found that since this problem involves both inequality and equality constraints, the usual method of Lagrange multipliers may not be sufficient, and that after an optimal solution is found numerically, checking it with the KKT conditions would verify its optimality(though not a necessary condition since my function is non-convex). As a result, it would be great if someone could direct me to any programs which could carry out these calculations or implement these algorithms for me, and also explain how to apply the KKT conditions here to verify the calculations after such numerical estimates have been made. I am very new to optimization, only just familiar with Lagrange multipliers, so please let me know if I have made mistakes or misunderstood something.

4610818,"Prove that $p_n\to 1/2,$ and $q_n/(1/4)^n\to -1$","Here is problem 10 of 13th Annual Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament Team Round A 2010 Call a 2n-digit base-10 number special if we can split its digits into two multisets of size n such that the sum of the numbers in the two sets is the same. Let $p_n$ be the probability that a randomly chosen 2n-digit number is special. We allow leading zeroes in 2n-digit numbers. Prove that $p_n\to 1/2$ as $n\to\infty$ . Let $q_n=p_n-1/2.$ Prove that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} q_n/(1/4)^n = -1.$ There is an official solution to this problem, though I don't understand it fully. I was therefore thinking of requesting an answer here in the hopes that I'd understand it better. For convenience, here is a link to the official solution. To reiterate, it is not necessary to answer all of the questions I ask here, though it may be easier than coming up with an alternative solution to this problem. The main thing I don't understand about the solution to part a is why their proof shows that $p_n$ converges to $1/2$ . The proof of the second part of this question given in the official solution is quite hard for me to understand. In particular, I have the following questions about the solution. It seems that I can't fully understand the proof of part (a), which is why I can't seem to prove claims that follow from a similar argument to part 1 in this question. Edit: I've removed some previous questions so that this post no longer has as many questions. Why is a number good if it has any odd digits? Again, this seems similar to the proof of part a). If there are no odd digits, why does the sum being divisible by 4 imply the number is good? The only change from the official solution that I think should be made is that 8-k should be replaced with 4-k. Here is my take of the case where the sum of the digits is congruent to 0 modulo 4 and all the digits are even, where balancing argument A refers to Apass.Jack's final algorithm in his solution: Also, even if there are no odd digits, if the sum of the digits is divisible by 4, then the number is balanced. Indeed, in this case, the number of even numbers congruent to 2 modulo 4 must be even. We first set aside 10 occurrences of the digits 0,4,6,8. We then perform balancing argument A on the remaining digits, which still have a sum congruent to 0 modulo 4. Then if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the resulting sets of digits, and $s_i$ denotes the sum of all numbers in $S_i$ for $i=1,2,$ we have $s_1 + s_2 \equiv 0\mod 4$ and both $s_1$ and $s_2$ are even, so $s_1 - s_2\equiv -2s_2\equiv 0\mod 4.$ Let $d = |s_1-s_2|.$ Suppose $s_1 \leq s_2$ . We now add $(10-d/2)/2$ occurrences of the two numbers 4 and 6 and $(10+d/2)/2$ occurrences of the two numbers 0 and 8 to $S_1$ . Finally, we add $(10+d/2)/2$ occurrences of the two numbers 4 and 6 and $(10-d/2)/2$ occurrences of 0 and 8 to $S_2.$ Then the difference between the new sums $s_1$ and $s_2$ is now zero.","['contest-math', 'elementary-number-theory', 'calculus', 'combinatorics', 'probability']"
4610832,How to solve a second order ODE with Dirac delta inhomogeneity?,"I am working with the following second order ODE \begin{equation}
y''(x) - q¬≤ y(x) = F \delta(x - x_0)
\end{equation} on the domain $-L/2$ to $+L/2$ without specifying any boundary conditions for now. The solution to this problem I found in the literature is \begin{equation}
y(x) = A \cosh(qx) + B \sinh(qx) + \frac{F}{2q} e^{q|x-x_0|} .
\end{equation} However, I can not reconstruct this result. I am not sure how to split the solution into two parts before and after the Dirac spike.
Here is how far I have come:
The solution to the homogeneous equation can be obtained from the Ansatz \begin{equation}
y(x) = A e^{-qx} + B e^{qx} .
\end{equation} For the non-homogeneous equation I try variation of parameters starting from \begin{equation}
y(x) = C(x) e^{-qx} + D(x) e^{qx} .
\end{equation} Plugging this Ansatz into the ODE and introducing the constrain $C'(x) e^{-qx} + D'(x) e^{qx} = 0$ allows me to solve for the coefficients $C'(x)$ and $D'(x)$ \begin{equation}
C'(x) = - \frac{F}{2q} \delta(x - x_0) e^{qx} \quad \text{and} \quad D'(x) = \frac{F}{2q} \delta(x - x_0) e^{-qx} .
\end{equation} Integrating these equations then gives \begin{equation}
C(x_0) = - \frac{F}{2q} e^{qx_0} \quad \text{and} \quad D(x_0) = \frac{F}{2q} e^{-qx_0},
\end{equation} which do not depend on $x$ anymore, but only $x_0$ . This can now be used to obtain the full solution to the ODE \begin{equation}
y(x) = A e^{-qx} + B e^{qx} + \frac{F}{2q} \left( e^{q(x - x_0)} - e^{q(x_0 - x)} \right) .
\end{equation} I think the homogeneous part of mine is somewhat similar to the solution from the literature. I am more concerned what I missed in constructing the last term. Does anyone have any ideas on this?","['dirac-delta', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

The case $n=3, S=\{0\}$ This question was motivated by the question about existence of a bounded non-constant function $f:\mathbb Z^3 \to \mathbb R$ that is discrete harmonic except at the origin $(0,0,0)$ . An example of $f\in F(3,\{0\})$ is $f_1(x)$ equal to the probability that a symmetric 3D random walk starting from $x$ hits the origin. It can then be asked if all functions in $F(3,\{0\})$ can be obtained as linear combinations of $f_1(x)$ and the constant function $f_0(x)=1$ . The case $S=\{0\}$ For $n=1$ and $n=2$ the question is closely related to the related question with $S=\emptyset$ . A random walk in 1D and 2D is guaranteed to return to the origin. This suggest that $d(1,\{0\})=d(2,\{0\})=1$ . For $n\geq 3$ it is no more guaranteed that the random walk will be absorbed in at the origin and so there is at least one more dimension associated the ""value of never returning"".

4610971,Which matrices can be embedded in flows?,"I've been thinking about matrices, recently, and wondering about a fairly simple but maybe hard-to-answer question. A real $n\times n$ matrix $A$ yields a discrete dynamical system on $\mathbb{R}^n$ , where from time $n$ to time $n + 1$ the vector $\mathbf{x}$ jumps to the vector $A\mathbf{x}$ . Under what conditions on $A$ can we ""interpolate"" this to a continuous-time dynamical system, i.e., find some vector field $\mathbf{X}$ such that the time-one flow of $\mathbf{X}$ takes any vector $\mathbf{x}$ to $A\mathbf{x}$ ? Here is what I think I know (but please correct me if I'm wrong). A smooth homomorphism $\phi\colon \mathbb{R} \to \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{R})$ always takes the form $t \mapsto e^{tB}$ for some $B \in \text{M}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ . Thus, there exists a flow through matrices whose time-one map equals $A$ if and only if $A = e^B$ for some matrix $B \in \text{M}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ . There are known conditions specifying when this is true; for instance, a paper by Walter Culver titled ""On the Existence and Uniqueness of the Real Logarithm of a Matrix"" says that such a $B$ exists if and only if $A$ is nonsingular, and each Jordan block of $A$ belonging to a negative eigenvalue occurs an even number of times. But do there exist matrices $A$ which are not the exponential of some other real matrix, but nevertheless are the time-one map of some more complicated, non-linear, flow? Thus, we are looking for a smooth homomorphism $\phi\colon \mathbb{R} \to \text{Diff}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ such that $\phi(1) = A$ , or equivalently (I think), a not-necessarily-linear vector field $\mathbf{X}$ whose time-one flow equals $A$ . By the way, I don't need this for any work I'm doing; I just got curious. In terms of my level, I went to grad school for math, but it was years ago and I don't remember things as well as I should. Thanks in advance for your help! Edit: As Alp Uzman points out in his answer, if $A$ embeds in a nonlinear flow, then clearly $A$ must commute with nonlinear diffeomorphisms. By Kopell‚Äôs Theorem (again, see Uzman‚Äôs answer), this is not possible if $A$ is a contraction and certain conditions on its eigenvalues hold. In dimension 1, the possibilities for diffeomorphisms commuting with any smooth contraction $f$ (not necessarily a linear map) are quite restricted, thanks to Kopell‚Äôs Lemma. It‚Äôs natural to ask whether this result can be generalized to higher dimensions.

Show that $S$ is contained in the Wielandt subgroup $\omega(G)$ of $G$ Note : $\omega(G) = \bigcap N_G(H)$ , where $H$ runs over the subnormal subgroups of $G$ . Here's my attempt: We know (from this paper by Wielandt ) that $\omega(G)$ contains every minimal normal subgroup of $G$ (as stated in the Encyclopedia of Math on the Wielandt subgroup). So it would suffice to prove that $S \subset \operatorname{Soc}(G)$ , since this is the subgroup generated by such minimal normal subgroups. Suppose, then, that this is not true. Then, we must have, by the simplicity of $S$ , $S\cap \operatorname{Soc}(G) = 1$ , which implies $S \cap M = 1$ for all minimal normal subgroups $M$ of $G$ .

Also they didn't do $A = PDP^T$ instead they did $A = PDP^{-1}$ . Can anyone help me understand?","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'orthogonality', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'symmetric-matrices']"
4611026,"Set Theory - Cardinality - Having trouble ""building"" functions","While not a specific problem, trying to prove the cardinality of one set is equal to that of another one leaves me puzzled and confused. After looking at several problems and solutions, I don't know how to define an inverse function that satisfies (meaning, I'm having trouble thinking of such a function.) For example:
Prove that the sets below have equal cardinality: $\lbrace f:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \lbrace 0,1\rbrace\rbrace, 
\text{and}\ 
\lbrace f:\mathbb{N} \to \lbrace 0,1\rbrace, \text{such that there's no}\ f(i) = f(i+1) = 0\rbrace$ What can I do in order to understand better? I'll be glad to hear what your experiences with this kind of problem are (function building).","['functions', 'set-theory']"
4611052,"In the group $G=\langle r,s,t\mid r^2=s^3=t^3=rst\rangle,$ the element $rst$ has order $2$","Formally, if $F$ is the free group with basis $X = \{r, s, t\}$ and $N$ is the normal subgroup generated by $R = \{r^2 s^{-3}, s^3 t^{-3}, t^{3} (rst)^{-1}\}$ , and $G = F/N$ , I want to show that the coset of $rst$ has order $2$ in $G$ . There are two parts to this: showing $rstrst = 1$ and showing $rst \neq 1$ . There must be some way to play with and combine the relations in just the right way to get $rstrst = 1$ , but it seems difficult to get inverses to even appear in the right places and amounts to cancel all the $r, s, t$ of positive exponent. So far I know $r^2 = s^3 = t^3 = rst = str = trs$ , $r = st$ , $s^2 = tr$ , $t^2 = rs$ , and so I try at random some manipulations like $rstrst = t^2 s^2 r = (s^{-1}r)^2 (rt^{-1})^2 (t^2 s^{-1}) = \cdots$ or similar, which has just resulted in wandering about aimlessly. On the other hand, to show $rst \neq 1$ , I have previously shown that $G/\langle rst \rangle \cong A_4$ , so I could exhibit a property that is different between $G$ and $A_4$ to say that $rst \neq 1$ , but such a property might already rely on $rst$ being not $1$ to demonstrate, as the groups share all other defining relations. Proving $rst \neq 1$ directly by showing $rst \notin N$ in $F$ seems way too messy, since the elements of $N$ are words on the conjugates of $R$ .","['group-presentation', 'combinatorial-group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'free-groups', 'group-theory']"
4611054,Show positivity of a function of two variables in the unit square.,"Let $$
f(x,y) =  x^3 (1 + y + y^2) + y^2 \Big[x^2  (5 + 2 y) + x  (-6 - 4 y + y^2) +  (1 + 3 y + y^2)\Big] 
$$ Show that $f(x,y) \ge 0 $ for $0\le x \le 1$ and $0\le y \le 1$ . Numerical evaluations seem to support the claim.  This is a cubic function in $x$ with one negative coefficient in the linear term, all other coefficients are positive. Since $f(x=0) > 0$ , the last two terms guarantee positivity for $0 < x < 1/6$ . The last three terms show a quadratic function which has its minimum always for $x^* \in [0 \quad 1]$ ,  namely at $x^* = \frac{6 + 4 y - y^2}{10 + 4 y }$ ; however, for small $y$ , the value of the sum of the three last terms is negative at $x^*$ .

4611065,Are there reasons to prefer one definition of the exponential function over the other?,"This question is motivated by curiosity and  I haven't much background to exhibit . Going through a couple of books dealing with real analysis, I've noticed that 2 definitions can be given of the exponential function known in algebra as $f(x)= e^x$ . One definition says : The exponential function is the unique function defined on $\mathbb R$ such that $f(0)=1$ and $\forall (x) [   f'(x)= f(x)] $ . The other one defines the exponential function as the inverse of the natural logarithm function . More precisely $(1)$ $\exp_a (x)$ is defined as the inverse of $\log_a (x)$ , $(2)$ then , $\exp_a (x)$ is shown to be identical to $a^x$ , and finally $(3)$ every function of the form : $a^x$ is shown to be a "" special case"" of the $e^x$ function. My question : (1) Do these definitions exhaust the ways the exponential function can be defined? (2) Are these definitions actually different at least conceptually  ( though denoting in fact the same object)? (3) Is there a reason to prefer one definition over the other? What is each definition good for?","['calculus', 'definition', 'exponential-function', 'real-analysis']"
