4290758,Factoring $4x^2-2xy-4x+3y-3$. Why isn't it working?,"I want to factorise the following expression. $$4x^2-2xy-4x+3y-3$$ Here are the ways I tried $$4x^2-2xy-4x+3y-3=\left(2x-\frac y2\right)^2+3y-3-\frac{y^2}{4}-4x=\left(2x-\frac y2\right)^2+\frac{12y-12-y^2}{4}-4x=\left(2x-\frac y2\right)^2-\frac 14(y^2-12y+12)-4x$$ Now I need to factor the quadratic $y^2-12y+12$ . So, I calculated discriminant $$D=12^2-4\times 12=96\implies \sqrt D=4\sqrt 6.$$ This means that the multipliers of quadratic are not rational.  So I don't know how to proceed anymore.","['contest-math', 'factoring', 'polynomials', 'algebra-precalculus', 'quadratics']"
4290784,Proof the existence of two roots in $(x-1)\ln y=\ln x$ when $y \neq e$,"Problem statement Proof that $y^x\cdot x$ and $yx^2$ for $x, y \ge 1$ have a single intersection point when $y \ge e$ or $y=1$ and at least two when $1<y<e$ . I am not sure if my reasoning has flaws, how to finish it or if there is any other more elegant/simpler way of proving it. I am studying the behavior of these two functions, i.e. when is $y^x\cdot x>yx^2$ . After graphing it, I have seen that in some regimes, one is greater than the other but not after a specific point. I can prove that there is a single solution for $y=e$ but I struggle to prove the other fact. Attempt $$y^x\cdot x=yx^2\ \overset{x\ge1}{\rightarrow}\ y^x=yx$$ Fixing $y$ to $k$ (for clarity of the reasoning): $$k^x=kx\ \rightarrow x\ln k=\ln k + \ln x$$ $$(x-1)\ln k = \ln x$$ And this is not further simplificable, so we have to find where a line intersects the logarithm function. Case 1: $y=e$ Observing that the derivative of $\ln x$ at $x=1$ is $(x-1)\ln y$ for $y=e$ , and the fact that the derivative of a function at a point is the tangent line at that point, this is the only intersection point. Proof: $f(x)=\ln x,\ f(1)=0 \rightarrow f'(x)=\frac{1}{x};\ f'(1)=1 \rightarrow \int f'(x)|_{x=1}\mathrm{d}x=x+c\overset{f(1)=0}{=}x-1 = (x-1)\ln e\quad \blacksquare$ Case 2: $y\neq e$ Here I tried to find a closed expression of the points by Taylor expansion and then find the roots via Ruffini but $f(x)=\ln x$ is not well defined at $x=1$ . Another idea was to try random points below and above $x=1$ and see what approximate root I found via Newton, but neither option seemed feasible. After thinking and playing with the graph a bit more, I realized that $x=1$ is like the z-rotation axis of the line $(x-1)\ln y$ so I decided to go this way: Fact #1: $x=1$ is a trivial solution of $(x-1)\ln y = \ln x\quad\forall\ y\in[1,\infty)$ Proof: $\ln x|_{x=1}\ln 1 = 0 = 0\ln y=(x-1)\ln y|_{x=1}\quad \blacksquare$ . Fact #2: both functions are strictly monotonically increasing.... and I guess this is relevant? And here is pretty much where I am stuck.","['multivariable-calculus', 'proof-writing', 'solution-verification']"

4290812,low $p$-value and low explained variation connection in multiple regression analysis,"I've just started studying multiple linear regression and I'm stuck at creating a dataset for which a multiple regression model would have a low $p$ -value (the coefficients are non zero) and also low explained variation $R^2$ . The following is what I've come up. To create a dataset with low explained variation it is necessary that the output variable is not in linear correspondence with the predictor variables. very low $p$ -value of coefficients it is necessary that the coefficients are non zero. If predictors are independent the coefficient $i$ th $a_i$ is equal to $\rho(X_i,Y)$ (correlation between $X_i$ and $Y$ ). If $X_i$ and $Y$ are not connected by linear relation, the coefficient $\rho$ is almost zero so this scenario has to be excluded. On the other hand, if I define $Y$ so has to have linear relation to $X_i$ for every $i$ , the condition on explained variation not holds anymore. However, if the predictors are not independent, although I know the formula for the coefficients, it's not very clear to me how to proceed.","['linear-regression', 'statistics', 'regression-analysis']"

4290850,Doubts on roster notation of sets,"Simple examples of sets are often described via roster notation (aka enumeration notation) like $\{0,1,4,9\}$ -  simply write down the elements of the set between the two set delimiters (curly brackets) and separate them by commas. In axiomatic set theory this notation also occurs in the Axiom of Pairing: For any $a$ and $b$ there exists a set $\{a, b\}$ that contains exactly $a$ and $b$ . It is then easy to see that $\{a, b\} =  \{b, a\}$ . More generally one can usually read that ordering and multiple listing of the elements in roster notation is irrelevant, for example we have $\{0,1,2\} = \{1,0,2,1,0\}$ . In axiomatic set theory the concept of an ordered pair $(a,b)$ is not introduced by a separate axiom, but it is somehow defined based on the existing axioms, for example by $(a,b) = \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ . More generally, the concept of an ordered tuple $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ can be introduced in that way. Here are my doubts: It seems to me that roster notation is based on an intuitively pre-existing concept of an ordered tuple . Writing down elements sequentially from left to right does not really produce a set, but a tuple. We then have a certain equivalence relation for such tuples which says us when to regard two tuples as the ""same set"". But set theory should not be based on such an intuitive prerequisite. In fact even the axiom of pairing is based on an intuitive concept of a pair. Later re-introducing this concept via a definition seems to be circular. One might argue that $\{a,b\}$ is short for $\{x : x = a \vee x = b\}$ . But even in this notation we actually have a pair of conditions, separated by a $\vee$ instead of a comma. Yes, $x = a \vee x = b$ and $x = b \vee x = a$ are equivalent, but alone to state this fact requires an intuitive understanding of ""ordering"" which axiomatic set theory claims to be reducible to more elementary concepts. In other words: We start with an intuitive concept of pairs or tuples as ingredients of the axioms and later ""cleanly"" re-introduce these concepts using the axioms based on the same (but beforehand unclean) concept. My question: Usually roster notation occurs at the very beginning of texts on set theory. But it involves ingredients which are not really available in a precise sense at that point: Finite sequences of elements, i.e. ordered tuples Permutations of ordered tuples A reduction process eliminating duplicates in tuples One can argue that at the beginning an intuitive understanding of these ingredients is sufficient to get the idea what roster notation means. The precise meaning will be clear after having introduced the necessary ingredients via an axiomatic approach. But the Axiom of Pairing involves roster notation before the above ingredients have been properly defined. Is this a vicious circle? Do we need a new axiomatic approach avoiding this problem? More precisely, do we need an additional axiomatic concept of an ordered pair?","['elementary-set-theory', 'motivation']"

These above sums were determined by using the Mittag-Leffler expansion of $\csc (z)$ , i.e $\csc(z) = \frac{1}{z} + 2z \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n \frac{1}{z^2 - \left(\pi n\right)^2}$ and substituting it into the integral $\int_{0}^{\pi/m} x \csc (x) \, dx$ If one uses the following other method, we can determine the odd and even terms of the sums $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( 4n \, \text{arccoth} \, (4n)-1\right) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{G}{\pi}- \frac{1}{4} \ln (2)$$ $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( (4n-2) \, \text{arccoth} \, (4n-2) - 1\right) = \frac{G}{\pi} - \frac{1}{4} \ln (2)$$ $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(6n \, \text{arccoth} \, (6n) - 1\right) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2\pi} \, \text{Cl}_2 \left( \frac{\pi}{3}\right)$$ $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( (6n-3) \, \text{arccoth} \, (6n-3) - 1\right) = \frac{1}{\pi} \, \text{Cl}_2 \, \left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) - \frac{1}{4} \ln(3)$$ $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( 8n \, \text{arccoth} \, (8n) - 1\right) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{\pi} \, \text{Cl}_2 \, \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \frac{1}{4} \ln (2-\sqrt{2})$$ $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( (8n-4) \, \text{arccoth} \, (8n-4) - 1\right) = \frac{2}{\pi} \, \text{Cl}_2 \, \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \frac{G}{\pi} - \frac{1}{4} \ln(2+\sqrt{2})$$ EDIT I am now interested in $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(m n \, \text{arccoth} \, (m n) - 1\right)$$ for $|m|>1$ as asked here. Here is how I originally proved it for the odd terms: For the first odd term sum, begin with the known result $$2G = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} x \csc (x) \, dx$$ then integrate by parts to get: $$2G = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \ln \left(\cot (x) + \csc (x) \right) \, dx = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \ln (\cos (x) + 1) \, dx - \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \ln (\sin (x)) \,dx$$ Then use the well-known result $\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \ln (\sin(x)) \,dx = - \frac{\pi}{2} \ln (2)$ and use the identity $\cos (x) + 1 = 2 \cos^2\left( \frac{x}{2}\right)$ and make the substitution $\frac{x}{2} = u$ . $$\implies 2G - \pi \ln (2) = 4 \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \ln (\cos (u)) \, du$$ Now use the Weierstrass product for $\cos (z)$ , namely $\cos(z) = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(1-\frac{4z^2}{\pi^2 (2n-1)^2}\right)$ to obtain: $$2G - \pi \ln (2) = 4 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \ln \left( 1-\frac{4u^2}{\pi^2 (2n-1)^2}\right) \, du$$ After integrating, obtain $\pi \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \ln \left(1-\frac{1}{4(1-2n)^2}\right) = -\frac{\pi}{2} \ln (2)$ and the result quickly follows. The other odd sums are the same idea. The even sums just comes from combining the two results from the alternating sum and the odd term sum.","['integration', 'calculus', 'analysis', 'sequences-and-series']"

A Riemannian metric $g$ is Hermitian if for any $X,Y \in T_p\mathcal{M}$ , $p\in \mathcal{M}$ , we have $g(J(X),J(Y)) = g(X, Y) $ . We assume that the almost complex structure acts as $J\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}\right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{\mu}}$ , $J\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{\mu}}\right) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}$ , so that $

J\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}^{\mu}}\right) = -i \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}^{\mu}}
$ The above condition then forces $g_{\mu \nu} = g_{\bar{\mu}\bar{\nu}} = 0$ . Looking at the metric expansion, we see that this means $g_{\mu \nu}^{(1)} = g_{\mu \nu}^{(4)}$ , while $g_{\mu \nu}^{(2)} = - g_{\mu \nu}^{(3)}$ , in this basis. Using these results, we find that \begin{eqnarray}

&=& \frac{1}{2} \left( h_{\mu \bar{\nu}}\, dz^{\mu} \otimes d\bar{z}^{\nu} + h_{\bar{\nu} \mu} \, d\bar{z}^{\nu} \otimes dz^{\mu} \right)
\end{eqnarray} Where we call $h_{\mu \bar{\nu}} = \overline{h_{\bar{\nu}\mu}}$ the Hermitian metric on $\mathcal{M}$ . QUESTION Is the above relationship between $h_{\mu \bar{\nu}}$ and $G_{MN}$ correct, and why is it that $\det(G_{MN}) = (\det(h_{\mu \bar{\nu}}))^2$ ? Here is an attempt at an answer. Let $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , $D$ be $n \times n$ matrices.
Then if $C$ , $D$ commute , we have the identity \begin{equation}
\label{det:identity}
\det
\begin{pmatrix}
    A & B \\
    C & D
\end{pmatrix}
= \det(AD - BC)
\end{equation} Using the decomposition of $G_{MN}$ , we find that \begin{eqnarray}
\label{det-G}
\det\left(G_{MN}\right)
&=& \det\left(g_{\mu\nu}^{(1)}g_{\nu\lambda}^{(4)} - g_{\mu\nu}^{2}g_{\nu\lambda}^{3}\right)
= \det\left( \left(g_{\mu\nu}^{(1)}\right)^2 + \left(g_{\mu\nu}^{(2)}\right)^2\right)
\\
&=& \det\left( g_{\mu\nu}^{(1)} + i g_{\mu\nu}^{(2)}\right) \det\left( g_{\mu\nu}^{(1)} - i g_{\mu\nu}^{(2)}\right)
\end{eqnarray} The second equality above comes from the identifications due to hermitian condition described above. The RHS of the last equation is $\det\left(h_{\mu\bar{\nu}}\right) \det\left(h_{\bar{\nu}\mu}\right)$ and we have seen that $h_{\bar{\nu}\mu}=\overline{h_{\mu \bar{\nu}}}$ . So we find that $$ \det\left(G_{MN}\right) = \left|\det\left(h_{\mu\bar{\nu}}\right)\right|^2 $$ or $\det\left(h_{\mu \bar{\nu}}\right) = \sqrt{\det\left(G_{MN}\right)}$ if $h_{\mu \bar{\nu}}$ is real. Problems: $g^{(2)}$ , $g^{(3)}$ do not necessarily commute. But perhaps it is true that these components are somehow required to vanish -- maybe due to the requirement that $\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{\nu}} \}$ form an /orthonormal basis/ -- so that $h_{\mu \bar{\nu}} = g_{\mu \nu}^{(1)}$ .","['complex-geometry', 'almost-complex', 'kahler-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

However, I recently stumbled across a link between probability distribution and physical behavior in this video on the heat equation and this video on the Fokker-Planck equation.  I was kind of surprised by this, because probability distributions are abstract, mathematical concepts, while heat evolution and gas diffusion exist in the physical world. How should this fact that partial differential equation solutions describe both probability distributions and physical phenomena such as heat and gas be understood?  Does this occurrence indicate that the evolution of the physical phenomenon is being driven by that probability distribution under the hood?  Is it a coincidence that they both exemplify the same behavior?  Would this be a prime example of ""The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics"" as described by Eugene Wigner? How seriously should one take finding something like the above ""flashlight"" pattern when playing around with probability distributions?

4291260,Defining a log spiral from three points,"Let us have three points: $p_0 = (0,0)$ , $p_1 = (a,0)$ and $p_2=(b,c)$ . (We can assume that $b<a$ .) I want to define a log spiral (in polar space) of the form $r=r_0e^{k\theta}$ from some $center=(x,y)$ that passes through the three points. We can assume the spiral passes through $p_0$ when $\theta = 0$ , so that $r_0^2=x^2+y^2$ . We must compute values for $r_0$ , $k$ and another parameter that would allows us to find $centre$ . It is easy to setup a system of equations to represent the problem, but it is very ugly, and I am not sure how to solve it computationally. For example, if $\theta_0 = cos^{-1}[(r_0^2 + r_1^2 - a^2)/2r_0r_1]$ and $\theta_1 = cos^{-1}[(r_0^2 + r_2^2 - d^2)/2r_0r_2]$ , where $d^2=b^2+c^2$ , we can have equations, such as: $r_1 = r_0e^{k\theta_0} = r_0e^{k\times cos^{-1}[(r_0^2 + r_1^2 - a^2)/2r_0r_1]}$ $r_2 = r_0e^{k\theta_1} = r_0e^{k\times cos^{-1}[(r_0^2 + r_2^2 - d^2)/2r_0r_2]}$ and another uglier equation involving the angle $\theta_2$ between $p_1$ and $p_2$ : $r_2 = r_1e^{k\theta_2}$ . There must be a better way of setting the equations to solve the problem, involving a better representation of the problem, for example a complex representation, or some clever geometry. EDIT: Complex Representation We can represents the points in the complex plan as: $p_0 = 0$ , $p_1 = a$ and $p_2=b + ci$ . Then, the problem is equivalent to finding two complex numbers z and s such that the graph of the complex-valued function over the reals $z^\theta + s$ passes through the points. z should not be a muliple of $e^i$ , in which case it will reduce to a circle.

4291290,What determines how to treat single variable PDEs and thus their constants of integration?,"When solving a first-order ODE (perhaps there is also a way to extend this to a higher order ODE) for $y(x)$ , it is possible to shift perspective and consider $x$ to be a function of $y$ by manipulating the differential forms.  For example, $\frac{dy}{dx} = h(y)$ can be solved as $\frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{1}{h(y)}$ , which may be easier.  The moral of the story, very crudely stated, seems to be that derivatives are slopes, and we can inquire about the slope of any variable with respect to any other, regardless of which variables are ""actually independent"" at the end of the day. When solving a first-order PDE such as $u_t + 2xu_x = 0$ , one of the steps involves considering either $\frac{dt}{dx}$ or $\frac{dx}{dt}$ , even though both $x$ and $t$ are independent variables, which I'm fine with due to the above paragraph.  However, either of these derivatives are situated within a horizontal slice of $\mathbb{R}^3$ , where $u$ is the dimension orthogonal to that slice.  Thus these derivatives should technically be partials, and the ""ODEs"" they create technically single variable PDEs, and more importantly, the constant of integration encountered when we solve either of these ""ODEs"" should be a function of $u$ .  In this particular problem (solved using the choices made in the above timestamped video), we would get $x = K(u)e^{2t}$ , which produces the correct solution $u = f(xe^{-2t})$ after dividing through by $e^{2t}$ and taking $K^{-1}$ of both sides.  In other solution methods for first-order PDEs, constants are explicitly written as functions . Does thinking about the constant of integration as a function in the context of first-order PDEs always work as it does here, or is this a coincidence?  If not, then why is it correct to use a genuine constant here instead of a function of the dimension not involved in the derivative?  Again, I'm drawing the conclusion from the first paragraph that $u$ not ""actually"" being an independent variable makes little difference in this context. For separation of variables problems, it is similarly common to shorthand partial derivatives as ordinary derivatives once things are separated.  For example, if the PDE is $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0$ , and thus one of the separated equations is $Y_{yy} = \lambda Y$ , we often pretend this is the same thing as $Y'' = \lambda Y$ .  However, we are really solving the former, which takes place within a $2$ -dimensional slice of $\mathbb{R}^3$ , not the latter, which takes place within $\mathbb{R}^2$ .  Thus, if we solve it by guessing the particular solution $Y = e^{\sqrt\lambda y}$ and finding the general solution via reduction of order , it seems like we should, for both integrations that occur within reduction of order, write the constants as arbitrary functions of $x$ , since integrating within a ""constant $x$ slice"" of $\mathbb{R}^3$ should yield that arbitrary function.  Why is it correct to use a genuine constant here? Is there a systematic way to decide when integration constants in a three-dimensional problem should be functions, or does it come down to memorizing the decisions presented along with each solution method?","['surfaces', '3d', 'functions', 'partial-differential-equations', 'constants']"

4291396,Stokes' theorem on the 2-sphere,"Consider the 2-sphere $\mathbb{S}^2\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ so that it can be parametrized locally by the spherical coordinates $(\theta,\phi)$ , i.e., $\hat{n} = (\sin \theta \cos \phi, \sin \theta \sin \phi, \cos\theta)$ . Let me define locally a 1-form by $$
A = \frac{1}{2}(1-\cos\theta )d\phi
$$ It's clear (I think) that $A$ can be extended to a smooth 1-form on $\mathbb{S}^2$ .  Now let's say I have a simple closed contour $\gamma$ in $\mathbb{S}^2$ such that $\gamma (s) = (\theta_0, s)$ where $\theta_0$ is constant in this context and $s\in [0,2\pi]$ . Then it's not hard to see that $$
\oint_\gamma A= \pi(1-\cos\theta_0)
$$ Now by Stokes' theorem, it seems that $\gamma$ is the boundary of the ""upper-sphere"" parametrized by $0<\theta < \theta_0$ and $\phi \in (0,2\pi)$ and thus we can apply Stokes' theorem so that $$
\oint_\gamma A = \int_\text{upper} dA = \frac{1}{2} \int_\text{upper} \sin \theta d\theta d\phi
$$ Notice that $\sin \theta d\theta d\phi$ is the induced surface measure and thus the RHS is just the solid angle $\Omega(\text{upper})$ enclosed by $\gamma$ divided by 2, i.e., $=\Omega(\text{upper})/2$ . Now this is all good so far. However, one can although think of $-\gamma$ (reversed orientation) as the boundary of the ""lower sphere"", i.e., that parametrized by $\theta_0 <\theta<\pi$ . In this case, you would think that you could apply Stokes' theorem again so that $$
\oint_\gamma A = -\oint_{-\gamma} A = -\int_\text{lower} dA = -\frac{\Omega(\text{lower})}{2}
$$ However, this obviously can't be true since this would imply that the solid angle of the entire 2-sphere is $$
\Omega(\text{upper}) +\Omega(\text{lower})=0
$$ I think this is somehow related to the Chern number, but I don't quite understand where I went wrong in my reasoning. EDIT . After a closer look, it seems that $A$ might not be well-defined near the south pole, i.e., $\theta = \pi$ . Indeed, near the south pole, it seems that $A\sim d\phi$ which would mean any sufficiently small contour around the south pole would give $\oint_\gamma  A = 2\pi$ and does not converge to zero.

4291668,"Proof verification: if $f$ is a solution of $(y')^2+y^2=1$ that is defined over $\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ attains at least one of $1,-1$ as a value.","Context : I'd like to prove that for any pair of numbers $(x_0,y_0)$ with $|y_0|\leq 1$ , the initial value problem $$(y')^2+y^2=1,y(x_0)=y_0$$ will have infinitely many solutions that are defined over $\mathbb{R}$ . In my analysis of the differential equation, I've determined that it locally has exactly two solutions when $|y_0|<1$ , each a sine wave, and that these ""branch off"", so to speak, to infinitely many when their graphs reach $\pm 1$ . Since I'm interested in solutions defined over $\mathbb{R}$ , I can prove the infinitude of solutions by showing that any $\mathbb R$ -defined solution attains either $1$ or $-1$ as a value. Problem : if $f$ is a $\mathbb R$ -defined solution of $(y')^2+y^2=1$ , is it true that $f(x_0)=1$ or $f(x_0)=-1$ for some $x_0\in\mathbb R$ ? I've been thinking about this problem for a while now, and believe I have conceived of an argument that proves the answer is yes. Here it is: Proof : suppose, for the sake of finding a contradiction, that $f$ is a $\mathbb R$ -defined solution of $(y')^2+y^2=1$ that never attains $1$ nor $-1$ as a value. Since the differential equation implies that $f$ must satisfy $-1\leq f(x)\leq 1$ for every $x\in\mathbb R$ , it follows from our assumption that $-1<f(x)<1$ for every $x$ , or $\left|f(x)\right|<1$ . Note that the ODE is equivalent to $|y'|=\sqrt{1-y^2}$ , so $\left|f(x)\right|<1$ and the fact that $\sqrt{1-t^2}>0$ when $|t|<1$ implies that $|f'(x)|>0$ for every $x$ . This yields the following result: Result 1 : For any $x$ , either $f'(x)>0$ or $f'(x)<0$ . For what follows, we'll need to strengthen Result $1$ to the following: Result 2 : $f'$ is either strictly positive or strictly negative. Proof : From Result $1$ , we have that either $f'(0)>0$ or $f'(0)<0$ . Suppose $f'(0)>0$ and pick any $x_1\neq 0$ . From Result $1$ , it follows that either $f'(x_1)>0$ or $f'(x_1)<0$ . Notice that it is not possible for $f'(x_1)<0$ to be true because Darboux's theorem would then imply that $f'(c)=0$ for some $c$ between $0$ and $x_1$ , contradicting Result $1$ . Thus, $f'(x_1)>0$ ; since $x_1$ was arbitrary, this proves that $f'$ is strictly positive. The argument for $f'(0)<0$ is pretty much identical, so it is omitted. Thus, $f'$ is either strictly positive or strictly negative. With this established, it follows that either $$f'(x)=\sqrt{1-[f(x)]^2}\text{ for every }x\text{, or }f'(x)=-\sqrt{1-[f(x)]^2}\text{ for every }x$$ or, because $\sqrt{1-[f(x)]^2}>0$ , $$\frac{f'(t)}{\sqrt{1-[f(t)]^2}}=1\text{ for every }t\text{, or }\frac{f'(t)}{\sqrt{1-[f(t)]^2}}=-1\text{ for every }t$$ Integrating each case from $x_0$ to $x$ , using $\int 1/\sqrt{1-x^2}dx=\sin^{-1}(x)$ , and rearranging, we get $$f(x)=\sin\left(\sin^{-1}\left(f(x_0)\right)+x-x_0\right)\text{ for every }x$$ $$\text{or}$$ $$f(x)=\sin\left(\sin^{-1}\left(f(x_0)\right)-(x-x_0)\right)\text{ for every }x$$ If the correct expression for $f$ is the first one, then we can evaluate it at $\frac{\pi}{2}+x_0-\sin^{-1}\left(f(x_0)\right)$ and $-\frac{\pi}{2}+x_0-\sin^{-1}\left(f(x_0)\right)$ . This is justified because the domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$ . \begin{align}
f\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+x_0-\sin^{-1}\left(f(x_0)\right)\right) &= \sin\left(\sin^{-1}\left(f(x_0)\right)+\frac{\pi}{2}+x_0-\sin^{-1}\left(f(x_0)\right)-x_0\right)\\
&= \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\\
&= 1
\end{align} \begin{align}
f\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}+x_0-\sin^{-1}\left(f(x_0)\right)\right) &= \sin\left(\sin^{-1}\left(f(x_0)\right)-\frac{\pi}{2}+x_0-\sin^{-1}\left(f(x_0)\right)-x_0\right)\\
&= \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\\
&= -1
\end{align} This contradicts the assumption that $f$ never attains $1$ nor $-1$ . We can reach a contradiction from the second expression too; just evaluate $f$ at $\frac{\pi}{2}+x_0\color{red}{+}\sin^{-1}\left(f(x_0)\right)$ and $-\frac{\pi}{2}+x_0\color{red}{+}\sin^{-1}\left(f(x_0)\right)$ instead. Thus, our original assumption must be false, so any $\mathbb R$ -defined solution always attains at least one of $1,-1$ as a value. $\blacksquare$ I appreciate any and all feedback.","['calculus', 'solution-verification', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

Probably not. If not can anyone help me how to improve it? Step 0 Let $n$ denote a natural number. We are going to use the lemma that $a \leq b$ $\iff $ $a^n \leq b^n$ where $a,b$ are two real numbers $>0$ . We are also going to use the squeeze theorem and the binomial theorem. We will first construct a lower bound then an upper bound for $a \geq 1$ and then we are going to generalize it for $0<a<1$ . Step 1 Let $a \geq 1$ . We will show that $1 \leq a^{1/n}$ . This is equivalent to $1 \leq a$ . But this is true by assumption and thus we have a lower bound. Step 2 Lets consider $a^{1/n} \leq 1 +\frac{a}{n}$ . This is equivalent to $a \leq (1+\frac{a}{n})^{n}$ . We can use the binomial theorem here and we find that it is equal to $1+n \frac{a}{n}1^{n}+...=1+a+...$ . Then we combine this and we have that $a \leq 1+a+...$ but this is obviously true. Step 3 We now have achieved the following for a real number $a \geq 1$ we have that $1 \leq a^{1/n} \leq 1+a/n$ . And by the squeeze theorem this converges to 1. Step 4 Last and least we need to show the same thing for $0 <a <1$ . We can rewrite this into $a^{1/n}=\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{a})^{1/n}}$ . But because if $a <1$ then $1/a > 1$ but because this is also a real number we can use the theorem we just proved and apply the quotient rule for limits.

In other words, prove whether or not two distinct subsets of $S$ will always have the same $g$ value. This was a bonus problem on the final exam of an introductory proofs class I took last year, and it has been bothering me ever since then because no solution was ever posted. I think this would be reasonably simple to check with a computer using brute force, but that was besides the point of the class. A similar problem where $S$ is instead a set of 8 people is trivial to prove using the Pigeonhole Principle. In that case, the codomain of $g$ will have $8 \cdot 31 =248$ elements while $\mathcal{P}(S)$ will have $2^8 = 256$ elements, so therefore $g$ is not injective. Clearly this same strategy does not apply to a group of 7 people, but is there another way of approaching this problem in order to prove whether or not $g$ is injective? My first thought was that even though $2^7 = 128 < 217=31 \cdot{7}$ , there could maybe be some way to analytically reduce the 217 possible sums until there are less than 128?

Unfortunately, mathjax is not available on pdf format. And all lecture notes I could find are all in pdf format and have equations that is ignored by my screen reader. Then, I have thought of bypassing my notation problem completely. Maybe there is a course that teaches discrete math through programming just like how SICP did it with sets. I know SICP does not intend to teach discrete math, but I feel that the same idea could be applied when actually learning discrete math. I am hoping that by using this approach, even though the mathematical notation are invinsible to my screen reader, I still have some code (maybe written in a functional language?) that I could play with to understand the concepts. I am counting on abstraction here (E.G. I am confident that objects in graph theory can be represented as data structures). I would like to ask: is there such a course? Can anyone recommend a course like this? Like a discrete math and programming combination? Topics I am interested in are combinatorics, asymptotic notation, number theory, graph theory Also, I am aware that bypassing math notation is extremely dangerous to do. After all, reading and writing prufes almost involves reading math notation. I have come to accept that this might be my (or my screen reading software)'s limitation that cannot be fixed at the moment.

4292089,Geometric intuition behind Cauchy not having a mean,"I'm trying to follow the geometric intuition behind the Cauchy distribution in the book ""An introduction to probability theory and its applications"" by Feller volume 2, first edition. On page 51, he describes the density of the Cauchy distribution as: $$\gamma_t = \frac{t}{(t^2+x^2)\pi}$$ He then describes an experiment where a ray of light is emitted horizontally onto a vertical mirror from a source O. The light strikes the mirror at point A and the mirror can rotate about a vertical axis passing through A. This is shown in the figure below. The light reflects off the mirror and strikes the wall O is on at a distance $X$ from O. The first assertion is that if $\phi$ is uniformly distributed between $(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$ , $X$ has the density given by $\gamma_t$ . I managed to prove this. Then he says that its apparent that if this experiment is repeated $n$ times and the average taken, then this average $\frac{X_1+X_2+\dots X_n}{n}$ will have the same distribution as $X_1$ . I didn't follow this part. I guess I could derive it from the density, but Feller seems to be hinting at some kind of obvious geometric intuition which I'm completely missing.","['convergence-divergence', 'probability']"

so that the inclusion map $M^a \to M^b$ is a homotopy equivalence. Edit: The set $M^a$ is defined as $M^a:= f^{-1}(-\infty,a]$ . After the proof, he states that The condition that $f^{−1}[a,b]$ is compact cannot be omitted. For example
Figure 3.2 indicates a situation in which this set is not compact. The
manifold $M$ does not contain the point $p$ . Clearly $M^a$ is not a

So I have attempted to solve this problem and I am stuck, and want to ask for some help. My approach is contradiction. I will detail the work I have so far. I would prefer help which builds on my current work, however if my approach is futile then of course starting over is preferable, but in the end how you help is up to you. Suppose that $f_n \rightarrow f$ in $L^1$ does not hold, then $\exists\; \epsilon > 0$ s.t. $\forall$ $N$ , $\exists$ $n\geq N$ s.t. $\int_P |f_n -f| \geq \epsilon $ (where $P$ is a set of positive measure). Now, we know that $f_n$ converges in measure, denote $\{x\;|\;|f_m(x)-f(x)|\geq \epsilon\}=F_{m,\epsilon}$ , then $\exists$ M s.t. $\forall$ $m\geq M$ , we have $\mu(F_{m,\epsilon})<\epsilon$ . Now, at this point I start to become unsure of what to do. THe most interesting thing I can come up with is this: $$\sup_P |f_n -f| \mu(P)\geq \int_P |f_n-f| \geq \epsilon \mu(P) > 0$$ Also, we have that |f_n|\leq g, so we need to use this, but I am not sure how. Of course $\sup_P |f_n -f| \mu(P)\leq \sup_p 2g \mu(P)$ but I am not sure how this helps. Another interesting thing I found was that, $f_n \rightarrow f$ in $L^1$ is equivalent to $|f_n - f|\rightarrow 0$ in $L^1$ , so if we could show that $\int_P |f_n-f|\rightarrow 0$ somehow, than perhaps this would say something close to "" $f_n\rightarrow f$ in $L^1$ ""...

4292260,Can I Plug In Infinity to Verify the Equation: $\tan \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - x\right) = \cot x$,"When working on the following equation for my pre-calculus class a couple nights ago Verify that: $$
\tan \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - x\right) = \cot x
$$ I decided to answer the question by using the fact that $$
\tan \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - x\right) = \frac{\tan \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan x}{1 + \tan \frac{\pi}{2} \tan x}.
$$ I realized that using this formula, I would not help me answer the question for my math class, because, as we learned in class, $\tan \frac{\pi}{2}$ is undefined. However, I (knowingly erroneously) proceeded with this method, plugging in $\pm \infty$ for $\tan \frac{\pi}{2}$ yielding $$
\frac{\pm \infty - \tan x}{1 + \pm \infty \tan x}
$$ which can be simplified down to $$
\frac{1 - 0}{0 + \tan x} = \frac{1}{\tan x} = \cot x
$$ by dividing the numerator and the denominator by $\pm \infty$ . In an attempt to justify the fact that $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ should be 1 and $\frac{1}{\infty}$ and $\frac{\tan x}{\infty}$ should be 0, I turned to limits. Whilst not knowing too much calculus, I learned last year in Algebra II that $\infty$ can be somewhat approximated with limits. As such, I defined a new constant $\beta$ as $$
\beta = \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} x
$$ and $\alpha$ as $\beta$ 's reciprocal. From my understanding of limits, that just means $\beta$ is essentially some very large number, so I should still be able to do arithmetic with it ( $\alpha \beta = 1$ , $\beta - \beta = 0$ , etc.). So then my equation becomes: $$
\frac{\beta - \tan x}{1 + \beta \tan x} = \frac{\beta - \tan x}{1 + \beta \tan x} \cdot \frac{\alpha}{\alpha} = \frac{1 - \alpha \tan x}{\alpha + \tan x}
$$ which is essentially $\cot x$ at the end, because $\alpha \approx 0$ .

Suppose it is given a probability measure $\gamma$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with first marginal $\mu$ (meaning that $\pi^1_\sharp \gamma = \mu$ , where $\pi^1(x,y)=x$ is the projection on the first factor from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}$ ).

4292545,Problem when calculating vaccine effectiveness,"When calculating vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization from publicly available data, I came across a strange (mathematical) problem, which I do not know how to interpret. The problem occurs on real-world data, though for this question I hand-crafted the data to better illustrate the problem. I calculate the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization by comparing numbers of hospitalized in the group of positive. Here are my data: Note that while the effectiveness of the vaccine for the whole population is negative, for individual age ranges it is positive. Mathematically it is clear - young people are often positive but rarely hospitalized, while old people are rarely positive (because they are more vaccinated) however they are hospitalized more often. Question 1: How to interpret the fact that the effectiveness for the whole is negative, while for parts it is positive? When I perform the categorization differently than by age range, I can get completely different effectiveness for the parts: Note that the total numbers are the same as before, only the distribution of hospitalized among positive is different. My impression is that by carefully choosing the category, I can get any results I want. Question 2: I am sure this phenomenon is well known and studied in statistics. Can you point me to the right topic I can look at? Question 3: As shown above, the calculated vaccine effectiveness depends substantially (and can give completely different results) on the division into categories chosen. Why is categorization by age considered better (and correct) than categorization e.g. by colour (as in my example)? IMO, it's just a wishful thinking. For instance, how can we be sure that if we sub-divide the age ranges more finely (either by individual years or by another criteria, e.g. type of vaccine, factory where it was made, region where the patients live etc.), the effectiveness won't be negative again?",['statistics']

For the sake of simplicity, say that both $G$ and $H$ contain all self-loops. Let $N_G(v)$ and $N_H(w)$ be the first neighborhoods of any vertex $v\in V$ (in $G$ ) and $w\in W$ (in $H$ ), respectively. Then the strong product $G\boxtimes H$ of $G$ and $H$ is a graph with set of nodes $V\times W$ in which a pair $(v,w)\in V\times W$ is adjacent to another one $(v',w')\in V \times W$ if and only if $(v,w) \in N_G(v')\times N_H(w')$ . It is easy to see that the independence number $\alpha(G\boxtimes H)$ of $G\boxtimes H$ is always larger than or equal to the product $\alpha(G)\alpha(H)$ of the independence numbers $\alpha(G)$ of $G$ and $\alpha(H)$ of $H$ . This is because the Cartesian product $I\times J$ of an independent set $I$ in $G$ with an independent set $J$ in $H$ is an independent set in $G\boxtimes H$ . I assume it is not always the case that $\alpha(G\boxtimes H) = \alpha(G)\alpha(H)$ (not even up to constants) because I keep finding the upper bound $\alpha(G\boxtimes H) \le \alpha^\star(G)\alpha(H)$ , where $\alpha^\star(G)$ is the fractional packing (or Rosenfeld) number of $G$ , which I know can be much bigger than $\alpha(G)$ .

What I think . Consider the exterior power.
Uniqueness seems easy: The canonical projection is supposed to be a $\frak{g}$ -intertwiner. This forces us to define on equivalence classes of homogenous tensors $x.[v_1 \otimes ... \otimes v_r] := [x. (v_1 \otimes ... \otimes v_r)]$ for $x \in \frak{g}$ . As homogenous tensors span $V^{\otimes r}$ there image under the canonical projection spans $\bigwedge ^r V$ . Hence, the above definition determines the action uniquely. What remains to show is that this map is well-defined, and indeed gives a $\frak{g}$ -action. That is where I am struggling. I have no experience in working with exterior powers.

Attempt: I have realized that $a_N+b_N=a_0+b_0$ for every $N$ , so it suffices to see that $\{b_{N,N}\}$ is bounded below or $\{a_{N,N}\}$ is bounded above. I don't know how to make rigorous calculations, but I have found out by using the software Mathematica that apparently  with $\alpha=1/2$ there is convergence for some pairs $(a_0,b_0)$ like $a_0=0.004; b_0=0.003$ $a_0=0.008 ; b_0=0.004$ $a_0=0.003 ; b_0=0.001$ $a_0=0.32 ; b_0=0.24$ $a_0=0.021 ; b_0=0.017$ Thanks.","['real-analysis', 'calculus', 'numerical-methods', 'sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence']"
4292928,How does Brownian motion exit a square? Or the harmonic measure on a square.,"Consider a circle $\mathcal{C}$ in $\mathbf R^2$ of unit radius and a Brownian motion $\{X_t\}_{t\in \mathbf R^+} $ starting from its center. Let $\mu$ be the measure on $\mathcal{C}$ defined on arcs $I$ as $$
\mu(I) = Prob(X_\tau \in I), 
$$ where $\tau = \text{inf}_t (X_t \in \mathcal{C})$ . Namely, $\mu(I)$ is the probability that $X$ leaves the circle through the arc $I$ . It is well known that $\mu$ is just Lebesgue measure on $\mathcal{C}$ , simply by isotropy of Brownian motions. My question is: what happens if we replace the circle with a square? Is there any closed formula for the probability density of the exit point of a Brownian motion from a square? Guess: a friend of mine proposed this function $$
p(x) = \frac{\frac{1}{1+x^2} - \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{\pi}{2} -  1}
$$ as probability density on a single side (perhaps a factor of $1/4$ is needed to normalize), where $x$ is distance from the middle point of the square side. EDIT: I leave you some nice Python simulations","['stochastic-processes', 'brownian-motion', 'probability-theory', 'polygons']"
4292930,Does the inclusion of schemes affine over $S$ to $S$-schemes have a left adjoint?,"Let $S$ be a scheme. Consider the category $\mathrm{Aff}_{/S}$ of schemes affine over $S$ , by which I mean $S$ -schemes $X$ such that the structure morphism $X \to S$ is affine. For simplicity, I'll also call those affine $S$ -schemes (though they don't have to be affine as an absolute scheme!). Consider the inclusion functor $\mathrm{Aff}_{/S} \to \mathrm{Sch}_{/S}$ . Does this have a left adjoint? The question is motivated by the ""absolute analogue"". It's well-known for $S=\mathrm{Spec}(\Bbb Z)$ that a left adjoint to $\mathrm{Aff} \to \mathrm{Sch}$ exists and it is given by $X \mapsto \mathrm{Spec}(\Gamma(X,\mathcal O_X))$ . The same construction works as long as $S$ is affine. One naïve way one might try to do a similar thing in the general setting is to use the relative Spec. The relative Spec construction has a nice universal property, so that seems promising. The idea is to define a functor $\mathrm{Sch}_{/S} \to \mathrm{Aff}_{/S}$ by sending $X \xrightarrow{f} S$ to $\underline{\mathrm{Spec}}_S(f_* \mathcal O_X) \to S$ . The problem with this is that $\underline{\mathrm{Spec}}_S(f_* \mathcal O_X)$ is not even defined, because for general $f$ , there's no reason that $f_* \mathcal O_X$ is quasicoherent! (This is however true if $f$ is qcqs.) So that doesn't work. Of course, via the relative Spec functor, the category of affine $S$ -schemes is anti-equivalent to the category of quasicoherent $\mathcal O_S$ -algebras, so the question could be recast in terms of asking for a functor from $S$ -schems to quasicoherent $\mathcal O_S$ -algebras with certain properties. Certainly taking the pushforward of the structure sheaf gives us a canonical $\mathcal O_S$ -algebra, that may however not be quasicoherent, as mentioned before. So I guess if there was a sufficiently canonical way to associate to each $\mathcal O_S$ -algebra a quasicoherent $\mathcal O_S$ -algebra, applying that to the pushforward of the structure sheaf and then taking the relative Spec would give us our desired functor. Actually, there are some situations where one can associate to some non-quasicoherent module a ""canonical"" quasicoherent module with a suitable universal property, see here . I don't see how that lemma is applicable in this situation, however. One could of course try to use adjoint functor theorems, however the original motivation for the question was figuring out whether the inclusion $\mathrm{Aff}_{/S} \to \mathrm{Sch}_{/S}$ preserves limits. (Note that $\mathrm{Aff}_{/S}$ actually has all limits because the category of quasicoherent $\mathcal O_S$ -algebras has all colimits.) That's of course asking less than the existence a left adjoint, but in practice exhibiting a left adjoint is often a good way to show that a functor preserves limits.","['adjoint-functors', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"
4292931,Probability - Am I understanding the problem correctly (Part II)?,"The problem It is given that a certain type of battery has a mean shelf life of $30$ months with a standard deviation of $3$ months.

The probability that a randomly selected battery has a lifetime of $\approx2.18$ years can be evaluated as $$p=\mathbb P(X>2.18)=\mathbb P(Z>-1.28)=0.9$$ where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable.

4292933,$A$ has property of Baire if and only if $A=B \sqcup Q$ where $B$ is a $G_{\delta}$ set and $Q$ is of first category,"Over $\Bbb{R}$ , A set $A$ with a property of Baire is defined in our notes as the symmetric difference $A=G\triangle Q$ where $G$ is open and $Q$ is of first category. I am asked to show that a set $A$ has property of Baire if and only if $A=B \sqcup Q$ where $B$ is a $G_{\delta}$ set and $Q$ is of first category. I can show that for $A=G\triangle Q$ with open $G$ and first-category $Q$ , one gets $N=\overline{G}\setminus G$ is closed (and nowhere dense), and $N\triangle Q$ is of first category, hence $A={\overline{G}\triangle N \triangle Q}=\overline{G}\triangle (N \triangle Q)$ which means it is also a symmetric difference of closed set and a first category set. But for the countable intersection of open sets $B=\bigcap B_i$ , I am not sure what to do similar to the above method. Is $B$ nowhere dense? If so, then $A $ is a first category set, but is it still the symmetric difference between an open set and a first-category set?

Question Out of Curiosity: Is $\mathbb{R}$ as a ( Cauchy- ) complete field (in terms of the Euclidean metric) a/the "" smallest "" ( Cauchy- ) complete field containing (an isomorphic copy of) the field $\mathbb{Q}$ (in terms of the Euclidean metric)? By "" smallest "" I mean two things out of curiosity: (1) If $\mathbb{F}$ is some ( Cauchy- ) complete field (in terms of the Euclidean metric), must $\mathbb{F}$ contain (an isomorphic copy of) the field $\mathbb{R}$ as a subfield? (2) If $\mathbb{F}$ is some ( Cauchy- ) complete field (in terms of the Euclidean metric) containing (an isomorphic copy of) the field $\mathbb{Q}$ (in terms of the Euclidean metric), must $\mathbb{F}$ have cardinality strictly greater than $\mathbb{Q}$ (i.e., must $\mathbb{F}$ be uncountable)?

After giving it a read, I think Oliver Aberth constructed a countable ( Cauchy- ) complete field (in terms of the Euclidean metric) containing (an isomorphic copy of) the field $\mathbb{Q}$ as a subfield, hence the field $\mathbb{R}$ is not a/the "" smallest "". But an online friend who is much more mathematically matured than me said (nearly a month ago) the paper is misleading so I am misunderstanding the facts. Until now I still don't know why, so I am asking here and wishing someone can help about my curiosity and/or clarify what Oliver Aberth actually did in the paper.","['field-theory', 'complete-spaces', 'abstract-algebra', 'analysis']"
4292979,Signed Borel Measures and Functions of Bounded Variation,"Let $\nu$ be a finite signed Borel measure on the closed interval $[a,b]$ . We can define a function $F_\nu : [a,b]$ by $$F_\nu(x) = \nu([a,x]).$$ It can be shown that $F_\nu$ has bounded variation and is right-continuous. An exercise in my class notes asks to prove that $|\nu|([a,b]) = V(F_\nu, [a,b])$ , where the right-hand side denotes the total variation of $F_\nu$ . Immediately after this, the notes state the following theorem: ""The map $\nu \mapsto F_\nu$ is a bijection from the set of finite signed Borel measures on $[a,b]$ to the set of functions of bounded variation that take value $0$ at $a$ and that are right-continuous."" My problem is that neither of these statements are true. Both break when we consider the measure $\delta$ given by $$\delta(A) = \begin{cases} 1, &\quad a \in A \\ 0, &\quad a \notin A
\end{cases}.$$ In this case, $F_\delta$ is identically $1$ , and so $V(F_\delta,[a,b]) = 0$ while $|\delta|([a,b]) = \delta([a,b]) = 1$ . Moreover, $F_\delta$ does not take the value $0$ at $a$ , so the second statement is false too. How do we fix this? Can we just limit ourselves to the meausures $\nu$ for which $\nu(\{a\}) = 0$ ? Or is there a change we can make so that the results still apply to all signed measures?","['measure-theory', 'signed-measures', 'borel-measures', 'real-analysis', 'total-variation']"
4292984,"Are a (co)tangent vector's ""coordinate components"" equivalent to the ""coordinate components of its pushfoward to R^n""?","[All equation numbers reference Wald, Robert M. , General relativity , Chicago-London: The University of Chicago Press. XIII, 491 p. 34.50 (1984).] Consider a subset $O$ of an $n$ -dimensional, $C^{\infty}$ , real manifold $M$ .  Let $\psi:O\to V\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a chart and let $x^\mu:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ denote coordinates corresponding to some choice of basis $\{e_\mu\}$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ .  Composition yields the smooth maps $x^\mu\circ \psi:O\to\mathbb{R}$ . Now, the corresponding coordinate components $v^\mu$ of any tangent vector $v\in V_p$ at $p\in O$ are given by \begin{align}
v^\mu=v(x^\mu\circ\psi(p)), \tag{2.2.6}\label{v mu}
\end{align} with $v(f)$ viewed as a linear map $v:C^{\infty}(M)\to\mathbb{R}$ . On the other hand, the push-forward map $\psi^*:V_p\to V_{\psi(p)}$ associated with $\psi$ is defined via \begin{align}
(\psi^*v)(f)\equiv v(f\circ\psi) \tag{C.1.1}\label{push v},
\end{align} for all smooth $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ .  So, it would seem the coordinate components of $\psi^*v$ at $\psi(p)$ are given by the same expression as the coordinate components of $v$ at $p$ : \begin{align}
(\psi^*v)^\mu = (\psi^*v)(x^\mu) \overset{\eqref{push v}}{=} v(x^\mu\circ\psi(p)) \overset{\eqref{v mu}}{=}v^\mu \label{*}\tag{$\star$}

\end{align} the coordinate components of any dual vector $w\in {V}^*_p$ are given by \begin{align}
w_\mu=w(X_\mu), \tag{c.f. Ch2 Problem 6.b} \label{w mu}
\end{align} Since $\psi$ is bijective, its inverse ${\psi^{-1}}:V\to O$ can provide a push-forward $(\psi^{-1})^*:{V}^*_p \to {V}^*_{\psi(p)}$ for cotangent vectors by requiring that for every $v\in V_{\psi (p)}$ , \begin{align}
((\psi^{-1})^*w)(v)=w((\psi^{-1})^*v) \tag{c.f. C.1.2} \label{push w}
\end{align} The coordinate components of $(\psi^{-1})^*w$ at $\psi(p)$ are given by, \begin{align}
((\psi^{-1})^*w)_\mu = ((\psi^{-1})^*w)\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu} \right) \overset{\eqref{push w}}{=} w\left((\psi^{-1})^*\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}\right)\overset{\eqref{X mu}}{=}w(X_\mu)\overset{\eqref{w mu}}{=}w_\mu. \label{**}\tag{$\star\star$}

Is it valid to view these formulas as saying: "" The coordinate components (associated with chart $\psi$ ) of a tensor at $p\in M$ are equal the coordinate components of the tensor's push-forward via $\psi$ to $\psi(p)\in\mathbb{R}^n$ "" ?","['manifolds', 'diffeomorphism', 'tangent-spaces', 'differential-geometry']"
