6208,Isolated zeros on closure of a domain,"Let $f$ be an analytic function on the open unit disk domain $D$.  Suppose also that $f$ is bounded. Since $f$ is bounded I believe that $f$ can be continuously extended to the closed unit disk.

6224,The discrete Bessel kernel,"Theorem 2 in a paper by Borodin, Okounkov, and Olshanski  states that the discrete Bessel kernel $J(x,y,\theta)$ is given by \begin{equation*}
\sqrt{\theta} \frac{J_x J_{y+1} - J_{x+1} J_y}{x-y}

6234,What's the value of this Viète-style product involving the golden ratio?,"One way of looking at the Viète (Viete?) product
$${2\over\pi} = {\sqrt{2}\over 2}\times{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}\over 2}\times{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}}\over 2}\times\dots$$
is as the infinite product of a series of successive 'approximations' to 2, defined by $a_0 = \sqrt{2}$, $a_{i+1} = \sqrt{2+a_i}$ (or more accurately, their ratio to their limit 2).  This allows one to see that the product converges; if $|a_i-2|=\epsilon$, then $|a_{i+1}-2|\approx\epsilon/2$ and so the terms of the product go as roughly $(1+2^{-i})$. Now, the sequence of infinite radicals $a_0=1$, $a_{i+1} = \sqrt{1+a_i}$ converges exponentially to the golden ratio $\phi$, and so the same sort of infinite product can be formed:
$$\Phi = {\sqrt{1}\over\phi}\times{\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1}}\over\phi}\times{\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1}}}\over\phi}\times\dots$$
and an equivalent proof of convergence goes through.  The question is, what's the value of $\Phi$?  The usual proof of Viète's product by way of the double-angle formula for sin doesn't translate over, and from what I know of the logistic map it seems immensely unlikely that there's any function conjugate to the iteration map here in the same way that the trig functions are suitably conjugate to the version in the Viète product.  Is there any other approach that's likely to work, or is $\Phi$ just unlikely to have any formula more explicit than its infinite product?","['sequences-and-series', 'number-theory']"

6407,Tangent to two disks: Roots of a 4th-degree polynomial?,"Suppose you would like to find the two tangent lines that support two given disks in the plane
to the same side.  Parameterizing the circles using $( \cos \theta, \sin \theta )$,
I find that ultimately I am computing the roots of a 4th-degree polynomial in $x = \cos \theta$
(two of whose roots are imaginary, and two real).
But I may not have formalized this in the most perspicacious manner.
Rather than detail my approach, let me just pose the general question of whether
there is a way to compute the tangent lines without effectively finding the roots of
a 4th-degree polynomial. With two solutions one might hope for a 2nd-degree polynomial. Addendum .
I should have made clear that what I need are the coordinates of the two points of tangency for
two circles arbitrarily placed in the plane.  Nevertheless, both Ross's and Moron's solutions
can answer this version of the question as well.  With appropriate translation, scaling, and rotation, I can place the two circles so that one is a unit-radius circle centered on the origin,
and the other has $r \ge 1$ with its center on the $+x$ axis.  Then I am in the situation Moron drew.
Knowing the side lengths of the triangles yields $\sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is the
angle of the triangle on the $x$-axis, and from that I can compute the coordinates
of the points of tangencies
in terms of $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$.  Much simpler than my brute-force calculation.

6414,Why is the manifold structure on the tangent bundle unique?,"...subject to the conditions that (i) the projection be smooth and that (ii) smooth sections correspond to smooth vector fields. This homework problem is really bugging the hell out of me.  Of course it can be checked locally, so we'll look at an open neighborhood $U\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and check that $TU\cong U\times \mathbb{R}^n$ (where the isomorphism is as topological spaces with sheaves of functions that we declare to be smooth).  On the one hand, it's easy to see that $U \times \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies these two conditions, since the projection is literally just a projection (in coordinates) and the correspondence is $X$ a vector field --> $s = (x_1,\ldots, x_n, X(\partial/\partial x_1), \ldots, X(\partial/\partial x_n))$ $s=(s_1,\ldots, s_n)$ a smooth section --> $X = \sum_i s_i\cdot\partial/\partial x_i $. On the other hand, I'm having a lot of trouble showing that the obvious sheaf (which I'll denote $O_{TU}$) is the unique one with properties (i) and (ii). For example, suppose $\mathcal{F}$ is another sheaf of functions on $U\times \mathbb{R}^n$.  Suppose that $f \in \mathcal{F}(V) \backslash \mathcal{O}_{TU}$ for some open set $V\subseteq U$.  There really doesn't seem to be any way to show that this violates property (i), because what it really means is that for any $g\in O_U$, $g \circ \pi \in O_{TU}$, and the hypothesis of this statement begins with a function on $U$, not $TU$.  On the other hand, I don't see any way to make a vector field on $U$ out of $f$, and (according to this question ) it feels likely that I can't necessarily get a section that detects the failure of $f$ to be $O_{TU}$-smooth.

There exists a positive function $M(r)$ such that $M(0)=0$ and $V(t,r) = -\dfrac{M(r)}{R(t,r)}$ where $R$ is another positive function such that $R(0,r)=r$. Let $p(r) = \dfrac{E(r)}{V(0,r)}$ be a function regular at $r=0$ such that $p(0) \in (-\infty,1)$. Also define a function $a$ of $r$ such that, $a(r) = \dfrac{M(r)}{\dfrac{4}{3}\pi r^3}$.

6507,Are there broad or powerful theorems of rings that do not involve the familiar numerical operations (+) and (*) in some fundamental way?,"I am of, and I would like to retain, a mindset that mathematics does not have to have numbers as the central object of interest. With that in mind, I have done a fair amount of self-study on topics in undergrad modern algebra, looking for examples to show this is the case. For objects like groups, it is often stated explicitly, at some point, that group elements can be though of as automorphisms on a particular set. I find this pretty interesting, that numbers do not come into play at all here. This makes groups pretty useful for problems that have symmetries. However, for objects like fields and rings, it seems that their application often ends up dealing with numbers somehow. I'm aware there are probably a handful of cases where rings and fields do not show up as numbers, but those tend to be side-cases that are not of main study. I'm only vaguely aware of Galois theory and it's uses for fields as extensions of groups, so perhaps that is the direction I should follow there. But as for rings, aside from the example I just gave, I still come up a bit short on any powerful or broad theorems that make use of those two operations but do not involve numbers in some fundamental way. Perhaps math.stackexchange can prove me wrong? P.S. Answers with really good links to books or other resources will at least get an upvote. An update for those who pointed out my lack of precision. So admittedly, the choice of words was bad. I did use the phrase ""involve numbers in some fundamental way"", which, in my mind, means ""does not use facts about numbers"". Perhaps I can  rephrase it better. Suppose I have a group (G, *). There are many examples of groups if I want to let G be the integers, rationals, reals, complex, etc, where the group operation (*) can be addition, multiplication, or some other operation. However, each of these are ""numerical"" examples. There are groups which do not behave like numbers, if we let G be the set of all bijections on a set S, and let (*) be the composition, we may not be able to find a group where the set S is a collection of numbers and (*) is a ""numerical"" operation on them. Our group operation (*) may end just being some random rearrangement of numbers that does not take advantage of the properties of numbers. In this way, and as others often point out, all groups are just specific cases of bijections & composition. Now suppose I have a ring (R, +, *). The ring of functions on integers, rationals, reals, etc. takes advantage of the properties of numbers when defining (+) and (*). As would the ring of polynomials, or the ring of matrices. Each of these examples of rings, while the set R is not a set of numbers, ends up being an abstraction of numbers, and the operations (+) and (*) make use of this fact. An example of what I mean To give a example (counterexample?) of what I mean, try Boolean rings. The operations (+) and (*) are isomorphic to the logical operations ""xor"" and ""and"". There is also examples of lattices with join and meet. One could try to squeeze in natural numbers into this with lcd and gcd, but these properties are not unique to numbers so they are not exactly ""numerical"". If you want to add more structure, say an additive and multiplicative identity, you can use  Stone's Representation Theorem to show it is isomorphic to a collection of sets with symmetric difference and intersection.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'soft-question', 'group-theory', 'field-theory']"

6552,Area of a sector between a point and a function determined by an angle,"I've been trying to find a way to do this: given a point $P(\alpha,\beta)$, a function $f(x)$, and an angle $\theta$, find the area of the sector determined by extending a horizontal line from $P$ to $f$, and then another one from $P$ to $f$ at the angle $\theta$ from the first line. If you look at this picture: it's a little more clear what I'm talking about. I want to find the area of that sector $S$, which is determined by that triangle $R_1$ and the other region $R_2$. Let the value of $x$ where the horizontal line from $P$ hits $f$ be $q$ (that is, $q=f^{-1}(\beta)$). Now, the line $\overline{PA}$ has the equation $y=\tan\theta(x-\alpha)+\beta$. The intersection of that and $f$, the point $A$ (the first intersection point), is the beginning of the interval determining $R_2$; I'll call the root $p$ of $f(x)=\tan\theta(x-\alpha)+\beta$ that value of $x$, so $p=f^{-1}(\tan\theta(x-\alpha)+\beta)$. The area of $R_1$ is simply the area of the triangle: $R_1=\frac{1}{2}(p-\alpha)(f(p)-\beta)$. The area of $R_2$ is the area under the curve from $p$ to $q$, minus the initial height $\beta$: $R_2=\displaystyle\int_p^q (f(x)-\beta) dx$. Therefore, the total area is $$S=\frac{1}{2}\tan\theta(p-\alpha)^2-\beta(q-p)+\displaystyle\int_p^q f(x) dx$$ This is the way I did it, but there has to be a simpler way; is there one involving polar equations? Is there a general formula when $f$ is non-invertible? Edit: If the function $f$ is translated so that $P$ is now the origin, the area is just $\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}\int_0^\theta r^2 d\phi$ where $r(\phi)$ is $f(x)$ in polar form. However, translating $f$ over to where $P$ is on the origin turns it into $f(x+\alpha)-\beta$. Is there a nice way of putting that into polar form?","['geometry', 'calculus']"

6629,Large Deviation Properties of a function of a geometric random variable,"Suppose I have a variable $s$ that has a geometric distribution with success parameter x. So the probability of success on  trial $s$ is $p_s = (1 - x)^{s - 1} x$, Consider the following function of $s$ $V(s) = \delta^s$, where $\delta < 1 $.  Then the expected value of this function is given by $\sum_ 1^{\infty} V(s) p_s = \frac{\delta x} {1 - \delta (1 - x)}$. Consider now the deviation of V(s) from its mean : $(V(s) - \frac{\delta x} {1 - \delta (1 - x)}) $ What distribution does this have? What I am really interested in is the behavior of the follow ordinary stochastic differential equation: $\dot{V} =  \delta^s  - V$, stochastic because the law of motion depends on the random variable $s$.  The stochastic approximation technique allows me to focus on the mean dynamics, which are given by $\dot{V} =  \frac{\delta x} {1 - \delta (1 - x)}  - V$, whose equilibrium is simply $\hat{V} = \frac{\delta x} {1 - \delta (1 - x)}$. I would like to characterize the large deviation properties of the original ODE, IE calculate the exponential likelihood $V$ crosses a particular boundary $c$. For example, if $\delta = .95$ and $x= .01$, $\hat{V} = 0.159664$.  If we set $V_0 = 0.159664$, and let $V_t = V_{t-1} + .2 (\delta^s - V_{t-1})$, and $s$ has the above distribution, how do I calculate the expected time to $V_t$ crossing, say, $c=.4$?  What is the associated rate function? Editing to give the background to the problem: I am interested in the following stochastic dynamic system: $V_t = V_{t-1} + \gamma (\delta^{S_{t-1}} - V_{t-1})$, where $\delta <1$, $\gamma<1$, both positive, and each $S_t$ is an i.i.d. geometric random variable with success parameter $x$.  What this models is agents who have to wait a geometric length of time to get a reward of value 1, and they have time discount factor $\delta$, and they are learning  the expected value of their reward using a constant gain adaptive  learning procedure, with gain $\gamma$. So considering $S$ as following a Poisson, rather than Geometric, makes little difference to the sense of the problem.  The goal is Find the equilibria of the learning dynamics Characterize the mean time to escape from this equilibrium, the large deviation properties. So, for large deviation properties, I should be able to use something like Cramer's theorem, I think.  As Mike says below, iterating the dynamics gives $V_t = (1−γ)^tV_0+γ\sum_{k=0}^{t−1}(1−γ)^{t−1−k}δ^{S_k}$ So it all depends on $\sum_{k=0}^{t−1}(1−γ)^{t−1−k}δ^{S_k}$, the discounted sum of some random variables. The Probability that $V_t >c$ is then given by $Pr(V_t > c ) = Pr(\sum_{k=0}^{t−1}(1−γ)^{t−1−k}δ^{S_k} > \frac{c-(1−γ)^tV_0}{\gamma})$ Let $Z:=\frac{c-(1−γ)^tV_0}{\gamma}$.  so we need the distribution of $\sum_{k=0}^{t−1}(1−γ)^{t−1−k}δ^{S_k}$, which as Mike says is a discounted sum of independent random variables, and so we have that this is approximately normal, for large $t$. Turning now to the question of large deviations, if things were not discounted by powers of $(1-\gamma)$, we could appeal directly to Cramer's Theorem; $ Pr(\sum \delta^{S_k} > n a) \leq Exp[-n(r^* a - Log(E[Exp(r^* \delta^S)])] $ where $r^* $ is chosen to maximize $r a - Log(E[Exp(r \delta^S)]$.  The problem would be to simply calculate the moment generating function of  $\delta^S$.  But, I don't exactly want $Pr(\sum \delta^{S_k} > n a)$, I need $ Pr(\sum (1-\gamma)^{t-1-k} \delta^{S_k} > a)$; so not an average of $\delta^{S_k}$s, but a discounted sum.  so it is not quite a direct application.","['dynamical-systems', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'probability-theory', 'approximation', 'probability']"

Let $M_z$ be the multiplication operator by $z$ (""the unilateral shift on $H^2$""). So, if $g_n(z) = M_z^n (z - c) = -cz^n + z^{n + 1}$ I find that the power series coefficients of $g_n$ (which is given by $g_n(z) = \sum_m a_{n,m} z^m$) are $a_{n,n} = -c$ and $a_{n,n+1} = 1$. If I insert this in the inner product (where $h(z) = \sum \overline{b_n} z^n$), $(g_n, h) = 0$ for all $n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$. I obtain that $b_{n + 1} - c b_n = 0$ for $n \geq 0$. This gives that $b_n = C \cdot c^n$. But $\sum c^n z^n = 0$ only if $c = 0$. This would imply that $f(z) = z$ is cyclic but a cyclic vector cannot have a zero in the unit disk! What is wrong here?

6675,Order of a Group from its Presentation,"Let $G$ be a group with generators and relations. I know that in general it is difficult to determine what a group is from its generators and relations. I am interested in learning about techniques for figuring out the order of a group from the given information. For example, I know that if the number of generators exceeds the number of relations then the group has infinite order. If the number of generators equals the number of relations then the group is cyclic or has infinite order. Let $G= <x, y|x^2 = y^3 = (xy)^4 = 1>$ . My hunch is that G has finite order because $(xy)^4$ is somehow independent of $x^2$ and $y^3$ . But if the exponent on $xy$ were bigger, say $(xy)^6=1$ that relation becomes redundant. My question is: is this sort of thinking correct? Furthermore: my method will only tell me if $G$ , or its modification, is finite (or infinite). If $G$ is finite how can I figure out the order of the group? I know that the orders divide the order of the group, but I am looking for a specific number.","['group-theory', 'group-presentation']"
6695,"Ways to evaluate $\int \sec \theta \, \mathrm d \theta$","The standard approach for showing $\int \sec \theta \, \mathrm d \theta = \ln|\sec \theta + \tan \theta| + C$ is to multiply by $\dfrac{\sec \theta + \tan \theta}{\sec \theta + \tan \theta}$ and then do a substitution with $u = \sec \theta + \tan \theta$ . I like the fact that this trick leads to a fast and clean derivation, but I also find it unsatisfying: It's not very intuitive, nor does it seem to have applicability to any integration problem other than $\int \csc \theta \,\mathrm d \theta$ .

found on the ETS website: Let $M$ be a $5\times 5$ real matrix.
Exactly four of the following five conditions on $M$ are equivalent
to each other.
Which of the five conditions is equivalent to NONE of the other four? (A) For any two distinct column vectors $u$ and $v$ of $M$,
the set {$u,v$} is linearly independent. (B) The homogeneous system $Mx=0$ has only the trivial solution. (C) The system of equations $Mx=b$ has a unique solution for each real $5\times 1$
column vector $b$. (D) The determinant of $M$ is nonzero. (E) There exists a $5\times 5$ real matrix $N$ such that $NM$ is the $5\times 5$ identity matrix. Apparently, the correct answer is (A), but I can't figure out why this is true. If $M$ is
nonsingular, as is implied by statements (B)-(E), then isn't that equivalent to its column vectors being linearly
independent? And if the 5 column vectors are independent, then I can easily show that
each pair of vectors are independent. What am I missing?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'gre-exam']"
6737,Covering ten dots on a table with ten equal-sized coins: explanation of proof,"Note: This question has been posted on StackOverflow . I have moved it here because: I am curious about the answer The OP has not shown any interest in moving it himself In the Communications of the ACM, August 2008 ""Puzzled"" column , Peter Winkler asked the following question: On the table before us are 10 dots,
  and in our pocket are 10 $1 coins.
  Prove the coins can be placed on the
  table (no two overlapping) in such a
  way that all dots are covered. Figure
  2 shows a valid placement of the coins
  for this particular set of dots; they
  are transparent so we can see them.
  The three coins at the bottom are not
  needed. In the following issue , he presented his proof: We had to show that any 10 dots on a
  table can be covered by
  non-overlapping $1 coins, in a problem
  devised by Naoki Inaba and sent to me
  by his friend, Hirokazu Iwasawa, both
  puzzle mavens in Japan. The key is to note that packing disks
  arranged in a honeycomb pattern cover
  more than 90% of the plane. But how do
  we know they do? A disk of radius one
  fits inside a regular hexagon made up
  of six equilateral triangles of
  altitude one. Since each such triangle
  has area $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$, the hexagon
  itself has area $2 \sqrt{3}$; since the
  hexagons tile the plane in a honeycomb
  pattern, the disks, each with area $\pi$,
  cover $\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}}\approx .9069$ of the
  plane's surface. It follows that if the disks are
  placed randomly on the plane, the
  probability that any particular point
  is covered is .9069. Therefore, if we
  randomly place lots of $1 coins
  (borrowed) on the table in a hexagonal
  pattern, on average, 9.069 of our 10
  points will be covered, meaning at
  least some of the time all 10 will be
  covered. (We need at most only 10
  coins so give back the rest.) What does it mean that the disks cover
  90.69% of the infinite plane? The easiest way to answer is to say,
  perhaps, that the percentage of any
  large square covered by the disks
  approaches this value as the square
  expands. What is ""random"" about the
  placement of the disks? One way to
  think it through is to fix any packing
  and any disk within it, then pick a
  point uniformly at random from the
  honeycomb hexagon containing the disk
  and move the disk so its center is at
  the chosen point. I don't understand. Doesn't the probabilistic nature of this proof simply mean that in the majority of configurations, all 10 dots can be covered. Can't we still come up with a configuration involving 10 (or less) dots where one of the dots can't be covered?","['geometry', 'puzzle', 'probability']"
6746,Boundedness of Continuous Bilinear Operators,"Let $T:X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous bilinear operator defined on a normed linear space $X$ s.t. $T(\alpha x + \beta y,z) = \alpha T(x,z) + \beta T(y,z)$) and $T(x,y) = T(y,x)$. Does there exist a constant $C$ s.t. $||T(x,y)|| \leq C$ $||x||$ $||y|| \forall x,y$? I know that the result is true if $X$ and $Y$ are complete spaces, by using the uniform boundedness principle on $T$ as a continuous function of x for fixed y (and/or the other way around). However, I'm not sure if completeness is necessary, since it is true that a continuous linear operator $T: X \to \mathbb{R}$ has the property $||T(x)|| \leq C ||x|| \forall x$ on any normed linear space $X$ (although linear and bilinear operators are not exactly the same).","['bilinear-form', 'functional-analysis']"

Now $x^8\equiv 16\pmod{2}$ is solvable with $x\equiv 0\pmod{2}$, so I assume $p$ is an odd prime. From a theorem earlier in the text, If $p$ is a prime and $(a,p)=1$, then the congruence $x^n\equiv a\pmod{p}$ has $(n,p-1)$ solutions or no solution according as $a^{(p-1)/(n,p-1)}\equiv 1\pmod{p}$ or not. So since $(16,p)=1$, the problem reduces to showing that $16^{(p-1)/(8,p-1)}\equiv 1\pmod{p}$ holds for all $p$. I note that $(8,p-1)$ can only take values $2,4,8$. For $2$, the above equivalence is then $4^{p-1}\equiv 1\pmod{p}$, which is true by Fermat's little Theorem. For $4$, it is then $2^{p-1}\equiv 1\pmod{p}$, which again holds by FlT. However, the case where $(8,p-1)=8$ is throwing me off. At best I see that $16^{(p-1)/8}\equiv 2^{(p-1)/2}\pmod{p}$, but I'm not sure how to show this is congruent to $1$ modulo $p$. Maybe there's a more elegant way to do it without looking at cases. Thanks for any insight.","['prime-numbers', 'modular-arithmetic', 'number-theory']"

Her conjecture is: Every integer eventually appears in the $a(n)$ sequence. This sequence is not unknown; it
is A000319 in Sloane's integer sequences.
Essentially hers is a question about the orbit of 1 under repeated $\tan(\;)$ -applications.

6891,Critical exponents and point-wise convergence,"A phase change is only possible in a physical system which obeys the laws of statistical mechanics if the infinite series for the partition function of that system converges non-uniformly (i.e. converges point-wise).  This is because in order for a phase change to occur, the partition function must converge to two different continuous functions in different regions of the phase plane; and this can only happen if the number of terms in the partition function is infinite. It might be possible, using the analogy with phase changes, to make some general statements about partition functions which converge non-uniformly to two different continuous functions.  This is interesting to me because point-wise convergence is a very weak condition, and the analogy with phase changes seems to suggest a path towards a deeper understanding of this form of convergence. One of the most interesting subjects in the statistical mechanics of phase transitions is the so-called ""renormalization group"" (which is not a group) and the critical exponents it predicts (these are non integer numbers which are associated with a ""critical point"" in the phase plane).  Another powerful result from renormalization group theory is the concept of universality, in which the thermodynamic variables of the system are symmetric across all length scales at a certain critical point.  Universality is directly related to the critical exponents and critical point behavior, but as is fairly standard for theoretical physics, the mathematics used is non-rigorous (I recommend the book ""scaling and renormalization in statistical physics"" by Cardy) For the point-wise convergence of a partition function, can we put the foundations of critical exponents on a rigorous mathematical basis; in the sense that we can somehow predict their values from properties (such as the partial derivatives) of the partition function?","['statistics', 'analysis']"
