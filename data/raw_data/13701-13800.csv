108284,Example of a closed subspace of a Banach space which is not complemented?,"In this post, all vector spaces are assumed to be real or complex. Let $(X, ||\cdot||)$ be a Banach space, $Y \subset X$ a closed subspace. $Y$ is called $\underline{\mathrm{complemented}}$, if there is a closed subspace $Z \subset X$ such that $X =Y \oplus Z$ as topological vector spaces. If $H$ is a Hilbert space every closed subspace $Y$ is complemented; the orthogonal complement $Y^{\bot}$ is a closed subspace of $H$ and we have $H=Y \oplus Y^{\bot}$. A famous theorem of LindenstrauÃŸ and Tzafriri (which can be found in their article ""On the complemented subspaces problem"", Isreal Journal of Mathematics, Vol. 9, No.2, pp. 263-269) asserts that the converse is true as well. More precisely, if $(X, ||\cdot||)$ is a Banach space such that every closed subspace is complemented then $||\cdot||$ is induced by a scalarproduct, i.e. $(X,||\cdot||)$ is a Hilbert space. Now to my question. Can you give me an example of a Banach space $(X,||\cdot||)$, which is not a Hilbert space, and of a closed subspace $Y \subset X$ which is not complemented? It is easily seen that $Y$ must be both infinite-dimensional and infinite-codimensional, for every finite-dimensional and every (closed) finite-codimensional subspace is complemented. I thought about something like $c_{0} \subset (\ell^{\infty}, ||\cdot||_{\infty})$ the closed subspace of null sequences in the Banach space of bounded sequences but couldn't produce a proof that no closed complement exists in that case. Can you help me either proving that $c_{0}$ is not complemented (if that's true at all) or by giving me a different example?","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"
108288,"Infinite tetration, convergence radius","I got this problem from my teacher as a optional challenge. I am open about this being a given problem, however it is not homework. The problem is stated as follows. Assume we have an infinite tetration as follows $$x^{x^{x^{.^{.^.}}}} \, = \, a$$ With a given $a$ find $x$ . The next part of the problem was to discuss the convergence radius of a. If a is too big or too small the tetration does not converge. Below is my humble stab at the problem. My friend said you would have to treat the tetration as a infinite series, and therefore could not perform algebraic manipulations on it before it is know whether it converges or diverges. However my attempt is to first do some algebraic steps, then discuss the convergence radius. I) Initial discussion At the start it is obvious that the tetration converges when $a=1$ (just set $x=1$ )
Now after some computer hardwork it seems that the tetration fails to converge when a is roughly larger than 3. II) Algebraic manipulation $$ x^{x^{x^{.^{.^.}}}} \, = \, a$$ This is the same as $$ x^a \, = \, a$$ $$ \log_a(x^a) \, = \, \log_a(a)$$ $$ \log_a(x) \, = \, \frac{1}{a}$$ $$ x \, = \, a^{\frac{1}{a}}$$ Now, if we let $a=2$ then $x = \sqrt{2}$ . After some more computational work, this seems to be correct, which makes me believe this formula is correct. III) Discsussion about convergence By looking at the derivative of $ \displaystyle \large a^{\frac{1}{a}} $ we see that the maxima occurs when $a=e$ , which also seems to correspond to the inital computational work.
Now I think, that the minima of $\displaystyle \large a^{1/a}$ is zero by looking at its graph, studying its derivative and the endpoints. So that my ""guess"" or work shows that it converges when $$ a \in [0 \, , \,  1/e] $$ VI) My questions Can my algebraic manipulations be justified? They seem rather sketchy
taking the a`th logarithm and so on . (Although they seem to ""magically""
give out the right answer) By looking at Wikipedia it seems that the tetration converge when $$ a \in \left[ 1/e \, , \, e \right] $$ This is almost what I have, why is my lower bound wrong? How can  I find the correct lower bound?","['exponentiation', 'convergence-divergence', 'real-analysis', 'tetration']"
108290,Dimension of its irreducible components in Elimination Theory.,"There is a small result I don't understand. To preface, for an algebraic variety $V\subset\mathbb{A}^n$ over some field $F$, one defines $\dim V=\operatorname{trdeg}(F(x)/F)$ for a generic point $(x)$ of $V$. Also, I denote by $V(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ the set of zeroes in $\mathbb{A}^n$  of some homogeneous forms $f_i$ in $F[X]$. As an algebraic set, we know $V(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ can be written as a finite union of irreducible components without inclusion relations. Now let $M(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ be the maximum of the dimensions of the irreducible components. Apparently for any nonnegative $d$, the set of points $(f_1,\dots,f_r):=(w)_f$ where $M(f_1,\dots,f_r)>d$ is also an algebraic set. I identify the points $(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ as a subset of $\mathbb{A}^n$ in the following way. For a finite set of forms $(f)=(f_1,\dots,f_r)$, let $d_1,\dots,d_r$ be the degrees, with $d_i\geq 1$ for all $i$. Each $f_i$ can be written as
$$
f_i=\sum w_{i,(v)}M_{(v)}(X)
$$
where $M_{(v)}(X)$ is a monomial in some set of indeterminates $(X)$ of degree $d_i$, and $w_{i,(v)}$ is a coefficient. Let $(w)=(w)_f$ be the point obtained by arranging the coefficients $w_{i,(v)}$ in some definite order, and consider this point in some affine space $\mathbb{A}^n$, where $n$ is the number of coefficients, determined by the degrees $d_1,\dots,d_r$. So given such degrees, the set of all forms $(f)=(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ with these degrees is in bijection with the points of $\mathbb{A}^n$. So if given a fixed $d\geq 0$, then why is the set of $(f_1,\dots,f_r):=(w)_f$ such that $M(f_1,\dots,f_r)>d$ an algebraic set? So given $d\geq 0$, I want to find all sets of forms $f_1,\dots,f_r$ such that the maximum dimension of the irreducible components of their set of zeroes in $\mathbb{A}^n$ has degree greater than that fixed $d$. Then for each possible set of forms meeting that condition, I identify with a point in $\mathbb{A}^n$ as described above. Why are those points in $\mathbb{A}^n$ an algebraic set?","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
108296,Polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ sending integers to integers?,"We can view the binomial coefficient $\binom{x}{k}$ has a polynomial in $x$ with degree $k$.

108308,Apostol proof divides by zero?,"The following is a proof from Apostol's linear algebra book that $\{1,t,t^{2},...\}$ is independent. To my eye, he's dividing by zero repeatedly. Is this really as huge an error as it seems, or are there missing details that would make this rigorous? It suffices to show that for each $n$ the $n+1$ polynomials $1,t,...,t^{n}$
are independent. If these polynomials span the zero polynomial we
have $$\sum_{k=0}^{n}c_{k}t^{k}=0$$ for all real $t$. Putting $t=0$ we see that $c_{0}=0$. Now divide
by $t$ and put $t=0$ again to find $c_{1}=0$. Repeating the process
we find every $c_{k}$ is $0$, so $1,t,...,t^{n}$ are independent. Edit : I'm treating ""polynomial"" as a garden-variety function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$, and it seems like that may be part of my problem.",['linear-algebra']

We can define $$F(G)=\{g\in G\,|\,o(\operatorname{Cl}(g))<\infty\},$$ where $o(\operatorname{Cl}(g))$ is the order (cardinality) of the conjugacy class of $g$ in $G$. This set is a subgroup of $G$ because 1) $o(\operatorname{Cl}(1))=1<\infty;$ 2) we have $g(xy)g^{-1}=(gxg^{-1})(gyg^{-1}),$ so $\operatorname{Cl}(xy)\subseteq\operatorname{Cl}(x)\operatorname{Cl}(y).$ Therefore, if $$o(\operatorname{Cl}(x))<\infty\text{ and }o(\operatorname{Cl}(y))<\infty,$$ then $o(\operatorname{Cl}(xy))<\infty.$ $F(G)$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G.$ Indeed, let $\alpha$ be an automorphism of $G$. Then $$\alpha(g)\alpha(x)(\alpha(g))^{-1}=\alpha(gxg^{-1})$$ for all $g,x\in G.$ We have $o(\alpha(\operatorname{Cl}(x)))=o(\operatorname{Cl}(x))$ because $\alpha$ is a bijection and so, since $\{\alpha(g)\,|\,g\in G\}=G,$ we obtain $$o(\operatorname{Cl}(\alpha(g)))<\infty,$$ and therefore $$\alpha(g)\in F(G).$$ I would like to ask if there is a name for this characteristic subgroup.

108405,Explicit descriptions of groups of order 45,"I know that there are two groups of order 45, and obviously one of them (up to isomorphism) is $\mathbb{Z}_{45}$.

What this second group of order 45 doesn't have, unlike $\mathbb{Z}_{45}$, is a subgroup of order 15.  This rules out an element of order 15, which would generate a cyclic subgroup.  I know the group is abelian since we can write it as a product of normal subgroups.  Otherwise I'm unsure of what consequences this has, and what the structure of the non-cyclic group of order 45 is.

I'm concerned with the problem, whether in the interval $\small f_n(+1).. f_n(-1) $ or
 $$ {3^n+1 \over 2^n+1} \le x \le  {3^n-1 \over 2^n-1} $$ 
an x can be integer (In the original version of this question I asked for a ""crossing of an integer value"" in $\small f_n(+1) \ldots f_n(-1) $ which seemed to be somehow obfuscating). Obviously this interval is roughly centered around the noninteger number $ {3^n \over 2^n}$ and the question can be reformulated whether for all $n \gt 1$
 $$ \left\lfloor {3^n \over 2^n} \right\rfloor \lt {3^n+1 \over 2^n+1} \le {3^n \over 2^n} \le  {3^n-1 \over 2^n-1} \lt \left\lceil {3^n \over 2^n} \right\rceil $$ 
Or one could ask whether in the interval $\small f_n(1)<x=f_n(j)<f_n(-1) $ there is an integer x for some j where  $ -1 \le j \le 1 $. Empirically we'll find an integer only for $\small n \in \{1,4,7\}  $ and moreover, such an integer for some negative j only at n=1 . Remarks: It's worth to note that 
 $${3^n+ \frac12 (\frac43)^n \over 2^n+\frac12 (\frac43)^n}

defines an interval which increases with $\small n \ge 1$ from width 0.375 up to $\small 1 $ (not including). 
Thus it can contain at most one integer number and the interval here in question
 $\small f(1) \ldots f(-1) $ or $ {3^n+ 1 \over 2^n+1} \ldots  {3^n- 1 \over 2^n-1} $
is always enclosed within.

But that problem ""took me"" quite a long time in the last years and I'm still curious in its relevant aspects, and I was just re-reading some of my older notes on it.

108544,Differential equations notation,"I've always wondered why does the differential equation notation for linear equations differ from the standard terminology of vector spaces. We all know that the equation $y'' + p(x) y' + q(x)y = g(x)$ for some function $g$ is called linear and that the associated equation $y'' + p(x)y' + q(x) y = 0$ is called homogeneous . But why is that? WHY should mathematicians explicitly cause confusion with the rest of the theory of vector spaces? What I mean by that is : Why not call the equation $y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x)$ an affine equation and call $y' + p(x) y' + q(x) y = 0$ a linear equation? Because linear equations (in the sense of differential equations) are not linear in the sense of vector spaces unless they're homogeneous ; and linear equations (in the sense of differential equations) remind me more of a linear system of the form $Ax = b$ (which is called an affine equation in vector space theory) than of a linear equation at all.

108549,Constructing a countable family of seminorms in a metrizable LCS.,"Here's some context before my question. Let $\mathbb{V}$ be a topological vector space, which is Hausdorff and such that its topology is generated by some arbitrary family of seminorms $\{\rho_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in I}$; this means that $\mathbb{V}$ is locally convex. Now, if $I$ turns out to be countable (or if we can reduce the family $\{\rho_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in I}$ to a countable one, while keeping the same topology in $\mathbb{V}$), we can define a metric in $\mathbb{V}$ by
$$d(u, v) = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^i} \frac{\rho_i(u - v)}{1 + \rho_i(u - v)},$$
where $\{\rho_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is some enumeration of $\{\rho_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in I}$, so that its topology is metrizable. I've been told that the converse is also true, which leads to my question. QUESTION : Let $\mathbb{V}$ be a topological vector space having a metrizable topology, generated by some metric $d$.

A theorem says that in this case $$o([G,G])\leq(n^2)^{n^3}, $$ where $o(\cdot)$ denotes order and $[G,G]=G'$ is the commutator subgroup of $G$. The bounds from the proof seem crude and I would like to ask if we can improve upon the result. Of course, the theorem is valuable with any bound because it implies that $G'$ is finite. Proof. We have exactly $n$ cosets $\{x_iZ(G)\}_{i=1}^n$. We will be using the representatives $x_i.$ Let $$c_{ij}=[x_i,x_j]=x_i^{-1}x_j^{-1}x_ix_j.$$ First, we note the following Lemma 1. $$\{c_{ij}\,|\,i,j=1,...,n\}=\{[x,y]\,|\,x,y\in G\}.$$ Proof of lemma. For $x,y\in G$ we have some $i,j\in\{1,...,n\}$ and $z_1,z_2\in Z(G)$ such that $$x=x_iz_1\text{ and }y=x_jz_2.$$ Then $$
\begin{eqnarray}
[x,y]&=&x^{-1}y^{-1}xy=z_1^{-1}x_i^{-1}z_2^{-1}x_j^{-1}x_iz_1x_jz_2\\
&=& (x_i^{-1}x_j^{-1}x_ix_j)(z_1^{-1}z_1z_2^{-1}z_2)\\
&=& x_i^{-1}x_j^{-1}x_ix_j\\
&=& [x_i,x_j].
\end{eqnarray}
$$ Lemma 2. For $x,y\in G$ we have $$[x,y]^{n+1}=[x,y^2][y^{-1}xy,y]^{n-1}.$$ Proof of lemma. Since $G/Z(G)$ has order $n$, we have $[x,y]^n\in Z(G)$. Therefore $$
\begin{eqnarray}
[x,y]^{n+1}&=&x^{-1}y^{-1}xy[x,y]^n\\
&=& x^{-1}y^{-1}x[x,y]^ny\\
&=& x^{-1}y^{-1}x(x^{-1}y^{-1}xy)[x,y]^{n-1}y\\
&=& (x^{-1}y^{-2}xy^2)y^{-1}[x,y]^{n-1}y\\
&=& [x,y^2][y^{-1}xy,y^{-1}yy]^{n-1}\\
&=& [x,y^2][y^{-1}xy,y]^{n-1}
\end{eqnarray}
$$ Proof cont'd. Let $g\in G'.$ It is a product of a a finite number $m$ of elements $c_{ij}$ (with possible repetitions) because $[x,y]^{-1}=[y,x]$ and so we do not need to consider inverses. Suppose $m>n^3$. We have $$\operatorname{card}(\{c_{ij}\,|\,i,j=1,...,n\})\leq n^2$$ so some element $c_{ij},$ say $c=[x,y],$ must appear at least $n+1$ times in the product. There is no reason to believe however that $c^{n+1}$ occurs in the product since the occurances of $c$ may be scattered. We fix it by noting that for any $x',y'\in G$ we have $$[x',y'][x,y]=[x,y]c^{-1}[x',y']c=[x,y][c^{-1}x'c,c^{-1}yc].\tag1$$ This allows us to rewrite $g$ as a product of commutators which begins with $[x,y]^{n+1}:$ $$g=[x,y]^{n+1}c_{n+1}c_{n+1}...c_{m}.$$ But this equals $$[x,y^2][y^{-1}xy,y]^{n-1}c_{n+1}c_{n+1}...c_{m},$$ which is a product of $m-1$ commutators. Repeating this procedure, we can decrease the number of factors to $n^3.$ Therefore we can write any element of $G'$ as a product of at most $n^3$ commutators. We recall that there can be at most $n^2$ distinct commutators in $G$ and therefore there are at most $(n^2)^{n^3}$ elements in $G'.$ EDIT I have laid my hands on a copy of Passman's book on group rings and I see that the theorem and the proof come from it.

(c) Let $\alpha$ be the counting measure on $2^X$. Then two functions on $X$ are equal almost everywhere $[\alpha]$ if and only if they take the same value at every point in $X$.

Then $2^X$ is a sigma algebra and by definition the if $(X,2^X)$ is a measure space, then $f:X\to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is measurable since the the set $\{x\in X : f(x) < c\} \in 2^X$ for every $c\in \mathbb{R}$. (b) Here, it suffices to show that the sets which have measure zero are the sets which does not contain $x$. So suppose $f=g$ a.e. then there is a set $N$ with measure zero such that $A=\{x\in X : f(x)\ne g(x)\} \subset N$. But these are precisely those  points which don't contain $x$. So $f(x)=g(x)$ on $N^c$. (c) By definition of the counting measure , the empty set is the only set with counting measure zero.

I guess my biggest problem is that I don't really know how diagonal and permutation matrices (don't) commute. Because it is not true that $DM=MD$ when $D\in T$ and $M\in P$ since the permutation is either horizontal or vertical, but sometimes it seems like you can do something like it. So far, I have proved that $P\subset N(T)$, in the following way. Let $M_\sigma\in P$. Then $M_\sigma=VS_\sigma$, with $V\in T$ and $S_\sigma$ a permutation matrix. So $M_\sigma DM^{-1}=VS_\sigma D S_\sigma^T V^{-1}$. Thus if we prove that $S_\sigma D S_\sigma^T$ is diagonal we are done. This is true since $S_\sigma D S_\sigma^T=(x_1 e_{\sigma(1)} \dots x_n e_{\sigma(n)}) (e_{\sigma^{-1}(1)} \dots e_{\sigma^{-1}(n)})=(x_{\sigma^{-1}(1)}e_1 \dots x_{\sigma^{-1}(n)}e_n)$, where $e_i$ are the standard basis vectors. Even this is hopelessly written out. I'm trying to find a way to see what the product $S_\sigma D S_\sigma^T$ is without writing it in vectors. For the other way around I don't really know what to do. I'm having a hard time rewriting matrix products in a useful way. Perhaps there is a way of proving this using something completely different? Maybe you can prove it using $N(T)/T\simeq S_n$, but this actually what I want to use my question for.

The question is, if we are trying to approximate the area of a square with identical circles, does the sequence of approximations converge (and does it converge to the area of the square)? Because for 1,4,9,16, and 25 circles, the ratio r of the area of the approximating circles to that of the square is the same ($\frac{\pi}{4}$), I thought that this pattern surely continued. So my original question was whether, if we remove the square-numbered approximations, we get a convergent sequence. I see that this is related to the problem of packing circles into a square, and having looked at the sequence of ratios (given here ) I see that after 25 the ""best"" packing is not a nice military arrangement but something else, something that allows the circles to swell a bit. So the ""best"" packing improves for square numbers as well. And so it does appear that we have a non-monotone sequence of approximations that might or might not converge to a ratio r = 1. But appearances can be deceiving. I did a quick review of the literature (at the link above) but it is addressed primarily at the question of optimal packing for given numbers of circles, and not convergence, which I hope is much simpler.

Suppose I have an arbitrary (continuous) function $f:X \longrightarrow Y$, where $Y$ is a Hausdorff space (I think it is irrelevant for my question whether $X$ is Hausdorff or not, so I just consider it to be a topological space - if this is incorrect, please correct me!).

For continuity of such a map, I would normally consider continuity to mean that $f^{-1}(V)$ is closed in $X$ whenever $V$ is closed in $Y$, though again definitions involving convergence of sequences and the notion that $f$ is continuous iff $f(\overline{A}) \subset \overline{f(A)}$ for every $A \subset X$ are also known to me.","['general-topology', 'analysis']"

  of conditioning probability distributions in statistics, while
  avoiding purely abstract formulations of conditional probability. The linked paper Chang, J.T.; Pollard, D. (1997). "" Conditioning as disintegration "". STATISTICA NEERLANDICA 51 (3) has 30 pages and is somehow overwhelming to me now. Following is a scenario I am considering (but it may be over-complicated and misleading, I am not sure): Suppose $(\Omega, \mathcal{M},P)$ is a probability space. $(S, \mathcal{S})$ is a measurable space. and $Y:\Omega \to S$  is a measurable mapping. 
The conditional probability $P(\cdot | Y)$ is a mapping $\mathcal{M} \times S \to [0,1]$. I guess it is only when the conditional probability is regular, i.e. $\forall s \in S$, $P(\cdot | Y)(s)$ is a probability measure, that the conditional probability can be given by the disintegration theorem?

108766,LÃ¼roth's Theorem,"I have just begun to read Shafarevich's Basic Algebraic Geometry . In the first section of the first chapter, he quotes LÃ¼roth's theorem, which states that any subfield of $k(x)$ that is not just $k$ is isomorphic to $k(x)$, i.e. is generated as a field over $k$ by a single rational function of $x$. I have been trying to find a proof. I am stuck, and would appreciate any hints to fill in the argument. (I have consulted Wikipedia, Wolfram Mathworld, and this MathOverflow question , but so far haven't been able to satisfy myself.) I have thought about two approaches so far. My question would be answered by a suggestion about how to complete either one of these ideas. Here they are: Let $k\subset L \subset k(x)$ be an intermediate field not equal to $k$. Approach #1: Any element of $k(x)$ not in $k$ is transcendental over $k$; meanwhile, $k(x)$ has transcendence degree 1 over $k$; it follows that $L$ has transcendence degree 1 over $k$. Thus $k(x)$ is algebraic over $L$. Let $p(t)$ be the minimal polynomial of $x$ over $L$. $$p(t)=t^n+l_1t^{n-1}+\dots+l_n$$ where $l_1,\dots,l_n\in L$ (and are thus rational functions of $x$). Now if the theorem is really true, $L=k(f)$ for some $f\in k(x)$; and $f=r/s$, with $r,s\in k[x]$. Then $p(t)=r(t)-fs(t)$. This is degree $n=\max(\deg r,\deg s)$ in $t$. Any coefficient of any power of $t$ in $p(t)$ is actually either in $k$ (if this power of $t$ does not appear in $s$), or else it is a linear function of $f$ and thus a field generator for $L$ and degree $n$ as a rational function of $x$. Thus I expect to be able to prove that, with $p(t)$ defined as above, actually any of the coefficients $l_1,\dots,l_n$ not contained in $k$, i.e. any of them (say $l_i$) that is a nonconstant function of $x$, is degree $n$ as a function of $x$ and is thus a field generator for $L$. (It would be sufficient to prove that it is degree $n$ as a function of $x$, because then $k(x)\supset L \supset k(l_i)$, but $[k(x):L]=[k(x):k(l_i)]=n$.) One internet source I found suggested that this is the right approach, but I can't seem to fill it in. Here's what I've got: $p(t)$ is divisible by $t-x$ over $k(x)$ (since $x$ is a root), and over $k(l_1,\dots,l_n)$ it is irreducible (since this field is contained in $L$). I can't see that there is anything else I know about it for sure. It must be that irreducibility over $k(l_1,\dots,l_n)$ implies that $l_1,\dots,l_n$ are all either degree $n$ or else in $k$; but I haven't figured out how. From examples I have worked out (in which I chose $l_1,\dots,l_n$ semi-arbitrarily to fulfill $(t-x)\mid p(t)$), this seems to be true; if I make any of them different in degree from $0$ or $n$, then usually I can also get $x$ as a rational function of them, thus in these examples $k(l_1,\dots,l_n)=k(x)$ and $p(t)$ is divisible by $t-x$ over $k(l_1,\dots,l_n)$. Of course I assume it can also happen that I choose $l_1,\dots,l_n$ so that $k(l_1,\dots,l_n)\neq k(x)$, but $p(x)$ will still factor over $k(l_1,\dots,l_n)$ as long as any of the $l_i$ not in $k$ differ in degree from $n$. In any case all the calculations have felt ad-hoc and I haven't so far seen a reason for what is happening. So any hints here would be appreciated. Approach #2: Because the theorem reminds me of the result that $k[x]$ is a p.i.d., I have also been unable to escape the following thought: let $f\in L$ be an element of $L$ of minimal degree as a function of $x$, and suppose that there is some other element $g\in L$ not in $k(f)$. Can I construct some element of $L$ using $f$ and $g$ (i.e. an element of $k(f,g)$) that contradicts $f$'s minimality in degree? I have not given this approach as much thought as the above, but again, so far I have not seen how to carry out the construction. The Euclidean-algorithm trick that proves $k[x]$ is a p.i.d. is unavailable here because I can't multiply $f$ or $g$ by anything that is not a rational function of one or the other of them. (In particular I can't see how to pass to a polynomial ring in $x$ but make sure I've stayed inside $k(f,g)$.) $g$ does have a minimal polynomial over $k(f)$, and if $g\notin k(f)$ then its degree is $>1$, so this could be a starting point for trying to construct the lower-degree element of $k(f,g)$, but again I haven't seen how to make this work. So here again, I would appreciate any thought that could be used to complete the argument. Thanks in advance!","['rational-functions', 'algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

108923,Upper bounds on the size of $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$,"Any automorphism of a group $G$ is a bijection that fixes the identity, so an easy upper bound for the size of $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ for a finite group $G$ is given by \begin{align*}\lvert\operatorname{Aut}(G)\rvert \leq (|G| - 1)! \end{align*} This inequality is an equality for cyclic groups of orders $1$ , $2$ and $3$ and also the Klein four-group $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z_2}$ . I think it's reasonable to believe that they are the only groups with this property. The factorial $(|G| - 1)!$ is eventually huge. I searched through groups of order less than $100$ with GAP and found no other examples. The problem can be reduced to the abelian case. We can check the groups of order $< 6$ by hand. Then if $|G| \geq 6$ and the equality holds, we have $\operatorname{Aut}(G) \cong S_{|G|-1}$ . Now $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$ is a normal subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut(G)}$ , and is thus isomorphic to $\{(1)\}$ , $A_{|G|-1}$ or $S_{|G|-1}$ . This is because $A_n$ is the only proper nontrivial normal subgroup of $S_n$ when $n \geq 5$ . We can see that $(|G| - 1)!/2 > |G|$ and thus $\operatorname{Inn}(G) \cong G/Z(G)$ is trivial. How to prove that there are no other groups for which the equality $\lvert\operatorname{Aut}(G)\rvert = (|G| - 1)!$ holds? Are any better upper bounds known for larger groups?","['automorphism-group', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

108951,Is the centralizer of a semisimple element in a connected algebraic group always connected,"There is an exercise on page 142 of Humphreys' Linear Algebraic Groups : Ex.1 Let $G$ be a connected algebraic group, $x \in G$ is semisimple. Must $C_G(x)$ be connected? When $G$ is solvable, I think of another fact whose correctedness is proved on the book: Let $H$ be a subgroup (not necessarily closed) of a connected solvable group $G$, $H$ consisting of semisimple elements. Then $C_G(H) = N_G(H)$ is connected. So, suppose that $G$ is solvable, set $H = \langle x \rangle$. It appears that $C_G(x)$ is connected. I think the general case could be reduced to the solvable case if for any $y \in C_G(x)$, I can find a Borel subgroup of $G$ containing both $x$ and $y$. (Then $y$ must be in $C_B(x)$ which is connected.) I think the Borel subgroup could be found, may be through the method of Borel variety. But I have difficulty in this. Another exercise on the same page is: Ex.2 Let $G$ be a connected algebraic group. If $x \in G$ has semisimple part $x_s$, then $x$ is contained in the identity component of $C_G(x_s)$. If the answer to Ex.1 is affirmative, then Ex.2 would be obvious, since $x \in C_G(x_s)$. But I am not sure. So, would you please tell me the answer to Ex.1 , or help me with the proof or counterexample? If the centralizer could be not connected, how can I give Ex.2 a proof?

I can show the sequence is Cauchy if the mapping had been a contraction, but the technique there doesn't generalize well.

Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $\{T^nx_0\}$ did not converge to the fixed point $\alpha$. Then $\exists \epsilon$ and a subseq $\{ T^{n(k)} x_0 \}$ s.t. for each $n(k)$, $d(T^{n(k)} x_0 , \alpha ) > \epsilon $. By compactness, $ \{ T^{n(k)} x_0 \}$ admits a convergent subseq.

109037,Weaker version of Cauchy sequence criteria [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Closed 12 years ago . Possible Duplicate: Why doesn't $d(x_n,x_{n+1})\rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ imply ${x_n}$ is Cauchy? my question is this: The following definition is weaker than the definition of Cauchy sequences: $\forall \; \epsilon > 0, \;\exists N \in \mathbb{N} \;s.t.\; \forall\; n \geq N, \; |a_{n+1}-a_n | < \epsilon.$ Show that this is not equivalent to $(a_n)$ being a Cauchy sequence. The definition of Cauchy sequence is: A sequence $(s_n)$ is Cauchy if (and only if) for each $\epsilon > 0$ there exists an integer $N$ with the property that $|s_n-s_m| < \epsilon$ whenever $n\geq N$ and $m \geq N$. Note that a sequence (of real numbers) is convergent if and only if it is Cauchy. So I see an (the?) obvious difference between these two in that the Cauchy criteria demands that all values in a sequence above a certain index ($N$) are within a prescribed tolerance of each other, whether adjacent or not. This is where the question is weaker, in that it only requires the immediately adjacent values of the sequence to be within a tolerance of $\epsilon$. This would then allow, by taking successive differences of adjacent values, to accumulate a difference greater than $\epsilon$. This is seen as, $$\left| \sum_{i=1}^{n+1}\,a_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n}\,a_i\right| < \epsilon,\quad
\left|\sum_{i=1}^{n+2}\,a_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n+1}\,a_i\right| < \epsilon,\quad
\left| \sum_{i=1}^{n+3}\,a_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n+2}\,a_i\right| < \epsilon,$$
and summing each side of the inequalities gives (after reverting to sequence-notation and employing the triangle inequality),
$$
\left(|a_{n+1}-a_n| + |a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}| + |a_{n+3}-a_{n+2}| + \cdots + |a_{K} - a_{K-1}| \right) \leq \left( \epsilon_{1,2} + \epsilon_{2,3} + \epsilon_{3,4} + \cdots + \epsilon_{K-1,K} \right)
$$
which implies
$$\left( \epsilon_{1,2} + \epsilon_{2,3} + \epsilon_{3,4} + \cdots + \epsilon_{K-1,K} \right)_{\textrm{ by weaker criteria }}   \geq |a_n - a_{n+K}|_{\textrm{ by Cauchy criteria }}$$ If I understand these differences correctly, then my main problem is putting these into a formal mathematical proof.
