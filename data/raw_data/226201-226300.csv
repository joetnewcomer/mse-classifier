4669413,Stability of the SIR epidemic model — Jacobian is singular,"The SIR epidemic model presents three differential equations for three time-dependent variables — $S(t)$ , $I(t)$ , $R(t)$ . \begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta SI\\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta SI - \gamma I\\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I\\
\end{aligned} For the SIR model, I calculate the Jacobian matrix $J$ , as follows \begin{equation*}
J = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial S} & \frac{\partial S}{\partial I} & \frac{\partial S}{\partial R} \\
\frac{\partial I}{\partial S} & \frac{\partial I}{\partial I} & \frac{\partial I}{\partial R} \\

\begin{pmatrix}
- \beta I & - \beta S & 0 \\
\beta I & \beta S -\gamma & 0 \\
0 & \gamma & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*} In this case, the characteristic polynomial is given by $$(-\lambda) \left( \lambda^2+(\beta I-\beta S+\gamma)\lambda+\beta I\gamma \right)$$ To determine the stability of the disease-free equilibrium we substitute $S = 1$ and $I = 0$ for $S$ and $I$ . Hence, the characteristic polynomial becomes $$-\lambda^2(\lambda-\beta+\gamma)$$ This has three roots: $\lambda_1$ , $\lambda_2 =0$ and $\lambda_3=\beta-\gamma$ . The last eigenvalue to be negative is required that $\beta<\gamma$ . How can I determine the stability if two of the three eigenvalues are $0$ ? I have seen some solutions for $2 \times 2$ matrix, but I don't understand them. Is there any easy reason for being stable or unstable?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'stability-in-odes', 'epidemiology', 'dynamical-systems']"
4669482,Is there a good way to estimate this double integral related to the Airy functions,"Let $\operatorname{Ai}(x,y)$ be the Airy kernel which is given by \begin{equation}\label{equ2.12}
\operatorname{Ai}(x,y)=
 \begin{cases}
 \frac{\operatorname{Ai}(x)\operatorname{Ai}'(y)-\operatorname{Ai}(y)\operatorname{Ai}'(x)}{x-y}, & x\ne y, \\
 \operatorname{Ai}'(x)^2-x\operatorname{Ai}(x)^2 & x=y. \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation} Here $\operatorname{Ai}(x)$ denotes the standard Airy function \begin{align*}
\operatorname{Ai}(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\mathcal{C}}{e^{x\cdot t+t^3/3}\,\mathrm dt},
\end{align*} where $\mathcal{C}$ is a contour running from $\infty e^{- i \pi /3}$ to $\infty e^{ i \pi /3}$ , or any other contour which can be deform from this one such that $\operatorname{Re}(t^3) \to -\infty$ along the contour.
Using the relation \begin{align}\label{equ2.13}
\operatorname{Ai}(x,y)=\int_0^{\infty}{\operatorname{Ai}(t+x)\operatorname{Ai}(t+y)\,\mathrm dt},
\end{align} we have the following double integral representation of the Airy kernel \begin{align*}
\operatorname{Ai}(x, y)=\frac{1}{(2\pi i)^2}\int_{-\mathcal{C}}\mathrm dt\int_{\mathcal{C}}\mathrm ds\, \frac{e^{x\cdot s+s^3/3}}{e^{y\cdot t+t^3/3}}\cdot\frac{1}{s-t},
\end{align*} Now let $\cdots<-\lambda_{k}<\cdots<-\lambda_1<0$ be the zeroes of the Airy function $\operatorname{Ai}(x)$ and let $\cdots<-\mu_{k}<\cdots<-\mu_1<0$ be the zeroes of $\operatorname{Ai}'(x)$ respectively. Choose large enough and close $\lambda_{k}$ , $\mu_{j}$ satisfying $$
|\lambda_k-\mu_j|\sim \frac{\lambda_k^{-\frac12}}{|k-j|}.
$$ Then one can obtain $$
A(k, j)\triangleq\frac{|\operatorname{Ai}(-\lambda_k, -\mu_j)|}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Ai}(-\lambda_k, -\lambda_k)}\cdot \sqrt{\operatorname{Ai}(-\mu_j, -\mu_j)}}\approx \frac{1}{2|k-j|}
$$ Now I need to deal with a more complicated form than the Airy kernel. More precisely, consider \begin{align*}
I(x, y)=\frac{1}{(2\pi i)^2}\int_{-\mathcal{C}}\mathrm dt\int_{\mathcal{C}}\mathrm ds\, \frac{e^{x\cdot s+s^3/3}}{e^{y\cdot t+t^3/3}}\cdot\frac{1}{s-t}\cdot\frac{2e^{-2(s-t)}}{1-e^{-(s-t)}}.
\end{align*} This can be seen as a ""perturbation"" of the Airy kernel. I hope to understand the asymptotic behavior of the form $$
T(k, j)\triangleq\frac{|I(-\lambda_k, -\mu_j)|}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Ai}(-\lambda_k, -\lambda_k)}\cdot \sqrt{\operatorname{Ai}(-\mu_j, -\mu_j)}}.
$$ Question: Is there a good way to evaluate $T(k, j)$ and is there a similar estimate as $A(k, j)$ above? I think the key is to evaluate the double integral $I(-\lambda_k, -\mu_j)$ . Maybe some kind of saddle point argument is needed but I don't know how to deal with it. Thanks in advance.","['complex-analysis', 'special-functions', 'asymptotics']"

4669541,Bagging a random sample with duplicate,"this is a question posed by an engineer friend who had this probability problem arise at work. It goes like this, Say we have 5000 marbles. Of them, we know that 50 are duplicates. They are not necessarily all the same duplicates, and not necessarily perfect distinct pairs of duplicates. So, we know that there are 4950 distinct marbles and 50 marbles that are duplicates. Consider randomly bagging these marbles into 100 bags of 50 marbles. What is the probability that at least one bag has at least one pair of duplicate marbles? Another way of phrasing: What is the probability that after bagging, one or more bags contain two (or more) of the same marbles?  (You can simplify this if you would like as it is a bit vague, but an answer to the general question is preferred. So, if you want to assume that the duplicates are all the same or the duplicates all show up in perfect pairs.) I gave this a shot myself, but it is a bit more complicated than I am capable of solving with certainty. The engineers working with this problem seem to believe the probability is very low. However, I disagree and believe that the probability is considerably high. Any solution including a simplification of the problem to give a rough approximation (or what we hope would be an approximation) is great. I'd prefer to see steps and reasoning to justify your answer as well as teach me how to approach such a problem.

4669668,How to calculate proximity of corners to a point in a square,"Forgive me in advance for not necessarily knowing how to ask this question:
I would like to calculate the proximity to each of the four corners of a square given an arbitrary (single) input point P, but expressed as value between 0-1, so if the point P (x, y) was located at C for example, C's output value would be '1' and if it was located at A, C's value would be '0'.  There should be a mix between the corners. What are the necessary steps to achieve this?
The context is that I'm building an application whereby the user inputs a location (the point) and I would like the outputs to be normalized as a list of values [0, 1, 0, 0] for example, representing [vA, vB, vC, vD] with B as the corner point.  In this case coordinate P would be [-1, 1].  If the point is [0,0] the output would be [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5].","['analytic-geometry', 'trigonometry', 'geometry']"
4669682,Calculating the probability of placing $N$th in a point-based tournament?,"Consider a tournament with $N$ players. The tournament consists of $M$ games. Each game involves all $N$ players. The result of a game is a ranked list of players. Tournament points are awarded based on the per-game rank. At the end of $M$ games, the players are then ranked by the sum total of their tournament points. How can I calculate the probability of given player placing in a given rank at the end of tournament? Clearly the probability is $1 / N$ when all tournament point sums are equal, like at the start of the tournament. The particular case I'm interested in is given an intermediate state of tournament points what is the probability? Example $N = 3$ , $M = 3$ . Tournament points are awarded 10 points, 5 points, and 0 points for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd respectively. Team 1 2 3 A 10 B 5 C 0 What is the probability Team A will place 2nd at the end of the tournament? My Shortcomings Note: I realize now the following doesn't correctly account for ties, my apologies. Manually Counting My naive approach was to manually count all the possibilities. The total possible tournament outcomes $N!^M$ . In this case, M is 2 because there are only 2 remaining games. This gives 36 possible outcomes. By tallying the results, where A places second, I get 8, thus 8 / 36 is the probability that Team A places second. This approach is quickly intractable as N or M increases. Therein lies my problem. I need to be able to calculate the probability without manually counting the frequency in all possible permutations. Conditional Probability I then tried to calculate the probability of one round using conditional probability: Let $S_x$ = the score of team $x$ Then P(A placing 2nd) = $P(S_b > S_a + 5)$ + $P(S_c > S_a + 10)$ - $P(S_b > S_a + 5 \bigcap S_c > S_a + 10)$ $P(S_c > S_a + 10) = 0$ $P(S_b > S_a + 5) = P(S_b = 10) P(S_a = 0 | S_b = 10)$ $P(S_b > S_a + 5) = \frac{1}{3} P(S_a = 0 | S_b = 10)$ $P(S_b > S_a + 5) = \frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{2}$ $P(S_b > S_a + 5) = \frac{1}{6}$ But this approach doesn't easily lend itself to multiple rounds and it is still computationally complex for larger $N$ and $M$ . My intuition is that there's some deeper combinatorics at work here but I couldn't make headway thinking of a solution. I tried to think of a sub-problem that might be composable here. Using the example, Team B outplacing Team C (in any permutation), but I feel like it's not useful because it is the probability of a dependent event.","['combinatorics', 'probability']"

I originally wanted to prove the first statement as the second statement follows after taking $b_n = {1\over{n\ln(n)}}$ . I have since realized that there is another solution to the original question which doesn't involve this lemma, but I still am curious to know whether the lemma is true. I have figured out that the lemma is not true if you take away the requirement that both $a_n$ and $b_n$ are decreasing, but I believe with this restriction, the result should be true.","['alternative-proof', 'calculus', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

Proof : This formula being homogeneous, we can assume WLOG that $a=2$ . Let us take for the $x$ -axis line $AB$ , $M$ as the origin. In this way $A=(-1,0)$ and $B=(1,0)$ .

For a differentiable function $f$ , define a locus of points $P$ as follows: Let $m$ be an arbitrary tangent line to $f$ , and let $n$ be another tangent line that is perpendicular to $m$ . A point is in $P$ iff it is the intersection of $m,n$ . For a parabola, $P$ is the directrix (you can prove this with algebra or with geometry). But for other types of graphs, it gets a little weirder. Some examples: For $f(x)=x^3$ , $P= \emptyset$ since $f'(x) \geq 0 \space \forall x$ . For $f(x) = \sin(x)$ , $P$ is a lattice of points consisting of the intersections of tangent lines having a slope of 1 and -1.

I have drawn it in Geogebra and it looks like an inverted bell curve, which makes sense, but I can't get an actual equation to describe it. The same algebraic techniques used to show that $P$ will be the directrix when $f$ is a parabola end up with awful equations that I'm not even sure have a closed form solution.

4670333,Motivating Gauss's suggestions of prize problems for the Goettingen university.,"(This question was posted before in History of Science and Mathematics stackexchange, but since I recieved no comments after 6 days, I decided to reask it here.) P. 220-221 of volume 12 of Gauss's werke contain a complete list of the prize problems which Gauss suggested to the Goettingen university in the years 1830, 1834, 1842 and 1849. Those prize problems can shed some light on his intentions for further studies of several mathematical questions whose solution he did not complete. Here is a Google translation (from Latin) of some of the problems in the list: 1830, May 6. [1] Derive the general criterion for the solvability of the differential trinomial $pdx^2+2qdxdy+rdy^2$ into two factors, each of which is a complete differential. [2] Determine the line joining two given points which, when rotated about a given axis, produces a surface of smallest area. [3] To explain the character of the curve, in which the radius of curvature is everywhere reciprocally proportional to the length of the curve. [4] To progress the current state of our knowledge about the periodically variable stars. [5] Demonstrate the equality between the infinite series $$1+(\frac{1}{2})^3x+(\frac{1\cdot3}{2\cdot4})^3x^2+(\frac{1\cdot3\cdot5}{2\cdot4\cdot6})^3x^3+etc$$ and the square of the infinite series $$1+(\frac{1}{4})^2x+(\frac{1\cdot5}{4\cdot8})^2x^2+(\frac{1\cdot5\cdot9}{4\cdot8\cdot12})^2x^3+etc$$ 1834, May 21.
[1] Determine the moment of inertia of the five Platonic solids with respect to any axis through the center.[2] To explain the various methods of solving Kepler's problem, especially by means of infinite series, as well as addressing the degree of convergence of these developments.
1842, May 23. [1] To understand the methods for finding any number of right angled spherical triangles whose sides and angles have rational sines and cosines. Note that I have omitted a few problems for which the translation was not good enough. Comments: Problem [2] from 1830 concerns ""minimal surfaces"" and was solved by Gauss's pupil Benjamin Goldschmidt. Since the solution of this problem (the catenary) was already well known during the 18th century (L. Euler discovered it), I guess Gauss's real intention was to make the methods related to minimal surfaces more rigorous. Problem [3] from 1830 concerns the so-called "" Euler spiral "". Problem [4] from 1830 concerns, according to other sources I read ,the construction of a reliable ""photometer"" (this is the subject of another question I posted long ago on hsm stackexchange). Problem [5] from 1830 was not set as a prize problem by the Goettingen university (it remained merely a suggestion). However, Gauss apparently solved it by himself in p.191-193 of volume 10 of his werke; he apparently shows that when $x=1$ than the first series and the square of the second series are both equal to $2\frac{\varpi^2}{\pi^2}$ . It seems that Gauss's identity is a case of Clausen's formula (Clausen deduces the same identity in his article ); this raises the question why Gauss suggested to set this as a prize problem if Thomas Clausen has already proved it in 1828. Problem [1] from 1834 was solved by the german mathematician Feodor Deahna in his prize awarded essay from 1835 ""Momenta inertiae singulorum quinque corporum regularium"". Apart from the fact that the Platonic solids are spherical tops, I find this problem to be also very interesting. What is most interesting to me is problem [1] from 1830 - it deals with a differential form (such as the first and second fundamental forms), therefore it seems that it is concerned with a certain problem of differential geometry. Since it was only 2 years after Gauss's groundbreaking memoir on differential geometry, I guess it is reasonable to believe it might be related to some differential-geometric problem that occupied Gauss's mind during this time. My questions Since the only problem whose meaning I did not recognize yet is problem [1] from 1830, my main question is about the meaning of it, and how it merges into the context of Gauss's differential geometric ideas. Regarding the other problems, since it is not possible to cover the whole context for all these problems in a single post, I mainly aim to make a ""brain storming"" on Gauss's list of problems, so any interesting/useful comments on the other problems will be blessed! Several clues regarding problem [1] : Based on several clues in Gauss's Nachlass, I have a very ""unfounded intuition"" that problem [1] is related to a problem in differential geometry which occupied him during this time. In p.446 of volume 8 of Gauss's werke, Gauss states the following: The conditional equation that $$pdx^2+2qdxdy+rdy^2$$ is a pure product of two total differentials is the following: $$0 = 2(q^2-pr)(\frac{\partial^2p}{\partial y^2}-2\frac{\partial^2q}{\partial x\partial y}+\frac{\partial^2r}{\partial x^2})+p(\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}\frac{\partial r}{\partial y}-2\frac{\partial q}{\partial x}\frac{\partial r}{\partial y}+(\frac{\partial r}{\partial x})^2)+q(\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\frac{\partial r}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}+4\frac{\partial q}{\partial x}\frac{\partial q}{\partial y}-2\frac{\partial q}{\partial x}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}-2\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}\frac{\partial q}{\partial y})+r(\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}-2\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\frac{\partial q}{\partial y}+(\frac{\partial p}{\partial y})^2)$$ In his comments on this note, Stackel remarks that in the same notebook in which Gauss wrote this statement, immediately after it appears a short note entitled ""general solution to the problem of development of a surface"", which appears in p.447-448 of the same volume. The mathematician Julius Weingarten comments on Gauss's approach in this ""general solution"", and says several things which I was unable to understand but concludes that Gauss's solution is incomplete. Rephrasing Gauss's problem in modern terms, I guess what he attempted to solve is: ""given the surface metric, find all possible isometric embeddings of it in $\mathbb{R^3}$ "" (I interpreted ""development"" as ""isometric embedding""). This problem in an extension of the Theorema Egregium, and since it is perhaps the only aspect that Gauss left uncomplete in his memoir of differential geometry, I suspect there might be a connection. Many mathematicians - among them Ferdinand Minding and Weingarten himself - have contributed to its solution. Since I don't have enough knowledge in differential geometry to understand what is going on there, I stress that this supposed connection between Gauss's prize problem from 1830 and the problem of ""finding all isometric embeddings"" is entirely a conjecture of mine based on ""crossing the loose ends"". I have no idea how the problem of factoring a differential form into two total differentials is related to isometric embedding of a given metric.","['math-history', 'analysis', 'differential-geometry']"

4670432,"Odds of Winning Viral ""Number Ordering"" Game","I have recently seen on social media a game that is quite amusing and addicting to watch. Here is a link to a guy playing it. Here is a description of the specific rendition I just shared. Given a RNG that gives $20$ random numbers between $1$ and $1000$ , sequentially order the numbers without knowing what is going to come next with the intention of having all $20$ numbers sorted at the end (i.e. if you draw $500$ rank it at ~ $10$ , then rank the next number, then the next, etc.) At the end of the game if all $20$ numbers are sorted properly in increasing order you win, if they are not you lose. Let's assume for the purpose of this analysis that the set of numbers we are drawing from is sufficiently large that we do not have to worry about repeating numbers. We can just assume we are drawing random real numbers between $0$ and $1$ if you will. And also since we have no idea of the numbers that are going to come the only strategy that we can employ to win the game is basic statistical ranking, assuming a uniformly distributed RNG. My question is: What are the odds of winning this game for $n$ randomly drawn numbers that are to be ordered? The case for when $n=2$ is straight forward. If the numbers drawn are $a$ and $b$ respectively, if $a$ is greater than $0.5$ it will be ranked at $2$ and so we will win if $b$ is smaller than $a$ , the opposite is true in the other case. In the first case we will win an average of $\frac{3}{4}$ of the time, and so too in the second case. So we can expect to win about $\frac{3}{4}$ of the time for $n=2$ . I have been working on some code to simulate the game and the ranking process to get some Monte Carlo results. But I would be interested in a closed form solution.","['statistics', 'combinations', 'random-variables']"

Prove that $$\lim_{n \to \infty} n \left(\frac{\pi}{4}-n\int_0^1\frac{x^n}{1+x^{2n}}dx \right)=\int_0^1f(x)dx$$ My approach was to make the change of variables $u=x^n, \text{ which is bijective on [0, 1]. Therefore } x=u^{\frac{1}{n}} \implies dx=\frac{1}{n}u^{\frac{1}{n}-1}; \frac{\pi}{4}=\int_0^1\frac{1}{1+x^2}dx$ . Now we rewrite the requested limit: $$n \left(\frac{\pi}{4}-n\int_0^1\frac{x^n}{1+x^{2n}}dx \right)=n \left(\int_0^1\frac{1}{1+u^2}du-\int_0^1\frac{u^{\frac{1}{n}}}{1+u^{2}}dx \right)=\int_0^1\frac{-\frac{u^{\frac{1}{n}}-1}{\frac{1}{n}}}{1+u^2}du$$ . My question is now can we interchange the limit with the integral? $\frac{u^h-1}{h}$ approaches $\ln(u)$ when $h$ approaches $0$ , so it would make sense that $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\int_0^1\frac{-\frac{u^{\frac{1}{n}}-1}{\frac{1}{n}}}{1+u^2}du=\int_0^1\frac{-\ln(u)}{1+u^2}du$$ . Now if we do integration by parts on $\int_0^1f(x)dx$ we obtain $$\int_0^1f(x)dx=\arctan(x)\ln(x)\mid_0^1-\int_0^1\frac{\ln(x)}{1+x^2}dx=\int_0^1\frac{-\ln(u)}{1+u^2}du$$ I have not yet learned in school about uniform convergence, but I read by myself that if a sequence of functions is uniformly convergent to some function, then we can interchange the limit. Is it true that $\frac{u^h-1}{h}$ converges uniformly to $\ln(u)$ ? It seems obvious, but I can't seem to prove it, since $u=0$ makes the function behave badly. But again $u=0$ is the only problem, it is only one point of discontinuity so it should not influence the value that much. I do not know if this is relevant, but I looked up and found that $\int_0^1f(x)dx$ is the catalan constant. Any help in solving this problem regarding the interchange of limits would be gladly appreciated.","['improper-integrals', 'real-analysis', 'uniform-convergence', 'limits', 'catalans-constant']"

Also using the SLLN, $$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} I_{\{X_m=i, X_{m+1}=j\}} \rightarrow \pi_i.P_{ij}$$ . Taking the ratio we can say that $\frac{N_n(i,j)}{N_n(i)} \rightarrow P_{ij}$ . Is this correct? Or am I missing something major?","['probability-distributions', 'markov-chains', 'stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

\mathcal{S} = \bigoplus_{\chi\in \mathrm{Irr}(W)} V_\chi\otimes S_\chi
$$ where $V_\chi$ is the space where $W$ acts by the irreducible representation $\chi$ , and $\mathcal{S}_{\chi} = \hom_W(V_\chi, \mathcal{S})$ is a perverse sheaf on $\mathcal{N}$ . Since $\mathrm{End}(\mathcal{S})\cong\mathbb{Q}_\ell[W]$ , we conclude that each $\mathcal{S}_\chi$ is nonzero and that $$

At this point in the proof, it is not yet known that the $\mathcal{S}_\chi$ are semisimple, so I do not know how to proceed in this direction. In fact, I think the corresponding statement for complex representations is false.
I.e., if $R$ is a finite dimensional $\mathbb{C}$ -representation of $W$ with $\mathrm{End}(R) = \mathbb{C}[W]$ , then the multiplicity of each $W$ -irrep in $R$ is precisely 1.
But $\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{C}[W]) \cong \mathbb{C}[W]$ and $\mathbb{C}[W]$ contains irreps with larger multiplicities.","['algebraic-geometry', 'representation-theory', 'lie-groups', 'sheaf-theory']"

4671193,Limit behavior of discounted sum of Bernoulli.,"I am interested in studying the limit behavior of a system described by a sequence of variables $(\alpha_t)_{t=0}^\infty$ which take values in $[0,1]$ whose law of motion is as follows: $$\begin{cases}\alpha_0\in [0,1]\\
\alpha_{t+1}=\kappa\alpha_t+(1-\kappa)w_t
\end{cases}$$ where $\kappa\in (0,1)$ is a persistence parameter and $w_t$ is the realization of a Bernoulli $W_t$ , whose probability of sucess depends on $\alpha_t$ : $$W_t\sim \textrm{Bern}(F(\alpha_t))$$ where $F:[0,1]\to [0,1]$ is a surjective and weakly decreasing function The specific shape of $F$ depends on the primitive of the model I am studying, but it is always ""step like"". In particular it is always the case that, $$\exists 0<a<b<1\quad st.\quad F(\alpha)=1\quad \forall \alpha\leq a\quad\land\quad F(\alpha)=0\quad \forall \alpha\geq b$$ then, either $F$ is strictly decreasing in $(a.b)$ or $F$ has a constant piece $(a^{\prime},b^{\prime})$ for some $a^{\prime}>a$ and $b^{\prime}<b$ where $F((a^{\prime},b^{\prime}))=\frac{1}{2}$ and it is strictly decreasing otherwise. Notice that $\alpha_t$ should rewrite $\alpha_t=\kappa^t\alpha_0+(1-\kappa)\sum_{i=0}^t\kappa^{t-i}w_{i-1}$ , whence the title of the question. My question is: What can I say about the limit behavior of $\alpha$ ? It seems clear to me that, doing a qualitatively study of the system, almost surely, $\alpha_t$ will eventually be in $(a-\delta_a,b+\delta_b)$ where $\delta$ 's are due to the discrete sizes of the jumps of $\alpha_t$ . But beyond this, my null experience with stochastic processes and dynamical systems lets me say nothing. Another variable of interest for me would be the average of the Bernoullis: $$\theta_{t}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^t W_i}{t}$$ Usually, one uses some law of large numbers to study its convergence. Here, the Bernoullis are all correlated and not identically distributed, so the standard results do not apply. Is there any result I could exploit?

4671643,"A counterexample of ""Mapping open sets to open sets to define continuity""","A  general question about continuity is that why it can not be defined as ""Mapping open sets to open sets"". The discussion can be seen in Why aren’t continuous functions defined the other way around? or Continuity vs. Mapping open sets to open sets? A typical counterexample is to show that: a continuous function can map an open set to non-open set . E.g., the continuous mapping $f(x)=x^2$ on $\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$ , which send the open set $(-1,1)$ to the non-open set $[0,1)$ . In Charles Nash's book, Topology and Geometry for Physicists (page 11), there is another type of counterexamples - a discontinuous function can always map an open set to open set. However, the example itself confuse me. The example is the discontinuous function: $$f\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
x, & x\leq0\\
1+x, & x>0
\end{cases}$$ In the book, it is said "" $f$ always maps open sets into open sets "" and gives no enough details. But if we choose $x\in\left(-\epsilon,\epsilon\right)$ , then $f\left(x\right)\in\left(-\epsilon,0\right]\cup\left(1,1+\epsilon\right)$ , which is not an open set by the usual topology. To make sense, should we use other topology here?","['continuity', 'general-topology', 'real-analysis']"

4671650,Must solutions to the time-independent Schrodinger equation that have discrete spectra or negative eigenvalues be square-integrable?,"Consider the following version of the time-independent Schrodinger equation: $$
\left( -\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x) \right) \psi(x) = \lambda\ \psi(x)
$$ (where we have absorbed some unimportant physical constants into the function $\psi(x)$ ). The function $V(x)$ is a given real smooth function $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ , which we assume to be continuous and to approach 0 at large arguments: $$
\lim_{|x| \to \infty} V(x) = 0.
$$ The smooth complex-valued function $\psi:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ and the real constant $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ are to be determined. This equation is simply the eigenvalue equation for the linear second-order differential operator in parentheses. (We can loosen the smoothness requirements on $V(x)$ and $\psi(x)$ , if doing so makes the problem more tractable.) Non-rigorous physical heuristics suggest that these three statements are equivalent: $\psi(x)$ is square-integrable, i.e. $$\int \limits_{-\infty}^\infty dx\ |\psi(x)|^2 < \infty,$$ $\lambda < 0$ , and $\lambda$ lies in a discrete part of the eigenvalue spectrum of the differential operator in parentheses, i.e. there exists a proper real interval such that $\lambda$ is the only eigenvalue in the differential operator's spectrum that lies within that interval. A related piece of ""folk wisdom"" considers the same eigenvalue equation in the case where $$
\lim_{|x| \to \infty} V(x) = +\infty,
$$ and claims that in this case, (a) all eigenfunctions $\psi(x)$ must be square-integrable, and (b) the eigenvalue spectrum of the differential operator must be discrete. But this ""folk wisdom"" is incorrect. This answer gives an explicit example of a function $V(x)$ and a square-integrable eigenfunction $\psi(x)$ with positive eigenvalue $\lambda$ . Therefore, statement #1 above does not imply statement #2. (I do not know whether the spectrum for the particular differential operator given in that example is discrete or continuous around the relevant eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$ , so I don't know the status of claim #3 for this example.) What are the exact implications between the three statements above?
Of the six possible implications, which have been proven to be true, which (other than $1 \implies 2$ ) have explicit known counterexamples, and which are still open problems? I'd also like to know about the case of multiple spatial dimensions, although I assume that the answers are probably the same as for the 1D case.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'sturm-liouville', 'lp-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'eigenfunctions']"
4671651,What can we say about $[\mathbb{Q}(j(ni)):\mathbb{Q}]$,"Here $j$ stands for the j-invariant of elliptic curve. The case of when the lattice is an integrally closed ring was treated in in ""Advanced Topics in the Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves"" Chapter II. I'm interested in non-integrally closed case. For example, when $\Lambda=\{\mathbb{Z}+\mathbb{Z}*ni\}$ . It hase endomophism ring $\mathbb{Z}[ni]$ . So conjugates of $j(ni)$ are (maybe subsets of) j-invariants of elliptic curves with complex multiplication $\mathbb{Z}[ni]$ . And seemingly we need to classify ideals of $\mathbb{Z}[ni]$ mod principal ideal. Here is where I'm stuck. Are there reference treating non-integrally closed case? Thanks. Some update: A seemingly effective approach is to consider modular equations, which is a polynomial $F$ s.t. $F(j(\tau),j(n\tau))=0$ , insert in $j(i)=12^3$ it's possible to obtain a polynomial $f:=F(j(i),-)$ , so $j(ni)$ is a root of $f$ . Note that $f\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ , has degree $n+1$ . So now we only need to know how $f$ factorizes. And if my calculation is correct, $f$ should has roots $j(ni),j(i/n),j((i+1)/n),\dots,j((i+n-1)/n)$ . Note that $j(ni)=j(i/n)$ by modular relations, so $j(ni)$ is a multiple root. And a special case is, if $n$ is prime, the only other multiple roots are $j((i+1)/n)=j((i-1)/n)$ , so maybe by some Galois action argument, we have $[\mathbb{Q}(j(ni)):\mathbb{Q}]=2$ , is this correct?","['number-theory', 'elliptic-curves']"
4671662,Existence of a principal bundle charts compatible with $f$-equivariant reductions,"Let $\pi:P\rightarrow M$ and $\pi':P'\rightarrow M$ be principal $G$ and $H$ bundles respectively, and $f:G\rightarrow H$ be Lie group homomorphism.

Suppose that $F$ is surjective, and $f$ is a surjective Lie group homomorphism. Furthermore, assume that $G$ and $H$ are connected for simplicity.

If not, are there cases where this can happen? i.e. perhaps if $F$ and $f$ are double coverings? And if no such case exists, how can I see that this breaks down? Note that if $f$ is a surjective Lie group homomorphism, then $G/\ker f\cong H$ , because the kernel is a closed Lie subgroup of $G$ , and the action of $\ker f$ on $G$ is free and proper. For context, I asked this question earlier today, and I believe if I can show that such a chart exists then I could easily prove what I seek out to prove. I am starting to suspect that no such chart exists however, I just can't see why. It seems that maybe such a chart would depend on global sections of $f$ , which is a submersion.","['equivariant-maps', 'principal-bundles', 'differential-topology', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"
4671703,"Number of strings, when each character must occur even times","I was reading this question on programmers.StackExchange and wanted to try a combinatorics approach to solve the following problem: Let $S=\{A,B,C,D\}$ be a set of characters and $n$ a positive natural,
  find the number of strings of length $n$ composed of characters in $S$
  such that each character occur even times. I tried to solve it by myself but I am stuck and I would appreciate a hint to solve this kind of problems. Also, there are similar questions on this site for not quite exactly the same problem, but I didn't find an answer that could help me. Current attempt First, when $n$ is odd, the result must be zero. A string satisfying the desired property would necessarly have an even length, as a permutation of the concatenation of substrings of even lengths (each substring being a character from $S$ repeatead even times). Now, let's suppose that $n$ is even. If we have a mapping $c$ from $S$ to $\mathbb{N}$ assigning the number of occurence of each character (e.g. $c_A=0, c_B=2, c_C=4, c_D=0$), then the number of strings $N(c)$ we can produce with this mapping would be a k-permutation of characters, as we choose a string of size $n$ with $c_A$ times $A$, $c_B$ times $B$, etc. : $$N(c) = \frac{n!}{c_A! c_B! c_C! c_D!}$$ Also, I can evaluate the number of such mappings $c$: this is equivalent to finding the number of strings where characters appear in order with varying occurences. For example, with $n=4$: $$\begin{array}{c|cccc}
&            c_A & c_B & c_C &c_D \\
\hline
     AAAA &  4 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
     AABB &  2 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
     AACC &  2 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
\dots\\
\end{array}
$$ The number of strings of size $n$ with an even number of each character is exactly the same as the number of strings of size $k=n/2$ with single characters (just imagine that AA, BB, CC, DD are characters).
So, the number of mappings is the number of combinations of characters from $S$, with repetition, like the following ones with $k=2$: AA AB AC AD
BB BC BD
CC CD
DD That is given as a $k$-combination of 4 elements: $$ N_{mapping}(k) = \binom{|S|+k-1}{k} = \binom {3+k}{k}$$ This is where I'am stuck. I wanted to combine this number of mappings with the number of permutations computed by each mapping, previously, but I can't ($N(c)$ depends on actual values of the mapping $c$).
Also, I am sure there is a more straightforward approach, but I don't know how to proceed. Thanks for any help you could provide.",['combinatorics']
4671729,Show a operator is not a tensor field on $\mathbb{R}^3$,"I'm a beginner in tensors, and all my concepts of tensors are from the book: ""Munkres-Analysis on Manifolds"" Consider the $2$ tensor field $\omega$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$ . Then, from my book, it means that for each vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^3$ , $\omega(x)$ represents a $2$ tensor on the tangent space of $x$ denoted as $\mathscr{T}_{x}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ . That is, if use the notation $(x;v)$ to represent the vectors in the tangent space $\mathscr{T}_{x}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ , we have $$\begin{align}
\omega(x):((x;v_{1}),(x;v_{2})) \to r
\end{align}$$ where $r$ is a number on $\mathbb{R}$ Now I let the vectors $v_{1},v_{2}$ depend on $x$ , so $(x;v_{1}), \ (x;v_{2})$ become 2 vector fields $$\begin{align}
F_{1}(x)=(x; v_{1}(x)) \\  \\ F_{2}(x)=(x;v_{2}(x))
\end{align}$$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$ where each of then is in the tangent space of $x$ , and $$\begin{align}
v_{1}:& \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3 \\ :& x=(x^1,x^2,x^3) \to (v_{1}^1(x),v_{1}^2(x),v_{1}^3(x))=v_{1}(x)
\end{align}$$ So does $v_{2}$ . Then I define a operator $T$ $$\begin{align}
T: ((x;v_{1}),(x;v_{2}),(x;v_{3})) \to \frac{\partial }{\partial x} (\omega (x)((x;v_{2}),(x;v_{3}))) \cdot v_{1} 
\end{align}$$ where $(x;v_{i})_{i=1,2,3}$ are vectors fields. Now I'm wondering how to prove the operator $T$ is ""not"" a tensor field on $\mathbb{R}^3$ ? Here I first notice that $T$ indeed sents $3$ vectors into a number, since $\omega (x)((x;v_{2}),(x;v_{3}))$ is a number and it only depends on $x$ , so the derivative with respect to $x$ is a $1 \times 3$ matrix. Finally, it dot products with $3 \times 1$ column $v_{1}$ , the result should be a number. Then I tried to write out a partial derivative. I think the result of $\omega (x)((x;v_{2}),(x;v_{3}))$ depends on $x$ , $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ where the last 2 also depend on $x$ . Thus I think I might be able to write $\omega$ as $$\begin{align}
\omega(x,v_{2}(x) ,v_{3}(x)) = r
\end{align}$$ Thus the partial derivative is $$\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x}+ \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial v_{2}} \cdot \frac{\partial v_{2}}{\partial x}+ \frac{\partial \omega }{\partial v_{3}} \cdot \frac{\partial v_{2}}{\partial x} && (*)
\end{align}$$ where $\dfrac{\partial \omega}{\partial v_{2}} \cdot \dfrac{\partial v_{2}}{\partial x}$ can be regarded as a $1 \times 3$ matrix $$\begin{align}
\left( \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial v_{2}^1}  \ \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial v_{2}^2} \ \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial v_{2}^3} \right) 
\end{align}$$ and $\dfrac{\partial v_{2}}{\partial x}$ is a $3 \times 3$ matrix, and hence $(*)$ is indeed a $1 \times 3$ matrix. So far, I have 2 questions 1 Are my thoughts above right? 2 If they are right, how can I tell that $T$ is ""not"" a tensor field?

It went like this: Present an example of a convergent series of complex numbers $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}z_n$ such that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}z_n^3$ diverges. My solution was to make use of the cube root of unity, by defining $\large z_n=\frac{e^{2\pi i n/3}}{\sqrt[3]{n}}$ . In this fashion, one can easily see that $\large z_n^3=\frac{e^{2\pi i n}}{n}=\frac{1}{n}$ , and so $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}z_n^3$ diverges by the harmonic series. However, I was not able to prove that the series of $z_n$ was convergent. I am somewhat positive that the series is indeed convergent, as WolframAlpha computes that it converges to $\text{Li}_{1/3}(e^{2\pi i/3})$ . It's quite obvious that the convergence won't be absolute, as $|z_n|=\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{n}}$ gives a divergent series. I attempted to separate $z_n=a_n+b_n i$ for $a_n=\cos(2\pi n/3)/\sqrt[3]{n}$ and $b_n=\sin(2\pi n/3)/\sqrt[3]{n}$ , but I couldn't get this to be very fruitful. Any ideas?

Given the word ""POLYNOMIAL"", how many ways can you rearrange the letters such that 'P' is next to 'O' and 'N' and 'M' cannot be together.

Step 2: Calculate the permutations of this pseudo 7-letter word while accounting for the fact that 'X' has two permutations for every appearance ('CA' or 'AC'). Number of permutations of ""XLENDAR"" = $7! \times 2 = 10,080$ . My confusion here is about the repetition of the letter 'A' in the original word ""CALENDAR"" and how to deal with it.
Consider a sample of the permutations as follows: A, CA, L, E, N, D, R
AC, A, L, E, N, D, R This would be double-counting the same permutation if using the formula above, right? How do we deal with this pattern that can appear if the letters 'A' and 'CA' are arranged beside each other as a palindrome? This pattern can shift from the beginning of the word till the end a total of 6 times, so do we subtract 6 from 10,080? For part b) I grouped 'D' and 'R' together as 'Y' to get XLEYAR. Following the same method as above, I calculated the permutations where 'D' and 'R' do appear together (remembering that both 'X' and 'Y' have 2 permutations each every occurrence). $6! \times 2 \times 2 = 2880$ . Subtracting these occurrences from the original total should tell me all the permutations that satisfy the condition for 1b). Once again, though, my confusion lies with the repeated 'A' in this calculation. I've seen some solutions presented as # of permutations $= 10,080 - 2880 = 7200$ , but they don't address the repetition in their calculations. I'd really appreciate some help as I'm not sure where to go from here. Thank you!","['permutations', 'combinatorics']"
