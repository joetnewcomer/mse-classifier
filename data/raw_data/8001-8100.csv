60667,"What are Belgium's chances on getting a medal at the 400m finals, given that they have 2 of the 8 athletes?","This is a question my wife and I pondered over at the breakfast table this morning: Belgium has two athletes in the finals of the 400m at the World Championship athletics this year. What are Belgium's chances of getting a medal, assuming every runner has the same capabilities? Plus, what's the formula/explanation for calculating this? I know/think that, if we'd have 1 athlete, it would be 3/8, because there are 3 possible medals, and 8 athletes competing. (I hope this step is correct?) But what if you have 2 athletes? Is it then just 6/8? Intuitively, that feels incorrect. But I would love to get a decent explanation on how to calculate this.",['probability']
60672,Group extensions of cyclic groups,"Let $A$ be an infinite cyclic group and $B$ be a cyclic group of order $n$. Suppose 
$$0 \to A \to G \to B \to 0$$
is a short exact sequence of abelian groups. What could $G$ be? It is clear enough that $G = \mathbb{Z} \oplus C_m$ works, for all $m$ such that $m$ divides $n$ and $\textrm{gcd}(m, n/m) = 1$, by the Chinese remainder theorem. $A$ and $B$ are finitely generated, so $G$ is as well; thus the structure theorem for finitely-generated abelian groups tells us that this is exhaustive. However, is there a more direct approach (in the sense of not using a sledgehammer) to this easy-looking exercise? (It is exercise 6.2 in Massey's A basic course in algebraic topology .) For example, by tensoring with $\mathbb{Q}$, we obtain a right-exact sequence
$$\mathbb{Q} \to G \otimes \mathbb{Q} \to 0 \to 0$$
which tells us that the free part of $G$ has rank at most $1$, and considering $\textrm{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})$, we get a right-exact sequence
$$0 \to \textrm{Hom}(G, \mathbb{Z}) \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0$$
which indicates the free part of $G$ has rank exactly $1$. What can we say about the torsion part?","['group-extensions', 'abelian-groups', 'cyclic-groups', 'group-cohomology', 'group-theory']"

60702,Solving a separable 2nd order differential equation (can a similar technique be used)?,"I've been investigating a lot of interesting physically inspired second order differential equations that don't have t in the equation at all and thus are separable (one example being $y''=-\frac{k}{y^2}$). I know that if $y' = f(y)$ I can solve this by $\int {\frac {dy}{f(y)}} = \int dt$ For the second order equation $y'' = f(y)$ I have been removing a variable since t is not involved by the following steps, but it can get messy. $$y' = v$$
$$v' = f(y)$$

60715,Is there any significance to the logarithm of a sum?,"Many years ago, while working as a computer programmer, I tracked down a subtle bug in the software that we were using. Management had dispaired of finding the bug, but I pursued it in odd moments over a period of a few days, and finally found that the problem was that, in computing the geometric mean, the program was taking the log of the sum instead of the sum of the logs. When thinking back on that, I always wonder whether there is any situation in which taking the log of a sum would be of interest. The only case I can think of is that it is often convenient to shift the logarithm to the left by 1 unit, which is done by adding 1 to the argument, that is, one often wishes to deal with log(1 + x) instead of log(x), so that one has the convenient situation of f(0) = 0. Let’s call this the trivial scenario. So, can anyone think of any non-trivial scenario in which taking the log of a sum is the thing to do?","['logarithms', 'real-analysis']"
60718,"Given a width, height and angle of a rectangle, and an allowed final size, determine how large or small it must be to fit into the area","In other words, if I had a rectangle of $10\times 10$ and an angle of $45$, and the allowed area was $100\times 100$, the rectangle would be about $70\times 70$. The allowed area is $100\times 100$ in red and the final rectangle is the blue $70\times 70$ rotated rect. I want to know how to get that ""$70\times 70$"" for any rect, angle, and area. I believe the rectangle's original width and height are not important, only their ratio is. Getting the above is easy if its a square, but I don't know how to do it if it is a non-square rectangle. So what if I had a rectangle of $2\times 3$ or $200\times 300$ and an angle of $90$ degrees, that must fit into a space of $100\times 20$? Or some other arbitrary space? Is there a general formula for determining the correct size of the original rectangle from the final area it takes up?","['geometry', 'trigonometry']"

$$\frak{c} \cdot \frak{c} \leq \aleph_0 \cdot \frak{c}$$ The first inequality I've proven already, the second one I just cannot get it(obvious is it may be). The only thing I'm allowed to use is the definition of cardinality, the cantor-bernstein-schroder theorem and the fact that:

60742,Finding the n-th lexicographic permutation of a string,"I have an ordered set of symbols S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }. I want to find the 1,000,000-th permutation in lexicographic order of S. It is a programming puzzle, but I wanted to figure out a way without brute-forcing the task. So my thinking was like this: For 10 variable symbol positions, we have 10! permutations, obviously. Now we want to find the first symbol. If we fix the first symbol, then the remaining 9 symbols can have 9! combinations. That means that 0 or 1 cannot be the first symbol, because the highest possible position is 2*9! = 725,760, which is lower than 1,000,000. The lowest position for a leading 3 is 3*9! + 1 = 1,088,641, so it can't be 3 or higher, either. Therefore, the first number must be 2. 2*9! is the largest multiple of 9! no greater than 1,000,000, so I need the 2nd symbol (zero-based) from the current set. So now the question becomes, of the remaining S := S \{2}, which permutation of these symbols is at lexicographic position (1,000,000 - 2*9!) = 274,240? 6*8! = 241,920 is the largest multiple of 8! which is smaller than 274,240, so I need the 6th-smallest symbol of the remaining set, which is 7. So the prefix should be 27 by now. That way, I keep going and finally arrive at:
1,000,000 = 2*9! + 6*8! + 6*7! + 2*6! + 5*5! + 1*4! + 2*3! + 2*2! + 0*1! + 0*0! which results in ""2783905614"" as my solution. However, according to the solution tester , (free reg. req.) that is incorrect. Where did I go wrong in thinking or applying?","['puzzle', 'combinatorics']"

60781,Symmetric groups on sets with the same number of elements are isomorphic,"Continuing my work through Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote, I'm stuck on what is probably a very easy proposition: Let $\Delta$ and $\Omega$ be nonempty sets. The symmetric groups $S_\Delta$ and $S_\Omega$ are isomorphic if $|\Delta| = |\Omega|$ The proof is outlined in the text, then exercise 1.6.10 asks the reader to ""fill in the details"" by: Let $\theta : \Delta \rightarrow \Omega$ be a bijection. Define $\varphi : S_\Delta \rightarrow S_\Omega$ by $\varphi(\sigma) = \theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta ^{-1}$ for all $\sigma \in S_\Delta$ (a) $\varphi$ is well-defined, that is, if $\sigma$ is a permutation of $\Delta$ then $\theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta ^{-1}$ is a permutation of $\Omega$. I thought I knew what ""well-defined"" meant ($x = y \rightarrow f(x) = f(y)$ ), but this doesn't seem anything like that. My best guess at how to prove this is: $\theta ^{-1}$ is a bijection from $\Omega$ to $\Delta$, then $\sigma$ is a bijection from $\Delta$ to itself, then $\theta$ is a bijection from $\Delta$ to $\Omega$. Is that correct? Thanks. I think I can get the rest*, but I'll add to this question if need be. * (b) $\varphi$ is a bijection from $S_\Delta$ onto $S_\Omega$. [Find a two-sided inverse for $\varphi$], and (c) $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, that is $\varphi(\sigma \circ \tau) = \varphi(\sigma) \circ \varphi(\tau)$ Added for (b), I used $\varphi ^{-1}(y) = \theta ^{-1} \circ y \circ \theta$ for $y \in S_\Omega$. I showed that this is indeed an inverse since: $\varphi^{-1}(\varphi(\sigma)) = \theta^{-1} \circ (\theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta^{-1}) \circ \theta = \sigma$, and likewise for the reverse composition. And (c) was simply a matter of writing an equality using the definitions of the expressions on each side.","['symmetric-groups', 'abstract-algebra']"

Is there any efficient way to compute this without having to check a ton of cases? For just a prime we can use quadratic reciprocity, but that doesn't do any good here. A problem like this was asked on an oral exam in my program (the number was $4000$, so one had to apply the Chinese remainder theorem first and then solve two questions like this), so I guess the professor thought that this is something that one should be able to work out on the black board pretty quickly. The only approach I know is to first find all squares modulo say $9$, which would give $0,1,4,7$, then look at the numbers: $0,0+9,0+18,1,1+9,1+18,4,4+9,4+18,...$ and figure out which of these liftings are squares mod $27$.

For any $S,T\subseteq X$, $\varnothing=f(\varnothing)$ $S\subseteq f(S)$ $f(f(S))=f(S)$ $f(S\cup T)=f(S)\cup f(T)$ I want to show that the sets $\mathcal{T}=\{A\mid f(A^c)=A^c\}$ form a topology from the open set point of view. I see that $\varnothing, X\in\mathcal{T}$, as well as finite intersections of sets in $\mathcal{T}$. How can I show that $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under arbitrary unions? Taking $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, then $f((\cup\mathcal{A})^c)=f(\cap
_{A\in\mathcal{A}} A^c)$, and I want this to equal $\cap_{A\in\mathcal{A}} A^c$. I suspect this uses the property that $f$ is idempotent, since I didn't use that to show the other three properties.

60875,Singularity of $1/(1-z)$ at $z=1$,"My book claims that $1/(1-z)$ has an essential singularity at $z=1$ by writing out the Laurent series and showing that there are infinitly many terms. Why isn't this just a pole of order 1? We can write this as $-1/(z-1)$, then the numerator is a nonvanishing analytic function, and the denominator is of the form $(z-1)$, so it seems like by definition this should be a pole, and not an essential singularity. What am I missing here? If anyone is curious: the book is the Princeton Review for the GRE Math Subject Test, 4th edition, p. 312-313 Their argument is this. Consider the region $1 < |z| < \infty$ and write $f(z) = \frac{1}{1-z} = \frac{1}{z(\frac{1}{z}-1)} = -\frac{1}{z} \cdot \frac{1}{z-\frac{1}{z}}$. Then if $|z| > 1$, then $|1/z| < 1$, so we can expand $\frac{1}{1-z} = -\frac{1}{z} \cdot \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{z}}= -\frac{1}{z} (1 + (\frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{z}^2 + \cdots) = \frac{1}{z} - (\frac{1}{z})^2 - (\frac{1}{z})^3 - \cdots$ for $|z| > 1$. Since this has infinitely many terms in the Laurent series, $z=1$ is an essential singularity.",['complex-analysis']
60880,Simpson's Rule and other Newton-Cotes Formulas,"I am curious about the value of Simpson's rule (also called the parabolic rule or the 3-point rule) for approximating integrals.  The calculus text I am now teaching from uses this rule any time an approximation is needed for an integral.  For example, it may give a messy arclength integral and ask for the Simpson's rule approximation using 4 intervals (and thus 5 sample points): $$ \int_a^{a+4h} f(x) dx \simeq \frac{h}{3}\left(f(a)+ 4f(a+h) + 2f(a+2h) + 4f(a+3h)+ f(a+4h)\right).$$ I understand the idea of Simpson's Rule.  If you just sampled three evenly spaced points on a quadratic function, you could compute the integral on that interval with the weighting pattern $(1,4,1)$; this happens to give the right answer for degree 3 polynomials as well.  The $(1,4,2,4,2, \ldots, 4,2,4,1)$ pattern comes from repeating this pattern over every pair of intervals. But I'm not convinced we should always apply this rule any time we cut into $2n$ intervals.  Why not just use throw out the uneven weighting and use a few more sample points?  If the weighting is so helpful, why not use a more complicated weighting (like the various $n$-point rules (Newton-Cotes formulas) described here )? The Newton-Cotes formulas and their error terms form a beautiful theory, but are probably too much for undergrad calculus!  I understand showing Simpson's rule and going no further. So I have two main questions-- is Simpson's rule so useful that calculus students should always use it for approximations?  And are the other Newton-Cotes formulas (or Gaussian quadrature) always the best way to do numerical integration, or only when the values $f(x_i)$ are sufficiently expensive to compute?","['education', 'calculus', 'numerical-methods']"
60881,Question about computing a Fourier transform of an integral transform related to fractional Brownian motion,"I am trying to show an integral transform has a fixed point.

That is $T_H \phi (x) = \phi (x)$.

The motivation for the problem is is that we know for the $H=\frac{1}{2}$ and $c=2$ then $\phi(x) = e^{-2|x|}$ is a fixed point for $T_{\frac{1}{2}}$.  That is the Fourier transform of 
$T_{\frac{1}{2}}e^{-2|x|} = 2 \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{e^{\frac{-x^2}{2y}}}{\sqrt{2 \pi y}} e^{-2y} dy$ is equal to $\frac{4}{k^2+4}$ which is the same as the Fourier transform of $e^{-2|x|}$.

60886,How can I show these two metrics give the same topology?,"This question came up while showing the composition of a metric with a certain other 
function gives another metric. Suppose I have some metric space $(X,d)$ and a 
continuous, non-decreasing function $f$ on the nonnegative reals. Moreover, suppose 
that $f(x)=0$ iff $x=0$, and $f$ also satisfies the triangle inequality in that $f
(x+y)\leq f(x)+f(y)$. Using these properties, it is not difficult to show that $f\circ d$ is yet another 
metric on $X$, so $(X,f\circ d)$ is also a metric space. I notice the (open) balls given by the metrics are of form 
$$
B_d(x,r)=\{y\in X\mid d(x,y)\lt r\}
$$ and 
$$
B_{f\circ d}(x,r)=\{y\in X\mid (f\circ d)(x,y)\lt r\},

60917,Is $1-\sin(x)$ a contraction mapping?

I'm not posting the assignment problem here as I want to think about it myself, but one approach I am currently working on is to try to show that
$$f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R},\quad f(x) = 1-\sin(x)$$
is a contraction mapping. At the moment I have a feeling it isn't. For example take $x_1 < 0 < x_2$, then
$$ \left|\frac{(1-\sin x_1)-(1-\sin x_2)}{x_1-x_2}\right| = \left|\frac{\sin(x_1) - \sin(x_2)}{x_1-x_2}\right| \to 1$$
as $x_1 \to 0^-, x_2 \to 0^+$. Hence there does not exist a non-negative $k<1 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $|\sin(x_1)-\sin(x_2)| \leq k|x_1-x_2|$ for all $x_1,x_2 \in \mathbb{R}$. (Just take $x_1,x_2$ arbitrarily close to $0$.) So $f$ is not a contraction mapping. That was the idea. Thinking just a little bit further, we see that this occurs because $|f'(x)| = 1$ at $x=0$. So perhaps we have a necessary and sufficient condition for a function on the reals to be a contraction mapping, namely that $\forall x\in\mathbb{R},|f'(x)|\leq k<1$ for some non-negative real $k$. Is this the case? Or have I missed some subtle (or not-so-subtle) point?","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

60922,Fractional iteration of the Newton-approximation-formula: how to resolve one unknown parameter?,"For my own exercising I tried to find a closed form expression for the Newton-approximation algorithm, beginning with the simple example for getting the squareroot of some given $ \small z^2 $ by recursion according to
$$ \small x_0 = 1 \qquad x_{k+1} = \left( {z^2 \over x_k}+x_k \right)/2 $$ where only $ \small z^2 $ is known and z is sought by $ \small z = \lim_{k \to \infty} x_k$. After expanding some iterations in symbolic variables I got the pattern for a closed form
$$ \small x_k = z{ (z+x_0)^{2^k} + (z-x_0)^{2^k} \over (z+x_0)^{2^k} - (z-x_0)^{2^k} }
 $$
which might further be compacted to
$$ \small x_k = z \cdot \left(1 - { 2\over 1- \left({ z+x_0 \over z-x_0 }\right)^{2^k} } \right)
$$
If z is known then this is a nice form for fractionally iterating the original recursion; given some $ \small x_0$ and $ \small \sqrt{z^2}$ I can plot the function and see the quality of approximation by a smooth curve (its logarithm shows a parabola), ... but the requirement is obviously from the statement of the problem ("" find the squareroot of z "") that z should occur in even powers only. Well, if I expand the first version of the two closed forms then only the binomial coefficients at even order in the numerator and at odd order in the denominator remain (where the z at the beginning of the formula cancels against one occurence in the denominator) and thus I've to deal with the given $ \small z^2$ only. However, then I have variable number of terms for varying k and for fractional k their number is even infinite, so this is not the final solution where I'm after. I might overlook something trivial, but how could I reformulate this such that I get even powers of z only and still have an expression, where k can be taken fractional? Just a short addendum Sep 18. The Kalantari-paper has the formula a bit different; significant is a sign-change(I'll have to check my other derivation again) such that I should assume the more correct form:
$$ \small x_k = z{ (x_0+z)^{2^k} + (x_0-z)^{2^k} \over (x_0+z)^{2^k} - (x_0-z)^{2^k} }
 $$
This can be reformulated into the surprising form, where k is the index of iterations if the Newton-formula is employed:
$$ \small {x_k-z \over x_k+z}= \left( {x_0-z \over x_0+z}\right)^{2^k}$$ This form has the interesting property, that -once $ \small \left| x_0-z \right| <1 $ - then it is immediately visible, that each iteration approximates zero with quadratic error reduction, simply because of the repeated squaring of the small numerator. [update] While for integer-indexed iterations the sign-question is irrelevant (and the significant terms in the binomial expansions cancel, so the effect is invisible) this is not so for the 0'th iteration: then the numerators and denominators of the lhs and rhs should be equal, so the Kalantari-sign-scheme was the meaningful one.","['recursive-algorithms', 'elementary-number-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

Show that $Y$ is measurable with respect to $\sigma(X) = \{ X^{-1}(B) : B \in \mathcal{R} \}$ if and only if there exists a function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $Y(\omega) =
f(X(\omega))$ for all $\omega \in \Omega$. Firstly, I am assuming that for $Y$ to be measurable with respect to $\sigma(X)$ means that $\forall B \in \mathcal{R} \quad Y^{-1}(B) \in \sigma(X)$.  The text (Probability: Theory and Examples) failed to define the phrase. The problem following it begins describing a constructive proof where we split $Y$'s range into segments of increasingly fine granularity ( i.e. $\left [\frac{m}{2^{n}}, \frac{m+1}{2^{n}}\right)$ for each $m \in \mathbb{N}$ ) and define a function between $X$'s range and $Y$'s for each level of granularity ( i.e. by noting that $Y^{-1}\left(\left[\frac{m}{2^{n}}, \frac{m+1}{2^{n}}\right)\right)$ = $X^{-1}(B_{n,m})$ for some $B_{n,m} \in \mathcal{R}$ and defining $f_{n}(x) = \frac{m}{2^{n}}$ when $x \in B_{n,m}$ ), then need to show that $Y$ is equal to this function in the limit. Unfortunately I can't even make sense of how each of these functions are defined, much less use them.  In particular, I don't see how each $x \in \mathbb{R}$ maps to a single $B_{n,m}$, which would mean we would need to define $f_{n}$ via the infimum of all available values.  Take the example that $X(\omega) = 0$ for all $\omega$. As this constructive proof is a separate problem, there must then exist a non-constructive one as well which is perhaps more concise.  I have been unable to make any headway in that respect.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"
60945,Understanding the Musical Isomorphisms in Vector Spaces,"I am trying to solidify my understanding of the muscial isomorphisms in the context of vector spaces. I believe I understand the definitions but would appreciate corrections if my understanding is not correct. Also, as I have had some difficulty tracking down related material, I would welcome any suggested references that would expand upon this material and related results. So, let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ with inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ and let $V^*$ denote its dual. For each element $v \in V$, one can define a mapping $V \rightarrow V^*$ by $v \mapsto \langle \cdot, v \rangle$. By the Riesz representation theorem this mapping actually determines an isomorphism that allows us to identify each element in $V$ with a unique functional in $V^*$ The ""flat"" operator $\flat$ is defined by by $v^{\flat}(u) = \langle u , v \rangle$ for all $u \in V$ and is thus just the Riesz isomorphism in the direction $V \rightarrow V^*$ as defined above. On the other hand, given a linear functional $f_v \in V^*$, we know that there exists a unique $v \in V$ such that $f_v(u) = \langle u , v \rangle$ for all $u \in V$ and the ""sharp"" operator $\sharp$ is defined by  by $f_v^{\sharp} = v$ and this represents the other direction of the Riesz isomorphism. Is this understanding correct? Can anyone provide a reference to some examples/exercises that would explore these operators in a concrete way? The Wikipedia page on the topic isn't of much help.

"" I argue in my answer that the number of ways $S(n)$ to obtain twice as many heads as tails for the first time in $3n$ coin flips is $\binom{3n}{n} \frac{2}{3n-1}$.  The argument works by showing that $S(n)$ satisfies a recurrence and then using a binomial convolution identity to show that $\binom{3n}{n} \frac{2}{3n-1}$ satisfies the recurrence as well. However, it seems to me that there ought to be a nice, direct combinatorial proof that $S(n) = \binom{3n}{n} \frac{2}{3n-1}$.  After all, there are $\binom{3n}{n}$ sequences of $3n$ coin flips in which $n$ are tails, and the number of those for which we see twice as many heads as tails for the first time is just $\frac{2}{3n-1}$ of that.   I've been thinking about this some the past few days but have been unable to find a combinatorial explanation of the fraction $\frac{2}{3n-1}$. So my question is... Can someone provide a combinatorial proof that $S(n) = \binom{3n}{n} \frac{2}{3n-1}$? And, more generally, if $S(n,r)$ is the number of ways to obtain $r$ times as many heads as tails then my argument in the answer mentioned above shows that $S(n,r) = \binom{(r+1)n}{n} \frac{r}{(r+1)n-1}$.  It would be nice if the proof were generalizable to the $S(n,r)$ case. One thought is that it might be possible to adapt one of the combinatorial proofs that the $n$th Catalan number $C_n$ is $\binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{n+1}$.  In fact, in the $r=1$ case the question is equivalent to finding the number of Dyck paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ that do not touch the diagonal $y=x$ except at $(0,0)$ and $(n,n)$.   This is known to be $2C_{n-1} = \binom{2n-2}{n-1} \frac{1}{n} = \binom{2n}{n}\frac{1}{2n-1} = S(n,2).$ In fact, that last paragraph makes me wonder if there might be some generalization of the Catalan numbers in this direction.  Or perhaps the alternative formulation $S(n,r) = \binom{(r+1)n-2}{n-1} \frac{r+1}{n}$ admits a combinatorial proof more easily. Added : I think Qiaochu Yuan's argument below about using Raney's lemma is on the right track, but it doesn't quite get to the expression I'm looking for.  Raney's lemma is about a sequence in which all partial sums are positive.  However, in obtaining $r$ times as many heads as tails for the first time the partial sums ($+r$ for each tail and $-1$ for each head) do not all have to be positive or all negative.  For example, you could have a sequence like HHHT, with overall $+1$, and then if the next flip is a tail you would have HHHTT, with overall $-1$, and we still haven't reached exactly twice as many heads as tails. I suspect the Raney's lemma argument can be adapted, but I don't think we quite have an answer to the question yet.  Does anyone see how to do it? Added 2 : I found a complete combinatorial argument.  See my answer below.","['binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"

61026,Dedekind Sum Congruences,"For $a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}$, let $a^{\prime} = \gcd(b,c)$, $b^{\prime} = \gcd(a,c)$, $c^{\prime} = \gcd(a,b)$ and $d = a^{\prime} b^{\prime} c^{\prime}$. Define $\mathfrak{S}(a,b,c) =  a^{\prime} \mathfrak{s}( \tfrac{bc}{d}, \tfrac{a}{b^{\prime} c^{\prime}}) +   b^{\prime} \mathfrak{s}( \tfrac{ac}{d}, \tfrac{b}{a^{\prime} c^{\prime}}) + c^{\prime} \mathfrak{s}( \tfrac{ab}{d}, \tfrac{c }{a^{\prime} b^{\prime}} )$, where $\mathfrak{s}$ is the Dedekind sum . I can prove the following: For $a, b, c \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\gcd(a,b,c) = 1$,
\begin{align}
12 a b c \ \mathfrak{S}(a,b,c) \equiv (ab)^{2} + (bc)^{2} + (ca)^{2} + d^{2}  \ \pmod{a b c}.
\end{align}
Is this congruence in the literature? I'm aware of the 3-term generalization of Rademacher and Pommersheim and of the work of Beck on the Carlitz-Dedekind Sums, but these don't seem to include this particular congruence as a special case. I generalize. For $a_{1}, \dots, a_{n} \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\gcd(a_1, \dots, a_{n}) = 1$, let $a_{i}^{\prime} = \gcd(a_{1}, \dots, \hat{a}_{i}, \dots, a_{n})$. Define the symmetric summation $$
\mathfrak{S}(a_{1},\dots, a_{n}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{i}^{\prime} \, \mathfrak{s}\left( \tfrac{a_{1} \cdots \hat{a}_{i} \cdots a_{n}}{a_{n+1}},  \tfrac{a_{i}}{a_{1}^{\prime} \cdots \hat{a}_{i}^{\prime} \cdots a_{n}^{\prime}} \right).
$$
where $\hat{}$ denotes omission. For pairwise coprime $a_{1}, \dots, a_{n} \in \mathbb{N}$ (all primed variables equal $1$), I conjecture the following congruence holds for $n = 4$ (and I have a hunch that it continues to hold for $n > 4$):
$$
12 a_{1} \cdots a_{n} \, \mathfrak{S}(a_{1}, \dots, a_{n}) \equiv \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (a_{1} \cdots \hat{a}_{i} \cdots a_{n})^{2} \right) + 1 \ \pmod{a_{1} \cdots a_{n}}.

61048,Definition of convergence of a nested radical $\sqrt{a_1 + \sqrt{a_2 + \sqrt{a_3 + \sqrt{a_4+\cdots}}}}$?,"In my answer to the recent question Nested Square Roots , @GEdgar correctly raised the issue that the proof is incomplete unless I show that the intermediate expressions do converge to a (finite) limit. One such quantity was the nested radical 
$$
\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1+\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \cdots}}}} \tag{1}
$$ To assign a value $Y$ to such an expression, I proposed the following definition. Define the sequence $\{ y_n \}$ by: 
$$
y_1 = \sqrt{1}, y_{n+1} = \sqrt{1+y_n}.
$$
Then we say that this expression evaluates to $Y$ if the sequence $y_n$ converges to $Y$. For the expression (1), I could show that the $y_n$ converges to $\phi = (\sqrt{5}+1)/2$. (To give more details, I showed, by induction, that $y_n$ increases monotonically and is bounded by $\phi$, so that it has a limit $Y < \infty$. Furthermore, this limit must satisfy $Y = \sqrt{1+Y}$.) Hence we could safely say (1) evaluates to $\phi$, and all seems to be good. My trouble. Let us now test my proposed idea with a more general expression of the form
$$\sqrt{a_1 + \sqrt{a_2 + \sqrt{a_3 + \sqrt{a_4+\cdots}}}} \tag{2}$$
 (Note that the linked question involves one such expression, with $a_n = 5^{2^n}$.) How do we decide if this expression converges? Mimicking the above definition, we can write:
$$
y_1 = \sqrt{a_1}, y_{n+1} = \sqrt{a_{n+1}+y_n}.
$$
However, unrolling this definition, one get the sequence
$$
\sqrt{a_1}, \sqrt{a_{2}+ \sqrt{a_1}}, \sqrt{a_3 + \sqrt{a_2 + \sqrt{a_1}}}, \sqrt{a_4+\sqrt{a_3 + \sqrt{a_2 + \sqrt{a_1}}}}, \ldots
$$
but this seems little to do with the expression (2) that we started with. I could not come up with any satisfactory ways to resolve the issue. So, my question is: How do I rigorously define when an expression of the form (2) converges, and also assign a value to it when it does converge?

61060,Question about the nature of coordinate systems,"I couldn't really think of a good one line title for my question, so I will try to elaborate. From what I have sort of gathered over my years, if you want to locate an arbitrary point in an n-dimensional coordinate space, you need at least n coordinates.  This was sort of implied in my Linear Algebra class about linear coordinates, I think ... but I sort of felt that there was a further implication that this requirement applies to all types of coordinate systems, including angle-based ones like Polar coordinates. For example, if I wanted to describe a 3D point, I can choose whatever coordinate system I want, but that coordinate system must require at least 3 points to be able to uniquely identify my point.  That's why cartesian $(x,y,z)$ , cylindrical $(r,\theta,z)$ , and spherical coordinates $(r,\theta,\phi)$ work, as well as a coordinate system relying on a linear combination of three linearly independent vectors (cartesian being a special case of this where the three vectors are orthogonal unit vectors).  Furthermore, if a linear combination coordinate system requires four or more coordinates but only describes points on one 3D space, that coordinate system has redundancies and may be reduced to only needing three coordinates. I was then taught, in Physics, that a point in that 3D space was an abstract entity, and that the coordinate system is irrelevant to the nature of the point -- to describe it, all you needed was to chose a set of bases.  Any bases will do -- as long as there are three of them. I sort of took this generalization to other spaces besides just the n-dimensional real number space.  For example, the human color space, I figured, has 3 dimensions, and that's why all of the current color systems (RGB, HSV, HSL, the varies CIE perceptional color spaces) all require three coordinates, and you can't describe all colors with only two coordinates, and a coordinate system with four coordinates is redundant. Also, there is the space of all possible rectangles.  A rectangle can be uniquely described by its height and width, but there are many other ways, all of which require at least two numbers. And all ""redundant"" systems may be reduced to a non-redundant one (similar to how vectors that aren't linearly independent can be reduced to a set of linearly independent vectors that can combine to form the original ones) Thank you if you are still reading at this point; I know that that was kinda long-winded.  I have two questions, that are somewhat related. Is what I am thinking true?  Did I make too many vast generalizations?  What is wrong about this line of thought, if anything?  I'm sure I made too many jumps somewhere. One thing that has been troubling me is the ""trilateration"" ""coordinate system"" used to find points on a 2D plane.  Coordinate system is defined as: There are three reference points at arbitrary locations on the plane.  The coordinate is given as $(r_1,r_2,r_3)$ , where $r_n$ is the distance of the given point from the $n$ th anchor point. This bugs me because to locate a 2D point using this coordinate system, you need three coordinates.  Should it not be that, because this is a 2D plane, you only need two coordinates?  How does something like this exist?  What makes it fundamentally different from the other coordinate systems/spaces I have mentioned previously?

Inside every object there are certain ""subobjects"" that we can divide by: normal subgroups, subgroups, ideals and subspaces with the subspace topology, respectively. I (think I) know from an universal algebra viewpoint (of which I know nothing) that in the case of ""algebraic"" objects, the ""subobjects"" we take the quotient by are determined by congruences: equivalence relations on the cartesian product that respect the operation(s). The first problem is: 1) How to define categorically the ""subobjects"" by which we take quotients? Now, the resulting ""quotient object"" $G/N$ always satisfies the same universal property: it comes with a morphism $\pi$ such that $\pi:G\to G/N$ and $N\subset ker \,\pi$, which is universal with respect to this: any other such morphism factors through $\pi$. The second (intimately linked) problem is: 2) How to define categorically these ""quotient objects"" and express in fancy terms the universal property they satisfy? Now, in ""algebraic"" categories there are well-known isomorphism theorems . In the Wikipedia link, it is explained that they are all a special case of the universal algebra statement. 3) How can we express them in categorical terms?

Put differently, it tells us how many elements (edges) of a certain structure (graph with fixed number of vertices) must be there to guarantee that a particular property (existence of a clique of a specific size) will hold. One can argue that in EGT we try to understand the structure of the extremal objects, but I don't see why Ramsey theory should not try to do the same thing, and also I don't see how this is done in the (beautiful) Erdős–Stone theorem which is considered a fundamental theorem of EGT.

$$I(n,a,1) = \int_{a}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \exp \left[ -\pi \frac{1}{n} t^2\right]dt
= \int_{a/\sqrt{n}}^\infty \exp \left[ -\pi t^2\right]dt,$$

61252,Is there a name for this strange solution to a quadratic equation involving a square root?,"Here's an elementary question on solving the following quadratic equation (well, it's not a quadratic until the square root is eliminated): $$\sqrt{x+5} + 1 = x$$ Upon solving the above equation either using the method of factoring or the quadratic formula (after squaring both sides) you get $x = 4$ and $x = -1$. If you plug in $x = 4$ in the original equation, it checks out. However $x = -1$ doesn't work. You'll end up getting $3 = -1$ which is not true (in other words the LHS does not equal the RHS). Is this still considered a solution/root of this particular equation? Does it have a special name?","['faq', 'radicals', 'algebra-precalculus']"
61263,Simplify using the Tangent Difference identity,"I solved a problem to the point that I know the answer is $$\frac{2nr}{\tan\left( \frac{(n-2)\pi}{2n} \right)}$$ The question tells me that the answer is going to be $$2rn\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)$$ Wolfram Alpha tells me the two are equal, so at least I'm on the right track. [ link ] I was able to simplify $$\frac{2nr}{\tan\left( \frac{(n-2)\pi}{2n} \right)}$$ to $$\frac{2nr}{\tan\left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{n} \right)}$$ and then attempted to use the tangent difference identify, $$\tan(\alpha \pm \beta) = \frac{\tan\alpha \pm \tan\beta}{1 \mp \tan\alpha\tan\beta}$$ to simplify further. But I am unable to find $\tan\alpha$ due to the fact that $\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$ is undefined. How do I work around this?

Please don't give me a solution, I want to do this problem, but i need some advice. Clearly if I have a continuous bijection then it'll be a homeomorphism. Because the closed sets are compact and $f$ continuous map preserve this property, and so the image is also closed, so this map is also homeomorphism.

Going over some exercises, this theorem made it easy to see that a subgroup $H$, with $|H|=35$, is normal in $G$ when $|G|=70$. A similar situation wasn't as obvious. If $|H|=35$, but $|G|=140$, then $H$ has index $4$. How then would one go about proving $H\unlhd G$? Thanks.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

61374,Bound for multi-index sum,"I have difficulties in evaluating the multi-index notation in the following context: Let $x \in R^n$ and let $i$ be a multi-index, $i=(i_1, \dots, i_n)$.
Now I want to know the bound of the sum (knowing that each $x_i \leq a$, $\frac{1}{x_i} \leq b$)
$$ \sum_{|i|=3} \frac{1}{i!} \frac{x^i}{x_l} \quad (\ast) $$ What I thought so far: There are three types of summands, (i) there is one $i_j=3$ (and the rest $i_k$, $k \neq j$ is 0) in $i$, then $i!$=6; (ii) there is one index $i_{j_1}=2$ and one $i_{j_2}$=1 (the others 0), then $i!=2$; and (iii) there are three components of $i$ 1, the rest 0, the faculty would be 1.
(the types would be $(0, \dots, 3, \dots, 0)$, $(0, \dots, 0 , 2, 0, \dots, 0, 1, 0, \dots, 0)$ and $(0, \dots, 0 , 1, 0, \dots, 0, 1,  0, \dots, 0, 1, 0, \dots, 0)$). Now if I look at the first case, I would have $(n-1)$ times the expression $\frac{x_j^3}{x_l}$, $l \neq j$ and once $x_l^2$, so 
$$ (\ast) = \frac{1}{6} ( \underbrace{\sum_{j \neq l} \frac{x_j^3}{x_l}}_{ \leq (n-1) a^3 b} \quad + \underbrace{x_l^2}_{\leq a^2}) + \frac{1}{2} (\text{???}) + \frac{1}{1} (\text{????}) $$ Q: How can I obtain the whole bound for $(\ast)$ ? Is this right so far? How can I continue for the second case (ii)? Is there a way to let it do mechanically be mathematica? (Does someone know how to put multi-index notation in Mathematica) Note: I write $x_i \leq a$, $\frac{1}{x_i} \leq b$

61377,Looking for Proofs Of Basic Properties Of Real Numbers,"I have just begun my study of complex numbers and I learned where imaginary numbers came from and their importance. However there's one thing that I need to clarify and that is the properties of real numbers and their proofs. Closure Laws For all $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$, $a+b$, $a-b$, $ab$, $a/b$ are real numbers. Thus $\mathbb{R}$ is closed under four fundamental operations. Commutative Laws For all $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ $a+b = b+a$ and $ab = ba$. Associative Laws For all $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$ $a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c$ and $a(bc) = (ab)c$. Additive Identity For all $a \in \mathbb{R}$ there exists $0\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a+0 = 0+a = a$. Additive inverse For all $a \in \mathbb{R}$ there exists a $b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a+b = b+a = 0$, the additive identity $b = -a$ is called the additive inverse or the negative of $a$. and similarly Multiplicative Identity, Multiplicative inverse, Distributive Law, Trichotomy Law, Transitivity of order, Monotone Law of Addition, Monotone law of multiplication. I understand that the above laws hold good throughout mathematics. Should these laws be accepted as being true ""on faith"" or are there proofs?
If yes, I am curious to know the proofs. As per my understanding no textbook has ever talked about proofs for these.","['soft-question', 'proof-writing', 'real-analysis']"
