2174598,Determining how many cards of a Poker hand to discard,"I am programming a game of 5 Card Poker, and an AI to play it. I have written a function that calculates, for a given card in a hand, the probability of improving the hand if this card is discarded and swapped for another random card dealt from the deck. As of now, the probability is calculated on the assumption that all other 47 cards are still in the deck. This will be refined at a later stage. I now need to write a function that determines which, and how many (0, 1, 2, or 3) cards to discard from a hand. If I have the probability for each of the 5 cards, what is the best way to determine what combination (of up to 3) of these cards will give the largest possibility in improving the hand?

2174693,"$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(x+e)(\ln^{2}x + 4\pi^{2})} \, dx$: Keyhole Contour Omitting Positive Axis","Compute $$\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(x+e)(\ln^{2}x + 4\pi^{2})} \, dx$$ Using the substitution $u = \sqrt{x}$ we see that
\begin{align*}
\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(x+e)(\ln^{2}x + 4\pi^{2})} \, dx =\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{u}{(u^{2}+e)(\ln^{2}u + \pi^{2})} \, du
\end{align*}
Now let $f(z) = \frac{z}{(z^{2}+e)\ln z}$ with  branch cut along the positive real axis and $-\pi \leq \arg z < \pi$. Let $\gamma$ be the following contour: Going by residues, we have that
$$\oint_{\gamma} f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i \left(\frac{2}{1+\pi^{2}} + \frac{1}{1+e}\right)$$
The same tricks as always show that the contributions from $\gamma_{R}$ and $\gamma_{r}$ will vanish as $R$ goes to infinity and $r$ goes to 0. Now
\begin{align*}
&\oint_{\gamma} f(z) \, dz = \oint_{\gamma_{\varepsilon}} f(z) \, dz + \oint_{\gamma_{-\varepsilon}} f(z) \, dz \\
=& \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{u+i\varepsilon}{((u+i\varepsilon)^{2}+e)(\ln (u+i\varepsilon)}\, du - \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{u-i\varepsilon}{((u-i\varepsilon)^{2}+e)(\ln (u-i\varepsilon))}\, du
\end{align*}
Taking $\varepsilon$ to $0$
$$= 2\pi i \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{u}{(u^{2}+e)(\ln^{2} u + \pi^{2})} \, du $$
Putting it all together, we finally see that
$$\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(x+e)(\ln^{2}x + 4\pi^{2})} \, dx = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2}{1+\pi^{2}} + \frac{1}{1+e}\right) $$
The professor said everything is good except that I put $\arg z \in [-\pi, \pi)$. I'm taking the positive real axis to the angle $-\pi$ and going all the way around comes to $\pi$. This issue is fixed by taking $0 \leq \arg z < 2\pi$ and changing $\ln z$ to $(\ln z - \pi i)$ in the denominator. This example does something weird and I think similar to what I did.

2174785,Connected component in a scheme,"Let $X$ be a scheme over a field $k$ (if necessary, locally of finite type).  Let $E$ be a connected component of $X$.  Then $E$ is closed.  For example, $X$ could be a group scheme over $k$, and $E = X^0$ the connected component of the identity point in $X$. There are many closed subscheme structures one can place on $E$. I've seen notes that mention the possibility of $E$ being geometrically connected .  A scheme $Y$ over $k$ is said to be geometrically connected if $Y \times_k \overline{k}$ is connected.  However, $E$ is just a closed subset of $X$, not yet a scheme. When people talk about $E$ being geometrically connected, are they saying with respect to a fixed closed subscheme structure on $E$?  Or is it the case that the underlying space of $E \times_k \overline{k}$ does not depend on the choice of closed subscheme structure on $E$? In the case where $X = \textrm{Spec } A$ is affine, it seems what I am doing is comparing the spectra of $A/I \otimes_k \overline{k}$ and $A/\sqrt{I} \otimes_k \overline{k}$. We can identify $A/I \otimes_k \overline{k} = A \otimes_k \overline{k}/(I \otimes \overline{k})$, and the same for $\sqrt{I}$.  I believe that the span of $I$ and $\sqrt{I}$ in $A \otimes_k \overline{k}$ are ideals with the same radical, which tells me that the prime spectra of $A/I \otimes_k \overline{k}$ and $A/\sqrt{I} \otimes_k \overline{k}$ are the same topological space.  So if $X$ is affine, there is no problem.",['algebraic-geometry']
2174790,"Prove $(a,b]$ is closed in the Upper Limit Topology","Recall that in the set of all real numbers, if $\Sigma$ is all sets of the form $\{ x \vert x > a\}$ and $\{ x \vert x \leq b\}$, then $\mathcal{T}(\Sigma)$ is called the Upper Limit Topology and has the sets $(a,b]$ as basis. Therefore, $(a,b]$ are obviously open sets in $\mathcal{T}(\Sigma)$, and I need to show that they are also closed in $\mathcal{T}(\Sigma)$ (clopen!) Could someone please tell me if my proof of this below is correct, and/or what I can do to polish it up and make it nicer? Thank you in advance. Consider $(a,b]^{c} = (-\infty,a] \cup (b, \infty)$. Now, $\displaystyle (-\infty, a] = \cup_{-n < a} (-n,a]$ so $(-\infty,a]$ can be expressed as the union of basis elements in $\mathcal{T}$, and thus is open. Also, $\displaystyle \cup_{n=b+1}^{\infty}(b,n] = (b,\infty)$, so we have written $(b,\infty)$ as the union of basis elements of $\mathcal{T}$. Therefore, $(b,\infty)$ is open in $\mathcal{T}$. Since we have shown $(-\infty,a]$ and $(b,\infty)$ to be open, $(-\infty,a] \cup (b,\infty)$ is open, so $(a,b]^{c}$ is open. Therefore, since $(a,b]^{c}$ is open, $\left((a,b]^{c}\right)^{c} = (a,b]$ is closed. Please note that this is not homework.

2174871,Do random variables form a comma category?,"Question: Do random variables form an example of a comma category? Attempt: Let $(M_i, \mathscr{F}_i, \mu_i)$ denote an arbitrary measure space ($M_i$ is the point set, $\mathscr{F}_i$ is the $\sigma$-algebra, and $\mu_i$ is the measure), and let $(X, \mathscr{G})$ be a measurable space (i.e. no choice of measure). If we let $\mathscr{M}$ denote the category of measure spaces and $\mathcal{M}$ denote the category of measurable spaces, then there is an obvious forgetful functor $\mathscr{M} \to \mathcal{M}$ which forgets the choice of measure. If we consider $(X,\mathscr{G})$ with the identity to be a (one object, one morphism) category, then it is trivially a subcategory of $\mathcal{M}$ and thus we have an obvious inclusion functor $(X,\mathscr{G}) \to \mathcal{M}$. Using the notation of the nLab page on comma categories , $C$ is the category of measure spaces $\mathscr{M}$, $D$ is the trivial category $(X, \mathscr{G})$, $E$ is the category of measurable spaces $\mathcal{M}$, $f$ is the forgetful functor $\mathscr{M} \to \mathcal{M}$, and $g$ is the inclusion functor $(X, \mathscr{G}) \to \mathcal{M}$. Then the objects will be measurable functions $\psi:(M_i,\mathscr{F}_i, \mu_i) \to (X,\mathscr{G})$ or (perhaps equivalently) the measures induced on $(X,\mathscr{G})$ via $\psi$, i.e. $\mu_i \circ \psi^{-1}$, or the resulting measure space $(X, \mathscr{G}, \mu_i \circ \psi^{-1})$. In particular, we can restrict $\mathscr{M}$ to be the subcategory of probability spaces , and take $(X,\mathscr{G})$ to be $\mathbb{R}$ with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra -- then the objects of the category are random variables, and (I think) two random variables are isomorphic in the category if and only if they have the same distribution. The more general formulation in terms of measure and measurable spaces above might allow this to be extended to random measures, stochastic processes, and others. This is almost a slice category, except that our agnosticism with respect to the measure on $(X, \mathscr{G})$ forces us to consider it as an element of the category of measurable spaces $\mathcal{M}$ rather than an element of the category of measure spaces $\mathscr{M}$, forcing us to resort to a more general comma category instead of a slice category.","['category-theory', 'probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"
2174876,"Find the determinant and possible sizes of a matrix $A$, which satisfies the equation $A^2 - 2A + 4E = 0$","Let $A \in M_n(\mathbb{R})$ satisfy the equation:
$$A^2 - 2A + 4I = 0$$
(a) What is $\det A$? (3 points) (b) What are possible sizes of a matrix $A$? (6 points) My solution We can derive 2 useful equations from the given one: 1) $A^2 = -2(2I - A)\Rightarrow (\det A)^2 = \det (-2(2I - A)) = (-2)^n \cdot \det (2I - A)$ 2) $A(2I - A) = 4E \Rightarrow \det A \cdot \det (2I - A) = 4^n = 2^{2n}$ From the first we see that the size $n$ must be even. This is the answer to the question (b). Now, let's build the system of equations, where $x = \det A$, $y = \det (2I - A)$. Also, we can replace $(-2)^n$ with $2^n$, because we know, that $n$ is even: $$\begin{cases} x^2 = 2^n \cdot y, \\ xy = 2^{2n} \end{cases} \Rightarrow \begin{cases} y = x^2\cdot2^{-n}, \\ x\cdot(x^2\cdot2^{-n}) = 2^{2n} \end{cases} \Rightarrow x = (2^{2n}\cdot2^n)^{1/3} = 2^n$$ So, $\det A = 2^n$ and it depends on the size of the matrix. This is the answer to the question (a). The question Is this solution correct? I have big doubts about it, because the question (b) is worth twice more points than (a), but happened to be much easier and also order of tasks suggests, that we should solve (a) first.","['matrices', 'matrix-equations', 'linear-algebra']"

\left( a\dfrac{d^2x_p}{dt^2} + b\dfrac{dx_p}{dt} + cx_p \right)$ $= 0 + f(t) = f(t) $ I don't see how this proves that a homogeneous solution and a particular solution are required to find the solution of a linear non homogeneous constant-coefficient differential equation? In fact, the proof shows that we end up with $= 0 + f(t) = f(t) $ where $f(t)$ is what we were seeking all along. Therefore, since $\left( a\dfrac{d^2x_c}{dt^2} + b\dfrac{dx_c}{dt} + cx_c \right) = 0$, what was the point of the solution to the homogeneous equation? It seems that the homogeneous solution was redundant from the beginning, since only the particular solution, $\left( a\dfrac{d^2x_p}{dt^2} + b\dfrac{dx_p}{dt} + cx_p \right)$, contributed towards the solution of the linear non homogeneous constant-coefficient differential equation ($\left( a\dfrac{d^2x_p}{dt^2} + b\dfrac{dx_p}{dt} + cx_p \right) = f(t)$). I would greatly appreciate it if people could please take the time to clarify concept. EDIT I've received 3 answers; none of which address my question or do it sufficiently. My question is very clear: How does the above calculation show that both a particular solution and a homogeneous solution are required for a general solution? I then mentioned that the homogeneous solutions ends up equating to $0$ and the particular solution equates to $f(x)$; in other words,  it seems that the particular solution was the only thing required to get the general solution $f(x)$, which seemingly makes the homogeneous solution redundant?

2175105,"Not understanding the concept of ""irreducibility"" for quasi-projective varieties","I am self-studying Shafarevich's ""Basic Algebraic Geometry"" and I am having some trouble understanding the decomposition of quasi-projective varieties into irreducible components. I work over an algebraically closed field. Shafarevich claims that ""The notion of irreducible variety and the theorem on decomposing a variety as a union of irreducible components carries over word-for-word from the case of affine sets."" I am having difficulties understanding this (Shafarevich dedicates only half a page to the concept of quasi-projective variety, leaving a lot for the student to figure out by himself). Let $X \subseteq \Bbb P ^n$ be an irreducible projective variety. Let $U = \{[x_0 : \dots : x_n] \in \Bbb P ^n \mid x_0 \ne 0\}$ be our usual affine chart. Let $X_0 = U \cap X$ be the affine part and $X_\infty = X \setminus X_0$ be the part at infinity. $X_0$ is the intersection of a Zariski closed subset of $\Bbb P^n$ and the open subset $U$, therefore a quasi-projective variety. $X_\infty$ is a closed subset of $X$, therefore closed in $\Bbb P^n$, therefore projective, therefore quasi-projective. Since $X = X_0 \cup X_\infty$, it follows that $X$ is reducible! Where am I wrong? A concrete example: consider the affine line $L: x=0$ in $\Bbb A^2$ and let $\overline L$ be its projective closure. Then $\overline L$ will be the union of $L$ (the affine part) and $[0:1:0]$ (the point at infinity). How does this fit with the intuition that $\overline L$ should be irreducible? Let $X,Y,Z$ be projective varieties such that $X = Y \cup Z$ with $Y \cap Z \ne \emptyset$. Let $W = Z \setminus Y$ - a quasi-projective variety. Since $X = Y \cup W$, how does this fit with the expected uniqueness of the decomposition in irreducible components? If $X = Y \cup Z$ is reducible with $X,Y$ projective, does it follow that $Z$ must be projective too, or can it also be quasi-projective non-projective?","['algebraic-geometry', 'projective-geometry', 'affine-geometry', 'affine-varieties', 'projective-space']"

2175212,A finite morphism $A\to B$ can be decomposed into a finite étale morphism followed by a finite morphism.,"I have spent quite some time attempting to solve the following problem: Let $A\to B$ be a finite homomorphism of Noetherian rings.

2175223,Proof of extension field containing a root of irreducible polynomial,"I have been reading Dummit/Foote lately, and in the introductory chapter on field theory, there is the following theorem: Theorem Let F be a field and let $p(x) \in F[x]$ be irreducible.  Then there exists a field $K$ containing an isomorphic copy of $F$ in which $p(x)$ has a root. In the proof of this theorem, $K$ is defined to be $F[x]/ \langle p(x)\rangle$, so that elements of $K$ look like $f(x) + \langle p(x) \rangle$ for some $f(x) \in F[x]$.  The claim is that the element $x + \langle p(x) \rangle$ is a root of $p(x)$.  My question is: If $p(x)$ belongs to $F[x]$, why can you even ""evaluate"" $p(x)$ at the element $x + \langle p(x) \rangle$.  If $p(x) = a_nx^n + \cdots + a_1x + a_0$, evaluating at $x + \langle p(x) \rangle$ looks something like
\begin{equation*}
a_n \big(x + \langle p(x) \rangle\big)^n + \cdots + a_1 \big(x + \langle p(x) \rangle\big) + a_0
\end{equation*}
But what does $a_1 \big(x + \langle p(x) \rangle\big)$ even mean?  I'm guessing that it is probably equal to $a_1x + \langle p(x) \rangle$.  But as far as I can tell, there is no definition (in D/F) of what this expression means or whether it even has a meaning. After thinking about this a little more, I have come up with the following hypothesis. Perhaps the theorem that I stated above could be stated as follows: Theorem (modified version) Let $F$ be a field and $p(x) \in F[x]$ be irreducible.  Then there exists a field $K$ such that the following are satisfied: There is an isomorphism $\phi: F \to \phi(F) \subset K$. The polynomial $\tilde{p}(x):= \phi(a_n) x^n + \cdots + \phi(a_1)x + \phi(a_0) \in K[x]$ contains a root, i.e. there exists $\alpha \in K$ with the property that $\tilde{p}(\alpha) = 0_K$. I would feel more comfortable about using this approach.  It seems strange (and to me, even not rigorous) to evaluate $p(x) \in F[x]$ at an element $\alpha \in K$ when $K$ is not (formally speaking) a super field of $F$.  By using the above formulation, we don't have this problem.  (Note: I know that some may take objection to my statement that $K$ is not a super field of $F$.  I realize that $K$ contains an isomorphic copy of $F$, but if $F \subset K$ does not hold in the set-theoretic sense, then it seems that you run into the problem  of defining what $a_1 \alpha$ means when $a_1 \in F$ and $\alpha \in K$.) To summarize, I guess I have outlined three general questions (although I would be grateful for comments on anything in this post) What is the meaning of the expression $a_1 \big(x + \langle p(x) \rangle \big)$ when $a_1 \in F$? If $f(x) \in F[x]$, what can I evaluate $f$ at?  Does this element need to belong to $F$? Is my restatement of the theorem correct?  If both formulations are correct, how is the one given in D/F rigorous?","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

2175271,Finding the variance of this uniform distribution.,"Let $f(x) = \frac{1}{\theta}$ for $0 \leq x \leq \theta$. Let $X_{(n)} = \text{max}(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$, where $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are i.i.d. Then we want to find $V(X_{(n)})$. I feel like I have the answer but mine differs from my professors, so if someone could point out where I went wrong that would be immensely helpful. We can find the PDF of $X_{(n)}$ by using the following trick: by definition, the CDF of $X_{(n)}$ is $P(X_{(n)} \leq x)$. However, if the maximum is less than or equal to x, then it follows that all $X_i$ are less than or equal to $x$, and so we have $P(X_{(n)} \leq x) = P(X_1 \leq n, \ldots, X_n \leq n)$. Since the $X_i$ are i.i.d, we have $P(X_{(n)} \leq x) = (F(x))^{n}$, where $F(x)$ denotes the CDF of $f(x)$. Note that the CDF of $f(x)$ is 
$$F(x) = \int_0^x \frac{1}{\theta} dy = \frac{y}{\theta} \bigg|_{y=0}^x = \frac{x}{\theta}.$$
Substituting this in, we have that then $P(X_{(n)} \leq x) = \frac{x^n}{\theta^n}$, and by taking the derivative we have that the PDF is $\frac{nx^{n-1}}{\theta^n}$. By a lemma, we may note that $V(X_{(n)}) = \mathbb{E}(X_{(n)}^2) - \mathbb{E}(X_{(n)})^2.$ Hence, we need to then find $\mathbb{E}(X_{(n)}^2)$ and $\mathbb{E}(X_{(n)})^2$. To find $\mathbb{E}(X_{(n)})$, we must solve the integral $$\int_0^{\theta} x \frac{nx^{n-1}}{\theta^n}dx = \int_0^{\theta} \frac{nx^{n}}{\theta^n}dx = \frac{nx^{n+1}}{(n+1)\theta^n} \bigg|_{x=0}^{\theta} = \frac{n\theta}{n+1}.$$
To find $\mathbb{E}(X_{(n)}^2)$, we must solve the integral
$$\int_0^{\theta} x^2 \frac{nx^{n-1}}{\theta^n}dx = \int_0^{\theta} \frac{nx^{n+1}}{\theta^n}dx = \frac{nx^{n+2}}{(n+2)\theta^n} \bigg|_{x=0}^{\theta} = \frac{n \theta^2}{n+2}.$$
Using the prior lemma, we have
$$V(X_{(n)}) = \mathbb{E}(X_{(n)}^2) - \mathbb{E}(X_{(n)})^2 = \frac{n \theta^2}{n+2} - \bigg(\frac{n\theta}{n+1} \bigg)^2 $$
$$=\frac{n\theta^2}{n+2} - \frac{n^2\theta^2}{n^2+2n+1} = \frac{n\theta^2(n^2+2n+1)-n^2\theta^2(n+2)}{(n+2)(n+1)^2} $$
$$=\frac{n^3\theta^2+2n^2\theta^2+n\theta^2-n^3\theta^2-2n^2\theta^2}{(n+2)(n+1)^2} = \frac{n\theta^2}{(n+2)(n+1)^2}.$$ However, my professor has $V(X_{(n)}) = \frac{n}{(n+2)(n+1)^2}$. Like I said, I don't know where I went wrong, so any help would be nice. Our expected value and PDF agree, so it must be somewhere in the calculation of variance.","['statistics', 'probability']"

It is easy to see that the distribution of $(U+W) \,\text{mod}\, 1$ is $U(0,1)$. Then, due to symmetry, the value of $(U+W)\,\text{mod}\, 1$ contains no information about the value of $U$, so it contains no information about $(U+V)\,\text{mod}\, 1$, so they are independent.

Brute force method.  Condition on the random variable $U$: 
\begin{align*}

2175318,$R$ is integrally closed in $S$ iff $R[x]$ is integrally closed in $S[x]$,"The title is the question. The parts in bold below are where I'm stuck. This is what I've tried (much of this is just me explaining a hint I received): This comes from Eisenbud 3.17. The hint in the back of the book states: First reduce to the case where $R$ is Noetherian by passing to a
  subring finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}$. This part I'm completely lost at. After that the hint goes on to say that $f(x)\in S[x]$ is integral over $R[x]$, then $M:=R[x][f(x)]\subset S[x]$ is a finitely generated $R[x]$-module. This follows from one of the theorems in the section. Let $\text{coef}(M)$ be the submodule of $S$ generated by all coefficients of
  elements of $M$. Show that $\text{coef}(M)$ is a finitely generated
  $R$-module. We know that $f$ is integral so satisfies some equation: $$f(x)^n+b_{n-1}f(x)^{n-1}+\ldots+b_1f(x)+b_0=0\;\;\;\;\;b_i\in R[x]$$ This means that $M$ is finitely generated as an $R[x]$-module by $\{1,f(x),\ldots,f^n(x)\}$. From this, it's easy to see that $\text{coef}(M)$ is finitely generated. The hint goes on If $\alpha$ is the leading coefficient of $f$, show that $R[\alpha]\subset\text{coef}(M)$; it follows that $R[\alpha]$ is a finitely generated $R$-module so $\alpha$ is integral over $R$. Shouldn't this just follow since $R\subset\text{coef}(M)$ and $\alpha\in\text{coef}(M)$...? Finally, Use induction on the degree and the fact that integral elements form a ring to show that $f\in R[x]$. If $f(x)$ has degree $0$ we are done since the leading coefficient of $f$ is just a constant integral over $R$. And since $R$ is equal to its integral closure, $f\in R[x]$. Now assume $f$ has degree $n$ and the coefficients on lesser degree terms are integral in $R$. Well, the leading coefficient is integral over $R$ and all the lower coefficients are integral over $R$ by induction so all the coefficients of $f$ are integral over $R$. Since $R$ is integrally closed this implies $f(x)\in R[x]$.","['abstract-algebra', 'integral-extensions', 'modules', 'commutative-algebra']"

Is it just piecewise continuous?

set of measure zero. The following is my attempt: Suppose that $A \subseteq [0,1]$ has measure zero and $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. By definition of measure, there exists a countable collection of open intervals $\{ I_k \}_{k \geq 1}$ such that $A \subseteq \cup_{k=1}^{\infty}{I_k}$ and $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{l(I_k)} < \frac{\varepsilon}{c}. $

    Since $f$ is Lipschitz, for each $k$, $|f(x_k) - f(y_k)| \leq c \cdot |x_k - y_k|.$

Eccles) covers. However, I notice there's a contradiction when I apply their methods in a swapped manner, which I can't seem to figure out. For simplicity, let's call the proof of the first statement, ""Prove that 98765432 is not the square of an integer"", Proof 1 , and the proof of the second statement, ""Deduce that 1234567 is not a perfect square"", Proof 2 . Proving that $98765432$ is not the square of an integer: Proof 1: Let $n = 98765432$ Proposition 15.2.3 states, ""If n is a perfect square (i.e. the square of an integer) then $n = 3q$ or $n = 3q + 1$ for some integer, $q$"". $98,765,432 = 3q + 2$ where $q = 32,921,810$ Thus, we have shown that $98765432$ is not a perfect square, by Proposition 15.2.3 $Q.E.D.$ Then, in another example problem, the book proves the statement ""If n is a perfect square, then n = 4q or n = 4q + 1 for some integer, q."" to be valid. Then, the author deduces that 1234567 is not a perfect square as follows: Proof 2: Let $n = 1234567$ $1,234,567 = 4q + 3$ where $q = 308,641$ Since $1234567$ does not equal $4q$ or $4q + 1$, it is not a perfect square.
  Thus, we have deduced $1234567$ is not a perfect square. $Q.E.D.$ I do comprehend how he used a derivation of the division theorem to prove these statements. What I can't wrap my head around is when I switch the logic used for the two proofs, I theorize that it should work the same way. However, it doesn't and I would like to know why. Moreover, when I use Proposition 15.2.3 (""If n is a perfect square (i.e. the square of an integer) then $n = 3q$ or $n = 3q + 1$ for some integer, $q$.) on the number $n = 1234567$, I get the following: Proof 1 (revised): Let $n = 1234567$ *Notice the ""revision"" is that I am using the number n from Proof 2 instead $1,234,567 = 3q + 1$ where $q = 411,522$ Thus, we have shown that 1234567 is not a perfect square, by Proposition 15.2.3 We cannot deduce by Proposition 15.2.3 that $1,234,567$ is not the sqaure of an integer since $1,234,567 = 3q + 1$ $Q.E.D.$ Similarly, I did the same with Proof 2 as follows: Proof 2 (revised): Let $n = 98765432$ *Note: the revision here is this n is the n from **Proof 1 ** instead $98,765,432 = 4q $ where $q = 308,641$ Thus, we have deduced 98765432 is not a perfect square.

2175915,Is it true that $\dim X\leq \dim X^*$ for locally convex topological vector spaces?,"A couple of years back, remilt asked whether the dimension of the topological dual of a normed space is always greater or equal than the dimension of the original space. The answer turned out to be positive. It feels natural to ask the same question for the wider class of topological vector spaces. Since there exist topological vector spaces $X$ for which $X^*$ is trivial (for example the $\ell_p$ spaces for $0<p<1$), lets concentrate on locally convex topological vector spaces, where it is a standard fact that $X^*$ is always nontrivial. Also in such spaces we have Hahn-Banach type theorems, which are always useful for constructing distinct elements of $X^*$. Definition: For a topological vector space $(X, \tau)$, we denote by $X^*$ the vector space of linear and continuous functionals from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$. Question: Let $(X,\tau)$ be a locally convex topological vector space. Is it true that $\dim X\leq \dim X^*$? In the case of normed spaces the proof consisted of three simple steps: The dimension of the space is equal to its cardinality, the cardinality is determined by the density character and finally density character increases when we take the dual. The first step is still true in the case of t.v.s., but the second and third need to be modified a lot, or changed altogether. Partial positive answers, ex. Frechet spaces, are also welcomed.","['functional-analysis', 'topological-vector-spaces']"

2176314,Is there a category of spaces with multiple choices of topology?,"If I remember my functional analysis correctly (hint: I probably don't), when considering Banach spaces we might want to work with up to 3 distinct choices of topology at a time: strong, weak, and weak-*. (Some of these coincide, I think, when the space is reflexive or Hilbert.) At least naively, it would seem like the category of topological spaces is insufficient to describe such objects, since each object carries insufficient ""data"" (i.e. only one choice of topology instead of 3). Is there a category-theoretic way to think about Banach spaces which is agnostic to which of the three topologies, strong, weak, weak-*, we might want to work with? My gut inclination is that the answer is no, because I can't think of appropriate morphisms for such a category -- they would have to be continuous with respect to all 3 different topologies, whereas I think one would be interested in a function which is continuous with respect to any one of them. That would lead to three different classes of morphisms, which would lead to an object related to a category (in particular which has categories as a special case) but nevertheless different. Note: I would have expected these questions (1) (2) to contain the answer, but they don't for whatever reason. Also nLab's page does seem to indicate that category theory applied to Banach spaces is less than simple (something about short versus bounded linear maps and unit balls) but doesn't seem to address my question about choice of topology (the phrase ""strong operator topology"" is found only once on the page, and the word ""weak"" has no hits at all).","['functional-analysis', 'category-theory', 'banach-spaces', 'soft-question']"
2176319,Symmetry of higher order mixed partial derivatives under weaker assumptions,"I have asked this question on Mathoverflow, but it did not receive much attention there. Suppose $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $f:U\to \mathbb{R}$. When $f$ is $C^2$ we know that the mixed partial derivatives are symmetric, i.e. 
$\partial_i\partial_jf= \partial_j\partial_if.$ 
But as it is famous  the continuity of the 2nd order partial derivatives is not necessary for this to happen. For example if $\partial_if$, $\partial_jf$ exist on $U$ and they are both differentiable (in the sense of Fréchet ) at some point $a\in U$ then 
$$\partial_i\partial_jf(a)= \partial_j\partial_if(a).$$ Now for the 3rd order partial derivatives we can obtain the symmetry if we assume that the 1st order partial derivatives of $f$ are differentiable on $U$ and its 2nd order partial derivatives are differentiable at $a$. Let me explain the proof for the particular case 
$$\partial_3\partial_2\partial_1f(a)= \partial_2\partial_1 \partial_3f(a).\tag{$\star$}$$
First as $\partial_1 f$ has 1st order partial derivatives in $U$ and they are differentiable at $a$ we have 
$$\partial_3\partial_2\partial_1f(a)= \partial_2\partial_3 \partial_1f(a).\tag{1}$$
Then since the 1st order partial derivatives of $f$ are differentiable in $U$ we have $\partial_3\partial_1f(x)= \partial_1\partial_3 f(x)$ for all $x\in U$. Hence we can differentiate to obtain 
$$\partial_2\partial_3\partial_1f(a)= \partial_2\partial_1 \partial_3f(a).\tag{2}$$
By combining (1) and (2) we get ($\star$). As you can see the full force of differentiability of the 1st order partial derivatives of $f$ on all of $U$ is only used for the equality of the 3rd order partial derivatives appeared in (2). So my question is Question: Can we prove the symmetry of 3rd order mixed partial derivatives of $f$ at $a$ by merely assuming that the 1st and 2nd order partial derivatives of $f$ exist on $U$ and they are all differentiable at $a$ ? If not, can you provide a counterexample?

The author says: "" Let $c_{1}<c_{2}<c_{3}<...$ be the critical values of $f:M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The sequence $\{c_{i}\}$ has no cluster point since each $M^{a}$ is compact. The set $M^{a}$ is vacuous for $a<c_{1}...$"" I proved that the set of critical values of $f$ is countable and that exists a minimum. Then I showed that the mentioned sequence has non cluster point but I did not manage in showing that he set ""$M^{a}$ is vacuous for $a<c_{1}...$"". What I used to show the first two statement are essentially: the fact that non degenerate critical points for a smooth real valued function on a manifold are isolated(consequence of Morse's lemma), the regularity of the function $f$ and the compactness of $M$. I thought of showing the last observation by a ""proof by contradiction"" supposing it exists an $a\in \mathbb{R}$ for which $M^{a}$ is not vacuous and $a<c_{1}$ and then finding a critical point for $f$: $p\in M^{a}$, leading to a contradiction.
