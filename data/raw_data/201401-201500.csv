3958948,Path Independence of Line Integrals,"The Cauchy-Goursat theorem states that if a function $f$ is analytic on, and in the interior of, a contour $C$ then: $$\int_{C} f(z) \hspace{1mm} dz = 0.$$ From here, a lot of lecture notes deduce the following. Cor. Suppose $f$ is analytic on some simply connected region $A$ . Then for any two points $a, b \in A$ we have that $$\int_{C} f(z) \hspace{1mm} dz$$ is independent of the contour $C$ in $A$ joining $a$ and $b$ . However, the 'proof' often only shows $$\int_{C_1} f(z) \hspace{1mm} dz = \int_{C_2} f(z) \hspace{1mm} dz.$$ when $C_1$ and $C_2$ are non-intersecting (because then $C := C_1\cup C_2$ is a closed contour). What is the best way to prove independence for all $C_1$ and $C_2$ ? I can 'see' that one can just pick a third contour $C_3$ which doesn't intersect either $C_1$ or $C_2$ , and the proof follows from that. But how can I make the existence of $C_3$ rigorous without 'advanced machinery'?","['complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"
3959044,"If $X$, $Y$, and $\frac{X+Y}{2}$ are nonnegative and identically distributed, is $X=Y$ almost surely?","Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are nonnegative random variables such that the distributions of $X$ , $Y$ , and $\frac{X+Y}{2}$ are identical. Is it true that $X=Y$ almost surely? $X$ and $Y$ are not necessarily assumed to be integrable. It is crucial that they are bounded on one side, since otherwise we may sample $X$ and $Y$ independently from the Cauchy distribution. $X$ and $Y$ cannot be independent because one-sided $\alpha$ -stable distributions do not exist for $\alpha \geq 1$ . (Proved by Esseen and Ramachandran in the 1960s.) My gut feeling is that if $X$ and $Y$ cannot be independent then they cannot not be distinct at all, but this relies on how, when they are square-integrable, $Y$ can be written as a linear combination of $X$ and an independent copy of it. The proof itself is easy when we assume square-integrability: $$ \mathbb{E}\left[ (X-Y)^2 \right] = \mathbb{E}\left[X^2\right] + \mathbb{E}\left[Y^2\right] - \mathbb{E}\left[(X+Y)^2\right] = 0. $$ I do not know how to proceed without this assumption. I don't think a truncation argument would work since $(X \wedge n) + (Y \wedge n) \neq (X+Y) \wedge (2n)$ . Perhaps there is a simple counterexample I have overlooked. For context, I have been reading a paper in which appears a continuous, strictly increasing process $(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ with $X_0=0$ the following two properties: $X_s/s \stackrel{d}{=} X_t/t$ and $X_{s+t} - X_s \stackrel{d}{=} X_t$ for all $s,t>0$ . The author claims that $\lim_{t\to 0} (X_t/t)$ exists almost surely because $X_t/t = \lim_{s\to \infty} (X_s/s)$ almost surely for all $t>0$ . (The limit as $t\to\infty$ was claimed to exist almost surely by Birkhoff's pointwise ergodic theorem, although it was not assumed in the paper that $X_1$ is integrable.) I did not quite see how this is true, though I realized that the proof will hold even without the ergodic theorem if my question is answered to be true.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'random-variables']"
3959068,When can the local orientation of the sphere bundle piece together?,"In Bott's ""differential forms in algebraic topology"", it is said that the orientation of a sphere bundle is equivalent to say there is an open cover $\{ U_\alpha\} $ on base space $M$ (we assume $M $ is a smooth manifold and the sphere bundle $E$ is $n$ -dimensional) and generators $\{ [\sigma_\alpha]\in H^n(E|_{U_\alpha})\} $ such that $\ [\sigma_\alpha]=[\sigma_\beta]$ in $\ H^n(E|_{U_\alpha \cap U_\beta})$ and each generates the cohomology of the fiber when restricted on each fiber. Then the caveat in the book said the cohomology class $\ [\sigma_\alpha]$ agree on the overlap doesn't mean they piece together to get a global cohomology class on $M$ . In fact, the context in the book then investigates the condition when it can piece to get a global cohomology class on $M$ : the Euler class $\ e(E) \in H^{n+1}(M)$ vanishes. But according to the Mayer-Vietoris sequence on the sphere bundle: $$\ 0\to \Omega^*(E|_{U_{\alpha\cup\beta}}\space) \to  \Omega^*(E|_{U_{\alpha}}\space)\bigoplus\Omega^*(E|_{U_{\beta}}\space) \to\Omega^*(E|_{U_{\alpha\cap\beta}}\space)\to0$$ so there is a long exact sequence of cohomology: $$...\to H^n(E|_{U_{\alpha\cup\beta}}\space) \to H^n(E|_{U_{\alpha}}\space)\bigoplus H^n(E|_{U_{\beta}}\space) \to H^n(E|_{U_{\alpha\cap\beta}}\space)\to H^{n+1}(E|_{U_{\alpha\cup\beta}}\space)\to...$$ We then put $\ [\sigma_\alpha]$ and $\ [\sigma_\beta]$ in $$\ H^n(E|_{U_{\alpha}}\space)\bigoplus H^n(E|_{U_{\beta}}\space) $$ so if cohomology class $\ [\sigma_\alpha]$ and $\ [\sigma_\beta]$ agree on the overlap, it means it lies in the kernal of the next map, so there must exist at least one cohomology class $\ [\sigma_{\alpha\cup\beta}]$ when restricted on $\ U_\alpha$ and $\ U_\beta $ is $\ [\sigma_\alpha]$ and $\ [\sigma_\beta]$ respectively. So we piece together $\ [\sigma_\alpha]$ and $\ [\sigma_\beta]$ with no condition. In fact, if the manifold M is compact, we can repeat this procedure to get a global cohomology class on E. It means that we can always piece together them on a compact manifold. But the Euler class of a sphere bundle on a compact manifold is not always zero. So my question is what's wrong in it? Besides, I found a similar argument in Spanier's Algebraic Topology (page 262), it said that the similar orientation class can always be pieced together. So what's the difference behind these two arguments? I'm really confusing. Thank you!","['de-rham-cohomology', 'vector-bundles', 'homology-cohomology', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
3959113,"What is the difference between ""expectation"", ""variance"" for statistics versus probability textbooks?","It seems that there are two ideas of expectation, variance, etc. going on in our world. In any probability textbook: I have a random variable $X$ , which is a function from the sample space to the real line. Ok, now I define the expectation operator, which is a function that maps this random variable to a real number, and this function looks like, $$\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n x_i p(x_i)$$ where $p$ is the probability mass function, $p: x_i \mapsto [0,1], \sum_{i = 1}^n p(x_i) = 1$ and $x_i \in \text{range}(X)$ . The variance is, $$\mathbb{E}[(X - \mathbb{E}[X])^2]$$ The definition is similar for a continuous RV. However, in statistics, data science, finance, bioinformatics (and I guess everyday language when talking to your mother) I have a multi-set of data $D = \{x_i\}_{i = 1}^n$ (weight of onions, height of school children). The mean of this dataset is $$\dfrac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i= 1}^n x_i$$ The variance of this dataset (according to "" science buddy "" and "" mathisfun dot com "" and government of Canada ) is, $$\dfrac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i= 1}^n(x_i - \sum\limits_{j= 1}^n \dfrac{1}{n} x_j)^2$$ I mean, I can already see what's going on here (one is assuming uniform distribution), however, I want an authoritative explanation on the following: Is the distinction real? Meaning, is there a universe where expectation/mean/variance... are defined for functions/random variables and another universe where expectation/mean/variance... are defined for raw data? Or are they essentially the same thing (with hidden/implicit assumption) Why is it no probabilistic assumption is made when talking about mean or variance when it comes to dealing with data in statistics or data science (or other areas of real life)? Is there some consistent language for distinguishing these two seemingly different mean and variance terminologies? For example, if my cashier asks me about the ""mean weight"" of two items, do I ask him/her for the probabilistic distribution of the random variable whose realization are the weights of these two items ( def 1 ), or do I just add up the value and divide  ( def 2 )? How do I know which mean the person is talking about?/","['statistics', 'soft-question', 'probability-theory', 'probability', 'terminology']"

3959192,Energy distance between random variable and random sample,"If $X$ and $Y$ are independent RVs we can expect $\mathbb{E}|X-Y|$ to be a measure of how ""far apart"" the variables are, but it doesn't work like a metric in the sense that its minimum is positive, attained when $Y=X'$ is an iid RV. But we can actually offset the expectation $\mathbb{E}|X-Y|$ accordingly - that is, if we pick $X'$ and $Y'$ to be iid with $X$ and $Y$ then $$ d(X,Y)^2=2\mathbb{E}|X-Y|-\mathbb{E}|X-X'|-\mathbb{E}|Y-Y'| $$ which apparently equals $$ =2\int_{\mathbb{R}} \big(F_X(t)-F_Y(t)\big)^2\,\mathrm{d}t $$ and $d(X,Y)$ is called the energy distance which measures how close $X$ and $Y$ are in distribution. Given a random variable $X$ , we can define an energy function $E(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$ to be (half the squared) energy distance between $X$ and the discrete uniform distribution on the set $\{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}$ . Then  given a random sample, i.e. $n$ RVs $X_1,\cdots,X_n$ which are iid with $X$ , we can define the energy variable $E=E(X_1,\cdots,X_n)$ , which is itself an RV. Question . Do we know anything about how $E$ is distributed? Can we calculate it explicitly, or any nice statistics (like mean, median, etc.) for particular RVs $X$ ? What about good estimates? Presumably as $n\to\infty$ we have $E\to0$ in some sense, can we describe how fast and in what sense $E$ converges to $0$ (in terms of $X$ 's distribution)? If $U$ is the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$ I calculated $$ E(u_1,\cdots,u_n) = \frac{1}{12n^2}+\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n\left(u_k-\frac{2k-1}{2n}\right)^2 $$ where $0<u_1<\cdots<u_n<1$ . This tells us $E_{\mathrm{min}}=\frac{1}{12n^2}$ is attained when $u_k=\frac{2k-1}{2n}$ , and possibly $E_{\mathrm{max}}$ is attained when $u_k=1$ , though it seems too difficult to find $F_E(e)$ for the median, although the mean looks calculable, albeit with a pretty large formula. Edit . Intuitively, a point-set being in a narrower range should make $E$ larger, so we should expect $E_\mathrm{min}$ to not occur at a boundary point, so we can find it by solving $\nabla E=0$ , which occurs at the vector $\vec\alpha$ for which $F_X(\alpha_k)=\frac{2k-1}{2n}$ for $k=1,\cdots,n$ . Then we may integrate $\nabla E$ from $\vec\alpha$ to $\vec x$ to obtain a generalized energy formula: $$ E-E_{\mathrm{min}}=\frac{2}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n \int_{\alpha_k}^{x_k}(x_k-u)f_X(u)\,\mathrm{d}u. $$ Plugging order statistics $X_{(k)}$ into this doesn't seem very amenable but it's a nice formula.","['statistics', 'probability-theory']"

I know that the statement $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k-1} e^{-2k^2 x^2} \to \frac12, x\to 0$ follows from properties of theta-functions, but the question is about simple methods.

So we have a set and we want to find all the subsets  either with the lexicographic oder or with Gray code and then we search for a specific subset and the position is the rank? $$$$ EDIT: The subset $T \subseteq S$ can de described by the vector $x(T)$ of length $n$ where at each position there is $1$ if the respective element is contained, $0$ else. As for Gray Code : It is defined recursively as follows. We start with $G^1=[0,1]$ . in each of the next levels we take the previous one with a $0$ at the beginning and we add the previous one reversely with $1$ at the beginning, e.g. $G^2=[00,01,11,10]$ , etc. For the algorithms ranking and unranking we consider the relation between Gray Code and the binary representation. The bits $b_i$ of Gray Code is $1$ if at the binary representation the bits $b_i$ and $b_{i+1}$ are different. For the ranking we take the bits from the most important to the less important and where the respective element that we check contains in the subset we reverse the bit b (initially $0$ ). At each bit that is one we augment also the rank. For the unranking we take the binary representation of rank and we add to the subset the elements for those that the consecutive bits were different.","['gray-code', 'combinatorics', 'computer-science']"

The first thing that baffled me is that if I want to disprove this, I have to give a counterexample, but to do that, I need to give a partial order over $X$ , only I don't know what $X$ is. On the other hand, to prove that this is a poset, I've tried showing that it's antisymmetric to no avail, and got stuck on that front.
for example: $let\,\, R_1,R_2\in\mathcal{R}\,    such\  that\,     R_{1} \sqsubseteq R_{2}$ By the assumption, for all $x,y$ the condition is satisfied, in particular for $\hat{x} ,\hat{y} \in X\ \left(\hat{x} R_{1}\hat{y} \ \rightarrow \hat{x} R_{2}\hat{y}\right)$ then in order for $R_{2} \sqsubseteq R_{1}\,$ to also occur, the condition must also apply for all $x,y\,$ , in particular $\hat{x} R_{2}\hat{y} \ \rightarrow \hat{x} R_{1}\hat{y}$ But this is where I got stuck, I can't seem to get to a conclusion from this point.

Further we have $\pi^{0}=1,\; S^{0}=1+r$ , as the $0-$ th asset is risk-free.

3959747,Identification of ends of Bruhat-Tits Tree,"I am trying to understand why a canonical identification exists between the ""ends"" or ""rays"" of the Bruhat-Tits tree defined on $\mathbb{Z}_p$ -lattices (with metric invariant under the action of $PGL(2,\mathbb{Q}_p)$ ) and $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{Q}_p)=\mathbb{Q}_p\cup\{\infty\}$ . I have consulted several online references on the Bruhat-Tits tree, all of which more or less avoid constructing the actual identification. Intuitively, I see that since any vertex in the tree has $p+1$ neighbors, a path that travels outwards without backtracking should correspond to a $p$ -adic number - for instance, if $p=2$ , you could label a path and end up with some binary string such as $0101010011...$ , which can be converted into a $2$ -adic by using the 0s and 1s as coefficients of a formal Laurent series. I am unsure, however, of what the end that corresponds to $\infty$ should look like, as well as how the exact identification between a path and a $p$ -adic would work - given a binary string, for instance, how would we know which power of $p$ would be the starting point? I am also unsure of what the implications of there being $p+1$ choices for the first outgoing edge are. Edit: After thinking further on the matter, I've realized that the $p+1$ -th edge (i.e. the ""extra"" one at your starting point) can be used to denote elements of $\mathbb{Q}_p\setminus\mathbb{Z}_p$ , by letting ""extra edge followed by $n$ zeroes"" denote multiplication of the subsequent binary sequence by $p^{-n-1}$ . So any path that does not travel through the extra edge initially simply belongs to $\mathbb{Z}_p$ , and I can identify $\infty$ with the path that goes through the extra edge and is followed by infinite 0s (since this one seems to be degenerate/lack interpretation via the above). Feedback on this identification and whether it is correct/can be made more precise would be appreciated.","['bruhat-tits-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'group-theory', 'p-adic-number-theory']"

My question is: how do we visually interpret this in terms of the graphs of $f$ and $g$ ? Does this mean that the graphs of $f$ and $g$ get closer to each other as $x$ gets larger and larger? My only intuition for this comes from the following example: we know that $\sin x \sim x$ as $x \to 0$ (since $\lim_{x \to 0} (\sin x)/x = 1$ ). And as we can see below, the graphs of $\sin x$ (the green line) and $x$ (the black line) get closer and closer as $x$ goes to $0$ . But this intuition does not seem to hold for functions asymptotically equivalent at $\infty$ . I graphed $x^2 + x$ (black line) and $x^2$ (green line) and their graphs do not appear to be getting closer at all! In fact, it looks like there's a ""gap"" between the two graphs. This leads me to believe that I'm not interpreting ""asymptotically equivalent"" in the right way. I've come across the idea that $f \sim g$ means that $f$ and $g$ have the ""same rate of growth"", but that feels very unintuitive for me. Is there are a way to see that in the graphs?

3959775,Bound for order of a group depending on number of elements of maximal order,"In a paper On the Number of Elements of maximal order in a Group it is proven that an arbitrary group $G$ with a finite number of elements of maximal order has bounded size. Namely: $$|G|\leq\frac{mk^2}{\varphi(m)},$$ where $m$ is the maximal order and $k$ the number of elements that have order $m$ . I wanted to characterize all groups $G$ , where the limit is sharp, i.e. $|G|=\frac{mk^2}{\varphi(m)}$ . Using GAP I found all groups with this property up to order 1023 and was able to state a conjecture. It is easy to see in the paper, that a group has this property only if all elements of maximal order are conjugated. So we need this as as a requirement. I wanted to prove the following conjecture, but missing some tiny part. Maybe someone knows a way, I would be really happy. Conjecture. Let $G$ be a group with $k<\infty$ elements of maximal order $m$ , in which all elements of maximal order are conjugated. Then the following are equivalent. $i)$ $|G|=\frac{mk^2}{\varphi(m)}$ $ii)$ $k=\varphi(m)$ $iii)$ $G$ has a unique subgroup of order $m$ $iv)$ $C_m \cong C_G(x)=C_G(y)\trianglelefteq G$ for all $x,y\in G$ with maximal order Proof. $i) \implies ii)$ This is the part, I could not prove : I only could prove, that all elements of order $m$ commute: Let $C_G(x)$ be the stabilizer of an element of maximal order. Orbit-Stabilizer-Theorem tells us, that $|C_G(x)|=\frac{mk}{\varphi(m)}$ . Assume there exists an element of order $m$ , not contained in $C_G(x)$ . $\langle x \rangle$ operates via left-multiplication on $C_G(x)$ . $C_G(x)$ is partitioned into $\frac{|C_G(x)|}{m}$ orbits. According to Lemma 3 of  the paper linked above, in each orbit exist at least $\varphi(m)$ elements of order $m$ , i.e. in $C_G(x)$ exist at least $\varphi(m)\frac{|C_G(x)|}{m}$ elements of order $m$ . Our assumption tells us $\varphi(m)\frac{|C_G(x)|}{m} < k$ , which leads to the contradiction $|C_G(x)| < \frac{mk}{\varphi(m)}$ . It follows that all elements of order $m$ commute. This is where I can't proceed further. Maybe someone has an idea? $ii) \iff iii)$ If $k=\varphi(m)$ , an element of order $m$ generates a cyclic subgroup which contains $\varphi(m)$ elements of order $m$ , that all generate this subgroup. So there can't be other elements of order $m$ in different subgroups. Otherwise, if there is only one cyclic subgroup of order $m$ , then it contains $\varphi(m)$ elements of order $m$ , no additional elements of order $m$ can exist, as they would generate a second cyclic subgroup of order $m$ . $iii) \implies iv)$ Let $Z$ be the unique subgroup of order $m$ and $X=\{x_1,\dots,x_k\}$ the set of elements of order $m$ . As all $x\in X$ generate $Z$ , $Z$ must be contained in all centralizers of elements in $X$ . Note that $G$ operates on itself via conjugation. Orbit-Stabilizer-Theorem tells us for $x \in X$ : $$|G|=|^Gx||G_x|=k|G_x|=\frac{mk^2}{\varphi(m)}=mk$$ This follows as all elements of order $m$ are conjugated and $k=\varphi(m)$ holds. It follows, that $|G_x|=m$ , which leads to $G_x=Z\cong C_m$ for all $x \in X$ . For the normal subgroup part, note that $\phi(x_i)=x_j$ for an inner automorphism $\phi$ and $i,j\in \{1,\dots k\}$ . Let $y \in Z$ arbitrary, then $y=x_1^\alpha$ for $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}$ . Let $\phi$ be an arbitrary inner automorphism. It follows that there is a $i \in \{1,\dots k\}$ with $$\phi(y)=\phi(x_1^\alpha)=\phi(x_1)^\alpha=x_i^\alpha \in Z$$ It follows that $Z$ is invariant under inner automorphisms, i.e. normal. $iv) \implies i)$ Orbit-Stabilizer-Theorem tells us that $|G|=|^Gx||G_x|=mk$ . As all stabilizers of elements of order $m$ are equal to the same cyclic group of order $m$ , it follows, that there exist only one cyclic group of order $m$ , it follows $k=\varphi(m)$ and $|G|=mk=\frac{mk^2}{\varphi(m)}$ .

The conventions in the notation are $N$ is the normal to the surface $T_\alpha, N_\alpha, B_\alpha$ are thr tangent normal and binormal to the curve. $k_1, k_2$ are the principal curvatures of the surface at the evaluated point. $k$ is used to denote curvature. So far I have this: My Work The curve $\alpha$ is an assymptotic curve, which means that at $P \in \alpha$ the normal curvature is 0, so: $\langle N, kN_\alpha \rangle  = 0$ $N$ is a unit length vector orthogonal to $T_\alpha$ and $N_\alpha$ the tangent and normal vectors to the curve, so: $N = T_\alpha \times N_\alpha = B_\alpha \iff N' = \tau N_\alpha$ .

I don't know how that above relationship was derived, I am looking for the proof that indeed: $|N'^2| = k_1^2\cos^2(\theta) + k_2^2\sin^2(\theta)$ As I failed to derive it on my own. Solution (with doubt) I managed to finish the proof by leveraging something I saw in the proof for Euler's theorem: By Euler's theorem: $k_n = \langle dN_p(v), v \rangle = k_1\cos^2(\theta) + k_2\sin^2(\theta)$ . But more importantly: $dN_p(v) = k_1e_1\cos(\theta) + k_2e_2\sin(\theta)$ So $N'\cdot N' = k_1^2\cos^2(\theta) + k_2^2\sin^2(\theta)$ By the fact the curve is assymptotic we get $N\cdot N_\alpha = 0 = k_1\cos^2(\theta) + k_2\sin^2(\theta)$ So $\cos^2(\theta) = -k_2\sin^2(\theta) / k_1$ and $\sin^2(\theta) = -k_1\cos^2(\theta) / k_2$ . And thus: $N'\cdot N' = k_1^2\frac{-k_2\sin^2(\theta)}{k_1} + k_2^2\frac{k_1\cos^2(\theta)}{k_2} = k_1k_2\sin^2(\theta) + -k_1k_2\cos^2(\theta) = -k_1k_2$ So $\tau^2 = -k_1k_2$ I am still however not satisfied with my work, because I have no idea why this holds: $$dN_p(v) = k_1e_1\cos(\theta) + k_2e_2\sin(\theta)$$","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

3959935,Weak formulation of $\Delta^{2}u=f$ with boundary conditions $u=\Delta u =0$.,"Let $U\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be an open subset (with sufficiently smooth boundary) and consider the boundary value problem $$\begin{cases}\Delta^{2}u=f \ \text{on $U$} \\ u=\Delta u=0 \ \text{on $\partial U$} \end{cases}.$$ To find a unique weak solution, I want to apply the Riesz representation theorem or Lax-Milgram theorem to an appropriate Sobolev space. My problem is finding this appropriate Sobolev space, that is, I'm trying to find the weak formulation of the above problem. I multiplied the above equation with a sufficiently smooth test function $v$ and found that \begin{align*}
\int_{U}\Delta^{2}u \cdot v&=\int_{\partial U}\frac{\partial\Delta u}{\partial n}\cdot v-\int_{\partial U}\Delta u\cdot\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}+\int_{U}\Delta u\cdot\Delta v\\
&=\int_{\partial U}\frac{\partial\Delta u}{\partial n}\cdot v+\int_{U}\Delta u\cdot\Delta v.
\end{align*} I have seen that $H^{2}(U)\cap H_{0}^{1}(U)$ is the Sobolev space we are looking for, but how do I deduce that? Is there a general approach? Of course we need $v\in H^{2}(U)$ in order to apply $\Delta$ to it. Furthermore, it looks like we are forcing the integral on the boundary to be zero by requiring $v=0$ on $\partial U$ , i.e. $v\in H_{0}^{1}(U)$ . Also, in order to apply the above mentioned theorems, one needs $u$ and $v$ to lie in the same Sobolev space. But if $u\in H^{2}(U)\cap H_{0}^{1}(U)$ is a weak solution, then we do not have $\Delta u=0$ on $\partial U$ .","['multivariable-calculus', 'sobolev-spaces', 'partial-differential-equations', 'boundary-value-problem', 'weak-derivatives']"
3959939,Local obstruction to having a complete extension,"This question arose while I was reading Helgason's book on symmetric spaces. In chapter IV section 5, one can read the following: Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold, $p$ a point in $M$ . In general it is impossible to find any neighborhood $N$ of $p$ which can be extended to a complete Riemannian manifold $\tilde{M}$ . To me this is very surprising. This means that there are local ""obstructions"" to the existence of a complete extension, so the completeness of a manifold $M$ impacts its local geometry. My first thought was that locally, say in a chart $B(0,\varepsilon)\subset \mathbf{R}^n\to  M$ , the metric doesn't vary to much from its value at $p$ . So maybe we can extend it to a metric on $\mathbf{R}^n$ using partitions of unity and we should be able to ask that the metric is the standard metric outside a ball $B(0,\varepsilon+r)$ . If this is possible I guess it would give a complete metric on $\mathbf{R}^n$ (here I'm probably wrong). But apparently this is not going to work. Hence my question is: What are some examples of manifolds $M$ and point $p$ of $M$ such that no neighborhood of $p$ can extend to a complete manifold ? From Helgason's book I know that locally symmetric spaces have these neighborhoods that extend to a complete manifold. Any kind of help will be greatly appreciated. EDIT : In fact the argument of partition of unity works in the $C^\infty$ category. However it doesn't work if everything is assumed to be real-analytic, which seems to be the what Helgason does implicitly. So I am still interested in a detailed example in the case where everything is real analytic.","['complete-spaces', 'geodesic', 'riemannian-geometry', 'symmetric-spaces', 'differential-geometry']"
3959975,"Do closed, connected subsets of manifolds always admit open neighborhoods to which they are homotopy equivalent?","Let $M$ be a topological manifold and $C$ a closed, connected subset of $M$ . Can we always find an open neighborhood $U$ of $C$ such that the inclusion $C \to U$ is a homotopy equivalence? My thought was to take $U$ as a union of small neighborhoods around each point in $C$ and show that $U$ deformation retracts onto $C$ . However, I don't know how to make this rigorous. If we're working with smooth manifolds and $C$ a submanifold, we can just take a disk bundle of the normal bundle. But in general, $C$ may not have such a tubular neighborhood.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"
3959981,Number of homeomorphism types of separable closed subspaces of $\beta \mathbb N$.,"When thinking about subalgebras of $\ell_\infty$ , the algebra of bounded, scalar-valued, I came across the following question related to counting subalgebras with weak*-separable dual ball obtainable by restricting to closed subsets of the spectrum of $\ell_\infty$ . Let $\beta \mathbb N$ be the Čech–Stone compactification of the discrete space of natural numbers. How many pairwise non-homeomorphic closed and separable subspaces does $\beta \mathbb N$ have? Such subspaces cannot be second-countable unless finite, but there are many separable closed subspaces (take the closure of any countable subset) and there is no obvious way to classify them up to homeomorphism.","['general-topology', 'compactification', 'compactness']"
3960020,How to find the generators for $y^2 = x^3 + 5x$,"This is a problem (3.9b on pg. 113) from ""Rational Points on Elliptic Curves 2nd Edition"" by Silverman and Tate. Let $C : y^2 = x^3 + 5x$ and $\overline{C} : y^2 = x^3 -20x $ . Let $\Gamma = C(\mathbb{Q})$ and $\overline{\Gamma} = \overline{C}(\mathbb{Q})$ . In the textbook, they define the homomorphisms $\alpha : \Gamma\to \mathbb{Q}^*/{\mathbb{Q}^*}^2$ and $\overline{\alpha}: \overline{\Gamma}\to \mathbb{Q}^*/{\mathbb{Q}^*}^2$ by: $$ \alpha((x,y)) = x \mod{{\mathbb{Q}^*}^2} $$ $$ \alpha((0,0)) = 5 \mod{{\mathbb{Q}^*}^2} $$ $$ \overline{\alpha}((x,y)) = x \mod{{\mathbb{Q}^*}^2} $$ $$ \overline{\alpha}((0,0)) = -20 \mod{{\mathbb{Q}^*}^2} $$ The methodology presented in the book tells us that the rank $r$ of $C$ is equal to: $$ 2^r = \frac{\left|\alpha(\Gamma)\right|\left|\overline{\alpha}(\overline{\Gamma})\right|}{4} $$ I have found that: $$ \alpha(\Gamma) = \{ 1,5 \} \subset \mathbb{Q}^*/{\mathbb{Q}^*}^2 $$ $$ \overline{\alpha}(\overline{\Gamma}) = \{ \pm 1, \pm 5 \} \subset \mathbb{Q}^*/{\mathbb{Q}^*}^2 $$ Therefore, the rank of $C$ is $1$ . Now, for the second part of the problem it's asking us to find generators for $C(\mathbb{Q})/2C(\mathbb{Q})$ . $$ C(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Z}\times (\text{torsion subgroup}) $$ $$ C(\mathbb{Q})/2C(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\times (\text{half of torsion subgroup}) $$ The generators for ""half of torsion subgroup"" are easy to find via Nagell-Lutz.

\end{align*} by serial representations of the two Meijer G-functions on the right hand side. The finite sum on the left hand side converges for any even number $\mathscr{n}$ . The identity is a special case of a more general solution of the integral Vladimir Reshetnikov and can be derived starting from stocha - Summary (1. - 3.) - and solve the integral  with the help of the Plancherel theorem, similar to Sasha .
The more challenge is to prove the identity by a serial representation of the right hand side of \eqref{eq:1}. As a result new series representations of each Meijer G function follow, respectively. Introduction: For a more general discussion the representation of the Meijer G-functions through their generalizations - the Fox H - Functions - Mathai are needed: \begin{align*}

\end{array}\right. \right)\text{,}
\end{align*} where we used the following coefficients and indices: \begin{align*}
\left(a_1,A_1\right) = \left(\frac{1-\mathscr{n}}{2},\mathscr{n}\right),\, \left(a_n,A_n\right) = \left(a_2,A_2\right) = \left(0,1\right)

\end{align*} Besides of the identity \eqref{eq:1}, which is subject of this post, other interesting unknown identities arise from the discussion in stocha and especially the interesting answer Somos . An asymptotic expansion of $\mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})}$ and $\mathcal{H_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}$ may also give more insight in the approximations of Claude Leibovici . Moreover the study of the Mellin transformation of $\mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})}$ and $\mathcal{H_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}$ is a valuable
replenishment to the paper ""Evaluation of a class of definite integrals"" by M.L. Glasser (Univ. Beograd. Publ. Elektrotehn. Fak. Ser. Mat. Fiz.76,498-No.541(1975), 49-50.) Since the argument of the Fox H-functions are equal to 1, we can use Mathai and write $\mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})}$ and $\mathcal{H_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}$ in different forms: \begin{align*}
\mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})} = H_{3,3}^{3,2}\left( 1\left\vert \tag{4}\label{eq:4}

\\ 
\left(b_q + 1,\frac{B_q}{k}\right)
\end{array}\right. \right)
\end{align*} where $k > 0$ Attempt at a solution: For the prove we followed two ways: The first way is to express the Fox H - Functions $\mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})}$ and $\mathcal{H_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}$ in serial representation Mathai , take advantage of the fact, that the poles of $\Gamma \left(1-a_j+s A_j\right)$ at least for $\mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})}$ are simple and receive an infinite sum: \begin{align}
\mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})} = (-1)^{\frac{\mathscr{n}}{2}} \,\pi \,\log\left(2\right) + \frac{1}{\mathscr{n}}\,\sum _{\nu =0}^{\infty } (-1)^{\nu } \,\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{\mathscr{n} - 2\,\nu -1}{2\,\mathscr{n} }\right) \Gamma\left(1 + \nu\right) \Gamma\left(\frac{1 + \mathscr{n} + 2\,\nu }{2\, \mathscr{n} }\right)^2}{\nu ! \,\Gamma\left(\frac{1 + 3 \,\mathscr{n} + 2 \,\nu }{2\, \mathscr{n} }\right)}  \tag{5}\label{eq:5}
 \end{align} \begin{align*}
= (-1)^{\frac{\mathscr{n}}{2}} \,\pi \,\log\left(2\right) + 2 \pi \, \sum _{\nu =0}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^{\nu }\, \sec\left(\pi\,\frac{1+2\,\nu }{2\, \mathscr{n} }\right)}{1 + \mathscr{n} + 2 \,\nu }
 \end{align*} It turned out, that the equivalent sum for $\mathcal{H_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}$ in contrast do not converge. Therefore we use the series representations of the Meijer G function Mathematical Functions Site , which do converge: \begin{align}
\mathcal{G_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})} = \sum _{k=1}^{\mathscr{n}+1} \frac{\left(\left(\prod _{j=1,j\neq k}^{\mathscr{n}+1}  \Gamma \left(a_k-a_j\right)\right) \prod _{j=1}^{\mathscr{n}+2} \Gamma\left(1+b_j-a_k\right)\right)}{\Gamma\left(1+a_{\mathscr{n}+2}-a_k\right)}\,_{\mathscr{n}+2}F_{\mathscr{n}+1}(\left\{1+b_{1}-a_k,\ldots ,1+b_{\mathscr{n}+2}-a_k\right\},  \tag{6}\label{eq:6}

\end{align*} Note that $b_{1} = b_{2}=0$ , $a_{\mathscr{n}+1} = 0$ , $a_{\mathscr{n}+2} = 1$ , $a_j = b_{j+2},\,j = 1,\ldots,n$ and \begin{align}
\frac{{\Gamma\left(1-a_{\mathscr{n}+1}\right)}^2}{\Gamma\left(2-a_{\mathscr{n}+1}\right)} = \frac{\Gamma\left(2-a_{\mathscr{n}+1}\right)}{{\left(a_{\mathscr{n}+1}-1\right)}^2}\tag{7}\label{eq:7}\\

\end{align} Note that $a_{\mathscr{n}+1} = 0$ . For further simplifications we have to express the coefficients $a_k$ and $a_j$ as function of $\mathscr{n}$ \begin{align}
a_j\left(\mathscr{n}\right) = \frac{1-\mathscr{n}}{2 \mathscr{n}}+\frac{j-1}{\mathscr{n}}\quad a_k\left(\mathscr{n}\right) = \frac{1-\mathscr{n}}{2 \mathscr{n}}+\frac{k-1}{\mathscr{n}} \tag{11}\label{eq:11}

\end{align} The simplification of the first product in \eqref{eq:6} seems to be very difficult, since the sign in the gamma function for some coefficients is negative.  The same derivations have to be done similar for $\mathcal{G_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}$ . We find a definite sum over $\mathscr{n}$ as expected, but make no progress at this point at all.

Let $f$ be such a polynomial. The answer here suggests showing that linear functions are continuous (easy) and that the composition of continuous functions is continuous (easy). However - and perhaps it's because I've been looking at this stuff too long - I fail to see why $$\begin{align}
p_0(x) &= a_n \\
p_1(x) &= xp_0(x) + a_{n-1} \\
p_2(x) &= xp_1(x) + a_{n-2} \\

Let's suppose I have a function $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $g(y) = cy + d$ for some $c, d \in \mathbb{R}$ fixed. I have shown that $g$ is continuous. If I assume $c = x$ and $d = a_{n-1}$ , then I get $g(p_0(x)) = xp_0(x) + a_{n-1}$ . However, while setting $d = a_{n-1}$ seems like fair game (they are both constants), $x$ is definitely not a constant, so I don't feel comfortable setting $c = x$ .

3960167,Problems to understand the definition of the level of significance $\alpha$,"I'm having problems to understand the definition of the level of significance $\alpha$ . I thought I knew what $\alpha$ is but I realized I don't. When I stated to study statistics by myself I read this introductory book and everything was fine, the definition is very clear. He says on page 290: You’re probably wondering, how small does a p-value have to be for us
to achieve statistical significance? If we agree that a p-value of $0.0001$ is clearly statistically significant and a p-value of $0.50$ is not, there must be some point between $0.0001$ and $0.50$ where we cross
the threshold between statistical significance and random chance. That
point, measuring when something becomes rare enough to be called
“unusual,” might vary a lot from person to person. We should agree in
advance on a reasonable cutoff point. Statisticians call this cutoff
point the significance level of a test and usually denote it with the
Greek letter $\alpha$ (alpha) . For example, if $\alpha = 0.05$ we say we are doing
a $5\%$ test and will call the results statistically significant if the
p-value for the sample is smaller than $0.05$ . Often, short hand
notation such as $P < 0.05$ is used to indicate that the p-value is less
than $0.05$ , which means the results are significant at a $5\%$ level. Now, I'm studying about statistical inference, a more advanced subject, and I realized there are some concepts that don't exactly have the same definition as I studied before. The level of significance is an example. I'm reading this book and on page 352 he introduces the Neyman-Pearson lemma as a method to find the UMP test . Example: On the basis of a random sample of size $1$ from the p.d.f. $f(x;
 \theta)=\theta x^{\theta-1},\ 0 < x < 1\ (\theta > 1)$ : For $\theta_1>\theta_0$ , the cutoff point is calculated by: ... $C=(1−\alpha)^{\frac{1}{\theta_0}}$ For $\theta_1<\theta_0$ , we have: ... $C = \alpha^{\frac{1}{\theta_0}}$ So in this second book, the cutoff point is not necessarily $\alpha$ , I'm confused. MY ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND WITH THE HELP OF THE ANSWERS The alpha is predetermined, but it doesn't mean I can't have a smaller rejection region. Then I end up having a smaller rejection region using NP lemma with the same level of significance alpha. Some introductory books let the cutoff point to be $\alpha$ by standard (why?), that's the reason of my confusion, I can shrink the rejection region keeping the value of $\alpha$ . Can someone say if I'm right?","['statistical-inference', 'statistics', 'hypothesis-testing']"

It makes sense to me that around a zero of order $n$ , the polynomial should look like $z^n$ -- that is, there should be $n$ yellow lines emanating from that point.

Find the last two digits of: $$\sum_{n=3}^{2019} f(n)$$ Can someone verify this ? I think $(n-3)$ works, and I posted it in AOPS, but the guy is saying that it is wrong. Here's the solution: Answer : $36$ , $f(n)=n-3 $ clearly for any $n , n-2$ doesn't satisfy because then equiangular property fixes the polygon. For $n=3, 4$ , clearly $f(n)=n-3$ works .
For $n\ge 5$ , consider the following construction , which i took for $n=7$ ,( but one can understand what's the construction) . It's just extending $2$ sides and making a parallel side . So $n-3$ consecutives doesn't fix. So $n-3$ works . And answer is $\frac{2016\cdot 2017}{2}=2033136 \equiv 36 \pmod {100}$ Here's the other guy's solution, which many people are saying it to be true :
Equilateral triangle which is regular, square but we can have a rectangle, pentagon where all it's sides are equal and so on. Then I see a pattern. This was the crucial observation. In Euclidean Geometry, if we have an equiangular polygon with odd sides then it's all the sides will be equal, i.e it will be a regular polygon. So, we have the regular polygons with side lengths $3,5,\cdots$ and so on. Here, in this case we can choose only one of it's side length and all the side lengths will be automatically chosen since it is an equiangular and hence regular polygon. Therefore, $f(n)=\boxed{1}$ , in the case when we have an equiangular polygon with odd sides.
Now, we see what happens when we choose an equiangular polygon with odd sides, so we can choose half of the sides of the polygon(these needs to be consecutive sides). Therefore $f(n)=\frac{n}{2}$ in the case where $n=\text{even}$ . $\text{Sum}=(1+2)+(1+3)+(1+4)+\cdots+(1+1009)+1=510553 $ . Therefore Last two digits of the sum $\boxed{53}$ .

3960570,"Injection between posets $(\Phi([-1,1]^d)\setminus\{\emptyset\},\subseteq)$ and $(\{-, 0,+\}^d,\preceq)$, where $-\preceq 0$ and $+\preceq 0$.","Let $(\{-, 0,+\}, \preceq)$ be the poset defined by the relations $-\preceq 0$ and $+\preceq 0$ and let $\left(\{-, 0,+\}^d, \preceq\right)$ be its $d$ -fold product. Show that: $$
(\Phi([-1,1]^d)\setminus\{\emptyset\},\subseteq)\cong(\{-, 0,+\}^d,\preceq),
$$ where $\Phi([-1,1]^d)$ is the face lattice of the $d$ -dimensional cube. I have an idea of what the isomorphism would be, but I cannot yet prove that it’s injective. First, a remark is that, since the product of posets is a binary operation, the elements of $(\{-, 0,+\}^d, \preceq)$ technically have a lot of extra parentheses, which could be omitted without losing any important information. So, for example, instead of $((0,+),-)$ , we’d simply have $(0,+,-)$ . Let $F \in \Phi([-1,1]^d)$ denote a face of the cube, and in particular let $v$ denotes a vertex. Then the mapping I’m thinking of is defined as: \begin{align}
&\phi:(\Phi([-1,1]^d)\setminus\{\emptyset\},\subseteq)\to(\{-, 0,+\}^d,\preceq) \\
&\phi(F) = (\text{sgn}(\sum_{v_i \in F}v_{i1}),…,\text{sgn}(\sum_{v_i \in F}v_{id}))
\end{align} i.e. we look at the vertices contained in $F$ , summing up their entries component-wise, and then taking their signs. Now I want to show that this map is injective. Given two faces $F_1$ and $F_2$ such that $\phi(F_1) = \phi(F_2)$ , it’s sufficient to show that a vertex $v_i = (v_{i1},…,v_{id})$ in $F_1$ is also in $F_2$ (and vice versa). Consider an entry $j$ in $\phi(F_1) = \phi(F_2) \in \{-, 0,+\}^d$ . If $F_1$ and $F_2$ contain just one vertex, then this entry determines exactly the sum at position $j$ of the vertices in $F_1$ and $F_2$ , respectively (namely, the “sum” of just one summand, resulting in value $-1$ or $1$ ). If $F_1$ and $F_2$ both contain $2^m$ vertices, then we can continue in an inductive fashion to show that the summands that result in the $j$ entry of $\phi(F_1)$ and $\phi(F_2)$ match each other one by one: in summing the $m$ entries in the $j$ -th position of vertices in $F_1$ and those in $F_2$ , assuming that the partial sums up to a certain position $n < m$ match, then the $j$ entry of $\phi(F_1)$ and $\phi(F_2)$ determines what the value of the next summands must be. Of course, this only works if $F_1$ and $F_2$ have the same number of vertices. I got stuck here since I can’t show that given $\phi(F_1) = \phi(F_2)$ , it cannot be the case that $F_1$ contains $m$ vertices, and $F_2$ contains $m’$ vertices, where $m \neq m’$ . Edit: I’ve found another map, which might be easier to check for the properties of an isomorphism. It’s not yet entirely rigorous, but I’m just putting it here for comments. For $F \in \Phi([-1,1]^d), \ \phi(F) = (u_1,…u_d) := u \in (\{-, 0,+\}^d, \preceq)$ , where $u$ satisfies the following: $\cdot$ $u$ has |dim( $F$ )| $0$ ’s, at positions corresponding to the axes of $\mathbb{R}^d$ that $F$ is “parallel” to. $\cdot$ The other positions in $u$ correspond to the remaining axes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ , have values either $1$ or $-1$ , depending whether $F$ lies in the positive or negative side of those axes, respectively.","['order-theory', 'solution-verification', 'combinatorics', 'lattice-orders']"

Show that $L/K$ only has finitely many intermediate fields $M$ . I'd like to know if my following proof is correct or how I could improve it: Suppose $L = K(\alpha)$ . For every intermediate field $M$ let $f_M \in M[X]$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $M$ . Then for every $M, M'$ we have $M \subseteq M' \iff f_M \in M'[X]$ . Now I wanna show that every $f_M$ uniquely defines the corresponding intermediate field $M$ : Let $M'$ be another intermediate field s.t $f_M \in M'[X]$ . Then by the above we have $M \subseteq M'$ and by the definition of $f_M$ and $f_{M'}$ it follows that $\deg(f_{M'}) \leq \deg(f_M)$ . Since every root of $f_{M'}$ in $M'$ is also a root of $f_M$ (I'm not sure about this one so in case this isn't necessarily true some clarification would be great!), we get $f_{M'} \mid f_M$ . However, since both polynomials are irreducible and monic, we have $f_M = f_{M'}$ which gives us $M = M'$ . Similarly we have that $f_M  \mid f_K$ in $L[X]$ for every $M$ . Now, since $L[X]$ is a UFD, we get: $$f_K = \prod_{K \subseteq M \subseteq L}f_M.$$ Since this factorization is unique and all factors are monic and irreducible there are no units in the product so we get: $$\deg(f_K) = \sum_{K \subseteq M \subseteq L}\deg(f_M) = n$$ which means there are only finitely many intermediate fields.","['field-theory', 'minimal-polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'extension-field']"

But not convinced fully. Thus we can use Cauchy's Condensation test, considering $f(n)=\frac{(\log n)^{k}}{n^{a}}$ . $\begin{aligned} 2^{n} f\left(2^{n}\right)=& \frac{2^{n}\left(\log 2^{n}\right)^{k}}{\left(2^{n}\right)^{a}}=\frac{\sin n^{k}(\log 2)^{k}}{2^{n(a-1)}} \\ &=\frac{n^{k} c}{2^{d n}} ; \text { where }\left(\log {2}\right)^{k}=c \text { finite constant }, d=a-1>0 \text { finite constant .}\end{aligned}$ Now, $\sum f(n)$ converges iff $\sum 2^{n} f\left(2^{n}\right)$ converges
iff $\sum \frac{n^{k}}{2^{d n}}$ converges.
By Ratio test the last series converges and hence the result. For part b) I can see that $h(x)=\frac{1}{n^{x}}=n^{-x}$ then $h'(x)=-n^{-x}\log n$ and $h''(x)=n^{-x}(\log n)^2$ and so on.

Since $\vert\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\vert =p$ , that gives the result. But this doesn't seem to extend to the $p$ -adic case. $\mathbb{Z}_p^n$ doesn't look like a lattice to me, and even if it were, I'm not sure how to relate the volume to the number of points in it. Maybe I could argue that $\mathbb{Z}$ is a subring of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ , and that $\mathbb{Z}_p/p\mathbb{Z}_p$ can take representatives of each coset from $\mathbb{Z}$ , so I can treat $\mathcal{O}_K/\pi\mathcal{O}_K$ as a $\mathbb{Z}$ -module.

This is a homomorphism, since it obeys the relations $\varphi(p) + \varphi(q) = \varphi(p+q)$ and $\varphi(p) \cdot \varphi(q) = \varphi(p \cdot q)$ for all $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]$ (verifying these is quite trivial). Now take any $q \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and define a $p \in \mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]$ such that $p(x,y,z) = q(x)$ . Since $\varphi(p(x,y,z)) = p(x,x,x^3) = q(x)$ , $\varphi$ is surjective and it follows that $\mathbb{Z}[x] \subseteq \varphi(\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z])$ . It is obvious that $\varphi(\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]) \subseteq \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and, therefore, we must have $\varphi(\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]) = \mathbb{Z}[x]$ . Lastly, we must show that $\ker(\varphi) = (x-y, x^3-z)$ . For brevity's sake I will denote $I := (x-y,x^3-z).$ Let $p \in I$ . Then there must exist $q_1, q_2 \in \mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]$ such that $p = q_1(x-y) + q_2(x^3-z)$ . It follows that: \begin{align*}\varphi(p(x,y,z)) &= \varphi(q_1(x,y,z)(x-y) + q_2(x,y,z)(x^3-z))\\ &= q_1(x,x,x^3)(x-x) + q_2(x,x,x^3)(x^3-x^3) = 0.\end{align*} Thus $p \in \ker(\varphi)$ and $I \subseteq \ker(\varphi)$ , since $p$ was chosen arbitrarily in $I$ . Now, take a $q \in \ker(\varphi)$ . Then $\varphi(q(x,y,z)) = q(x,x,x^3) = 0$ . Somehow we must get that $q \in I$ so that we can conclude $\ker(\varphi) \subseteq I$ and thus $I = \ker(\varphi)$ , but I seem to get stuck on every path. Proof by contradiction or by contraposition also seems fruitless. What am I missing? With all of the above, we may apply the first isomorphism theorem to conclude that: $$\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]/I = \mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]/\ker(\varphi) \cong \varphi(\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]) = \mathbb{Z}[x]$$","['ring-isomorphism', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomial-rings']"

3961057,formula for relating number of successes to number of tries,"Imagine we have a jar of marbles, where there are 10 different colors of marbles in the jar.
Let N be the number of marbles drawn in a sample and
K be the number of distinct colors in the sample.
Let C be the total number of colors in the jar (which is 10 in this example). We know that:
K = F(C,N) + chance. Intuitively, the more marbles we draw at a time, the more colors we are likely to obtain, up to the maximum. This strikes me as a binomial. I am looking for a formula to express in more detail how
K = F(C,N).
An obvious feature is that C is the maximum value. So I figure this is a model where K is an increasing proportion of C as N increases. I already know how to simulate the data, but wish to provide an expression of K depending on C and N. Any suggestions will be appreciated. Simulated data for the situation I intend will be as follows. I assume sampling with replacement. For this example, we have 10 colors in the jar (C=10). Note that we start by drawing one marble from the jar, which gives us a sample where N=1 and K=1. The number of colors found in a sample depends on the size of the sample. In this case it is seq(1:20). In this particular simulation, we have an equal representation for each color. The snip of R code I use to simulate the data is: ###snip of modified code for stack exchange exchange T <- c(1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10) for (i in 1:N){ for (s in 1:n.sims) { plot.sample <- sample(T, size=N[i]) K[s,i] <- length(unique(plot.sample)) } } Note that the line is just a loess plot at this point and the proper function would level off at C, the maximum number of colors. If I use the suggested formula
K=N*C/(N+C-1)

Take this away from the total amount of triangles $\frac{12C3\cdot9C3}{2}=9240$ gives the correct answer 6468. However , just for practice how would you calculate this from scratch without using the non-overlapping triangles? I think my attempt is very close but I'm not getting the answer: Choose the first triangle first by pinning down and disregarding any two distinct points from the circle effectively dividing it into two segments (major and minor). In this case to make it systematic, choose them 4 points apart (that is the minimum because 3 points apart will not work as they will not overlap) Then select one point in the minor segment to complete the triangle $**2C1**$ To make the other triangle, select another point in the minor segment to ensure overlapping $**1C1**$ To complete the other triangle, select two more points from the major segment $**8C2**$ Now repeat this process by gradually increasing the gap between the pinned-down points so you have $$\frac{(2C1\cdot1C1\cdot8C2+3C1\cdot2C1\cdot7C2+4C1\cdot3C1\cdot6C2+5C1\cdot4C1\cdot5C2+6C1\cdot5C1\cdot4C1+7C1\cdot6C1\cdot3C2+8C1\cdot7C1\cdot2C2)}{2}\cdot12 = 5442$$ The answer is 6468 Edit: the triangles are selected from distinct points (no repetition between the two triangles)",['combinatorics']
3961162,Help with understanding Duffing's oscillator,"I'm working through some notes regarding analysis of some weakly perturbed oscillators. Among these is Duffing's oscillator which is governed by $$ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2}+y+\epsilon y^3=0, \; \; 0<\epsilon << 1 $$ Now to leading we have \begin{align*}
   \frac{d^2y_0}{dt^2}+y_0=0
 \end{align*} with general solution $$ y_0 = a\cos t + b \sin t$$ which can be written w.l.o.g as $ y_0 = c \cos(t+\phi), \; \; c>0$ . So far so good. But now to understand the nature of the perturbation the notes make use of the Poincare-Lindstedt method, which relies on the observation that the period of the perturbed oscillator is $$2\pi(1+o(1))$$ as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ . Here is my first question: how exactly was this observation made? Next we define $Y(\tau; \epsilon) = y(t; \epsilon)$ where $\tau = t/\chi(\epsilon)$ and $\chi(\epsilon)$ is such that $Y$ is $2\pi$ periodic in $\tau$ . Then, expanding $Y$ and $\chi$ in powers of $\epsilon$ we have $$Y(\tau;\epsilon) \sim Y_0(\tau;\epsilon)+\epsilon Y_1(\tau;\epsilon)+...$$ and $$\chi(\epsilon) \sim 1+\epsilon\chi_1 + \epsilon^2\chi_2+...$$ Here the $Y_i$ are $2\pi$ periodic in $\tau$ . To leading order the solution has the same form, $Y_0 = a\cos(\tau + \phi)$ . Going up to first order in $\epsilon$ , we have \begin{align*}
\frac{d^2Y_1}{d\tau^2} + Y_1 &= -2\chi_1Y_0-Y_0^3 \\ 
&= -2\chi_1a\cos(\tau+\phi) -\frac{a^3}{4}\left \{3\cos(\tau+\phi)+\cos\left(3(\tau+\phi)\right)\right\},
\end{align*} where we have substituted for $Y_0$ and used a Fourier expansion. Then here is where I really have trouble. At this point then notes say that in order for $Y_1$ to be $2\pi$ perioduc in $\tau$ we must eliminate $\cos(\tau+\phi)$ terms, which gives us an algebraic expression for $\chi_1$ . But why must we eliminate such terms in order for $Y_1$ to be $2\pi$ periodic? I don't understand this.","['asymptotics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'perturbation-theory']"

3961266,Existence of specific sections of vector bundles over a manifold,"I am trying to do the following exercise from Hirsch, one could say that it's 3 exercises but they are all related so I believe it's best to treat them together: Let $\xi=(E,M,p)$ be an $n$ -plane bundle over a connected $k$ -manifold $M$ . a) If $k<n$ then $\xi$ has a non-vanishing section. Here I belive the idea is just to use the transversality theorem, since we can approximate the zero section map $s$ by mapping the transversal to the zero section $h_k$ and for $h_k$ close enough we will get that $p\circ h_k$ is a diffeomorphism. So we can consider $h_k\circ (p\circ h_k)^{-1}$ , and this will be a section, transversal to the zero section. But then by a dimension argument we have to have that their intersection is empty. b) If $k=n$ and $x\in M$ then $\xi$ has a section vanishing only at $x$ . Here let's divide this into two cases. First suppose $M$ has a non-vanishing section $s$ , then we can consider a function $f:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $f^{-1}(0)=x$ , I believe this is always possible, and just consider the section $fs$ . Now from the next question $c)$ and what we just did, we can assume that $\partial M=\emptyset $ and that $M$ is compact. Now if I remove a point from $M$ I get a non-compact manifold with a non-vanishing section, to be proved, and then we can just do an analogous argument to what we just did. c) If $k=n$ , and $\partial M\neq \emptyset $ or $M$ is non-compact, then $\xi$ has a non-vanishing section. Now let's first assume that $\partial M\neq \emptyset $ and that $M$ is compact . My idea is to try and do something similiar to what was done when we proved that a compact connected manifold with boundary has a non-vanishing vector field. So let's take the double $M'$ of $M$ . This will have a section $s$ with a finite number of zeros, by an analogous argument to what we did in $a)$ , which we denote by $F$ . Here I assume I can create a vector bundle over $M'$ by just taking the fibers of the vector bundle over $M$ . I believe this is possible, but would appreciate some input. We will call this $\xi'$ . Since $M'$ is connected there is a diffeomorphism $\phi :M'\rightarrow M'$ that takes $F$ into $M-M'$ . Then we can consider the map $s\circ \phi^{-1}|M :M\rightarrow \xi'$ that has no zeros. Now I would like to have a vector bundle map that goes from $\xi'\rightarrow \xi $ and covers the identity when we restrict to $M$ . But I'm not sure if this is possible since we want this map to not create zeros from the result we get from $s\circ \phi^{-1}$ , and I'm not sure how to create a map without using some partitions of unity. Now for the non-compact case I am kinda lost, have really no ideas on what to do. I thought about using the trivializing charts and then gluing everything together with partitions of unity, but when we glue things together, how can we do it in a way that doesn't create zeros ? I don't think I can have this control. So I am out of ideas and would appreciate some input. Don't really see where I can use the non-compactness hypothesis.
