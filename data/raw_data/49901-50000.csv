509616,On finitely additive premeasures,"Any interval of the form $(a, b]$ or $(a, \infty)$ is called an $h$-interval, where $a, b\in\mathbb{R}$ (see for example, Folland [1] page 33). Let $\mathcal{A}_h$ be the set consisting of all finite unions of $h$-intervals. It is easily checked that $\mathcal{A}_h$ is an algebra. My question is this: Does there exist a finitely additive premeasure $\mu$ on
  $\mathcal{A}_h$ such that $\mu(\mathbb{R})=1$, but that $\mu$ is not
  countable additive? For the reference, a finitely additive premeasure $\mu$ on a set $X$ is defined by a map $\mu: \mathcal{A}\to [0, \infty]$ where $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ such that $\mu(\emptyset)=0$. And that we require $\mu$ to be finitely additive, i.e. $\mu(A\cup B)=\mu(A)+\mu(B)$ whenever $A, B\subseteq X$ are disjoint sets. My thoughts: The most common premeasure is $\mu = \textrm{length}$ which, by Caratheodory's Theorem extends to concept of Lebesgue measures. But here, we are interested in something pathological; we require that $\mu(\mathbb{R})=1$. Thanks! [1] Real analysis - Modern Techniques, and Their Applications by Gerald B.

509633,Gelfand Naimark Theorem,"The commutative Gelfand-Naimark theorem tells us that every unital commutative C* algebra is isometrically isomorphic to the space of continuous functions on its maximal ideal space. The non- commutative GNS construction, on the other hand, tells us that every C* algebra is isometrically embedded into a * subalgebra of $\mathfrak{B}(\mathbb{H})$ for some Hilbert space $\mathbb{H}$. My question is the following: how does the commutative case fit into the non commutative one? I could see that given a commutative C* algebra $C(X)$, where $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space, one can find a non zero positive linear functional $F$ on $C(X)$ such that $F(e)=1$, where $e$ is the identity function on $C(X)$. Then using Riesz Representation theorem, one can find a corresponding Borel $\sigma$ algebra on $X$ and a unique probability measure $\mu$ such that $F(f)=  \int f\,d\mu \quad \forall f\in C(X)$. From here it is easy to deduce that $C(X)$ is isometrically embedded into a * subalgebra of $\mathfrak{B}(\mathcal{L^2}(X,\mu))$ via multiplication operators. My question is: Is there a canonical way of finding such a probability measure? Clearly if we choose a different positive linear functional, we get a different probability measure. So is there some unique/ natural way of doing this? Also, is this where the Hahn-Hellinger theorem comes in? I would be grateful for some clarity on this, and also references if possible.","['operator-algebras', 'functional-analysis']"

I tried to fix it with the following: Let $g_n:=f_n\chi_{P_n}\colon \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}$ measurable functions in the counting measure $\mu$ in $\mathbb{N}$ 
we have that $$g_n(k)=f_n(k)\chi_{P_n}(k)\to \frac{1}{k!}$$
for each $k\in\mathbb{N}$ and $P_n=\{1,\ldots,n\}$. But
$$|g_n(k)|\leq \frac{1}{k!}:=f(k)\quad\text{and}\quad \int_{\mathbb{N}}f(k)d\mu(k)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!}<3<\infty.$$ So by the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem, \begin{align}
\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=0}^n f_n(k)\\
&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{P_n}f_n(k)d\mu(k)\\

509646,dimension of a projective variety,"Let $Y$ be a projective variety with homogeneous coordinate ring $S(Y)$ , where $S=k[x_{0},x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}]$ and $k$ is algebraically closed. Show that $\dim S(Y)=\dim Y+1$ . My solution so far: Let $H_{i}=Z_{\mathbb{P}^{n}}(x_{i})$ . Let $U_{i}=\mathbb{P}^{n}\setminus H_{i}$ . $\phi:U_{i}\rightarrow A=k[y_{1},\dots ,y_{n}]$ is a homeopmorphism. Define $Y_{i}=\phi(Y\cap U_{i})$ . The plan is to show that $A(Y_{j})\cong (S(Y)_{x_{j}})_{0}$ (homogeneous elements of degree $0$ in the localization of $S$ ) for some $j$ . The rest of the solution follows from there. I know that there exists $j$ such that $\dim Y=\dim A(Y_{j})$ . I will assume that this $j=0$ for easy notation. $S$ is a graded ring with gradation $S=\oplus_{d\geq 0}S_{d}$ where $S_{d}$ consists of monomials of total degree $d$ . Therefore $$\displaystyle S(Y)_{x_{0}}=\bigoplus_{d\in\mathbb{Z}}(S_{x_{0}})_{d}/((S_{x_{0}})_{d}\cap I(Y)_{x_{0}}).$$ Any homogeneous element of degree $0$ has the form $f=\displaystyle \overline{\tfrac{\prod_{i\geq 1}^{n}x_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}}{x_{0}^{m}}}$ where $\sum\alpha_{i}=m$ . I will define the polynomial on top as $F$ so $f=\tfrac{\overline{F}}{x_{0}^{m}}$ . I think the appropriate map would be $\alpha:(S(Y)_{x_{0}})_{0}\rightarrow A(Y_{j})$ $f\mapsto F(1,\tfrac{x_{1}}{x_{0}},\dots ,\tfrac{x_{n}}{x_{0}})$ . My problem is I don't know if this map is well defined (i.e.) if $f=\tfrac{\overline{F}}{x_{0}^{m}}$ and $f= \tfrac{\overline{G}}{x_{0}^{m}}$ is $F(1,\tfrac{x_{1}}{x_{0}},\dots ,\tfrac{x_{n}}{x_{0}})=G(1,\tfrac{x_{1}}{x_{0}},\dots ,\tfrac{x_{n}}{x_{0}})$ .

509739,About the existence of a generic point on an irreducible closed subset of a prescheme,"This is Proposition 2 on page 81 of Mumford's The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes : Let $X$ be a prescheme, and $Z \subset X$ an irreducible closed subset. Then there is one and only one point $z \in Z$ such that $Z = \overline{\{ z \}}$ . Proof . Let $U \subset X$ be an open affine set such that $Z \cap U \neq \emptyset$ . Then any point $z \in Z$ dense in $Z$ must be in $Z \cap U$ ; and a point $z \in Z \cap U$ whose closure contains $Z \cap U$ is also dense in $Z$ . Therefore it suffices to prove the theorem for the closed subset $Z \cap U$ . But by Prop. 1 of section 4 there is a unique $z \in Z \cap U$ dense in $Z \cap U$ . I have some questions about this proof. Why does every dense point in $Z$ lie in $Z \cap U$ ? Why must $z \in Z \cap U$ whose closure contains $Z \cap U$ be dense in $Z$ ?

509788,Is there a completion of Laurent series w.r.t. integration?,"Given a Laurent series
$$f(z) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty a_k(z-z_0)^k,$$
its derivative is obviously also a Laurent series. However, upon integration, the $\frac1{z-z_0}$ term introduces a $\ln(z-z_0)$ term and therewith an essential singularity turning the integral of a Laurent series into something that generally is not a Laurent series again. So one could define a new kind of series including that $\ln$ term, and upon integration obtain another new term due to $\int\ln z\,dz = z(\ln z-1)$, or more generally, $$\int z^k\ln z\,dz = \frac{z^{k+1}[(k+1)\ln z -1]}{(k+1)^2}$$
for $k\neq-1$. So the series
$$f(z) := \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty [a_k+b_k\ln(z-z_0)](z-z_0)^k$$
with $b_{-1}=0$ is complete under both derivation and integration at the expense of introducing a branch cut and an essential singularity at $z_0$. But does such a series definition make sense? How would one obtain the coefficients $b_k$ now? For $b_{-1}\neq0$, one obtains $\int\frac{\ln z}z\,dz = \frac12\ln^2 z$, the inclusion of which requires the inclusion of $\int\ln^2z\,dz = z(\ln^2z -2\ln z+2)$ and therewith of $z^m\ln^2z$ for $m\neq-1$. And should the extended series include a $\frac{\ln^2z}z$ term, its integration would require a $\ln^3z$ term and so on, so in an even more general sense we'd have
$$f(z) := \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \sum_{l=0}^\infty c_{kl} \ln^l(z-z_0)\cdot (z-z_0)^k.$$
Now you could go on and include $l<0$ terms, but their integrals would require the inclusion of the logarithmic integral $\operatorname{li}(z-z_0)$, and integrating that would include $\operatorname{Ei}(z-z_0)$ and hypergeometric functions etc. - so, does this ever stop at a (up to powers) finite set of base functions?","['laurent-series', 'complex-analysis']"

The problem is following. It may not be accurate since the problem is dependent on my memory Let $f : [0, \infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $f$ is differentiable. $|f'(x) |\; \leq\  |f(x)|$ for all $x \in [0, \infty)$. $f(0) = 0$. Then prove that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \in [0,\infty)$. At the quiz, I applied the Mean Value Theorem and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. For any $x$, $|f(x)| = |\{f(x) - f(0)\}(x-0)| = |f'(c_{1})(x)|$ for some $c_{1} \in (0,x)$, and then 
$$|f'(c_{1})(x)| \leq |f'(c_{1})||x| \leq |f(c_{1})||x|$$ by Cauchy-Schwarz and given assumption. By doing so consecutively, we can obtain the inequality that 
$$
|f(x)| \leq |f(c_{n})||x||c_{1}|\ldots |c_{n-1}|
$$
for any $x \in [0,\infty)$. As $\{c_{i}\}, \; i\in \mathbb{N}$ is decreasing sequence and $f$ is continuous, $|f(c_{n})|$ can be arbitrary close to $0$ when $c_{n} \rightarrow 0$.

Over $\mathbf C$ , this pairing can be calculated analytically by Cauchy's Residue Theorem, but it requires ""division by $2i \pi$ ""... and somehow, we can't mimick this inside $\mathbf C_p$ ? is this right? if so, why can't we mimick it?

A column consists of one, two or three numbers and never three blanks. The columns are occupied by the number chosen from 1-9 (only nine), 10-19 (ten), 20-29 ... 70-79 and importantly 80-90 (eleven). Numbers in columns are ordered from top to bottom. How many possible unnumbered card layouts are there? How many possible numbered cards are there? I have started to approach this problem by first choosing the blanks for the first two rows and then attempting to work out a compensating row. This was hard. Next I begun to understand that there were a number of equivalence classes as columns could be reordered for the purposes producing different layouts. Next I looked into the most convoluted card which had five numbers followed by four blanks in the first row and four blanks followed five number in the second. This satisfied the ""no blank column"" requirement. Now the final row could be arranged however it wanted, though there was one confusing overlap to deal with. I considered another convoluted card which had as many columns of three as possible. It turns out it's possible have a maximum of three columns of three which also gives rise to the maximum of six columns of one. It also turns out you can have a maximum of six columns of two. I think the starting point might be to determine the classes of card initially by column combinations and then permute them. Having gotten all muddled by the layouts, I turned to the numbers. With a single number, it was one of 9, 10 or 11 depending on the column and that was easy. For the two number case, let's say with a column of ten, the first ($i$) was chosen from 9 and the next from $10-i$. It suddenly occurred to me that it was just combinations, phew. How to fit that with the whole business of column choice lost me. It seems possible that for each possible ""set"" of columns, there will be a way of determining the distribution of possible first columns and adding in an appropriate factor for the number combinations.

\Rightarrow R = \frac{r[1- \sin(\frac{\pi}{n})]}{\sin(\frac{\pi}{n})}$$ But I am not getting answer which is matching the four option as the sign in my answer is negative and in options it is positive.. please suggest where I am wrong.. thanks..","['trigonometry', 'circles']"
510732,Big O and Omega Properties,"I am trying to think of a case where this is not true: $f(n) = O(g(n))$ and $f(n) \neq \Omega(g(n))$, does $f(n) = o(g(n))$? I suspect that it has to do with the varying $c$ and $n_{0}$ constants but am not completely sure. Thanks!","['asymptotics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
