2304849,Question Regarding the Standard Picture of $K_{0}(A)$ for a C$^{*}$-Algebra $A$,"I am working through Rordam's book and I am stuck on exercise 4.4. Suppose we have a (not necessarily unital) C$^{*}$-algebra $A$. We are asked to prove that every element of $K_{0}(A)$ can be written as
$$
[p]_{0}-\left[\begin{pmatrix}1_{n} & 0_{n}\\ 0_{n} & 0_{n}\end{pmatrix}\right]_{0},
$$ 
for some projection $p\in M_{2n}(\widetilde{A})$ satisfying
$$
p-\begin{pmatrix}1_{n} & 0_{n}\\ 0_{n} & 0_{n}\end{pmatrix}\in M_{2n}(A).
$$ Following one of the proofs in the book (a quarter-way down page 64), I took an arbitrary $g\in K_{0}(A)$ and expressed it as $[e]_{0}-[f]_{0}$ for some projections $e,f\in M_{n}(\widetilde{A})$. Then, I put 
$$
p=\begin{pmatrix}1_{n}-f & 0\\ 0 & e\end{pmatrix}\qquad\text{and}\qquad q=\begin{pmatrix}1_{n} & 0_{n}\\ 0_{n} & 0_{n}\end{pmatrix}.
$$
As in the proof in the book, it follows that $g=[p]_{0}-[q]_{0}$ and that 
$$
[s(p)]_{0}=[q]_{0},
$$
where $s\colon\widetilde{A}\to\widetilde{A}$ is the map given by $s(a+\lambda\cdot1_{\widetilde{A}})=\lambda\cdot 1_{\widetilde{A}}$. So, we have $g=[p]_{0}-[s(p)]_{0}$, but to guarantee that  $p-\begin{pmatrix}1_{n} & 0_{n}\\ 0_{n} & 0_{n}\end{pmatrix}\in M_{2n}(A)$, I need $s(p)=q$, which obviously does not hold in general.

2304850,How to guess the function by its values on the mesh?,"How to guess the function by its values on the mesh? More precisely, I have the value of a function on some uniform mesh. If you plot the graph of this function by points, you get the following picture. The picture quality is poor, but I have values at 11325 points on a uniform mesh. What are the ways to guess the analytical representation of this function? My main idea is to find with some accuracy the first few coefficients of the Taylor series, to restore the exact values ​​of the coefficients and sum the series. Attempt number 1. Approximate the function by the Lagrange interpolation polynomial on a uniform mesh. This attempt failed, because on a uniform mesh the Lagrange polynomial even for small degrees (about 10) became very different from the function and had huge coefficients. Attempt number 2. The method of coordinate-wise descent for the coefficients of the interpolation polynomial. Failed, because the coefficients instantly slid into some local extremum. Attempt number 3. Approximate the function by the Lagrange interpolation polynomial on the Chebyshev mesh. I managed to approximate my function with a polynomial of degree 30 with an error of about 0.01 in the C-norm, but the coefficients again turned out to be quite large and completely different from the Taylor coefficients.

2304855,Methods to show an ideal in the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ is a proper ideal,"I was wondering if there were general ""tactics"" to show if an ideal in the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, where $K/\mathbb{Q}$ is a number field of degree $n$. For example, consider $\mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ and $P = (2,1+\sqrt{5})$. One method to show this is a proper idea is to argue that if $a + b\sqrt{-5} \in P,$ then $a+b\sqrt{-5} = 2x + y(1+\sqrt{-5})$ for integers $x,y$ and comparing coefficients, we get $a - b \equiv 0 \bmod 2,$ so $P$ cannot be the whole ring. However, this method seems quite laborious, and this may just be a special case when modding out by a prime actually works. For me, the following isomorphism seems quite intuitive: as $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}] \cong \mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2+5),$ we should have that 
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]/(2,1+\sqrt{5}) &\cong \mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2+5,2,1+x) \\
&\cong \mathbb{Z}/(6,2) \text{ by mapping } x \mapsto -1 \\
&\cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}
\end{align*}
so the ideal $P$ is indeed proper. But I can't seem to set up an explicit isomorphism at the moment, so I was wondering if this works generally? Furthermore, are there any useful techniques one might use to show an ideal is indeed proper?","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'ideals']"

2304886,How good is this approximation of $n$ factorial?,"For fixed $n\geq 1$, consider the sum
$$S_n:=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^n}{e^k}.$$
If you compute this sum for some small values of $n$, you will see that it is remarkably close to $n!$. The fact that it is somehat close to $n!$ is not too surprising because $S_n$ ""should"" be similar to the following integral
$$n! = \int_0^\infty \frac{x^n}{e^x}dx.$$
However, the precision of the approximation seems to be surprisingly good (check some small values on Wolfram Alpha and see for yourself!). Question: Is there a good way to show that $S_n$ is bounded above by $(1+\varepsilon) n!$ for every $n\geq1$ where $\varepsilon$ is some explicit positive constant which is ""close"" to $0$? After checking some small values of $n$, it appears that $n=3$ might be the worst value for an upper bound of this type. Note that, for many values of $n$ (perhaps for most $n$), it is actually the case that $S_n<n!$. If you think of $S_n$ as a Riemann sum approximating the integral, then the $k$th summand is approximating the area under the curve between $x=k-1$ and $x=k$ by the value at the right endpoint of this interval (namely, by $\frac{k^n}{e^k}$). The function $\frac{x^n}{e^x}$ is increasing for $0\leq x<n$ and decreasing for $x>n$. Therefore, for $k\leq n$, the $k$th summand is overestimating the area and for $k\geq n+1$ it is underestimating it. Magically, it seems that the overestimating terms and the underestimating terms cancel out beautifully and give us a result which is really close to $n!$. Does anyone know whether this phenomenon occurs for all $n$ and whether there is a good reason why this would be occur? By the way, there is a connection with Eulerian numbers here, if anyone is interested. It turns out that
$$S_n = \frac{e\cdot \sum_{m=0}^{n-1}A(n,m)e^m}{(e-1)^{n+1}}$$
where $A(n,m)$ is the number of permutations of $1,\dots,n$ with exactly $m$ ""ascents."" Interestingly, $A(n,0)+A(n,1)+\cdots +A(n,n-1)=n!$ (since every permutation has some number of ascents) but this doesn't seem to be terribly helpful since there are these factors of $e$ and $e-1$ floating around everywhere.","['special-functions', 'combinatorics', 'factorial', 'gamma-function', 'approximation']"

2304972,Does the existence of a power of $2$ prime-representing function $\lfloor \alpha^{2^n} \rfloor$ imply Legendre's conjecture to be true?,"I am preparing a paper on the topic of prime-representing functions, and one of the referees that reviewed my paper suggested me to include references to the following state of the art article: "" Prime representing functions "", K. Matomäki , Acta Math. Hungar.,128,no.4 (2010) 307--314. The abstract of the article is: We construct prime-representing functions. In particular we show that
  there exist real numbers $\alpha \gt 1$ such that: $$\lfloor \alpha^{2^n} \rfloor$$ is prime for all $n\in \Bbb N$. Indeed the set consisting of such
  numbers $\alpha$ has the cardinality of the continuum. So basically is a refinement of Mills'constant that is, to my surprise, able to provide a prime representing function working in the quadratic intervals $[n^2,(n+1)^2]$ (if I did not understand wrongly, this is for big enough $n$). My doubt regarding this is: as far as I can recall, Mills'constant is based on powers of three, $\lfloor A^{3^n} \rfloor$, and we still do not know if Legendre's conjecture is true or not, so there is not proof for a constant capable of making a prime-representing function like $\lfloor A^{2^n} \rfloor$. But according to the results of Matomäki, the study of the state of the art of prime gaps (and assuming that the Riemann hypothesis is true , as it is stated in the paper) makes possible to develop such power-of-two-based Mills-like constant. So my question is: does the existence of such power of two Mills-like constant imply that Legendre's conjecture is true? where is the trick, or where is the point I misunderstood? maybe can the constant exist, but Legendre's conjecture can still be false without being a contradiction? Thank you! Update 2017/06/06 . My perception is that Matomäki's proof shows that the existence of the constant implies that at least exist one infinite set of quadratic intervals $[N^2,(N+1)^2]$, indeed associated to the primes generated by the constant, each one of them containing at least one prime (indeed the one generated by the constant). So my guessing is that it is safe to say that (1) Still Legendre's conjecture is not proved to be true for all the existing quadratic intervals $[N^2,(N+1)^2]$, (2) Legendre's conjecture is true for those intervals associated to the primes generated by Matomäki's constant. A confirmation or not of this reasoning would be very appreciated.","['reference-request', 'number-theory', 'constants', 'prime-numbers', 'elementary-number-theory']"

If we have $\partial _t F \rightarrow 0$, because $\Delta_g F=-H\nu$, we can easily get $H=\langle F, \nu\rangle$  in the limit manifold.

I'm looking at a function $f : X \to \mathbb{R},f((p,q))=\max_i \frac{p_i}{q_i}$, with the understanding $0/0=1$. I'd like to think of this as a kind of ""distance"" between the distributions $p$ and $q$ which bottoms out at $1$ when $p=q$. Note that $p=q$ is indeed the strict minimum of $f((\cdot,q))$. Accordingly, is it possible to obtain a metric $d$ such that $\lim_{k \to \infty} f(p^{(k)},q)=1$ if and only if $\lim_{k \to \infty} d(p^{(k)},q)=0$? It would be nice if such a $d$ did not depend explicitly on $n$. It would also be of interest if $d$ were merely ""metric-like""; this is a soft concept, but for example the Kullback-Leibler divergence is ""metric-like"" in this sense. A concrete idea that comes to mind is $d(p,q)=\| \log(p/q) \|_\infty$, which is of course a bona fide metric. However this is not necessarily just $\log f$, because it could be that $\max |\log(p/q)| = | \min \log(p/q)|$. Can that happen? If so does it break the desired convergence property? Finally, it would be really nice if these two had the same monotonicity structure, i.e. $f((p_1,q_1)) \leq f((p_2,q_2))$ if and only if $d(p_1,q_1) \leq d(p_2,q_2)$, though that may be too much to hope for.","['real-analysis', 'soft-question', 'probability-theory']"

2305314,Vector bundles and projective $C^{\infty}$-modules,"There is the following theorem: Let $M$ be a smooth manifold (Hausdorff, paracompact etc.). Then there is a bijection {vector bundles over M}$/\cong \ \longleftrightarrow $ {projective $C^{\infty}(M)$-modules}$/\cong$. There is an easy (functorial) way to get from vector bundles to projective modules over $C^{\infty}(M)$, by taking global sections. My question comes from a similar result in Algebraic Geometry: Let $X$ be a scheme. Then there exists an equivalence of categories: {vector bundles over $X$} $\cong$ {locally free sheaves on $X$} where the functors are given by taking the sheaf of sections (which is similar to global sections of the vector bundle in the setting of manifolds) and taking the global spectrum of the symmetric algebra of the locally free sheaf in the other direction. So in the setting of schemes, the connection seems to be much nicer and I'm asking myself, whether there is a similar procedure in the world of manifolds that gives a functor from projective $C^{\infty}(M)$-modules (or locally free $C^{\infty}_M$-modules) to vector bundles over $M$. (I'm sorry for the vague formulation, but I'm not really sure what I want.

Intuitively, I'd like to say that the radius of the sphere is $0.5$ and this should be the upper bound of $\rho$. However, we need to use $\rho \le \cos\phi$. The algebraical explanation for this is:
$$
x^2+y^2+z^2-z+\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{4} \Rightarrow x^2+y^2+z^2=z\\
z=\rho\cos\phi \Rightarrow \rho=z=\rho\cos\phi
$$ I don't understand the reasoning behind this though. Is it because $\rho$ doesn't start in the origin so we need to make the adjustment? And secondly, aren't we interested in the angle $\pi/4 \le \phi \le \pi/2$ because this is actually where the cone is situated?

2305381,Condition for Ehresmann connection to be linear,"I am trying to get more familiar with Ehresmann-connections by looking at how they look like in local trivializations. I am roughly aware of the abstract theory, but not everything is immediately clear, hence this ""investigation"". Now, let $M$ be a smooth $n$ dimensional (real) manifold and let $\pi:E\rightarrow M$ be a rank $k$ vector bundle. Local trivializations are identified with local frames of $E$. A generic local section is written as $\psi=\psi^Ae_A$ and the index notation conventions of Einstein and Schouten are employed. A bundle chart for $E$ then looks like $(x^\mu,\psi^A)_{\mu=1,...,n;\ A=1,...,k}$, with a common domain $U$ for both the local chart on $M$ and the local trivialization of $E$ (this domain will be left implicit in this post). If a Koszul connection on $E$ is given locally by $$ \nabla_\mu\psi^A=\partial_\mu\psi^A+\omega_{\mu\ \ B}^{\ A}\psi^B, $$ then this connection determines an Ehresmann-connection on $E$ by letting $$ H_{(x,\psi)}=\text{span}(D_\mu), $$ where $$ D_\mu=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}-\omega_{\mu\ \ B}^{\ A}\psi^B\frac{\partial}{\partial\psi^A}. $$ This much is clear. However, something's unclear if I try to work the other way around . We can define the canonically existing vertical distribution as $$ V_{(x,\psi)}=\text{span}\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial\psi^A}\right\}, $$ and is easily verified that this is independent of the local trivialization. Now, let's try to define a horizontal distribution locally as $$ H_{(x,\psi)}=\text{span}\{D_\mu\}, $$ where I look for $D_\mu$ in the form $$  D_\mu=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}+Q^A_\mu\frac{\partial}{\partial\psi^A}.$$ The reason I am looking for the horizontal frame in this form is that, the presence of $\partial/\partial x^\mu$ will ensure that $D_\mu$ can never be vertical. Question 1: If I am interested in the most general Ehresmann connection on $E$ (linearity is not assumed), is this true that any horizontal distribution has a frame in this form? Now, going further, I want to ensure that my connection is linear , in the sense that parallel transport is linear.
It is natural, then that I should demand $Q^A_\mu(x,\psi)$  to have only linear dependence on the fiber coordinates, so $Q^A_\mu=-\omega^{\ A}_{\mu\ \ B}(x)\psi^B$. This will obviously give back what I started from (the covariant derivative). My problem is that Lee (Jeffrey, author of Manifolds and Differential Geometry , not to be confused with John Lee) states in the aforementioned book that the only condition for an Ehresmann connection on $E$ to be a linear connection is that it respects scalar multiplication , eg. that $(S_\lambda)_*H_{(x,\psi)}=H_{(x,\lambda\psi)}$ where $S_\lambda$ is multiplication by the scalar $\lambda$. I guess that in my own approach/notation, this means that $Q^A_\mu(x,\psi)$ is a homogenous function (of degree 1) of $\psi$. However, as far as I am aware, homogenity does not necessarily imply linearity. Question 2: What is the necessary condition for $H$ to be a linear Ehresmann-connection? Is Lee right or wrong? If he is right, then how does the form $D_\mu=\partial_\mu-\omega_{\mu\ \ B}^{\ A}\psi^B\partial_A$ come from a homogenous $Q^A_\mu$?

\int\int_R \sqrt{\frac{x^2+y^2}{4a^2-x^2-y^2}+1}dA

The projection of the surface to $xy$ plane will be a circle with the center in $(0,a)$ with the radius $a$ so it's symmetric around $y$ axis. Then $0\le\theta\le\pi$. Because $x^2+y^2=2ay$ then $r=2a\sin\theta$, therefore we now have the integral:
$$

The final answer must be that volume= $\frac{48\pi-64}{9}$ . Here's an illustration: Let $$V=\iiint_Bf(\theta,r,z)dV$$ Because of the symmetry of volume relative of the $y$ axis we can calculate the volume of the upper half then multiply it by 2. Then: $$
0\le z\le \sqrt{4a^2-x^2-y^2} \le \sqrt{4a^2-r^2}
$$ Because our the given surfaces don't have their center at the origin we need to adjust the $r$ . We can retrieve it from the cylinder equation, $r=2a\sin\theta$ . So: $$
0\le r\le 2a\sin\theta
$$ Finally, the projection of the surface onto the $xy$ plane is a circle. So I think that $0\le \theta \le 2\pi$ . But I don't get the correct answer with this angle range. If we evaluate the triple integral we'll get to this expression in the end: $$

Is it true that the minimal polynomial of $T^{-1}$ is $\frac{1}{a_0}(1+a_{m-1}x+...+a_1x^{m-1})+x^m$?

I've bumped into a research paper in which author asserts that the inequality $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}}{f^{2}\, d \gamma} \leq \frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}}{\| \nabla f \|^{2} \,d \gamma}$$ holds for any such function $f$. 
On the first glance, it looks as an improved version of the classical Poincare inequality which states that $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}}{f^{2}\, d \gamma } \leq \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}}{\|\nabla f\|^{2}\, d \gamma}$$ for any $L^{2}$ function that is orthogonal to the constant function (equivalently, with mean $0$). The questions are: (1) Is it possible to prove these inequalities via the  Fourier series techniques? (seems as if it is reasonable to consider the Fourier expansion of $f$ w.r.t to the orthogonal system consisting of Hermite polynomials and the try to obtain the inequality somehow, probably, with the use of the Parserval's identity). The same approach is known to be  working quite well for the $1$-dimensional Wirtinger inequality. (2) The general Poincare inequality states that for a given region $\Omega$ and $1 \leq p < \infty$ there exists a constant $C := C_{\Omega, p}$ such that for any $u \in W_{0}^{1, p}$ 
$$\|u\|_{L^{p}(\Omega)} \leq C \|\nabla u\|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}$$ So, under some mild assumptions (e.g. $\mathbb{E}(f) = 0$ ) is it possible to find the best lower bound for $C$?

I tried the usual methods like separation of variables but the fact, that 
$u'(t)=-u(t)\ln(u(t))$ would not let me solve the integral in that process due to always having one integral which is not solvable. So I thought I'd use Peano.

2306052,Taylor series and approximations to complicated integrals,"So, I feel like I should technically know how to do this, but I'm really not sure. I have a certain integral to calculate or rather, approximate since it's quite hard (if you'd like to know, it's the one in this question and it's been quite painful. Now, I've managed, with a considerable amount of manipulation, to reduce it to $$I(k) \approx \int_0^\infty \frac{p^6}{(1 + a^2 p^2)(1 + b^4 p^4)} \frac{1}{(1 + a^2 (p^2+k^2-p k))(1 + b^4 (p^2+k^2-p k)^2)}dp$$ which was still too hard. I then decided to make a further approximation, writing it $$I(k) \approx \int_0^\infty \frac{p^6}{(1 + a^2 p^2)(1 + b^4 p^4)} \frac{1}{(1 + a^2 (p^2+k^2))(1 + b^4 (p^2+k^2)^2)}dp$$ which is slightly (but only ever so slightly) more doable. The problem is, the end result is an extremely complicated result and I'd like to approximate it even further . (The reason I actually had to calculate the integral was I didn't know how it depended on the parameters $a$ and $b$). Now, I've got the solution and its dependence on the parameters, but it's extraordinarily ugly (it's about two pages long, so I won't include it here!). Furthermore, this is just the start of a bunch of complicated calculations I'll have to perform, and so breaking it up into some manageable chunks of some form would be very helpful.  I'm mainly interested in the ""small"" and ""large"" regimes, as well as where the function ""changes"" the overall power law. For example, in the following Log-Log plot, you see there is a ""knee"" around the region of ""5"" to ""10"", at different points for different parameters of the problem. Questions: 1) Does anyone have any ideas on how to break this up into a more manageable function say, using a Taylor Series? An earlier study showed that it sort of went as $$\sim \frac{1}{1 + c_1 k^2 + c_2 k^5}$$ but in that case the integral was enormously simpler (it still needed to be approximated by manipulating $c_1$ and $c_2$ though) and there were no parameters like $a$ and $b$ involved. I can get rid of one of the parameters by rescaling the variable but I'm still left with another. I can then do a Taylor series approximation around $0$ to get the leading order terms, and another around $\infty$ to get the asymptotic dependence. However, in the intermediate region I'm basically working in the dark. 2) Can the Taylor series around some pivotal point could help me in approximating the function in this region. I can easily perform such a series, but it gives me results in powers of $(k-k_0)$, which work locally, but not globally (i.e. I couldn't just ""attach"" it to the other initial and asymptotic values. 3) Furthermore, if I ""knew"" there should be (say) a $k^{-1}$ behaviour around a certain point (say $k_0$), would I be able to verify this using a Taylor series? Would I be able to get it's coefficient somehow? I'm sorry if these seem like evident questions, I really feel like I ought to know the answers (or atleast if it's possible!), given how much I've used these series in Physics! I'd really appreciate any help, I've wasted an insane amount of time on this, but I can't move forward without even a roughly analytic form of the graph. Let me know if there's anything I haven't explained clearly! EDIT: Couple of points to add on the values of the parameters $a,b$ and the variable $k$. $a$ and $b$ are small, $b\sim 1/3$ and $|a|<1$ for physically acceptable situations. However, $k$ can in theory stretch from $0$ to $\infty$ (though we usually stop around $O(1000)$.","['approximate-integration', 'physics', 'approximation-theory', 'integration', 'definite-integrals']"

2306317,Confusion with Edwards's Proof of Inverse Mapping Theorem: The convergent sequence.,"This question arose while working through the proof of the inverse
mapping theorem (Theorem III 3.3) in C.H. Edwards, Jr.'s Advanced
Calculus of Several Variables. Edit to add definitions:
$f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a $\mathscr{C}^{1}$ mapping in a neighborhood of the point $a$. $T=df_{a}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the differential of $f$ at $a$. The follow are established in the text $g_{0}(y)=a$ $\tau_{a}(x)=x+a$ $T\circ\tau_{a}^{-1}\circ g_{k+1}(y)=T\circ\tau_{a}^{-1}\circ g_{k}(y)-[f(g_{k}(y))-y]$. Edwards instructs the student to apply $\tau_{a}\circ T^{-1}$
to both sides of this expression. What I get is $g_{k+1}(y)=g_{k}(y)-\tau_{a}\circ T^{-1}[f(g_{k}(y))-y]$ $g_{k+1}(y)=g_{k}(y)-T^{-1}[f(g_{k}(y))-y]-a$. Edwards gives the generic induction step as $g_{k+1}(y)=g_{k}(y)-T^{-1}[f(g_{k}(y))-y]$. Now, according to my result the first induction step is $g_{1}(y)=g_{0}(y)-T^{-1}[f(g_{0}(y))-y]-a$ $=a-T^{-1}[f(a)-y]-a$ $=-T^{-1}[f(a)-y]$ So the $-a$ is canceled. But I don't see how that would be inherited
in subsequent steps. For example, $g_{2}(y)=-T^{-1}[f(-T^{-1}[f(a)-y])-y]-a$ seems to be the obvious next term. Where is the error?","['multivariable-calculus', 'induction', 'sequences-and-series']"

$$\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{1 / \sqrt{n}} \frac{\mathrm{e}^{x} - 1}{1 + x} \mathop{}\!\mathrm{d} x$$
converges. Now the integral does not have a closed form, and the summand evidently vanishes as $n \to \infty$. I've tried to apply all convergence tests that I could find, but none seem to work in this case. Many of them (d'Alembert, Dirichlet, etc.) try to evaluate $\displaystyle \frac{a_{n + 1}}{a_{n}}$ and then do something about it, but in this case, when the summand is a definite integral, this fraction doesn't seem to simply things much... Nor does it seem to simply things to evaluate the square root $\sqrt{\lvert a_{n}\rvert}$ or the integral $\displaystyle \int_{1}^{\infty} a_{n} \mathop{}\!\mathrm{d} n$. The Cauchy condensation test evaluates $2^{n} a_{2^{n}}$, which also doesn't seem to lead anywhere... I think the reason the aforementioned tests don't seem to work (based on my trial anyway...maybe they do and I'm just not seeing it) is that the summand is an integral. Hence I was wondering if there is a convergence test which works for series with definite integral summand?

Now any ${x}\subset S$ can be written as a limit of an appropriate sequence of open balls, which would correspond to a similar limit in $\mathbb R$, in case the limit exists. Then I would need to show that different limits are obtained in $\mathbb R$ for different $x\in S$. This is a step I am not sure how to show. Alternatively, one could show that all possible sequences of rationals have no greater cardinality than reals. What would be a good way to show this? I know that all reals can be written as some convergent sequence of rationals, but I am looking for something slightly different here.

0, & x=y=0\end{cases}

I proved that the partial derivatives of the function, as well as its directional derivatives, at $(0,0)$  all equal zero using the limit definition. The definition for differentiable that I use is:
$$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)-Ah}{||h||}=0$$
I haven't studied the polar notation yet, so if possible please refrain from using it. Because of the partial derivatives, $A=(0,0)$ although I couldn't get very far with that:
$$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f((0,0)+(h_x,h_y)) - 0-0}{||h||}=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{h_x^3\cdot h_y}{(h_x^4+h_y^2)(h_x^2+h_y^2)^{1/2}}$$ And because of the coefficients, I couldn't find a path that would help me disprove it (as is done often,$(t,t),(t-t)(1/n,1/n^2),(t,t^2)$). So I looked at the two pages of questions regarding this function here on MO.
Most of them focused on showing that it is continuous at the origin, which is nice but insufficient. This says that it is not differentiable, but the path doesn't seem right
$$\frac{t^3t^2}{t^4+t^4}=\frac{t^5}{2t^4}=\frac{t}{2}$$
I didn't find it in the book available online. Looking at the graph however, it is more similar to the non-diffetiable exampe from math-insight but going by the drawing is not enough. So, can you help me either prove or disprove its differntiablity at the origin?
