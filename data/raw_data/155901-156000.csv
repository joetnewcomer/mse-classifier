2645155,Base 17 on a Suanpan (Chinese abacus),"I recently discovered the Suanpan, which quickly became my favorite abacus design. Like the more common Soroban (Japanese abacus), the Suanpan has an upper rack and a lower one. The Soroban has 4 beads on the lower, and one bead on the upper. The Suanpan has 5 beads on the lower, and two beads on the upper. This is to allow for calculations involving base 16, like the classic Chinese weight system. Suanpan Image (for reference) I was intrigued by this versatility and I decided to see if bases other than 10 and 16 could be represented on a Suanpan. I discovered that bases 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, and 18 could be represented with relative ease. But 14 and 17 seemingly had no solution. Eventually I found an okay solution for 14, but I'm at a loss for 17. So I task you to help solve this mystery. Rules These rules are stated in reference to one column. The solution must be for a Suanpan, meaning it works for an abacus with 5 lower beads, and 2 upper beads. The lower beads are of value one (2 lower beads=2), but the top beads can be of any value. You may choose to not use any number of the beads. For example, Suanpans mimic Sorobans if you forget 1 lower bead and 1 upper bead. Suanpans can also perform binary math if you use 1 of the lower beads and nothing else. The value of an upper bead must be within 1 of the amount of lower beads used (this includes the same value as beads used). For example, in Soroban mode, the upper bead is worth 5, 1 more than the amount of beads used in the lower rack. Additionally, in hexadecimal mode, the upper beads are worth 5, which is the same as the amount of beads used in the lower rack. The layout/counting rules must not change when counting to the maximum value for the base (16). In another word: overflow must be consistent. The rule 3 lower beads not overflowing, but if 1 upper bead is counted it overflows would not be allowed. These rules are intended to have the solutions mimic the traditional (and intuitive) use of the Suanpan. I'm happy to provide any information on how my solutions work, to help you find the solution for base 17.","['combinatorics', 'number-systems']"
2645167,Finite intersections of a countable family of sets is countable?,Let $\mathcal{A} = \{A_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ a countable family of sets. Is it true that the following set $$\mathcal{F}:=\{ B : B=\bigcap_{j=1}^n A_{a_j} \text{ for a finite choice of } A_{a_j} \text{ in } \mathcal{A} \}$$ is countable?,['elementary-set-theory']
2645169,Region of attraction of simple ODE with perturbation,"There are a few nice discussions about ROA  covering a few subtopics: Region of attraction of : $x'=-y-x^3,y'=x-y^3$ via Lyapunov Function Region of attraction and stability via liapunov's function (No2) Basin of attractions with continuity and discontinuity Strength of attraction of fixed points Can the basin of attraction be multiple intervals? Now, consider the following simplest example: $$\dot{x} = x(x-1)(x+1)$$ $[-1,1]$ is the ROA. Now consider the two dimensional case: \begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\dot{x} = x(x-1)(x+1)\\
&\dot{y} = y(y-1)(y+1)
\end{aligned}  
\end{equation}Obviously, ROA is a square. However, if I consider the following coupled ODE: \begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\dot{x} = x(x-1)(x+1) + \epsilon (y-x)\\
&\dot{y} = y(y-1)(y+1) + \epsilon (x-y)
\end{aligned}  
\end{equation} where $\epsilon$ is a very small number. Or \begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\dot{x} = x(x-1)(x+1) + \epsilon (-y+x)\\
&\dot{y} = y(y-1)(y+1) + \epsilon (-x+y)
\end{aligned}  
\end{equation} Then I have the following ROAs:  (blue line-case three, black line-case two, red line-case one) My questions are: There are two different tilt directions for case two and three. I know this is because of the slope of the coupling term (for case two, the slope of $x$ and $y$ in the coupling terms are $-1$). But how could I analyze this formally? Is it a good way to analyze 1. by perturbation method (I think this should be a regular perturbation method)? (observe the sign of the leading order term of the solution obtained from perturbation method?) and how could I proceed it for the coupling term? Note: It is simple to check that if you just use the linearization method to find the Jacobian matrix (w.r.t the point $(0,0)$), the ROA will be the whole $\mathbb{R}^2$, which is not correct.","['basins-of-attraction', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems', 'perturbation-theory']"
2645176,Does $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{\ln(x)}{\cot(x)}$ exist or not?,"I stumbled on the following limit in a calculus textbook today: \begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{\ln(x)}{\cot(x)}
\end{equation*} According to the book's solutions and Mathematica , this limit exists and is equal to 0. I can see why $0$ is obtained using l'Hôpital's rule twice: \begin{equation*}
...=\lim_{x\rightarrow0}\frac{\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}{-\csc^2(x)}=-\lim_{x\rightarrow0}\frac{\sin^2(x)}{x}=-\lim_{x\rightarrow0}\frac{2\sin(x)\cos(x)}{1}=2\sin(0)\cos(0)=0
\end{equation*} If I recall correctly, l'Hôpital's rule is applicable when we have:
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\rightarrow a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
\end{equation*}
even if $f$ and $g$ are not derivable at precisely $a$, so there should be no issue in using it on the above limit. However, I can't reconcile the fact that $\ln(x)$ is defined over $]0,+\infty[$ (and usually, only $\lim_{x\rightarrow0^+}\ln(x)$ exists) with the fact that the above limit exists (both as $x\rightarrow0^+$ and as $x\rightarrow0^{-}$). It seems to me that only \begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^+}\frac{\ln(x)}{\cot(x)}
\end{equation*} should exist and thus the ""bilateral limit"" (with $x\rightarrow 0$) does not exist since the limit with $x\rightarrow0^-$ doesn't. Is there something I am missing?","['real-analysis', 'limits']"
2645177,"Prove there is no bijective continuous function $f:[0,1] \to [0,1]^2$ [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Is there a continuous bijection between an interval $[0,1]$ and a square: $[0,1] \times [0,1]$? (5 answers) Closed 6 years ago . Prove there is no bijective continuous function $f:[0,1] \to [0,1]^2$.

2645213,Non-algebraic set of countably infinite set of points,"Algebraic subsets of affine space have the property $(*)$: that their intersection with a line $L$ is either finite or $L$ itself (so $L$ was a subset). I am building an example of a set with property $(*)$, but is not algebraic. I am allowed to use any field and any dimension to construct this counterexample. My original idea was to simply take the graph of $e^x$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, or $\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{R}}^2$ if you prefer. I think this graph clearly has the property. I had trouble showing that it wasn't an algebraic set. So, instead of forcing that route, I build a set that I imagine won't be algebraic out of points instead of arcs. The construction is as follows: Pick any two distinct points at least distance one from eachother in the plane. Pick another point by avoiding all lines connecting the previous points, and choose this point to be at least distance one from the other points. We can build a countable collection of isolated points in this way, call it $X$. If $X$ doesn't intersect a line $L$, great. If it does in exactly one point, great. Suppose $L$ intersects $X$ in at least two points $x_i$ and $x_j$, and suppose $i<j$. In the construction of $X$, $x_j$ does not sit on a line which connects any two points of smaller index. Since $x_i$ is one point with smaller index, there can be no other points index less than $j$ on $L$. But each point after $x_j$ avoids the line containing $x_j$ and $x_i$. So $|L\cap X|=2$, and $X$ has property $(*)$. Now I need to show that $X$ is not algebraic. My hope was that working with isolated singletons would make proving this more simple, but now I realize that there is more subtlety here than I originally thought. In any case, by way of contradiction, suppose $X$ is algebraic. Then $X$ decomposes uniquely as a non-trivial union of irreducible algebraic sets $X=U_1\cup,\dots,\cup U_n$. But each isolated point $X_i=\lbrace x_i\rbrace$ is algebraic and irreducible. Thus $X_i\subset X$ implies that each $X_i$ is a subset of some irreducible $U_j$. By countable pigeonhole, without loss of generality, suppose that $U_1$ contains countably infinitely many of our $x_i$'s. Now $U_1$ is an irreducible countably infinite set having property $(*)$. This at least tells us that $I(U_i)$ is a prime ideal. Remark: I don't know if we need to take the $x_i$'s to be at least distance from one another, but I figured we should.",['algebraic-geometry']

2645248,Partial Sums of Geometric Series,"This may be a simple question, but I was slightly confused.  I was looking at the second line $S_n(x)=1-x^{n+1}/(1-x)$.  I was confused how they derived this.  I know the infinite sum of a geometric series is $1/(1-x)$.  I just can't figure out how the partial sums, $S_n(x)$, have $1-x^{n+1}$ on the numerator.  How was this derived? Thank you. Example 5.20. The geometric series
  $$
    \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n

  has partial sums
  $$
    S_n(x)

  $$\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{1}{a^2\cos^2{t}+b^2\sin^2{t}}dt=\frac{2\pi}{ab}$$ Attempt 1: Suppose $\gamma(t)= a \cos(t) + ib\sin(t)$ then we obtain $$\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{-a \sin(t) + ib\cos(t)}{a \cos(t) + ib\sin(t)}dt$$
I tired rationalizing the numerator but end up with $a^2+b^2$ in the numerator and a mess in the denominator. So I'm unable to obtain the LHS. Attempt 2: Recognize $$\int_{\gamma}\frac{1}{z}=\int\frac{\gamma'(t)}{\gamma(t)}dt=\int\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\log(\gamma(t))dt$$ so that $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\log(\gamma(t)) = \frac{1}{a^2\cos^2{t}+b^2\sin^2{t}}$$
Integrating in $t$ and exponentiating to solve for $\gamma$ gives a mess. It doesn't reduce either. I think here, there also maybe an issue of branch cuts that I haven't considered carefully. I also recognize that the denominator factors: $(a \cos(t) + ib\sin(t))(a \cos(t) - ib\sin(t))$ I haven't been able to use this information though. Any ideas?

2645264,"Is it ""bad form"" to count the number of outcomes in an event to compute a probability?","I've been reading this very interesting blog post entitled "" A review of probability theory "" from Terence Tao. Here are a few quotes from the blog post: Elements of the sample space $\Omega$ will be denoted $\omega$.
  However, for reasons that will be explained shortly, we will try to
  avoid actually referring to such elements unless absolutely required
  to. ... In order to have the freedom to perform extensions every time we need
  to introduce a new source of randomness, we will try to adhere to the
  following important dogma: probability theory is only “allowed” to
  study concepts and perform operations which are preserved with respect
  to extension of the underlying sample space. (This is analogous to how
  differential geometry is only “allowed” to study concepts and perform
  operations that are preserved with respect to coordinate change, or
  how graph theory is only “allowed” to study concepts and perform
  operations that are preserved with respect to relabeling of the
  vertices, etc..) As long as one is adhering strictly to this dogma,
  one can insert as many new sources of randomness (or reorganise
  existing sources of randomness) as one pleases; but if one deviates
  from this dogma and uses specific properties of a single sample space,
  then one has left the category of probability theory and must now take
  care when doing any subsequent operation that could alter that sample
  space. This dogma is an important aspect of the probabilistic way of
  thinking, much as the insistence on studying concepts and performing
  operations that are invariant with respect to coordinate changes or
  other symmetries is an important aspect of the modern geometric way of
  thinking. With this probabilistic viewpoint, we shall soon see the
  sample space essentially disappear from view altogether, after a few
  foundational issues are dispensed with. Let’s give some simple examples of what is and what is not a
  probabilistic concept or operation. The probability $P(E)$ of an
  event is a probabilistic concept; it is preserved under extensions.
  Similarly, boolean operations on events such as union, intersection,
  and complement are also preserved under extensions and are thus also
  probabilistic operations. The emptiness or non-emptiness of an event
  $E$ is also probabilistic, as is the equality or non-equality of two
  events $E,F$ (note how it was important here that we demanded the map 
  $\pi$ to be surjective in the definition of an extension). On the
  other hand, the cardinality of an event is not a probabilistic
  concept; for instance, the event that the roll of a given die gives
  $4$ has cardinality one in the sample space $\{1,\ldots,6\}$, but has
  cardinality six in the sample space $\{1,\ldots,6\} \times \{1,\ldots,6\}$ when the values of an additional die are used to
  extend the sample space. Thus, in the probabilistic way of thinking,
  one should avoid thinking about events as having cardinality , except
  to the extent that they are either empty or non-empty. [The bold is mine.] This seems to be a very insightful viewpoint. But, in introductory probability classes, it is very common to compute the probability of an event by counting the number of outcomes in the event, and dividing by the total number of outcomes in the sample space (assuming that all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely). Is this bad form?  In such cases, would it be preferable to compute the probabilities using an approach that does not involve counting the number of elements of an event? Perhaps an anology is that, in linear algebra, we often prefer proofs that don't use coordinates.",['probability']

My idea is to count the number of total lattice paths one can take from $(0,0)$ to $(2n,2n)$. There are ${4n \choose 2n}$ such paths. Then subtract the number of paths that are not valid. In counting these, I reasoned that we must avoid the ""odd points"" inside the grid with height and width of $2n$. I counted the number of paths that take these of points to be ${4 \choose 2}^{n-1}{2 \choose 1}{2 \choose 1}$ with the reasoning that from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$, there are ${2 \choose 1}$ paths, similarly for $(2n-1,2n-1)$ to $(2n,2n)$. Now, there are a total of $n-1$ ""odd points"" we consider and the number of paths from say $(1,1)$ to $(3,3)$ is ${4 \choose 2}$, we consider $n-1$ such scenarios. But in comparing my result, it is wrong, I seem to be undercounting the number of invalid paths that I need to subtract from the total paths. Edit: The result is expected to be the Catalan numbers of the form $C_{2n+1}$. Edit 2: I've reworked the problem to make the first couple of terms match $C_{2n+1}$, by removing from the total number of lattice paths the invalid paths (a sum of all the possible cases by which we choose how many and which odd points our invalid path has gone through).

2645382,"Functions defined as Sets, and operations with them","I'm self studying, Fundamentals of Abstract Analysis by Andrew Gleason, and while reading about how functions can be defined as sets I got confused when asked to solve concrete exercises of this type. $\textrm{Pg. 40}$ A function closer to our level of technical competence is $\{\langle0,0\rangle,\langle1,1\rangle,\langle2,4\rangle,\langle3,9\rangle\}$. This is the function which assigns the value 0 to 0, 1 to 1, 4 to 2, and 9 to 3. It is a subset of the function which assigns to each real number it's square. All other functions will be sets of ordered pairs of a similar character. Note that $\{\langle0,0\rangle,\langle1,1\rangle,\langle2,4\rangle,\langle0,5\rangle\}$ is not a function. $\textrm{3-4.1.

Which of them are injective? Is any one a restriction of another? Compute $f_1 \circ f_2$ and $f_2 \circ f_3$. Then compute $(f_1 \circ f_2)\circ f_3$ and $f_1\circ (f_2\circ f_3)$. $\textrm{My Answer}$: The domain of $f_1$ is $\{1,2,3,4\}$ , $f_2$ is $\{1,2,4\}$, $f_3$ is $\{0,1,2,3\}$, and $f_4$ is $\{0,1,2,4\}$. The range of $f_1$ is $\{0,1,2\}$, $f_2$ is $\{1,2\}$, $f_3$ is $\{0,2,4\}$, and $f_4$ is $\{1,2,5\}$. These sets do not need to be ordered, which may confuse someone, but I ordered them anyway. None of the functions $f_1, f_2, f_3$ and $f_4$ are injective since $f_i(x)=f_j(y)\not \Rightarrow x=y$. $f_2$ is a restriction of $f_4$ since $f_2 = f_4\setminus \langle 0,5 \rangle$. Finally, the composition of functions: $f_1\circ f_2 = \{f_1(f_2(x_1)), f_1(f_2(x_2)), f_1(f_2(x_3)), f_1(f_2(x_4))\}$ $=\{\langle2,f_1(1)\rangle, \langle4,f_1(1)\rangle, \langle1,f_1(2)\rangle, \langle4,f_1(2)\}$ $=\{\langle2,1\rangle, \langle4,1\rangle, \langle1,1\rangle, \langle4,1\rangle\}$ $=\{\langle1,1\rangle, \langle2,1\rangle, \langle4,1\rangle\}$ $f_2\circ f_3 =\{\langle0,1\rangle, \langle1,1\rangle, \langle2,1\rangle\}$, noting that $\langle3, f_3(x_4))\rangle$ is not defined. $(f_1\circ f_2)\circ f_3 = f_1\circ(f_2\circ f_3)$ since composition of functions is associative; therefore, $(f_1\circ f_2)\circ f_3 = f_1\circ(f_2\circ f_3) = \{\langle0,1\rangle, \langle1,1\rangle, \langle2,1\rangle\}$ Noting that $\langle3, f_1(0)\rangle$ is undefined which came from $\langle3, f_1(f_2(f_3(3)))\rangle$. Now my question is: Let $X = \{1,2,3\}$ and let $S$ denote the set: $S = \{f \in X^X : f \text{ is a bijection}\}$ (There are questions that follow this setup that I believe I could answer if I only knew how to approach this problem.) I'm familiar with $X^2$ being the cartesian product $X\times X$.

2645572,"Given two distinct colors, show that every adjacent region is different","This question is difficult to quantify; it came up while I was working on an art project. The basic idea is this: Suppose we have two colors ""red and ""blue,"" and a set of loops and start by assigning an arbitrary region ""0"" a color red. Then for every consecutive, adjacent region, we follow this rule: If an adjacent region was red, assign blue; If an adjacent region was blue, assign red; Repeat the rule for regions left out. If we complete the rule, does it follow that no adjacent regions share the same color? A similar question: does our choice of adjacent regions affect the outcome? Another way to think about this is to distinguish between even and odd regions. I attached drawings to clarify what I meant by a loop. One way I might define it is that a loop's endpoints must meet. Intersections are legal, but an overlap over some interval is illegal. Finally, a loop may be as complicated as you want. (What's better way to ask this question?

2645604,How many cells are expected?,"Suppose in the beginning, one cell was present in a Petri dish, and
  nutrients for cell division were provided in abundance. It is given
  that the probability for a cell to divide is $\sin(t^\circ)$, where
  $t$ (in minutes) is the time elapsed since its last division. What is
  the expected number of cells in the dish after $t$ minutes? Assume the
  cells won't die, or, cease to exist. A troubled friend of mine asked me this question. I became as troubled as him afterwards. I limited the discussion to $0 \leq t < 90$ for simplicity's sake. My approach Denote $p_m$ as the probability of having $m$ cells after $t$ minutes. Expected number of cells = $\sum^{\infty}_{m=1}mp_m$ Consider $m=1$. If there was still 1 cell in the dish after $t$ minutes, then that one cell must not have divided itself at the first place, so $p_1=1-\sin(t)$. Looks innocent enough. Consider $m=2$. The only case is that the 1 cell initially present had divided into 2 daughter cells at some time $x$, where $x\leq t$, AND that both the 2 daughter cells did not further divide themselves from time $x$ to $t$.
So the probability is $$p_2=\int_0^t \sin(x)[1-\sin(t-x)]^2 \text dx$$ Consider $m=3$. Now either one of the daughter cells must have divided itself. Say that this second division occurs $y$ minutes since the first division occured. Also taking the symmetry between the two daughter cells into consideration, the core of the integral is
$$2\sin x \sin y [1-\sin(t-x)][1-\sin(t-x-y)]^2$$ My queries When $m=3$, from/to where should I integrate $\text d x$ and $\text d y$? Can I write something like the following, if not, how should I formulate $p_3$? $$p_3 = \int_0^t\int_0^{t-t_1}\int_0^{t_1} 2\sin x \sin y [1-\sin(t-x)][1-\sin(t-x-y)]^2 \text dx \text dy \text dt_1$$ The probability tree gets really complicated when $m \geq 4$, and the integral itself requires $m-1$ variables.

2645906,Every k-cell is compact / alternative proof,"I have become really interested in trying to prove directly things that are more easily proved by contradiction. The below seems to be a good example of this. Rudin's proof makes perfect sense to me. In fact I think it is a very elegant proof. But nonetheless I am very much interested in a constructive proof. Essentially Rudin proves that every k-cell is compact by assuming the opposite: that there is an open cover of a k-cell $I$ which does not contain a finite subcover. I would like to assume $\{G_\alpha \}$ is an arbitrary open cover of $I$ and show directly that $G_\alpha$ must have a finite subcover. Here is an outline of Rudin's proof(Theorem 2.40): Every k-cell is compact. Proof. Let $I$ be a k-cell consisting of all points $x = (x_1, \dots, x_k)$ such that $a_j \leq x_j \leq b_j$ for $1 \leq j \leq k$. Put $\delta = \{ \sum\limits_1^k(b_j - a_j)^2\}^{1/2}$ Then $|x-y| \leq \delta$ if $x, y \in I$. Suppose there is an open cover $\{G_\alpha \}$ which contains no finite subcover. Put $c_j = \frac{a_j + b_j}{2}$. The intervals $[a_j, c_j]$ and $[c_j, b_j]$ determine $2^k$ k-cells whose union is $I$. At least one of these subsets of $I$, say $I_1$, cannot be covered by any finite subcollection of $\{ G_\alpha \}$. So we begin again with the k-cell $I_1$ and subdivide further to achieve a sequence of k-cells such that (a) $I \supset I_1 \supset I_2 \supset I_3 \supset \dots$ (b) $I_n$ is not covered by any finite subcollection of $G_\alpha$ (c) If $x \in I_n$ and $y \in I_n$ then $|y-x| \leq 2^{-n}\delta$ Hence there is a point $x^* \in \cap I_n$ and for some $\alpha$ $x^* \in G_\alpha$. Since $G$ is open there is a neighborhood $N_r(x^*) \subset G_\alpha$. If $n$ is large enough that $2^{-n}\delta < r$ then given $p \in I_n$ $|x^* - p | < 2^{-n}\delta < r \implies p \in N_r(x^*) \implies I_n \subset G_\alpha$ contradicting the fact that $I_n$ cannot be covered by a finite subcollection of $\{ G_\alpha\}$","['general-topology', 'real-analysis', 'alternative-proof']"

The random sample is coming from a $\operatorname{Exp}(\theta)$ distribution, $\theta>0$. We can use the fact that if $X \sim \operatorname{Exp}(\theta)$ then $\frac{2X}{\theta} \sim \operatorname{Exp}(2) \sim {\chi}^{2}_{2}$.

2645953,A surprising dilogarithm integral identity arising from a generalised point enclosure problem,"This question asked: What is the probability that three points selected uniformly randomly on the unit circle contain a fixed point at distance $x$ from the circle's centre? I answered that question with a geometric derivation of the following double integral for the desired probability:
$$P(x)=\frac14-\frac3{\pi^3}\int_0^\pi\int_0^a\left(\sin^{-1}\frac{x\sin b}{\sqrt{1+x^2-2x\cos b}}-\sin^{-1}\frac{x\sin a}{\sqrt{1+x^2-2x\cos a}}\right)\,db\,da$$
Below this equation I claimed: Trying to find a closed-form expression for this is neither simple nor enlightening. I did give an approximation to $P(x)$ and showed that it had an error of no more than around 0.004 via matplotlib. (In the graphs below, the pole refers to the fixed point.)
$$P(x)\approx\frac{(1-x^2)^{2/3}}4$$ But the relative size of the error irritated me – I had tried more complicated approximations, with only marginal improvements. Then I got the idea of using Taylor series for a better approximation – $P(x)$ is only defined on $[0,1]$, within the radius of convergence for many Taylor series. So I set to work, using SymPy to compute the Maclaurin (Taylor at $x=0$) series of $P(x)$. After half an hour I got the following:
$$P(x)=\frac14-\frac{3x^2}{2\pi^2}-\frac{3x^4}{8\pi^2}-\frac{x^6}{6\pi^2}-\frac{3x^8}{32\pi^2}-\frac{3x^{10}}{50\pi^2}+\mathcal O(x^{12})$$
I realised that the initial term and the factors of $\frac3{\pi^2}$ in subsequent terms were echoes of their presence in the expression for $P(x)$, so could be factored out computing the $x^{12}$ term would take forever in this form, so I split the integrand into four parts using the logarithmic version of $\sin^{-1}$:

$$P(x)=\frac14-\frac3{\pi^2}\left(\frac{x^2}2+\frac{x^4}8+\frac{x^6}{18}+\frac{x^8}{32}+\frac{x^{10}}{50}+\frac{x^{12}}{72}+\mathcal O(x^{14})\right)$$
All the powers were even and had unit fraction coefficients after factoring $\frac3{\pi^2}$ out. I then put the sequence $2,8,18,32,50,72$ into the OEIS and got a surprise… these are twice squares ! Therefore I could write
$$P(x)=\frac14-\frac3{\pi^2}\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{x^{2n}}{2n^2}$$
Thus was revealed the series expansion of the dilogarithm , the simplest expression for $P(x)$ and perhaps the most elegant equation I have encountered:
$$\bbox[5px,border:1px solid black]{P(x)=\frac14-\frac3{2\pi^2}\operatorname{Li}_2(x^2)}$$
I confirmed the correctness of this expression by comparing its values to my precomputed samples of $P(x)$, finding nothing but round-off error in the latter: Of course, such an equality begs explanation, and this is the question I am asking here: Why is the following identity true? $$\int_0^\pi\int_0^a\left(\sin^{-1}\frac{x\sin b}{\sqrt{1+x^2-2x\cos b}}-\sin^{-1}\frac{x\sin a}{\sqrt{1+x^2-2x\cos a}}\right)\,db\,da=\frac\pi2\operatorname{Li}_2(x^2)$$ The logarithmic form $(1)$ of the integrand in $P(x)$ may help. Besides Taylor series, I am open to proofs that exploit the geometry of the situation; here is the diagram I used to justify the integral expression for $P(x)$. Here $O$ is the origin and the arguments of $A$ and $B$ when treated as complex numbers are $a$ and $b$, lying in $[0,\pi]$ and $[0,a]$ respectively. The argument of the triangle's third point (not shown) lies in $[-\pi,0]$ and has to be between $P$ and $Q$ for the triangle to contain the fixed point $D$ at $(x,0)$. The first term in the integrand $\sin^{-1}\frac{x\sin b}{\sqrt{1+x^2-2x\cos b}}$ is $\angle DOQ$, the second term $\angle DOP$.","['polylogarithm', 'definite-integrals', 'geometric-probability', 'geometry']"

For example consider the function $f(x) = x$. It is clearly continuous at every point in its domain, which is all real numbers. But now let's have $f(x) = x \cdot \frac{x-2}{x-2}$ which means the function is undefined at $x=2$, but still equivalent to $f(x)=x$ everywhere else, so we exclude that point $x=2$ from the domain. The domain is now something like $(-\infty, 2) \cup (2, \infty)$. Continuity at a point usually means the limits exist and they equal the function's value at that point. The number $2$ is not in the domain so we only have to consider numbers to the left and to the right of $2$, and no matter what number we pick, they will be defined and have limits equaling those values. So would we still call such a function ""continuous"" despite having this $f(2)$ undefined?","['definition', 'continuity', 'calculus', 'limits']"

Then $X$ has a distribution of mixed type if $S$ can be partitioned into subsets $D$ and $C$ with the following properties: a) $D$ is countable and $0 \lt P(X \in D) \lt 1$. b) $P(X = x) = 0$ for all $x \in C$.

Define $N_\epsilon := \{ f > \lVert f \rVert _\infty - \epsilon\}$. Now we have $$N_\epsilon = N_\epsilon \cap \bigcup_{n\in \mathbb N}E_n = \bigcup_{n\in \mathbb N} (N_\epsilon \cap E_n)$$

$$g:= \frac{1_M}{\mu(M)}.$$
Clearly, $\lVert g \rVert_1 = 1$ and $$\int \lvert fg \rvert \, d\mu \geq \lVert f\rVert _\infty - \epsilon.$$

2646552,Group theory optimization; abstract algebra relevant?,"Suppose a girl, call her Alice is lost from home. Where all her geographical surroundings, including both herself and the position of her house can be modeled as particular vertices in a graph $G$ such that each edge in $G$ corresponds with a road that Alice can walk down as she attempts to find her way home. However Alice is on the phone with her friend Bob, who is trying to give her directions to get back home based on what she tells him of her current surroundings, yet Alice can only see those vertices directly adjacent to her and so Bob must try his best based on her description of where she is to help her navigate back home. Now my goal is to optimize the graph $G$ to make it as hard as possible for Alice to get home. After rethinking this several times, I can't help but think it involves group theory which seems weird in this particular context as I've not used abstract algebra in related problems of this nature before. Though in any case my train of thought was: Try to design a graph based on the constraints I was given, such that knowing the neighbors of any vertex gives as little structural information about that vertices positions relative to the graph as a whole, in this way since Alice can only see geographic objects adjacent to her, a graph satisfying this property would ensure Alice conveys as little information about her position as possible to Bob. However if the graph has a large automorphism group, or is ""vertex transitive"" then since any vertex can be mapped to any other vertex via a bijective map. This would make the positions (vertices) essentially indistinguishable up to the objects (vertices ) adjacent to Alice's position. So I'm thinking the more ""transitive"" I make the graphs automorphism group, the less information Alice will have about her geographic position relative to $G$, which means less info can be given to Bob, which means Alice will likely remain lost longer being unable to give much of a description of her surroundings based on the structure of adjacent vertices. Though I'm not totally sure I'm interpreting transitive group actions correctly and also the fact that group theory is coming up in an optimization problem seems kind of weird to me, so I think I might be looking at the problem wrong. Is my vague intuition corerct? Or am I (probably) interpreting the relationship between a graphs automorphisms and individual vertices relative distinguish-ability based on their neighbors wrong?","['graph-theory', 'optimization', 'computer-science', 'discrete-optimization', 'group-theory']"

The answer actually made the choice 
$$e_r = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta), \quad e_\theta = (-\sin\theta, \cos\theta)$$
I would like to clarify this step more naturally. More generally, let $g(x,y) = (u,v)$ be the change of variable map. Given a real valued function $f(x,y)$, we know in the new variable $\tilde f (u,v)= f(g^{-1}(u,v))$. Now given a vector field 
$$v(x,y) = v_1\frac{\partial}{\partial x} +  v_2\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$$ 
we would like to calculate $\tilde v(u,v)$ in the new variable, I think this is given by $dg(v)$ following the change of variable formula
$$dg\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial u}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial v}$$
$$dg\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \frac{\partial}{\partial u}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \frac{\partial}{\partial v}$$
Let us denote the coordinates of $v$ as $[v] = (v_1, v_2)$, we get 
$$[\tilde v(u,v)] = (Jg)(g^{-1}(u,v))[v(g^{-1}(u,v))].$$ I tried the following calculation.
Given $f(x,y)$, $h(r,\theta) = (x,y)$ the change of variable map, and $\tilde f = f \circ h$. Given the vector field: gradient of $\tilde f$
$$\tilde v(r, \theta) = \frac{\partial \tilde f}{\partial r}\frac{\partial  }{\partial r}+ \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial \tilde f}{\partial \theta}\frac{\partial }{\partial \theta}$$
Then we see that 
$$dh(\tilde v(r, \theta)) = \frac{\partial \tilde f}{\partial r}dh\left(\frac{\partial  }{\partial r}\right)+ \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial \tilde f}{\partial \theta}dh\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial \theta}\right)\\

2646832,how to place a rope with a given length within an orthogonal triangle (see picture),"I would like to know what is the optimal way of placing the red rope of a given length $p$, where $\sqrt{2}<p<2$, in the orthogonal triangle ABCA, so that the green area is minimized (see attached figure). A condition is that the rope along with the segment AB must formulate a convex set. So, is there a unique optimal way of placing the rope? Are there only two possible optimal (symmetrical) ways? Are there more? Are there infinite? Why?
 Most importantly, what is the value of the minimized area, for a given length $p$? Just by intuition, I would say that I would place the rope for some of its portion alongside segment AC (just for a small portion) and then go for a straight shot to point B (or do the symmetrical trajectory by going for a straight shot from point A to some point on CB and then go down to point B along side CB). Portions of the rope are allowed to lie on the the perimeter of the triangle ABCA, but not allowed to exceed the perimeter of the triangle. The rope can also be placed in such ways that it exhibits corners, as long as it formulates a convex set with segment AB. The endpoints of the rope are nailed down to points A and B.

2647039,Change of dimension of algebraic variety given by polynomials with variable coefficients,"If I have a finite collection of polynomials $f_i(c,z):\mathbb{C}^m\times\mathbb{C}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ where each $f_i$ is a polynomial in $z$ with some of the coefficients being elements of the vector $c$, the algebraic variety $$\mathcal{A}_c=\{z:f_i(c,z)=0\text{ for all }i\}$$ is dependent on $c$. I conjecture that there exists an algebraic variety $\mathcal{C}\subset\mathbb{C}^m$, not equal to $\mathbb{C}^m$, and a $d\geq 0$ such that $\text{dim}(\mathcal{A}_c)=d$ if $c\not\in\mathcal{C}$ and $\text{dim}(\mathcal{A}_c)>d$ if $c\in\mathcal{C}$. $\mathcal{C}=\emptyset$ would mean $\text{dim}(\mathcal{A}_c)$ is independent of $c$ which is sensible. 
This is trivially true in the case of one polynomial or if $n=1$, and in the case of two polynomials quadratic in $(z_1,z_2)$ (see below). If this or some similar result is true, could someone point me in the direction of the literature? Or any material that discuss such polynomials? I haven't found any but it seems like an elementary problem to consider, and even if this conjecture is exactly right I would like a more rich list of results for future reference. In fact I imagine the subsets $C_k\subset\mathbb{C}^m$ for which $\text{dim}(\mathcal{A}_c)=k$ form a stratification, where $C_{k+1}\subset\text{clos}(C_k)$ for all $k$, and for each $k$,  $\bigcup_{l\geq k}C_l$ is a variety. In the case where $$f_1(z_1,z_2)=az_1^2+bz_1z_2+cz_2^2=d,\\
f_2(z_1,z_2)=ez_1^2+fz_1z_2+gz_2^2=h,$$ consider them to be quadratics in $z_1$, set the roots of the quadratics to be equal, as they are given by the quadratic formula, and show that this is equivalent to $z_2$ solving a quartic whose coefficients are polynomial in $a$ through $h$. $\text{dim}(\mathcal{A}_c)>0$ if and only if this quartic is satisfied for infinitely many $z_2$ (as we need the roots to agree infinitely often), so the coefficients of the quartic must equal 0. This sketch doesn't take into account degenerate cases, $a=0$, etc., but it is only motivating.

To fix ideas, consider
$$ \sigma_n = \frac{1}{1+\alpha n^2},$$
but I would like to know if there are results more in general, for $\sigma_n$ satisfying the properties above. Now, by the hypothesis we know that
$$\sum_{n\geq 1} \sigma_n x_n$$
is absolutely convergent for any $\alpha>0$. What I'm interested in is understanding if the following rescaled series admits limit as $\alpha\to 0$:
$$\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{n\geq 1} \sigma_n x_n}{\displaystyle \sum_{n\geq 1} \sigma_n}.$$
My intuition tells me that, since $\sigma_n\to 1$ as $\alpha\to 0$, it will tend to some sort of uniform distribution, i.e.
$$\lim_{\alpha\to 0} \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{n\geq 1} \sigma_n x_n}{\displaystyle \sum_{n\geq 1} \sigma_n} 
= \lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N x_n,$$
assuming the RHS is well defined. So the question is: is my intuition correct? Or is it correct under suitable assumptions on $\{x_n\}_n$ or $\{\sigma_n(\alpha)\}$? This is not an exercise, it's something that has come up in a project I'm working on, and usually I don't deal with this type of problems so I don't know how to approach it. Any help is appreciated! EDIT: when I talk about assumptions on $\sigma_n$ I mean possiblle assumptions in addition to the ones I'm already imposing. Moreover, I'm more interested in understanding if the limit exists and what it looks like, rather then force the assumptions in order to make it become what my intuition tells me it should be. To make it clear: I'm mainly interested in the case
$$\sigma_n=\frac{1}{1+\alpha n^2}$$
but there are lots of other choices of $\sigma_n$ which satisfy the assumptions, as for example
$$\sigma_n=\frac{1}{1+\alpha n^c}\ \text{ for some } c>1$$
but also things like
$$\sigma_n=\frac{1}{1+\alpha n!}$$
with the latter example decaying much faster then the others. So I'm trying to understand what would be the limit of the ratio in the first example, and if it would change taking the other choices or it would be still the same.","['sequences-and-series', 'limits']"

\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{mn} X_k }{b_{mn}} =
\frac{b_{n}}{b_{mn}} \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n} X_k }{b_{n}} +
\cdots +
\frac{b_{n}}{b_{mn}}\frac{\sum_{k=(m-1)n}^{mn} X_k }{b_{n}}.

$$
\qquad\beta_m \xi_1+\cdots+ \beta_m \xi_m

where $\beta_k := \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{b_{n}}{b_{mn}}$ and $\xi_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$. But evaluating the limit in the LHS of $(II)$, I have that
$
\beta_m \xi_1+\cdots+ \beta_m \xi_m \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)

$$ For $S_n\sum_{k=1}^n X_k$, we have that
$$
E\Big[\frac{S^2_n}{n}\wedge M \Big] \longrightarrow E[\sigma \xi^2 \wedge M] \text{ as } n \longrightarrow \infty 
$$
for all $M>0$, but the RHS is always smaller than $1$. And if $E[X_k^2]=\infty$, by monotone convergence 
$$
E\Big[\frac{S^2_n}{n}\wedge M \Big] \longrightarrow E[X_k^2] \text{ as } M \longrightarrow \infty 
$$ Which, with a bit of care can be show to be a contradiction, hence $E[X_k^2]<\infty$. So to the parts that I am finding difficult: Does the limit $(II)$ for $(I)$ to make sense? If not, does it exist in the case that $b_n e^{cn} \longrightarrow $ for all $c>0$? Does $(III)$ imply $(IV)$?","['probability-theory', 'central-limit-theorem', 'probability', 'random-variables']"

2647746,Dividing balls into boxes with capacity limits,"Problem: In how many ways can you divide $13$ identical balls into $3$ different boxes
$k_1$, $k_2$, $k_3$, such that $k_1$ contains no more than $5$ balls, $k_2$ contains no more than $6$ balls and $k_3$ contains no more than $4$ balls? My idea: So my idea is to use the following theorem:

2647782,Curve of fractal triangle.,"Here's a triangle related to the Hokkaido tiling by Shigeki Akiyama.  I believe Stewart Hinsley found this particular tiling. The outer fractal triangle is divided into two similar fractal triangles. Is there a good generator for the fractal curves of the boundary? EDIT:  With help from William R. Somsky, Dieter Steemann, and Дмитрий Мехонцев, I managed to boil the boundary down to the following code. r = Root[-1 - #1^2 + #1^3 &, 3];
init1 = { -1, r, r^3, - r^4};
init2 = {-r^6, -r^4, -1, -(r^3 + r^7)};
cowed[comp_] := First /@ Split[Flatten[RootReduce[#[[1]] + 
 (#[[2]] - #[[1]]) {0, -r^5, r^5 + 1, 1}] & /@ 
 Partition[comp, 2, 1, 1], 1]];
Graphics[{EdgeForm[Black], Green, 
 Polygon[ReIm[Nest[cowed[#] &, init1, 5]]], Blue, 
 Polygon[ReIm[Nest[cowed[#] &, init2, 5]]]}] Behold the fractal cow-nautilus !","['tiling', 'curves', 'fractals', 'geometry']"
2647811,Can an ample line bundle be chosen to be a pushforward from a specified open?,"Let $j: U \to X$ be an open dense map of quasiprojective varieties. Is there an ample line bundle $\mathcal L$ on $U$ such that $j_\ast \mathcal L$ is also an ample line bundle? As pointed out by Saal Hardali in the comments below, it's not immediately clear that there's even a line bundle $\mathcal L$ on $U$ such that $j_\ast \mathcal L$ is a line bundle, never mind ample. I suppose that makes me a bit greedy, but so be it!",['algebraic-geometry']

$$y'' + \left(4x-\frac{2}{x}\right)y' + 4x^2y= 3xe^{x^2}.$$ I've been told to use $t = x^2$ along with change of variable to solve it, but it's clear that's not possible due to the singularity on $x = 0$ on the term $\frac{2}{x}$. I tried using  Frobenius method, but not luck with the solution. I would appreciate any help on how to solve it. Thanks in advance.","['frobenius-method', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
