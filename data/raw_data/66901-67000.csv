795952,Is $n^2 + n + 1$ prime for all n?,"I recently stumbled across this question in a test. Paul says that ""$n^2+n+1$ is prime $\forall\:n\in \mathbb{N}$"". Paul is correct, because... Paul is wrong, because... The answers sheet says that ""all answers providing a valid counterexample, e.g. $n=4$, are valid; however, I'm interested in understanding why - is there some sort of theorem which can predict whether a polynomial is prime or not? What I tried was: $n^2+n+1$ can be factorized as $(n+\frac{1+\sqrt{3}i}{2})(n+\frac{1-\sqrt{3}i}{2})$. Neither of these factors is a suitable factor (i.e. is natural, different from $1$, and different from $n^2+n+1$) for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$, therefore $n^2+n+1$ must be prime $\forall\:n\in\mathbb{N}$. Instead, $n^2-1$ can be factorized as $(n+1)(n-1)$. The factor $(n+1)$ is a suitable factor (i.e. natural, different from $1$, and different from $n^2-1$) for $n>2$; therefore, $n^2-1$ is not prime for $n>2$. However, the above reasoning is clearly wrong, because ""$n^2+n+1$ is prime $\forall\:n\in\mathbb{N}$"" doesn't hold for the case $n=4$. What is wrong in the reasoning? Can one tell whether a polynomial $p(n)$ is prime for all $n$ a priori ?","['prime-numbers', 'prime-factorization', 'discrete-mathematics']"

796040,The only irrep of a group of order p over a field of characteristic p is trivial,"I found an answer to my bigger question here , but I'm curious about my attempted proof in the case where $|G|=p$.  I'm nearly certain this does not work, but I can still learn something from it.  Do I have the right idea at all? Let $p$ be a prime, $P=\langle c \rangle$ a group of order $p$, and $F$ a field of characteristic $p$.  I want to show that the only irreducible representation of $P$ over $F$ is the trivial representation.  I am told to do this ""using the fact that $F$ contains all $p$th roots of $1$ (namely $1$ itself)."" I am not sure about how to use the $p$th roots (just $1 \in F$), but here's what I did: Let $A$ be a left $FP$-module, where $FP$ is the group ring of $P$ over $F$.  Also, let $P$ be a left $F$-module.  Take an element $0 \ne g \in A$ and consider the elements $g, (1c)g, (1c^2)g, ..., (1c^{p-1})g$.  Then these elements form a nontrivial proper(?) submodule of $A$ since for an arbitrary $a_1c^{j_1}+\cdots + a_pc^{j_p} \in FP$, we have $(a_1c^{j_1}+\cdots + a_pc^{j_p})(1c^ig)=\cdots=(a_1c^{i+j_1} + \cdots + a_pc^{i+j_p})g = c^kg$ for some $c^k \in P$, since $P$ is an $F$-module.  It follows that $A$ is reducible, and we have proved the contrapositive. Thanks.","['representation-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

796119,Why do we have that Hom is an exact functor in the situation described below?,"We are given a finite $p$-group $G$ and a finite $G$-module $M$ such that $pM=0$ (therefore $M$ is in particular a $\mathbb{F}_p$-vector space). In addition we have an arbitrary $G$-module $N$ which is also $\mathbb{F}_p$-vector space. Then we consider the short exact sequence 
$$0\longrightarrow M^G \overset{i}{\longrightarrow} M \overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow} M/M^G \longrightarrow 0$$
with $i$, reps. $\pi$, the natural inclusion, resp. projection. Since $Hom(\cdot,N)$ (here $Hom(\cdot,N)=Hom_\mathbb{Z}(\cdot,N)$, that is, we consider only the group structure of the modules, i.e. $Hom(\cdot,N)$ denotes group moprhisms) is a contravariant left-exact functor, we get the exact sequence
$$0\longrightarrow Hom\left(M/M^G,N\right)\longrightarrow Hom(M,N)\longrightarrow Hom\left(M^G,N\right)$$ of $G$-modules. However there is even more, we have that $Hom(M,N)\longrightarrow Hom\left(M^G,N\right)$ is surjective. (I know it is true, but I am not able to show it.) so that the above exact sequence extends to $$0\longrightarrow Hom\left(M/M^G,N\right)\longrightarrow Hom(M,N)\longrightarrow Hom\left(M^G,N\right)\longrightarrow 0$$ I was trying to show that we have a split of $i$ (i.e. a map, say $t$, such that $t\circ i=id_{M^G}$) with something of the form $$m\in M \longmapsto \sum_{g\in G}g.m \in M^G$$ but it does not work.

796262,Contradiction with complex gaussians...,"So, I am computing something seemingly simple involving complex gaussians and constants, but I am getting a big contradiction in my calculations. The setup: Let $C$ be a complex constant, that is, $C = c_r + jc_i$. Let $G$ be a complex gaussian variable, $G = g_r + jg_i$, where $g_r$ and $g_i$ are both uncorrelated, and where each are $\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$. I am computing $z = |C + G|^2$. The problem: Now, before I go on, it is obvious that the variable $z$, must always be greater than or equal to $0$, owning to the $| \cdot |^2$ operation. However when I open up and compute $z$, I get an expression that seems like it CAN be less than $0$. Opening up $z$, I get $$
z = (c_r^2 + c_i^2) + 2\Big[c_rg_r + c_ig_i \Big] + (g_r^2 + g_i^2)
$$ The first term is a constant, and will always be greater than or equal to zero. The last term is has a gamma distribution, and by definition, will also always be greater than or equal to zero. However, the middle term is simply a summation of two gaussians, but this means that there is a finite probability that they take on a value of less than zero, meaning that $z$ can also be less than zero! But $z$ can never be less than zero. This is the contradiction... I am not sure where I am making a mistake in my reasoning...

796268,Tensor Product of Algebras: Multiplication Definition,"I've managed to get a weak grip on what the tensor product of two vector spaces is.

In order for this to be bilinear we must have relations like  $x(y+z)=xy+xz$ (x,y,z are tensors here). I can't show that this is true: you can't in general simplify two tensors $y$ and $z$ into a new tensor of the form $v\otimes w$ (i.e the sum won't necessarily be a pure tensor). But then the multiplication isn't defined for a sum of pure tensors, only for pure tensors. What can I do here? Thanks for any replies!","['tensor-products', 'abstract-algebra']"

796358,"Question about Pasch's Postulate, line going through all three sides of a triangle","I've been reading the textbook Elementary Geometry from an Advanced Standpoint by Edwin E. Moise (3rd ed.).  My problem with his wording of Pasch's Postulate, and then a subsequent problem which aggravates my confusion. To start, this is his exact wording for Pasch's Postulate: ""The Posutulate of Pasch: Given a triangle $\triangle ABC$, and a line $L$ in the same plane.  If $L$ contains a point $E$, between $A$ and $C$, then $L$ intersects either $\overline{AB}$ or $\overline{BC}$."" This could mean one of two things:  Either that the line $L$ must intersect exactly one of either $\overline{AB}$ or $\overline{BC}$; or that the line $L$ must intersect at least one of either $\overline{AB}$ or $\overline{BC}$ (it can't turn around and leave). When I look at the other resources (mostly wikipedia), I lean towards the former.  However, in the same section, the reader is asked to prove that: ""If $L$ contains no vertex of the triangle, then $L$ cannot intersect all of the three sides"" from Pasch's Postulate. If the former were true, the proof of this statement would be ""Pasch's Postulate QED,"" which seems a little bit too easy.  However, I've spent hours trying to figure out how to do it with the latter defintion (it could intersect both), but I just get so confused because my lines aren't straight.  I'm completely at a loss. So my questions is: Which of my two interpretations is correct?  Can this problem be proved without using the former definition? EDIT: I've realized (with the help of one Andre Nicolas in the comments), that clearly the former definition doesn't work because the line could pass through $B$.  However, that leaves me with the same problem:  How does one go about proving that the line does not go through all three sides of the triangle without passing through a vertex?","['axiomatic-geometry', 'geometry', 'triangles']"

796635,Every metrizable Toronto space is discrete.,"$X$ is a Toronto space if for every $Y \subseteq X$ such that $|Y|=|X|$ then $Y$ is homeomorphic to $X$. I am trying to prove that every metrizable Toronto space is discrete. I have the following Ask a Topologist post which contains an overview for the proof. However, it uses concepts from descriptive set theory, in particular something about a Cantor-Bendixson resolution, which I have never heard before nor could find anything about. Does anyone have any hints/tips on how to prove this? What is a Cantor-Bendixson resolution? The following is a MathJaxified version of the proof given in the above link: Let $\DeclareMathOperator{\CL}{cl}X$ be a non-discrete metric Toronto space: it means that if $|X| = \kappa$
  and $Y$ is a subset of $X$, $|Y| = \kappa$ then $Y$ is homeomorphic to $X$. Then There is an isolated point in $X$. (Choose two nonempty disjoint open 
  sets $U$, $V$ in $X$. Then the union of $X \setminus U$ and $X \setminus V$ is $X$, hence at least one of these sets has cardinality $\kappa$: assume it is $X \setminus V$. If $y$ is a point in $U$ then $Y = (X \setminus V) \cup \{y\}$ is homeomorphic to $X$ and has an 
  isolated point.) The set $S$ of isolated points is dense in $X$. (If $\CL(S)$ has cardinality 
  $\kappa$, then we are done. Otherwise $X \setminus \CL(S)$ has cardinality $\kappa$ and
  does not contain an isolated point, contrary to 1.) It follows that if $X$ is not discrete then $|S| = \lambda < \kappa$, specially 
  the density of $X$ is less than $\kappa$. $X$ is scattered. (For $Y$ subset $X$ let $S(Y)$ denote the set of isolated 
  points in $Y$. Then put $S_0 = S(X)$, $S_\alpha = S(X \setminus \bigcup \{ S_\beta : \beta < \alpha \})$ for $\alpha < \kappa$. As $|S_\alpha| = \lambda$ for every $\alpha < \kappa$, 
  $S_\alpha$ is dense and open in $X \setminus \bigcup \{ S_\beta : \beta < \alpha \}$. Put 
  $Y = \bigcup \{ S_\beta : \beta < \alpha \}$. Thus we get a Cantor-Bendixson 
  resolution of $Y$.) Up to this point, we used only that $X$ is Hausdorff. If $X$ is metric then 
  (as the weight and density of a metric space are equal and the cardinality
  of a scattered space is less or equal to its weight, we get a 
  contradiction: $\kappa = |X| \leq \text{density of }X \leq \lambda < \kappa$.",['general-topology']

The equation is $y'(x) = y(x) \cdot \cos(x + y(x))$.

I am facing a problem which is straining my memory of linear algebra. I have: Three points with known coordinates, forming a triangle in space. Let the coordinates be R(top), P(left bottom) and Q(right bottom) (only rough positions) I'm not interested in the triangle as such, but in its two lines QP and QR These lines are tangent to a circle of known radius (basically I'm trying to smooth the angle via a radius, like in CAD) I need the equation of the circle, so I can pick any point I want between P and R to smooth out the angle. The angle is <180°, so there should exist one solution (correct me if I'm wrong) I found an image which illustrates my problem: You can see my points R,P,Q, aswell as my circle which is tangent to both rays originating in Q. Please note, that PQ does not necessarily have to be horizontal and that the angle $\alpha$ is not always 50°. My goal is to calculate the origin O and thus the complete equation of my circle in the form $\vec{r}(t)=\vec{c}+r\cdot\cos{\varphi}\cdot\vec{a}+r\cdot\sin{\varphi}\cdot\vec{b}$ Plan I have made so far: Calculate $\vec{PR}$ Calculate $a=\arccos{\frac{\vec{QP}\bullet\vec{QR}}{\left|\vec{QP}\right|\cdot\left|\vec{QR}\right|}}$ Calculate $b=\frac{\pi}{2}-a$ From here on it gets tricky. I know, that the origin is on the ray seperating the angle in Q in exact half. If I project that ray on my line $\vec{PQ}$, will I end up in the exact middle?

797892,Motivation for Weil pairing,"The Weil pairing 
$$e_\phi:E[\phi]\times E'[\hat{\phi}]\to \mu_n$$ 
for an elliptic curve is defined as follows. Let $\phi:E\to E'$ be an isogeny of degree $n$ and $\hat\phi:E'\to E$ be the dual isogeny. Given $(S,T)\in E[\phi]\times E'[\hat{\phi}]$, pick $g$ such that $\text{div}(g)=\phi^*((T)-(O))$, and define $e_\phi(S,T)=\frac{g(X+S)}{g(X)}$ (choose any $X$). Of course, one has to check this is well-defined, in particular that it doesn't depend on $X$, i.e., $\frac{\tau_S^*g}{g}$ is a constant where $\tau_S$ is translation by $S$. This definition is not at all transparent to me. I know that we want the Weil pairing because we want a nondegenerate, bilinear, alternating (when $\phi=[n]$), Galois invariant, compatible map (see Silverman III.8.1). But given that we want a map satisfying these conditions, how might one come up with the right definition? For instance, in the case of elliptic curves over $\mathbb C$ one could map to a lattice and define the map using the determinant---this seems a motivated construction since we get a canonical way of identifying $E[n]$ with $(\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z)^2$ (I don't know the details of this, I believe it's in Lang's Elliptic Functions).

Here is a quick outline, let $A$ be a member of the set of all open subsets in $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathcal{T}$. $\forall q \in A$, where $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, there exists a rational radius $r_q$ such that $(q-r_q,q+r_q) \subseteq A$. Then $A=\bigcup_{q \in A} (q-r_q,q+r_1)$. Every $A \in \mathcal{T}$ is completely defined by the set $\{(r,r_q) : q \in \mathbb{Q} \cap A \}$. I want to approach the problem where $\mathcal{T}$ is the set of all convex polygons in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in a similar fashion. However, in the above problem concerning open set I could find a way to completely characterize an open set using members of $\mathbb{Q}$. Does a convex polygon in $\mathbb{R}^2$ have any such defining characteristics?","['geometry', 'elementary-set-theory']"

798124,why generating function $A(z) = 1 + z + z^2 + \cdots$ can be denoted as $\frac{1}{1-z}$,"It is easy to see that $1 + z + z^2 + \cdots$ is equal to $\frac{1}{1-z}$ when $1 > z > 0$ and for $z >= 1$, they are not equivalent. So I have thought $\frac{1}{1-z}$ is just a short for the more complex formula $1 + z + z^2 + \cdots$ and it has nothing to do with the value of the function. But later when I look at some materials about generating function (e.g. analytic combinatorics), I find that people also do some algebra operations on the generating function. For example, for the problem of how many trees are there with $N$ nodes, the generating function is $G(z) = z(1 + G(z) + G(z)^2 + \cdots)$ and thus $G(z)=\frac{z}{1-G(z)}$. I regard $\frac{1}{1-G(z)}$ is just a short of $1 + G(z) + G(z)^2 + \cdots$ here and all things look good. To get the closed form of $G(z)$, however, they transform $G(z)=\frac{z}{1-G(z)}$ to $G(z)-G(z)^2=z$, which is an algebra operation. We know that $1 + G(z) + G(z)^2 + \cdots$ and $\frac{1}{1-G(z)}$ are not necessarily the same. So is the solution after we solving $G(z)-G(z)^2=z$ exactly the $G(z)$ we expect?","['discrete-mathematics', 'sequences-and-series', 'number-theory', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

$$
dX_t = 3dt + 2\sqrt{X_t}dB_t
$$ The final objective is to find $\mathbb{P}\left(\tau_0  < \tau_5 \right)$, which by definition is computed as:
$$
\mathbb{P}\left(\tau_0  < \tau_5 \right) = \frac{s(5) - s(x)}{s(5) - s(0)}
$$
where $s(x)$ is the scale function, defined as:
$$
s(x) = \int_{x_0}^{x}exp\left(-{\int_{y_0}^{y}\frac{2\mu(z)}{\sigma^2(z)}dz}\right)dy
$$ Because the scale function is unique up to an affine transformation , one can take any $x_o$ and $y_o$ in the real line. Evidently, $\mu(x) = 3$ and $\sigma(x) = 2\sqrt{x}$. For convenience I take $y_0 = 1$ and obtain the final expression for $s(x)$: $$
s(x) = \int_{x_0}^{x}exp\left(-{\int_{1}^{y}\frac{3}{2z}dz}\right)dy = \int_{x_0}^{x}y^{-\frac{3}{2}}dy
$$ And here comes the problem: if I choose $x_0 = 0$, then I don't have a problem calculating $s(0)$ (which is clearly $0$), but now when I calculate 
$$s(5) = \int_{0}^{5}y^{-\frac{3}{2}}dy  = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} + \frac{2}{0}$$ 
which is an indeterminate form, which means something earlier has gone wrong. if I choose $x_0 \ne 0$, then I face the same problem when calculating $s(0)$. Now the question is: how can I correctly separate the calculation of $s(x)$ so that I can obtain two different valid expressions for the scale function, one for the case where $x = 0$ and $x\ne 0$?

I simulated a few ""races"" as an example: Race 1: p = [p1,p2,...,p6] = [50,10,10,10,10,10] --> Total wins for each horse from 100,000 simulations = [95928,831,776,839,825,801] Race 2: p= [50,30,5,5,5,5] --> [78231,21636,29,43,30,31] You get the idea. So the question is given an initial set of probabilities for each of the 6 horses, what are the final ""winning"" probabilities? Is there a formula (complicated or not) that describes this? Thanks to everyone who gives it a shot!","['statistics', 'probability']"

I tried the following: 1)$0\leq z \leq 1$, $-sqrt{1-z} \leq y \leq \sqrt{1-z}$ but I couldnt find the x variation (same for $x$ instead of $y$) But maybe there is an easy one that I can't see I would be glad if someone could explain how to write, step by step, a region.

798522,Is this notation good for the chain rule derivative?,"When we take this derivative, for example: $$y = \log(\sin x)$$
We call $u = \sin x$, so we have: $$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d y}{du}\frac{du}{dx} = \frac{1}{u}\cos x = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}$$ But for me, it's better to do: $$\frac{d\log\color{Blue}{\sin x}}{d\color{Blue}{\sin x}}\frac{d\sin \color{Red}{x}}{d\color{Red}{x}} = \frac{1}{\color{Blue}{\sin x}}\cos \color{Red}{x}$$
It makes easy to do the 'pattern-matching' just by looking at the differentials. No substitution. I know that $\frac{d \log[\mbox{something}]}{d[\mbox{something}]} = \frac{1}{\mbox{something}}$ for example. However, it looks 'hairy' when I try with larger derivatives, like, for the function: $$(13x^2-5x+8)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
we do:
$$\frac{d(13x^2-5x+8)^{\frac{1}{2}}}{dx} = \frac{d\color{Green}{(13x^2-5x+8)}^{\frac{1}{2}}}{d\color{Green}{(13x^2-5x+8)}}\frac{d(13x^2-5x+8)}{dx} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\color{Green}{13x^2-5x+8}}}(26x -5)$$
but it's really better for me to do like this, instead of doing the bla bla bla of changing variables and stuff. But I'm afraid my teacher does not accept this. Is this notation/way of doing good for you guys? One more example : $$\frac{d}{dx}\sqrt{(\sin(7x+\ln(5x)))} = $$ $$\frac{d[\color{Blue}{\sin(7x+\ln(5x))}]^{1/2}}{d[\color{Blue}{\sin(7x+\ln(5x))}]}\frac{d[\sin\color{Red}{(7x+\ln(5x))}]}{d[\color{Red}{7x+\ln(5x)}]}\left[\frac{d[7\color{Purple}{x}]}{d[\color{Purple}{x}]} + \frac{d[\ln(\color{Purple}{5x})]}{d[\color{Purple}{5x}]}\frac{d[5x]}{d[x]}\right] = $$
$$\frac{1}{2}\left[\color{Blue}{\sin(7x+\ln(5x))}\right]^{-1/2}\cdot\cos(\color{Red}{7x+\ln(5x)})\left[7 + \frac{1}{\color{Purple}{5x}}\cdot 5\right]$$

798529,Choosing something of $0$ probability,"First of all, i am only a newbie and i am pretty sure that my thinking is faulty somewhere, so along the way as i explain things i will probably say something with an error and i hope you will help me find this error. This idea has been bogging me for some time already. Imagine picking a random real number. Without the loss of generality, let the picking interval be $(0,1)$ , or $<0,1>$ . Now, since there is an infinite amount of real numbers, the probability of choosing one specific number is $0$ . Yet, we have to pick one number when choosing randomly, let's say it's $0.5$ . We have now picked a number that had $0$ chance to be picked. How is this possible? Thank you for all the answers, i have had hard time deciding what to pick as ""correct"" answer as i came seeking answers.

$$\sin(\theta) = \cos \left(\tfrac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)$$ Both are the same entity. But is sine the copy of cosine, or is cosine the copy of sine? If you really don't see any difference between these two functions, my question could be rephrased as such: If for the rest of your life you had to only use one of the two following pairs of functions: $\cos(\theta)$ and $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)$ $\sin(\theta)$ and $\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)$ ...which pair would you choose?","['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'soft-question']"
798552,Hartshorne notation in Theorem 3.4,"I have a nitpicky question about notation in Hartshorne's proof of his Theorem 3.4 in his AG book; in particular, it is in his proof of part (b). The point in contention is the line One checks easily that $\phi_i^*(\mathfrak m'_P)=\mathfrak m_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}$. I already made my way through some confusion regarding $S(Y)_{(x_i)}$ v.s. $S(Y)_{((x_i))}$ thanks to this post . My question here is different. In short, I am getting stuck at the notation $\mathfrak m_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}$. At first, I thought the multiplication was taking place in the larger ring $S(Y)_{x_i}$, since, by abuse of parenthesis, I thought we had something like $$(\mathfrak m_P)\cdot (S(Y)_{(x_i)}).$$
That is to say, since the homogeneous generators of $\mathfrak m_P$ have strictly positive degree, the product $\mathfrak m_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}$ does not live in $S(Y)_{(x_i)}$. I now believe this interpretation of the notation is wrong, even though it is the first interpretation that suggested itself to me. I now believe the correct interpretation of the notation $\mathfrak m_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}$ is `the degree zero part of the localization of $\mathfrak m_P$ with respect to the homogenous element $x_i$, sitting in the ring $S(Y)_{(x_i)}$.'
That is to say,
$$\mathfrak m_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)} \subset S(Y)_{(x_i)}.$$
This second interpretation agrees with my understanding of the image of $\mathfrak m'_P$ under the map $\phi_i^*$, which seems to be composed exclusively of (degree zero) elements in the ring $S(Y)_{(x_i)}$, not the larger ring $S(Y)_{x_i}$. If the second interpretation is correct, it would be clearer to me if $$\mathfrak m_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}$$ were instead written as $$(\mathfrak m_P)_{(x_i)}$$ or something.","['notation', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Of course there is nothing wrong: the second ""differential form"" is not $\mathbb{C}$-linear. Hence, it is not a true complex differential form. However it is not real valued, so it is not a real differential form either. So what it is? Question . Can you clarify the nature of the objects $dz, d\overline{z}$ above?

798571,A property for perfect numbers,"If $n=\prod\limits_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i}$, is a perfect number, with $p_i$ distinct primes, $\alpha_i\geq1$, then for each $i$ there is a $j \in \{1,\ldots,k\}$ such that $p_i \mid (p_j^{\alpha_j+1}-1)$. $j$ is quite clearly not equal to $i$. Proof Note that $\sigma(n)\phi(n)=n\prod\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{p_i^{\alpha_i+1}-1}{p_i}$. Now $n$ is perfect so $\sigma(n)=2n$, i.e. $2\phi(n)=\prod\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{p_i^{\alpha_i+1}-1}{p_i}$. Lhs is an integer so must the rhs be. $\square$ It's rather trivial for even perfect numbers. e.g. $n=2^{p-1}(2^p-1)$, $p$ prime and $2^p-1$ a mersenne prime. Then $2^p-1\mid 2^{p-1+1}-1$ and $2 \mid (2^{2p}-2^{p+1}+1-1)$. I noticed this while studying yesterday, just curious where this might have been in use already? Or even if it's any use at all... Note: The condition is necessary but not sufficient since $n=40$ satisfies it and is not perfect. i.e. $40=2^3\cdot5$ and $5\mid2^4-1$ and $2\mid 5^2-1$. Apart from being even and $5$ not a mersenne prime, $2\cdot\phi(40)=32\neq36=\frac{2^4-1}{2}\cdot\frac{5^2-1}{5}$. I mean in principal you could deduce some possibly other not very helpful things like, given eulers form for odd perfect numbers $n=q^\alpha \prod\limits_{i=1}^k p_i^{2\epsilon_i}$, $q\equiv\alpha\equiv1 \pmod{4}$ that $q \mid p_i^{2\epsilon_1+1}-1$ for some $i$, and hence $ord_q(p) \mid 2\epsilon_i+1$. $ord_q(p)$ stands for the multiplicative order of $p$ modulo $q$. And also if $p_i^{2\epsilon_1+1}-1=kq$ then $k \equiv 0,2 \pmod{4}$ for $p_i\equiv 1,3 \pmod{4}$. That's all I could think of off the top of my head... Update: Also if $q=5$ and $3 \nmid n$ then $\alpha\geq 5$","['perfect-numbers', 'reference-request', 'number-theory']"
