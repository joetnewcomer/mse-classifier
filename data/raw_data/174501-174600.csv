3116113,Show that if $\phi \circ T$ is bounded for every $\phi\in Y^*$ then $T$ is bounded,"Show that if $T:X \to Y$ is a linear map between Banach spaces and $\phi \circ T$ is bounded for every $\phi\in Y^*$ then $T$ is bounded. The given hint is to prove the contrapositive. 'Progress': Suppose $T$ is unbounded. Then there exist $x_n \in X$ such that $\left\lVert x_n\right\rVert=1$ and $\left\lVert Tx_n\right\rVert \geq n$ for all $n$ . For each $n$ there is a support functional $\phi_n$ at $Tx_n$ : $\phi_n \in Y^*, \left\lVert \phi_n\right\rVert=1, \phi_n(Tx_n)=\left\lVert Tx_n\right\rVert$ . I then applied the (contrapositive of the) Principle of Uniform Boundedness to the set of linear maps $\phi_n \circ T$ before realising that this doesn't even work because we don't know that the maps $\phi_n \circ T$ are bounded. So really I've made no progress and this is mostly to show that I've tried. Though I expect the solution will use the PUB somehow. Any small hints would be appreciated (please do not spoil the solution).","['functional-analysis', 'unbounded-operators']"

3116131,Is this physical model exactly solvable?,"There exists a popular model in the Physics of heavy quark bound systems, called the Cornell potential model , in which the inter-quark potential is modeled to vary with radial distance $r$ as $$V(r) = - \frac{\kappa}{r} + \frac{r}{a^2}$$ The mathematical problem is reduced to solving the radial part of the Schrodinger equation $$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 u}{dr^2} + \left[ V(r) + \frac{l(l+1)}{2mr^2}\right]u = Eu$$ for the above potential, hence obtaining the reduced wavefunction $u(r)$ . The reduced wavefunction $u(r)$ is subject to the boundary conditions $u(r=0) = 0$ , and $u'(r=0) = R(0) =$ some number $C$ . Each of the constants $\hbar$ , $m$ , $\kappa$ , and $a$ are positive numbers. $l$ serves the role of azimuthal quantum number, and can take non-negative integer values, i.e. $l = 0, 1, 2, 3 \ldots$ However, this is generally fed in as a constant input, and choice of $l$ segregates solutions into various categories, e.g. $l=0$ states are the $s-$ wave states, $l=1$ are the $p-$ wave states, and so on. The energy eigenvalue $E$ can, in general, be either positive (called a Scattering State solution), or negative (called a Bound State solution); however, in this case, we are concerned with the latter variety ( $E<0$ ) since the model caters precisely to bound heavy-quark systems. Scanning across the literature, one only finds (abundantly) numerical/iterative approaches applied to this mathematical problem, and Wolfram Alpha also succumbs before it. My questions are: Is this physical model exactly solvable, i.e. is there any general solution to this differential equation for $u(r)$ , for any $E<0$ ? If not, what is the exact problem with this potential which hinders reaching an exact solution. ( I say that because the singularity at $r=0$ is due to inverse $r$ part, but if the second term was missing from the potential, then the pure inverse $r$ potential is known to be exactly solvable, it is a textbook problem taught in all undergraduate Physics courses. ) Aside from numerical/iterative approaches, if there is any alternative method which can be used for this purpose, or can be used in circumventing this difficulty?","['mathematical-modeling', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'quantum-mechanics', 'physics', 'mathematical-physics']"

3116171,"How does the high school approach to classifying linear systems generalize to more variables, and why does it work?","If we have two linear equations in two variables, there may be $0$ , $1$ or infinitely-many solutions. The standard approach to working out which case we're dealing with is probably to use Gaussian elimination. However, in high schools around here, they don't teach Gaussian elimination, and instead expect students to use (something like) the following result: Theorem. Consider $a,b,c,d,p,q \in \mathbb{R}$ . Let $\Gamma(x,y)$ denote the following condition. $$ax+by = p$$ $$cx+dy = q$$ Define $\tilde{\Gamma} := \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : \Gamma(x,y)\}.$ Then: $\tilde{\Gamma}$ has exactly one element if and only if $ad\neq bc$ . $\tilde{\Gamma}$ has infinitely many elements if and only if $ad = bc$ and $bq = dp.$ $\tilde{\Gamma}$ has no elements if and only if $ad = bc$ and $bq \neq dp.$ (*I haven't actually proved this, and some nonzeroness assumptions might be necessary to make it fully technically correct.) What seems to be happening, in particular, is that minors play a role in the number of solutions. By a $k$ -minor of a matrix $M$ , I mean a determinant of a $k \times k$ submatrix of $M$ . What seems to be going on is that we have to look at the $2$ -minors of the ""augmented matrix"" $$
  \left[\begin{array}{rr|r}
    a & b & p \\
    c & d & q \\
  \end{array}\right]
$$ or, perhaps more precisely, the $2$ -minors of $$
  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
    a & b & -p \\
    c & d & -q \\
  \end{array}\right]
$$ which, due to multilinearity of the determinant in the columns of the matrices to which it can be applied, has the same $2$ -minors up to a change in sign. However, I don't really get what's going on here. I get that we can move to projective space by homogenizing the linear equations above to obtain $$ax+by -pz = 0$$ $$cx+dy-qz=0$$ This seems to have something do with it. I also get that there's a way to determine the rank of a matrix using its minors, and thus the nullity using the rank-nullity theorem. But this isn't enough to really understand what's going on. Question. How does this classification generalize to more variables and/or more equations, and does projective space have something to do with it? Why does it work, and what's really going on here?

3116195,Smooth proper variety over $\mathbb Q$ with everywhere bad reduction,"$\newcommand{\Spec}{\operatorname{Spec}}$ It is a well-known fact that a smooth projective variety over $\mathbb Q$ has good reduction almost everywhere, i.e. everywhere apart from finitely many points. In the language of schemes, this is almost obvious -- given projective equations of the variety $X/\mathbb Q$ , for some $n$ we can construct a projective model $\mathcal X\to\Spec\mathbb Z[1/n]$ of $X$ . Since a projective morphism is proper and the singular locus of $\mathcal X$ is closed, the set of points of $\Spec\mathbb Z[1/n]$ with singular fibers is closed, hence finite (since the generic fiber is smooth). When I've first learned this proof, it seemed somewhat clear to me this works for smooth proper varieties over $\mathbb Q$ , but my professor has pointed out that while the latter part of the argument goes through, there may be problems in constructing a model over a subscheme of $\Spec\mathbb Z$ . He couldn't, off the top of his head, answer whether such varieties could have infinitely many places of bad reduction, but he speculated the answer is yes. This is my question: Can a smooth proper variety over $\mathbb Q$ have infinitely many places of bad reduction? I have speculated about a much stronger failure as well: Can a smooth proper variety over $\mathbb Q$ have bad reduction everywhere (i.e. at every finite prime)? Note: I have added a reference-request tag because I strongly suspect the answer has been already addressed in the literature, but my searches were unsuccessful, mostly returning results about varieties with everywhere good reduction.","['algebraic-geometry', 'arithmetic-geometry', 'reference-request']"
3116196,Trying to understand a standard example of weakly but not strongly measurable function,"I consider quite a standard example of a function that is weakly measurable but is not strongly measurable. Unfortunatelly, I don't fully understand it. Let $X=l_2([0,1])$ . Then $X$ equipped with a standard inner product is a nonseparable Hilbert space. Since every Hilbert space has an orthonormal basis, let $\{e_t\,:\, t\in[0,1]\}$ denote an orthonormal basis of $X$ . Define a map $f:[0,1]\to X$ by $$f(t):=e_t$$ for all $t\in [0,1]$ . Assume the the measure $\mu$ we consider is the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$ . First, I'd like to prove that $f$ is weakly- $\mu$ measurable. Pick $x^*\in X^*$ . Then, invoking Riesz Representation Theorem we deduce that  there is unique $x\in X$ such that $$\langle x^*, f(t)\rangle_{X^*\times X}=\langle x, f(t) \rangle_{X}.$$ Hence, in our situation, we obtain that $$\langle x^*, f(t)\rangle_{X^*\times X}=\langle x, f(t) \rangle_{X}=\langle x, e_t \rangle_{X},$$ for all $t\in [0,1]$ . How to deduce that a function $g(t)=\langle x^*, f(t)\rangle_{X^*\times X}=0$ $\mu$ a.e. on $[0,1]$ ??? The only that comes to my mind is that $x=\sum_{t\in[0,1]}\langle x, e_t\rangle e_t$ , so $$\langle x^*, f(t)\rangle_{X^*\times X}=\langle x, f(t) \rangle_{X}=\langle x, e_t \rangle_{X}=\langle \sum_{t\in[0,1]}\langle x, e_t\rangle e_t, e_t \rangle_{X}=\sum_{t\in[0,1]}\langle x, e_t\rangle.$$ Anyway, having that $\langle x^*, f(\cdot)\rangle$ is $0$ $\mu$ a.e. will give its measurablity and in consequance the weak measurablity of $f$ . How to prove that $f$ is not strongly measurable? I try arguing by contradiction. Assume that $f$ is strongle measurble. Then, by Pettis's theorem, we deduce that there exists a subset $E\subset[0,1]$ such that $\mu(E)=0$ and $f([0,1]\setminus E)$ is (norm) separable. If $\mu(E)= 0$ , we deduce that $E$ is at most countable and so $[0,1]\setminus E$ is uncountable.

So, $x_n^2 \to x^2$ and $y_n \to y$ as $n \to \infty$ . Since $\forall n \in \mathbb N \ \ (x_n,y_n)\in A$ , $x_n^2\leq y$ $\forall n\in \mathbb N$ .

3116806,Why does weak-$L^2$ convergence not imply pointwise convergence for continuous functions?,"This question shows that $L^2$ convergence does not show pointwise convergence, even when the functions involved are continuous.  This strongly contradicts my intuition, because I thought that weak- $L^2$ convergence sufficed for the same. What is wrong with the following proof? Let $\{\psi_\delta\}_{\delta}$ be approximate identities and continuous $\{f_n\}\rightharpoonup f_{\infty}$ in $L^2$ .  We claim $f_{\infty}(0)=\lim_{n\to\infty}{f_n(0)}$ . To see this, fix $\epsilon$ .  There exists $\alpha$ such that for any $\delta<\alpha$ and continuous $g$ , $$\epsilon>|g(0)-\langle g,\psi_{\delta}\rangle|$$ For such $\delta$ , then, $$\epsilon+\langle g,\psi_{\delta}\rangle>g(0)$$ Now let $g=|f_{\infty}-f_n|$ ; we have $$\epsilon+\langle|f_{\infty}-f_n|,\psi_{\delta}\rangle>|f_{\infty}(0)-f_n(0)|$$ As $\{f_n\}\rightharpoonup f_{\infty}$ , we have $\lim_{n\to\infty}{\langle|f_{\infty}-f_n|,\psi_{\delta}\rangle}=0$ for any $\delta$ .  So take $n\to\infty$ ; we obtain $$\epsilon>\limsup_{n\to\infty}{|f_{\infty}(0)-f_n(0)|}$$ Now take $\epsilon\to0^+$ . Worked example We can test this with the example from the cited question: in $L^2([0,1])\cap C([0,1])$ , take $f_n(x)=\ln{\!(n)}e^{-nx}$ and $\psi_{\delta}(x)=\frac{1}{\delta}\chi_{[0,1]}\left(\frac{x}{\delta}\right)$ .  As $n\to\infty$ , $$\|f_n\|_2=\ln{(n)}\sqrt{\frac{1-e^{-2n}}{2n}}\to0$$ so $\{f_n\}_n\to0$ , and thus $\{f_n\}_n\rightharpoonup0$ . $f_n(0)=\ln{(n)}$ , so we should expect $$\lim_{\delta\to0^+}{\int_0^1{f_n(x)\psi_{\delta}(x)\,dx}}=\ln{(n)}$$ On the other hand, weak convergence should give $$\lim_{n\to\infty}{\int_0^1{f_n(x)\psi_{\delta}(x)\,dx}}=\int_0^1{0\cdot\psi_{\delta}(x)\,dx}=0$$ Well, $$\int_0^1{f_n(x)\psi_{\delta}(x)\,dx}=\frac{\ln{(n)}(1-e^{-n\delta})}{n\delta}$$ Taking $n\to\infty$ does yield $0$ , and $\delta\to0^+$ yields $\ln{(n)}$ !

3117339,"A single set of moves $S$ that, if repeated, solves the Rubik's cube from any state","I am looking for a proof verification. I often find these concepts simple, but struggle to communicate them clearly. Communication in mathematics is very important to me: Examples could be: Any mistakes or vagueness. Comments to make my arguments shorter. An alternative proof or reference to an alternative proof, I could not find this problem anywhere. I want to prove that it is not possible to have a Rubik's cube in an arbitrary state for which there exists a set of moves $S$ that solves the Cube. The restriction here is that we first look at a cube, if it's not solved, we close our eyes and apply that set of moves, look at it again, if it's not solved, repeat the same moves. We do this over and over again. Sure there is a very very long sequence of moves that goes through all possible configurations, but you might skip a solved cube if you have your eyes closed. No single set of moves $S$ exist, such that is solves the cube from any given configuration. We will show that there exists no set of moves $S$ that can solve the cube from any given starting position. We will argue by contradiction. Suppose it is possible to solve any state by repeating a certain set of moves. the moves then must cycle through every possible configuration, as every single configuration must lead to a solved cube, at some point. We then know that the Rubik's cube is cyclic and it has the single generator, namely  this set of moves called $S$ . Lemma: Any cyclic group is Abelian First observe that any element in a cyclic group can be represented in terms of the cycle generator $c$ , so for $a,b \in \mathbb Z$ we know that some arbitrary elements in this cyclic group are given by $x=c^a$ and $y = c^b$ .
Now notice that for any cyclic group we have that the generator $c$ satisfies $$xy=c^a c^b= c^{a+b}=c^{b+a}=c^b c^a=yx$$ because addition in $\mathbb{Z}$ is commutative, it is a ring after all. This means that if the group is cyclic it must also be Abelian, which it clearly isn't, we use $r^2 g^2 r^2 $ versus $r^2 r^2 g^2 $ as a counterexample. We reach a contradiction, hence no such set of moves $S$ exists. $\square$","['proof-verification', 'finite-groups', 'alternative-proof', 'group-theory', 'rubiks-cube']"

3117422,Trisecting an angle $\theta$ equally via applying trigonometry,"I found an article in a book about trisecting an angle equally. It was written there that Archimedes tried to solve that process by applying pure geometry (using only compass and scale without its reading). But he failed to do that. However, there was no other method by which the angle can be trisected equally. However, out of curiosity, I wanted to solve the problem with some another process. It was also narrated in that text that $\angle BCF$ = $\phi$ = $\frac{\theta}{3}$ , when $CD$ will be equal to $r$ . And $C$ is to be a surmised point so that $CD$ can be equal to $r$ . But I wanted to calculate the specific location of $C$ from the circumferential point $I$ and measure the length of $IC$ (the diagram is given below) through mathematical term. My Attempt: At first I made a reverse approach by drawing $\angle BCF$ = $\phi$ = $\frac{\theta}{3}$ . Than, I drew two altitude line $BF$ and $DG$ , where $BF$ $\perp$ $CE$ and $DG$ $\perp$ $CA$ . And than, I connected $AD$ and $DI$ . From right angled $\triangle DGC$ , $GC$ = $r\cos\phi$ and $DG$ = $r\sin\phi$ , because $DC$ = $r$ . Again, we get an isosceles $\triangle ABD$ with having $AB$ = $AD$ = $r$ . From the $\triangle ABC$ , we get $180^\circ-\theta$ + $\frac{\theta}{3}$ + $\angle ABD$ = $180^\circ$ Than calucating the value, I got $\angle ABD$ = $\frac{2\theta}{3}$ and so, from isosceles $\triangle ABD$ , $\angle BAD$ = $180^\circ$ - $\frac{4\theta}{3}$ and from here we can write that $\angle DAI$ = $\frac{\theta}{3}$ . In $\triangle ADI$ , $AD$ = $r$ and $AI$ = $r$ . So, $\triangle ADI$ is an isosceles and $\angle DIA$ = $\frac{540-\theta}{6}$ . And now from right angled $\triangle DIG$ , we get $\frac{DG}{IG}$ = $\tan(\frac{540-\theta}{6}$ ) $\implies$ $IG$ = $\frac{r\sin\phi}{\tan(\frac{540-\theta}{6})}$ Subtracting | $IG$ | from | $CG$ |, $|IC|$ = $r\cos\phi$ - $\frac{r\sin\phi}{\tan(\frac{540-\theta}{6})}$ $\implies$ $|IC|$ = $r\cos(\frac{\theta}{3})$ - $\frac{r\sin(\frac{\theta}{3})}{\tan(\frac{540-\theta}{6})}$ Here we get the value of $IC$ , and so the point $C$ has an exact and individual location depending on the radius of the circle and the value of the $\theta$ . Is my formula\answer correct? If it so, then I would like to see another method except trigonometry. And my query is that how can we find the length of $IC$ without applying trigonometry or in how many ways the angle $\theta$ can be trisected equally? If I have a mistake, then please forgive me and help me correct the error. Thanks in advance.","['euclidean-geometry', 'angle', 'proof-verification', 'geometry', 'trigonometry']"
3117474,Modular geometry: The parabolas of quadratic residues modulo $p$,"[For using the available space better, I rotated the function graphs by 90 degrees.] For the quadratic function $f_1(x) = x^2$ (with $x \in \mathbb{R}$ ) there is only one parabola all integer points $(k,k^2)$ lie on: But for the quadratic residual function $f^p(x) = x^2\ \%\ p$ — i.e. the quadratic residue of $x$ modulo $p$ — there are many . Let $p=11$ . For each $0 < n < p$ consider the parabola $f^p_n(x) \sim x^2$ with $f^p_n(n)=n^2\ \%\ p$ , i.e. the parabola with vertex $(0,0)$ on which the point $(n,n^2\ \%\ p)$ lies: Equivalently — because $k^2\ \%\ p = (p-k)^2\ \%\ p$ — one may consider the parabola $f^p_n(x) \sim (p-x)^2$ , i.e. the parabola with vertex $(p,0)$ on which the point $(n,n^2\ \%\ p)$ lies: The important fact is, that when $p$ is prime all points $(k,k^2)$ lie on $f^p_n(x)$ modulo $p$ for all $0 < n < p$ . Lying on $f^p_n$ modulo $p$ means lying on $f^p_n$ when bending the square $[0,p]\times [0,p]$ to a torus, i.e. identifying its opposite sides. Here you see that all $(k,k^2)$ lie on $f^{11}_1$ modulo $11$ , resp. on $f^{11}_4$ and $f^{11}_{10}$ : Two questions arise: How many different parabolas $f^p_n$ are there for a given $p$ ? Note that $f^p_n = f^p_1$ for $n^2 < p$ . For $p=13$ one finds that $f^{13}_4 = f^{13}_8$ : How do you tell the grid cell in which the parabola $f^p_n$ actually ""hits"" $(k,k^2)$ modulo $p$ , i.e. after how many windings
  around the torus? For $f^p_1$ and $k^2 < p$ it's the cell $(1,1)$ (top left), obviously. For $f^{p}_1$ and $k=p-1$ it's the cell $(1,p-1)$ . For $f^{p}_{p-1}$ and $k=1$ it's the cell $(p-1,p-1)$ . For $f^{11}_4$ and $k=7$ , resp. $f^{11}_5$ and $k=6$ you will find, that the grid cell isn't displayed above (too far to the right). But one may try to determine it by looking at the torus chart, e.g. for $f^{11}_4$ : Counting lines in the chart for $f^{11}_{4}$ reveals that for the ""hit"" cell $(i,j)$ of $k=7$ it holds that $i+j \approx 60$ . The same works for the ""hit"" cell $(i,j)$ of $k=1$ for $f^{11}_{10}$ (see above) with $i+j = 20$ . To answer at least partially the first question one may define an equivalence relation $\sim_p$ between numbers $n_1,n_2 < p$ : $$n_1 \sim_p n_2\ \ \text{ iff }\ \ \ \frac{n_1^2\ \%\ p}{n_1^2} =  \frac{n_2^2\ \%\ p}{n_2^2}$$ When $n_1 \sim_p n_2$ both parabolas $f^p_{n_i}$ have the same slope, and thus are identical. So the first question reads: How many equivalence classes modulo $\sim_p$ are there?","['noneuclidean-geometry', 'modular-arithmetic', 'number-theory', 'geometry', 'quadratic-residues']"

3117489,Two fluids flowing perpendicular in thermal contact with a Wall [Help to mathematically model],"I will try to describe briefly how I am modelling the problem. (Please bear with the length). The governing equation describing temperature for a block at steady state is $$\nabla^2 T = 0$$ where $\nabla^2 T = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}$ defined on $x \in [0,L] ,y \in [0,l], z \in [0,w]$ This is prescribed with the following boundary conditions $\frac{\partial T(0,y,z)}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial T(L,y,z)}{\partial x}=0 \rightarrow Neumann$ $\frac{\partial T(x,0,z)}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial T(x,l,z)}{\partial y}=0\rightarrow Neumann$ $$\frac{\partial T(x,y,w)}{\partial z}=p_h\bigg(T_h - T(x,y,w)\bigg) \rightarrow Convection $$ $$\frac{\partial T(x,y,0)}{\partial z}=p_c\bigg(T_c -T(x,y,0) \bigg)\rightarrow Convection$$ The situation can be better understood from the attached figure Two fluids are in thermal contact with the separating wall and flow perpendicular to each other on either side of the wall. The inlet temperatures of both the fluids is known. Actually, there are two separate equations which govern them as $\frac{\partial T_h}{\partial x} + \frac{b_h}{L} (T_h - T) = 0\rightarrow T_h=\frac{e^\frac{-b_h x}{L}b_h}{L}\int e^\frac{b_h x}{L}T\mathrm{d}x$ Known that : $T_h(0,y,-w)=T_{h,i} \rightarrow $ a constant $\frac{\partial T_c}{\partial y} + \frac{b_c}{l} (T_c - T) = 0 \rightarrow T_c=\frac{e^\frac{-b_c y}{l}b_c}{l}\int e^\frac{b_c y}{l}T\mathrm{d}y$ Known that: $T_c(x,0,0)=T_{c,i} \rightarrow $ a constant So,the quantities $T_h$ and $T_c$ can now be substituted in the original last two boundary conditions. For example, the last bc would now look like $\frac{\partial T(x,y,0)}{\partial z}=p_c\bigg(\frac{e^\frac{-b_c y}{l}b_c}{l}\int e^\frac{b_c y}{l}T\mathrm{d}y -T(x,y,0) \bigg)$ Hence, this becomes a Robin type condition where all terms on the LHS and RHS are functions of $T$ (which is not analogous to any example I have encountered in textbooks, where such b.c. usually have a free stream temperature defined) Attempt I used: $T(x,y,z)=\sum_{m,n=1}^{\infty}T_{nm}(z)\cos(\frac{n\pi x}{L})\cos(\frac{m\pi y}{l}).$ where $T_{nm}(z)$ is the undetermined $z$ function. Substituting this expression in $\nabla T^2 =0$ , I obtain $T_{nm}(z) = A_{nm}^{+}e^{\gamma z} + A_{nm}^{-}e^{-\gamma z} $ where $\gamma^2 = {(\frac{n\pi}{L})^2 + (\frac{m\pi}{l})^2 }$ . Now, the undetermined coefficients are $A_{nm}^{+},A_{nm}^{-}$ which need to be determined using the $z$ boundary conditions. Henceforth, the $z=0$ BC (using @Dyaln suggestion) , becomes $$\frac{\partial T(x,y,0)}{\partial z} = p_c\bigg(e^{-b_cy/l}\left[T_{ci} + \frac{b_c}{l}\int_0^y e^{b_cs/l}T(x,s,z)ds\right] - T(x,y,0)\bigg) $$ On applying this boundary condition: $$
\frac{1}{p_c}\sum_{n,m=1}^\infty \cos(\frac{n\pi x}{L})\cos(\frac{m\pi y}{l})\gamma ( A_{nm}^{+} - A_{nm}^{-}) = e^{-\frac{b_c y}{l}}T_{ci} + U + V - S - T
$$ where $U =\sum_{n,m=1}^\infty ( A_{nm}^{+} + A_{nm}^{-}) \frac{(b_c)^2}{(b_c)^2 + (m\pi)^2} \cos(\frac{n\pi x}{L})\cos(\frac{m\pi y}{l}) $ $V = \sum_{n,m=1}^\infty ( A_{nm}^{+} + A_{nm}^{-}) \frac{b_c m\pi}{(b_c)^2 + (m\pi)^2} \cos(\frac{n\pi x}{L})\sin(\frac{m\pi y}{l})$ $S = \sum_{n,m=1}^\infty ( A_{nm}^{+} + A_{nm}^{-}) \frac{(b_c)^2}{(b_c)^2 + (m\pi)^2} \cos(\frac{n\pi x}{L}) e^{\frac{-b_c y}{l}} $ $T = \sum_{n,m=1}^\infty ( A_{nm}^{+} + A_{nm}^{-})\cos(\frac{n\pi x}{L})\cos(\frac{m\pi y}{l})$ Subsequently, I would have to use the $z=w$ BC to get another equation in terms of $A_{nm}^{+}, A_{nm}^{-}$ . My question (1) What I could not figure out till now is how to handle the exponential term while using orthogonality? An approximation [Update] From the physical problem at hand, one of the boundary conditions could be rewritten in an approximate from as $$\frac{\partial T(x,y,w)}{\partial z}=p_h\bigg(\frac{T_{hi}+T_h(x=L)}{2} - T(x,y,w)\bigg)$$ $$\frac{\partial T(x,y,0)}{\partial z}=p_c\bigg(\frac{T_{ci}+T_c(x=l)}{2} - T(x,y,0)\bigg)$$ On using the suggestions of Dylan, the BC now takes the form $$p_h^{-1}\frac{\partial T(x,y,w)}{\partial z} = \frac{1}{2}\bigg[T_{hi}(1+e^{-b_h}) + \frac{e^{-b_h}b_h}{L}\int_0^L e^{\frac{b_h s}{L}}T(s,y,z) \mathrm{d}s\bigg] - T(x,y,w)$$ $$p_c^{-1}\frac{\partial T(x,y,0)}{\partial z} = \frac{1}{2}\bigg[T_{ci}(1+e^{-b_c}) + \frac{e^{-b_c}b_c}{l}\int_0^l e^{\frac{b_c s}{l}}T(x,s,z) \mathrm{d}s\bigg] - T(x,y,0)$$ These BC(s) remove the dependence on the $e^{\frac{-b_c y}{l}}$ & $e^{\frac{-b_h x}{L}}$ .

In taking the difference quotient (in working with the derivative) we obtain something like, $$\lim_{h\to0}\int_\mathbb{R}f(z)\frac{g(x+h-z)-g(x-z)}h\text{d}z,$$ for which we want to find some integrable function $\psi$ so that for all $z\in\mathbb R$ , $$\left|\frac{g(x+h-z)-g(x-z)}h\right|<\psi(z).$$ That is to say, we want to find a function, $\psi$ , which dominates the above difference quotient. I see that that the hypotheses of the LDCT are satisfied (since $g\in C_c^\infty$ it is Borel measurable), but how do we rectify the fact that our sequence (the difference quotient) isn't indexed by the natural numbers? How do we apply LDCT when we have $0<h<1$ , which is uncountable. In order to find the dominating $\psi$ , as mentioned above, we make use of the Mean Value Theorem (Rather than just assume that such a dominating function exists, we should move to draw out the specific existence of such a function). In the first of the linked questions, this is done as follows, \begin{eqnarray*}
	\left|g(x + h - z) - g(x - z)\right|
	& = & 
	\left|
	\int_0^1\frac{\rm d}{{\rm d}s} g(x - z + sh)\; {\rm d} s
	\right|
	\\
	&\leq & 
	|h|\max_{x\in \mathbb R} |g'(x)|. 
\end{eqnarray*} How is it that $g'(x-z+sh)$ for $s\in(0,1)$ is bounded by $g'(x)$ as a function of $x$ alone? I am thinking that one defines $g'_s(x):=g'(x - z + sh)$ for $s\in(0,1)$ and then argues that for all $s\in(0,1)$ , $|g'_s(x)|<|g'(x)|$ for all $x\in\mathbb R$ so that the sequence of functions $(g_s)_{s\in(0,1)}$ is uniformly bounded. But how does one transition from dealing with $g'(x-z+sh)$ to $g'(x)$ ? And how does this affect our considerations of the support we are on?","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-integral', 'convolution', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"

(2 answers) Closed 5 years ago . Let $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n$ be a formal complex power series, with $a_n$ strictly decreasing to 1 as $n\to \infty$ . It is easy to see that the radius of convergence is 1, so that this power series represents a function $f$ holomorphic on the disk. The question is to Show that f has no zeroes on the disk. I've been looking at this a while and feel and tried a few different things. $\cdot$ One easy observation is the similarity of this series with $\frac{1}{1-z}$ , whose coefficients do not strictly decrease but which otherwise is an example of the thing to be proven. $\cdot$ Rouché's theorem doesn't seem to have an immediate application—I've tried comparing $f$ to $\frac{1}{1-z}$ or to its partial sums by Rouché. $\cdot$ If the partial sums had no zeroes, then neither would $f$ by Hurwitz's theorem $\cdot$ If we could show the function had positive real part we'd obviously be done, which seems highly plausible—the condition gives that $f(-1) = \sum a_n \cos\pi n > 0$ , but I don't know how to extend this argument to arguments other than $\pi$ .

3117798,"Group of order $5^k\cdot 8$ has normal subgroups of order $5^{k},5^{k}\cdot2,5^{k}\cdot4$","Let $G$ be a group of order $5^k\cdot 8$ . I was trying to prove that there are normal subgroups of order $5^{k},5^{k}\cdot2,5^{k}\cdot4$ . I saw the following statement: Let $P$ be a $p$ -Sylow subgroup of $G$ . Then obviously $|P|=5^k$ . Why the order of $P$ is $5^k$ ? I can't figure the connection between the $p$ -Sylow subgroup and $5^k$ . From the third Sylow theorem I know that $n_{2}|5^k$ and $n_2\equiv 2\,(mod\,2)$ but how does it help me? Edit: After understanding what I missed, I'll try to solve it: From the first Sylow theorem we know that $G$ has a $5$ -Sylow subgroup of order $5^k$ . I'll prove that $P\triangleleft G$ . On one hand $n_5=|G\,:\,N_G(P)|$ and on the other hand (third Sylow theorem) we get $n_5\equiv 1\,(mod\, 5)$ . From Lagrange we know that $P$ is subgroup of $N_G(P)$ so we know that $5^k$ divides $N_G(P)$ so there is $s\in\mathbb{N}$ so $|N_G(P)|=5^k\cdot s$ . We get $$|G\,:\,N_G(P)|=\frac{5^k\cdot 8}{5^k\cdot s}=\frac{8}{s}$$ We conclude that $n_5$ divides $8$ and the remainder is $1$ while dividing by $5$ meaning $n_5=1$ . So we have only one $5$ -Sylow subgroup meaning $P\triangleleft G$ . What do you think? Edit 2 : I was wondering if we need it all? From the Sylow $III$ theorem we get $n_5|8$ and $n_5\equiv 1 \, (mod \,5)$ . from $n_5|8$ we get $n_5\in \{1,2,4,8\}$ and from $n_5\equiv 1 \, (mod \,5)$ we get $n_5=1$ so there is only one $5$ -Sylow group meaning $P\triangleleft G$ . Is it correct? Edit 3 (Last edit I promise!) I will prove that $G$ has a normal subgroup of order $4\cdot 5^k$ . By Lagrange theorem we get: $$|G/P|=\frac{|G|}{|P|}=\frac{5^{k}\cdot 8}{5^{k}}=8$$ $8$ is a power of prime number so we $G/P$ has a subgroup of order $4$ and $2$ of the following format: $A/P$ . From Lagrange: $$|A|=|A/P|\cdot|P|=4\cdot5^{k}$$ And Also, $$|G\,:\,A|=\frac{|G|}{|A|}=\frac{8\cdot5^{k}}{4\cdot5^{k}}=2$$ So $A$ is a subgroup of $G$ of order $4\cdot 5^k$ and index $2$ , so its normal. Now I wonder how to prove that $G$ has a normal group of order $2\cdot 5^k$ . We stated that $G/P$ has a subgroup $B/P$ of order $2$ . So from the Lagrange theorem we get: $$|B|=|G/P|\cdot|P|=2\cdot5^{k}$$ I got stuck. I checked ther solution and found out that: $G/P$ is of order $8$ so it has a subgroup of order $2$ in $Z(G/P)$ . This group is of form $B/P$ for some subgroup $B$ of $G$ . We know that $B/P\subset Z(G/P)$ so $B/P \triangleleft G/P$ meaning $B\triangle G$ . First of all, I don't understand why $G/P$ has a subgroup of order $2$ in $Z(G/P)$ . I do know that $Z(G/P)\leq G/P$ , but how does it help up. Also, I don't understand why $B/P\subset Z(G/P)$ and why $B/P \triangleleft G/P$ ?","['finite-groups', 'normal-subgroups', 'abstract-algebra', 'sylow-theory', 'group-theory']"

&= P(X_1 \in Z(G))\left(1 - \frac{1}{2^{i - 1}} + \frac{1}{2^{i - 1}P(X_1 \in Z(G))}\right)

Or is it rather looking like $Bl_pC\times \mathbb P^{n-2}$ where $p$ is the singular point of $C$ ? I was reading about blow-ups along sub varieties recently in Shafarevich's book and have a question concerning it. Let us take a curve $C$ in $\mathbb A^n$ and consider $X=Bl_C\mathbb A^n$ . Since $C$ is one-dimensional, we need (locally) $m=n-1$ equations to define it and thus, according to my textbook, $$X\subset \mathbb A^n\times \mathbb P^{m-1}=\mathbb A^n\times \mathbb P^{n-2}.$$ Back to the curve case, locally the situation can be described explicitly and over each point of $C$ we find a $\mathbb P^{n-2}$ in $X$ . In particular, $\pi^{-1}(C)\to C$ is an algebraic fibre bundle with fibres $\mathbb P^{n-2}$ . By $\pi$ I of course mean the blow-up map. Shafarevich further gives the nice global description that $$\pi^{-1}(C)=\mathbb P(N_{C/\mathbb A^n}),$$ where $N_{C/ \mathbb A^n}$ denotes the normal bundle. So far so good, I think I understood that, at least the parts from the book. Now, if $C$ is a curve with a singular point, say $p\in C$ , I think we have a similar description and that $$\pi^{-1}(C)=\mathbb P(\mathcal N_{C/ \mathbb A^n}),$$ where $\mathcal N_{C/ \mathbb A^n}$ denotes the normal sheaf . Is this correct? The only reference I have for blow-ups along general subschemes I could find was the Algebraic geometry book by Hartshorne and I can't translate his description of blowing up into the one by Shafarevich. So if you can give me some reference you would really help me. Up to this point I think myself to be more or less on the safe side. However, I was thinking about how $\mathbb P (\mathcal N_{C/ \mathbb A^n})$ will look like in general and how I can interpret such a blow-up along $C$ . My naive thinking is that we kind of blow-up all point on $C$ at once. But then we would in particular blow-up the singular point of $C$ . So does $\mathcal N_{C/ \mathbb A^n}$ locally look like $C\times \mathbb P^{n-2}$ or rather like $Bl_pC\times \mathbb P^{n-2}$ ? And if the latter is the case, what happens to the divisor from the blow-up of $C$ at $p$ ? I hope this question is not too vague. If there is a way to improve it, please let me know. I'm aware that a question is supposed to show ""research effort"" but since these questions just came to me whilst reading a textbook, I don't really have a clue of how to start and was unable to say more than what I just wrote. EDIT: Here are some examples: 1) $C=\{x^2+y^2+z=z=0\}\subset \mathbb A^3$ . The blow-up is given in the respective affine charts by $a_0(x^2+y^2)=0$ and $a_1(x^2+y^2)=0$ . So here it looks like $C\times \mathbb P^1$ . 2) $C=\{xy+z^2=x^3+y^3=0\}\subset \mathbb A^3$ . In the respective charts we obtain $$a_0(xy+z^2)=x^3+y^3=0\quad\text{and}\quad xy+z^2=a_1(x^3+y^3)=0.$$ And here I am unable to proceed. Probably more light can be shed on the situation by computing the normal sheaf explicitly. I asked a related question Compute normal sheaf from equations some time ago but I can't manage to adapt the answer to the new situation here.","['algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'blowup']"
3118047,How to get the integral representation of $f'$ from that of $f$?

I also tried to prove that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \chi_{A_{n}} \leq \chi_{A} + \epsilon \chi_{E}$ for $x \in E$ so that I could use monotonocity of the integral and the Monotone Convergence Theorem, but I wasn't able to prove that inequality either. Haven't tried many attempts for $b)$ , but I think it could be closely related to $a)$ by substituting $E$ for $A \setminus C_{k}$ or some trick along those lines. The hint for $b)$ leads me to believe that this exercise could be attacked via integration but I could be wrong and maybe the hint points towards something else that I'm missing. Any hints or ideas (even those ones that don't use the hints of course) would be greatly appreciated and welcome. Thanks in advance.","['measurable-sets', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
3118626,Convexity of a set function,"Let $N$ be a finite set and $2^N$ be the set of all subsets of $N$ . Consider the function $f:2^N\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ . $f$ is said to be convex if for any two $Q,S\in 2^N$ $$f(Q\cup S)\ge f(Q)+f(S)-f(Q\cap S).$$ However, I cannot recognize any connection with the notion of convexity of a function defined on the real line. Can you give any clue on how to interpret this particular sort of convexity? UPDATE: As @Christoph rightfully noted, the described function is called supermodular (there is no entry on this kind of supermodular functions in Wikipedia, but I saw it elsewhere). However, I'm still puzzled about the relation between sub(super)modular set functions and concave (convex) functions. In the article on submodular functions it is said that ""Submodular functions have properties which are very similar to convex and concave functions..."" Does it mean that they are both convex and concave? What are these properties?","['functions', 'convex-analysis']"
3118723,Why isn't it trivial that pathwise uniqueness implies uniqueness in law?,"Consider an SDE $${\rm d}X_t=b(t,X_t){\rm d}t+\sigma(t,X_t){\rm d}W_t\tag1$$ with Lipschitz continous $b,\sigma:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ and a Brownian motion $(W_t)_{t\ge0}$ . We know that, given a filtered probability space and a Brownian motion on this space beforehand, there is a pathwise unique strong solution of $(1)$ . How can we conclude that this solution is unique in law? There is a well-known result by Yamada and Watanabe claiming that if weak solutions of $(1)$ are pathwise unique, then they are also unique in law. However, the proof is rather ""complicated"", while (at least in the setting described above) it seems to be trivial that $\operatorname P\left[X_t=\tilde X_t\text{ for all }t\ge0\right]$ implies that the finite-dimensional distributions of $X$ and $\tilde X$ coincide.

3118795,Understanding the minimal and maximal closed extensions of Laplace operator,"Let's consider the following setting. $\Omega$ is a connected, riemmanian manifold with boundary (although i think there is no harm on thinking it is a bounded, close region of $\mathbb{R}^n$ ). One can define the Laplace(-Beltrami) operator $-\Delta$ on smooth functions as usual, and the symmetric operator $-\Delta_0 = -\Delta|_{C_0^\infty(\Omega)}$ given by its restriction to compact supported smooth functions. Consider its minimal and maximal closed extensions defined as follows. The minimal closed extension $\Delta_\text{min}$ is the closure of $\Delta_0$ with respect to the Sobolev norm $\Vert \cdot \Vert_{H^2(\Omega)}$ , that is $$ \mathcal{D}(\Delta_\text{min}) = \overline{C_0^\infty(\Omega)}^{\Vert \cdot \Vert_{H^2(\Omega)}} = H^2_0(\Omega).$$ The maximal closed extension is the adjoint of the minimal, $\Delta_\text{max} = \Delta_\text{min}^\dagger$ . I belive this is like saying $$ \mathcal{D}(\Delta_\text{max}) = \{u \in L^2(\Omega) : \Delta u \in L^2(\Omega)\}, $$ where $\Delta u$ must be understood in the weak sense. That's what I would say I understand. I've been told that $$ \mathcal{D}(\Delta_\text{max}) = H^1_0 \cap H_2 \oplus \mathrm{ker}\, (\Delta_\text{max}), $$ but I can't see even how to start proving that, which is what lead me to ask you for any help or reference on this. Also I've heard that $\mathcal{D}(\Delta_\text{max})$ is greater than $H^2(\Omega)$ in the general case, but I don't really understand why. As I see it, the maximal closed extension can be seen as a map between $H^2(\Omega)$ and its dual, and thus $$ \Delta_\text{max} u\colon v \in H^2(\Omega) \mapsto \Delta_\text{max} u(v) = \langle \Delta_\text{max} u, v \rangle_{L^2(\Omega)}. $$ I can't see how $\Delta_\text{max} u$ can be identified (in the weak sense) with a function in $L^2(\Omega)$ if $u \notin H^2(\Omega)$ . Again, any hint or reference would be appreciated.","['sobolev-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"
3118822,Finding Euler path using powers of adjacency,"Context: I'm studying an introductory course to Discrete Applied Mathematics, and am new to the context of graphs. Knowing that a graph can be represented as an adjacency matrix, say we have the graph $G = \begin{bmatrix}

Trying to use $G^{vertexes}$ , I thought I could check how many possible solutions for an Euler circuit there were based on the initially chosen vertex. I quickly noticed that there was a flaw in my thinking: this allowed both paths and vertexes to be repeated on the path, which is not allowed in the definition of an Eulerian cycle. I know I can see if an Eulerian cycle exists counting the number of vertexes in the graph having odd and even edges joining other vertexes. If all vertexes have an even number, or exactly two uneven, of connected lines, there must exist at least one Eulerian cycle. If there is exactly one, or more than two uneven vertexes, the Eulerian cycle doesn't exist. This tells me nothing about where the starting position must be (unless there are two uneven ones), or the trajectory of the path. Is there any property I can use to limit the amount of repetitions of paths/vertexes, using the exponentiation technique, in order to see what starting position are valid? Are there any other thing I should know about Eulerian circuits?","['graph-theory', 'adjacency-matrix', 'discrete-mathematics', 'eulerian-path']"

Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb N \times \mathbb N$ be some subset such that the number of sets of the form $\{ (i,j) \mid (i+n, j+m) \in S \}$ for fixed $(n,m)$ is finite, so all those sets could be referenced by a finite number of tuples $(n_1, m_1), \ldots, (n_k, m_k)$ (lets call them the translations sets with respect to $S$ ).

 \{ \{ (i, j) \mid (i + n, j + m) \in M\} \mid n,m \ge 0  \}

Remark : The assumption that the translation sets for $M$ are finite is necessary, as in general it could be infinite, take $S = \{(1,1)\}$ , then $M = \{ (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), \ldots \}$ and so we have the translation sets $$

Thank you in advance Edit : The specific structure of $\mathbb{C}$ is that, if you consider only $(\mathbb{C},+)$ you can orderer it in the following way: $z = a + bi; w = c +di$ ( $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{R}$ ) $z < w \iff  a < c  \vee a = c \land b < d$ In that way we have a maximum $\alpha_{i} + \beta_{j} = \max(\alpha_{i}) + \max(\beta_{j})$ . Now we have that: $$\sigma(\max(\alpha_{i}) + \max(\beta_{j}))= \sigma(\max(\alpha_{i})) + \sigma(\max(\beta_{j})) = \max(\alpha_{i}) + \max(\beta_{j})$$ If and only if $\sigma(\max(\alpha_{i})) = \max(\alpha_{i}) \land \sigma(\max(\beta_{j})) = \max(\beta_{j}).$ This lets us prove that there exist $mn$ distinct homomorphisms.
