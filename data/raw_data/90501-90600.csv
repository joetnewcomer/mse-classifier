1218650,Matrix equivalence independent of dimension,"I'm looking for a criterion on symmetric, positive definite matrices $A$ which ensures the constant $M$ in the lower bound of the norm equivalence
$M\|A\|_\infty \le \|A\|_2 \le \|A\|_\infty$ does not depend on the dimension of the matrix. EDIT: I was thinking that it sufficient to constrain the eigenvalues of $A$, but so far I can't make this work. So far, I have only a quite unsatisfying attempt based on matrix sensitivity: supposing $A = Id + \Delta$, the matrix $\Delta$ should have $\|\Delta\|_2 \le \frac M{\sqrt n}$. One can generalize a bit by taking any diagonal (positive definite) matrix (EDIT: with bounded eigenvalues) in the place of the identity, but I'd be interested in a more general criterion. UPDATE: OK, something simple I missed: if an eigenvector of $A$ is $e = (1,...,1)$, then
$$
\|A\|_\infty = \max_{\|v\|_\infty =1}\|Av\|_\infty = \|Ae\|_\infty = \lambda_{e}(A) \le \lambda_{max}(A) = \|A\|_2.
$$
However, I need more generality than this. UPDATE 2: Just an idea, not sure that it helps: what one needs is a constant $M$ independent of $n$ such that
$$
 \|A\|_\infty = \max_{i} \sum_{j=1}^n |a_{ij}| \le \frac {\|A\|_2}{M}
$$

1218899,"Fastest way to meet, without communication, in a toroidal palace?","I was interested by a similar question asked here , but wanted to pose a slightly different variant that avoids some of the pitfalls and ambiguities in the first question in order to ask something more likely to get a concrete answer. Suppose two robots are dropped in a palace built on a toroidal planet. The palace covers the entire surface and is broken into equal sized rooms arranged in a grid fashion. The torus is well proportioned, allowing for an equal number of rooms in both directions: that is to say, the palace has n x n rooms and, due to being on a torus, wraps in both directions. Each robot is equipped with a teleporter. The teleporter can be programmed once per time period and will simultaneously move the robots to their target room. In order for the robots to find each other, they must either end up in same room for a given time period (either by moving to it, or remaining in it), or they may 'run into each other' by cross-teleporting to/from the same pair of rooms at the same time. The robots have no way of leaving marks or otherwise communicating with each other. Each robot has an in-built GPS system that is pre-programmed with the size of the palace and able to track their position relative to their starting room, although their orientation is random and not guaranteed to match that of their counterpart. They also both come programmed with a strategy, however the strategy is identical for both and cannot be varied between the two robots. You do, however, have access to a random number generator. What is the optimal strategy for the robots to find each other? If the robots could only teleport themselves to adjacent rooms, is the problem any different?","['geometry', 'puzzle', 'game-theory']"

The questions I've asked below are questions that can be answered, and not just discussed. I read this essay yesterday by Gian-Carlo Rota denouncing the structure of most differential equations courses.  In the essay, he says that the structure of these courses hasn't changed since the 19th century, almost word for word in some cases, and is filled with redundant lessons. In particular, he has a problem with the teaching of exact equations, integrating factors, homogeneous differential equations, and existence and uniqueness of solutions, saying that all of these topics and techniques are of no use whatsoever. He believes the bulk of DE courses should be linear DEs with constant coefficients (not variable coefficients), linear algebra, and Laplace transforms. Are most people here in agreement with this?  If so, how would a better DE course be built from scratch? EDIT: I just looked at MIT's syllabus for Differential Equations, and it looks like it reflects what Rota said.  So there's truth in it, though I haven't checked yet whether or not the course text by Edwards & Penney follows suit.","['education', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

1219195,Sets that are convex in two different metrics,"Let $(M,g)$ be a complete Riemannian manifold, and let $C$ be a subset of $M$. We will say $C$ is convex if for any points $p,q \in C$, there exists a unique normal minimal geodesic $\gamma$ joining $p$ and $q$, such that $\gamma \subset C$. Now, suppose we have a smooth manifold $M$, and two metrics $g_1$ and $g_2$. Briefly, I am interested to know under what conditions $(M,g_1)$ and $(M,g_2)$ have the same convex sets, or at least a class of convex sets (e.g. convex geodesic balls) in common. That is, if $C \subset M$ is a convex set in $(M,g_1)$, is it convex in $(M,g_2)$? Certainly this isn't generally true, so what conditions on $M,g_1,g_2,C$ are necessary/sufficient? My guess is that very restrictive conditions are needed to ensure all convex sets are shared, so let me be more precise and describe the specific case I'm interested in: Let $M = \mathbb R^n$ and $g_1$ be the standard Euclidean metric, and let $C = B_R(x)$ be the usual ball of radius $R$ centered at $x$, and let $g_2$ be some other metric. Is $C$ convex in $(M,g_2)$? (or what conditions on $g_2,R$ are needed? In particular I imagine that $R$ cannot be too large) In practice, I will be assuming $g_2 = c^{-2}(x)dx^2$ (from a wave equation) and that the sectional curvature is bounded above, so that there is some control over the injectivity/convexity radius . EDIT (some more thoughts): I suspect this is tied to curvature; does the sectional curvature bound the curvature (as a curve in Euclidean space) of a geodesic of $g_2$?","['partial-differential-equations', 'differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'reference-request']"
1219199,What does it mean to extend curves to the projective line,"The question is (from Arnol'd 's book : Ordinary Differential Equations): ""Which of the differential equations $ \dot x = x^ n$ determine on an affine line a phase velocity field that can be extended without singular points to the projective line?"" The answers that are given are n = 0,1,2. In the book from where I got this question, phase velocity field is when you plot the function $ v (x) = \dot x = x^n $ against $x$. $x$ is on the vertical axis and $v(x)$ on the horizontal one. For $\dot x = x$ and $\dot x = 1 $, the phase velocity fields are a diagonal line and a vertical line, respectively. So it makes sense that these are solutions. On the other hand, $\dot x = x^2$ has the phase velocity field that looks like $ y = \sqrt x $, which is what the phase velocity fields look like for higher values of n (although they get flatter faster). So what I don't understand is why is $ n = 2 $ a solution, but not $ n > 2 $ So where am I going wrong? Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
1219219,Topological invariants by integrals,"Some topological invariants that can be found e.g. in knot theory can be represented as integrals (Example: Integral for computing the Gauss linking number). Another example is the complex plane with poles: If the poles are defined by Terms like $\frac{1}{z-z_i}$ with some natural number $i$ that is indexing the pole then the number of poles (topological invariant) can be expressed as: $N = \int_C \frac{f(z)dz}{2 \pi i}$. In differential geometry the total curvature of a curve $c(t)$ parametrized by $t \in [0,1]$ is obtained by $TC[c(t)]= \int_0^1 \kappa(t) dt$ with the curvature of the curve $\kappa(t)$.

1219220,"What could be said about centralizers of normal subgroups if $G$ contains a simple, non-abelian maximal subgroup","Let $G$ be a finite group containing a maximal simple and non-abelian group, is it true that the centraliser of each normal subgroup is either trivial or a minimal normal subgroups? EDIT : Maybe to give some context. If $G$ contains a maximal subgroup which is core-free, then this property holds for the centraliser of each normal subgroup. For a proof, let $G$ be a group and $L$ be a maximal core-free group, meaning that the intersection of all conjugates of $L$ is trivial, in particular $L$ contains no normal subgroup of $G$. Now let $N \unlhd G$ be non-trivial, as $L \cap N = 1$ we have $G = LN$. Also $C_G(N) \unlhd G$ and so $C_G(N) \cap L \unlhd L$ and therefore $L \le N_G(C_G(N)\cap L)$. As $N \le C_G(C_G(N))$ we have 
$$
N \le C_G(C_G(N) \cap L) \le N_G(C_G(N)\cap L)
$$
which implies $G = LN \le N_G(C_G(N)\cap L)$, i.e. $C_G(N) \cap L) \unlhd G$, and as $L$ is core-free it follows that $C_G(N) \cap L = 1$. Now let $M \le C_G(N)$ be a non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$, then again $M \cap L = 1$ and so $G = LM$. By Dedekind's Identity we have with $M \le C_G(N) \le LM$
$$
 C_G(N) = M(C_G(N) \cap L) = M

We now need to prove that It also holds for $k+1$ Here we have two cases (1) $k$ is even    (2) $k$ is odd We start with the easier case , case (2) If $k$ is odd then $k+1$ is even and hence the first step is division $\frac{k+1}{2}$ will be in the list $ \{1,2,..........,k \}$ because $\frac{k+1}{2} < k$ and hence we are done for this case. However, Life couldn't be that easy :D So we have to consider case (1) If $k$ is even then $k+1$ is odd and so we have to multiply $3(k+1) + 1 = 3k +4$ and $3k+4$ is even because odd(3)xeven(k) + even(4) = even + even = even so we will apply the division step $\frac{3k+4}{2}$ However, It's not always true that $\frac{3k+4}{2} \leq k$ And so the induction fails Is there anything I did wrong here or is there anything I can add to proceed even a little bit further ?","['conjectures', 'collatz-conjecture', 'number-theory']"

1219540,Connected open subsets in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are path connected.,"The book I am using for my Introduction of Topology course is Principles of Topology by Fred H. Croom. I am to prove the following: Prove that every connected open $U\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is path connected. This is what I understand: A space $X$ is connected provided that it cannot be written as the disjoint union of specifically two open sets. A space $X$ is path connected if given $a,b\in X$, there is a continuous function $f:[0,1]\rightarrow X$ such that $f(0)=a$ and $f(1)=b$ If I am not mistaken, since $U$ is connected then the only sets which are clopen are $\emptyset$ and $U$. Therefore, given any $a\in U$, I would need to show a set of points, say $A\subseteq U$, which can be joined to $a$ by a path in $U$ is clopen. Rough Proof: Suppose $U$ is a connected open subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $a\in U$ and $A\subseteq U$ be a set of points which can join $a$. We define $C=U \setminus A$; therefore, $A\cap C=\emptyset$ by set difference. We seek to prove $A \neq \emptyset$, $A$ is open, and $A$ is closed. Let $x\in A$ (hence not empty); suppose $\exists \epsilon >0 : B(x,\epsilon)\subseteq U$. Since open balls are convex, it is path connected. Thus for any point $y$ in $B(x)$, there is a path from $x$ to $y$. Since $A$ is a set of points in $U$ that can join $a$, then there exist a path between $x$ and $a$. Since there is a path from $y$ to $x$ and $x$ to $a$; then, there is a path from $y$ to $a$ implying $y$ is in $A$. Since $y\in B(x,\epsilon)$, we conclude $B(x) \subseteq A$, hence $A$ is open. By definition, for $A$ to be closed, then $U\setminus A = C$ must be open. Using a similar argument above, if $x\in C$, then $\exists \epsilon>0$: $B(x,\epsilon)\subseteq U$. If any point $y\in B(x)$ joins $a$, so can $x$. Hence $C$ is open, therefore $A$ is closed. By hypothesis, $U$ is connected. Since $A$ is a nonempty subset of $U$, then if follows that $C=\emptyset$ and $A=U$; therefore $U$ is path connected. Am I on the right track? Is there anything I need to revise or make clear in my proof? I sincerely thank you for taking the time to read this question and my attempt at proving it.

I've looked around at other questions and answers on this site and quite a few others, but none of them seem to satisfy my question. Anyway, given two triangles on two intersecting planes, and a line of intersection (a vector V), how would I be able to tell if any part of the intersection line is contained in both triangles? So far I've been able to, given two triangles, find their two planes, and the direction vector of the line where they intersect. I think I might be able to find if the line of intersection is contained in one triangle by projecting to 2D, but I'm not sure how to find if that line of intersection is contained in both triangles. As far as I can tell, there's not much documentation on triangle to triangle collision, if anybody could tell me the step by step process to find the line of intersection between the triangles (and/or if it exists) rather than the line of intersection between the two planes, that would be great.

1220120,Showing that the moduli stack of triangles is equivalent to the quotient stack $[\tilde{T}/S_3]$,"$\require{AMScd}$
A good reference for this question is found in the first chapter in the unfinished book Algebraic Stacks by Behrend, Conrad, Edidin, Fulton, Fantechi, Göttsche, and Kresch.  ( http://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?file&key1=5158 ), but I'll try and give all the definitions myself. Definitions: Define a family of triangles to be a fibre bundle
  $V\xrightarrow{p}S$ with a continuously varying metric (i.e., a
  continuous function $V\times_SV\to\mathbb R_{\ge0}$ that restricts to
  a metric for each fibre) such that each fibre is isometric to a plane
  triangle.  The moduli stack of triangles is the category whose
  objects are families of triangles and whose morphisms are Cartesian squares \begin{CD} V' @>>> V\\@VVp'V @VVpV\\ S' @>f>> S \end{CD} Now let $\tilde{T}$ be the set $$ \{(a,b,c)\in\mathbb R^3\colon
 a,b,c>0, a+b>c,a+c>b,b+c>a\} $$ And let $\tilde{Y}$ be a family of
  triangles over $\tilde{T}$ such that the fibre over each $(a,b,c)\in
> T$ is a plane triangle with side lengths $a,b,c$.  So $\tilde{T}$ is a
  moduli space for all labelled triangles and $\tilde{Y}$ is a
  universal family over it. We have an action of $S_3$ on $\tilde{T}$ which permutes the three
  axes.  This induces an action by isometries on the set of all fibres
  of $\tilde{T}$. Form the category (quotient stack) $[\tilde{T}/S_3]$.  The objects of
  this category are diagrams $$ \tilde{T}\xleftarrow{f}
 E\xrightarrow{p}B $$ where $E\xrightarrow{p}B$ is a principal
  $G$-bundle (a fibre bundle with fibre $S_3$ (with the discrete
  topology) and a continuous right action of $S_3$ on $E$), and $f$ is a
  $G$-equivariant map.  The morphisms in this category are diagrams that
  look a bit like houses, with the bottom square Cartesian. I want to show that the two categories are equivalent, via an equivalence that commutes with the natural functors to $\mathbf{Top}$ (so an isomorphism of stacks).  This corresponds to our intuition that we can form the moduli stack of triangles by taking the moduli stack of ordered triangles and forming the quotient by the action of $S_3$. I'm having problems defining a functor between these categories.  Given a family $V\xrightarrow{p}S$, I want to form a principal $S_3$-bundle over $S$ that has a $G$-invariant map to $\tilde{T}$.  This means finding a $6$-sheeted cover of $S$. My attempt: Given a family of triangles $V\xrightarrow{p}S$, let
$$
E=\{(u,s,g)\;\vert\; u\in\tilde{T}, g\colon \tilde{Y}_u\to V_s\textrm{ is an isometry}\}
$$ This has natural maps to $S$ and to $\tilde{T}$ and every fibre has six elements, corresponding to the six possible orderings of the sides. However, we haven't yet defined topology on this space, since I haven't specified a space for the isometries $g$ to live in.  And I'm not sure how to.  I've tried considering certain function spaces with the compact-open topology, but I don't want to include any local compactness assumptions on the space $S$. How can we define an appropriate topology on this space to get the desired functor?  How can we show that the resulting space $E$ is a fibre bundle over $B$?  Or is there a better way of doing this?","['geometry', 'algebraic-stacks', 'general-topology', 'category-theory']"
1220149,Existence of non-abelian group of order n,"I know this is an old quetion, but I've certainly been disappointed with the given answers. The question is: There exists a characterization of the natural numbers $n$ such that there exist at least one non-abelian group of order $n$? 
In this web http://oeis.org/A060652 , those numbers are called ""non-abelian orders"" and they state this: Let the prime factorization of $n$ be $p_1^{e_1}\cdots p_r^{e_r}$. Then $n$ is in this sequence (of non-abelian orders) if $e_i>2$ for some $i$ or $p_i^k\equiv1$(mod $p_j$) for some $i$ and $j$ and $1\leq k\leq e_i$. I've been trying to figure out a proof and this is what I've got: Let $n=p_1^{e_1}\cdots p_r^{e_r}$, then there exist an non-abelian group of order $n$ if $e_i>2$ for some $i$ or $p_i\equiv 1$(mod $p_j$) for some $i\neq j$. It is clear that if both of these conditions fail to hold, then the only remainig option is $p_i^2\equiv 1$(mod $p_j$) for some $i\neq j$. Then the problem ""reduces"" to  this: If $p_i^2\equiv 1$(mod $p_j$) for some $i\neq j$, then there exist at least one non-abelian group of order n? If 1 is true, does the converse of the theorem also holds? i.e. If there exists a non-abelian group of order $n=p_1^{e_1}\cdots p_r^{e_r}$, then $e_i>2$ for some $i$ or $p_i^k\equiv1$(mod $p_j$) for some $i$ and $j$ and $1\leq k\leq e_i$.

1220219,Order and Metric,"Consider the Reals as a totally ordered set via its natural order ( linear continuum ). Such order induces an order topology ( basis is the collection of open-intervals of that order), which ends up being a metrizable space. The metrizable space has an equivalence-class of metrics ( equivalent metrics ) which generates such order topology,  the most famous of which is the euclidean metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The mentioned metric is induced by the euclidean norm on the 1-dimensional vector space of the reals. The mentioned metric is also based on the absolute-value function natural to the unique complete ordered field of the reals ( in every ordered field, we can naturally define the notion of an absolute value function that is enough , with the provided arithmetic, to define a natural metric ). What i'm most curious about is that it seems that in this case the natural order alone on the set of reals is indirectly inducing a vector space whose natural norm defines a metric that induces the order topology induced by that order. At the same time, it seems that the order alone on the set of reals is indirectly inducing an ordered field whose natural absolute value function defines a metric that induces the order topology induced by that order on that set. I'm just finding a bit curious and interesting the relation between a simple order on a set and many possible natural inductions ( vector space whose natural norm defines a metric that induces the order topology  or ordered field whose absolute value function defines a natural metric that induces the order topology ) . Is it only happening because we ordered set into consideration is the reals ( which is pretty important, even required for the notion of metric ) or is this notion more general ?

For example, with the integral $$ \int^{2\pi}_{0} \frac{x\sin x}{3+\sin^2 x} \ dx $$ I proceeded as follows. First I will note, that previously I have shown that $\int^{\pi}_{0} \frac{x \sin x}{3+\sin^2 x} \ dx =\frac{\pi}{2}\int^{\pi}_{0} \frac{\sin x}{3+\sin^2 x} \ dx = \frac{\pi}{4}\ln 3 $ Returning to the integral 
$$ \int^{2\pi}_{0} \frac{x\sin x}{3+\sin^2 x} \ dx  =  \int^{\pi}_{0} \frac{x\sin x}{3+\sin^2 x} \ dx  +  \int^{2\pi}_{\pi} \frac{x\sin x}{3+\sin^2 x} \ dx $$ Now in the second integral substitute $ x \to x - \pi $ then we have $$\int^{2\pi}_{\pi} \frac{x\sin x}{3+\sin^2 x} \ dx = \int^{\pi}_{0} \frac{(x - \pi)(-\sin x)}{3+\sin^2 x} \ dx= -\int^{\pi}_{0} \frac{x\sin x}{3+\sin^2 x}\ dx + \int^{\pi}_{0} \frac{\pi \sin x}{3+\sin^2 x}\ dx  $$ This means that $$ \int^{2\pi}_{0} \frac{x\sin x}{3+\sin^2 x} \ dx = \int^{\pi}_{0} \frac{\pi \sin x}{3+\sin^2 x}\ dx = \frac{\pi}{2} \ln 3 $$ by the initial result.

What if there are two other charts $(U',x')$ and $(V',y')$ with $p \in U'$ and $f(U') \subset V'$ but $y'\circ f \circ x'^{-1}$ not of class $C^r$? Will $f$ still be of class $C^r$ at $p$?","['differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
1220593,Would the joint distribution of Normal Random Variable and the distribution of a X bar from the same sample be bivariate Normal?,"I know this question is somewhat redundant... but here goes: My text asserts that the joint distribution of $$X_1=N(\theta, 1)\text{ and } \bar X = N(\theta, \frac 1n)$$ 
is Bivariate normal with $$\text{mean vector} = (\theta, \theta), \, \sigma_1^2 = 1,\ \sigma_2^2 = \frac 1n,\text{ and } \rho = 1/\sqrt n$$ Given the numerous reasons to not assume a Bivariate normal joint distribution  as a result of two marginal normals, many summed up nicely here: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/30159/is-it-possible-to-have-a-pair-of-gaussian-random-variables-for-which-the-joint-d/30205#30205 , why is it okay (to make assumptions) in this case? Also, how could the covariance be computed in this situation? The text offers a problem to show this result later in problems, thus prompting this question.

1220602,Checking a fundamental unit of a real quadratic field,"I just want to check whether I have got the fundamental unit of a certain real quadratic field, but I can't find how. For instance, if I am working in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ then $\mathcal{O}_K=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ and so the fundamental unit is of the form $a+b\sqrt{2}$. I suppose the fundamental unit is $1+\sqrt{2}$, ie. $a=1, b=1$. I know this satisfies Pell's Equation:
$$a^2-db^2=1^2-(2)(1^2)=1-2=-1$$
and so is a unit. How would I show this is fundamental? Since the fundamental unit generates all the other units, I first considered trying to show that $(1+\sqrt{2})^n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ must generate units, but this got messy. Surely there is a simpler way to check if this unit is fundamental? Is it simply that these are the smallest values of $a,b$ to create a unit?","['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"
