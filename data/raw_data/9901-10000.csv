75594,Surface where number of coordinate charts in atlas has to be infinite,"In the definition of a parametrised surface $S$, for every point in the surface, $p \in W \subseteq S$, where $W$ is open, there exists a coordinate chart or patch , $F :U\to \mathbb{R}^n$ that maps to $p$ from an open subset $U \in \mathbb{R}^n$ Is that right? If anyone knows of a more general definition, I'm willing to learn. It sounds a lot like a manifold, which I'm not entirely familiar with. In this definition, the number of surface patches in the atlas is not stipulated. Given a parametrisable surface, is a finite number of charts sufficient to describe the surface? Can we find a surface that requires infinitely many patches to fully chart? If so, in which $\mathbb{R}^n$ does the first such surface occur?   In which dimensions is it always possible to find a finite number of patches for any given surface? EDIT: Added requirement that such a surface (manifold) be connected. One made from infinitely many disconnected subsets would have to be charted infinitely.",['differential-geometry']
75595,Minimal distance limit problem,"Consider a square $\{(x,y): 0\le x,y \le 1\}$ divided into $n^2$
  small squares by the lines $x = i/n$ and $y = j/n$. For $1\le i \le n$, let $x_i = i/n$ and $$d_i = \min_{0\le j\le n} \left| \sqrt{1 - x_i^2 } - j/n\right|.$$ Determine $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{i=1}^n  d_i$$ if it exists. I think this might be proved using Weyl's Theorem (see, e.g., Korner, Fourier Anal., p11 (Cambridge), because as $n$ gets large the the behavior of the curve as it cuts the line joining two vertices is not unlike that of the fractional part of $n\cdot a$, $a$ irrational, as it travels around (say) a unit circle.

My advice to him was to parametrize the ellipse (say, in the first quadrant) with $x = a \cos(t); y = b \sin(t)$, find normal lines, then use the formula for the distance between a point and a line.

Is there a general way to construct an injective module (except using Baer criterion)? The other question is, if a ring $R$ is hereditary then every submodule of a left $R$-projective module $M$ is projective. Then every quotient module of a left injective $R$-module is injective too. What about submodule of a left, injective $R$-module? Is it also injective? Please help me to find a counterexample (if it exists). Thanks.","['homological-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"

75613,"The set of all $x$ such that $xHx^{-1}\subseteq H$ is a subgroup, when $H\leq G$","I found this problem in a textbook of abstract algebra: Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Prove that $$\{x\in G:xHx^{-1}\subseteq H\}$$ is a subgroup of $G$. It's easy to prove that the set is closed under multiplication, but I'm stuck on proving that it is closed under inverses. If $H$ is finite, say $H=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$, suppose $x$ is an element of the set. Then $xa_1x^{-1},\ldots,xa_nx^{-1}$ are all distinct, hence they are exactly $a_1,\ldots,a_n$, in some order. Therefore any element $b\in H$ can be written as $xcx^{-1}$ for some $c\in H$, and hence $x^{-1}bx=x^{-1}(xcx^{-1})x=c$ is also in $H$. So $x^{-1}$ is also an element of the set. However, the above method does not work if $H$ is infinite. The main idea is to prove that $x^{-1}ax\in H$ for every $a\in H$, given that $xax^{-1}\in H$ for every $a\in H$. I was trying to do some substitutions of $a$ to get the required result, but I can't seem to get the $x^{-1}$ to the left. Any help would be appreciated. It may be worth mentioning that I just started learning this group theory thing for a few days, so please adjust your explanation accordingly. Thanks in advance.",['group-theory']
75617,Why is every $N$-invariant polynomial function on $n\times n$ matrices in the Plücker algebra?,"Let $k$ be a field and $k[{\bf x}] = k[x_{ij}: 1 \leq i, j \leq n]$ be a polynomial algebra that I can think of as the algebra of functions on $n \times n$ matrices that are polynomial in each coordinate. I'd like to understand the polynomials $f$ in $k[{\bf x}]$ that are invariant by left translations by the unipotent group $N$ of upper triangular matrices: that is, those $f \in k[{\bf x}]$ that satisfy $f(ng) = f(g)$ for all $g \in M_n(k)$ and all $n \in N$. In this blog post on the representations of $GL_n$ , I think that David Speyer claims that the algebra of $N$-invariants as described above is generated, as an algebra over $k$, by all the bottom-justified minors: 
that is, for every subset $\sigma =\{\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_r\} \subset \{1, \ldots, n\}$ let $f_{\sigma}$ be the polynomial that corresponds to the $r \times r$ minor given by the bottom $r$ rows and the columns $\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_r$. Then the algebra generated by all of the $f_\sigma$ (something like a Plücker algebra) is supposedly exactly the algebra of $N$-invariants. It's not hard to convince yourself that all the $f_\sigma$s are $N$-invariant, but how can you show that there's nothing else? Speyer tantalizingly suggests that there are various arguments, and that Theorem 14.11 of Miller-Sturmfels provides one, but I can't figure out how it does that. For what it's worth, the theorem says that the $f_\sigma$s form a sagbi basis for the Plücker algebra with any term order where the leading term of each $f_\sigma$ is the diagonal (or antidiagonal) one. You can see the statement here ; search inside for ""diagonal or antidiagonal"". (Keep in mind that Miller-Sturmfels uses top-justified minors, so the Plücker algebra there is invariant by left translation by the lower-triangular unipotents. but I don't think that changes things much.) Any ideas would be much appreciated! I'd love to understand how Theorem 14.11 might be used to prove that the $f_\sigma$s generate the full algebra of $N$-invariants. I'm also terribly curious about other possible arguments.","['representation-theory', 'combinatorics']"
75623,How slow/fast can $L^p$ norm grow?,"This is actually an exercise in Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis , $L^p$ spaces chapter. Could anyone help me out? Thanks in advance. Motivation: It's well known that if we have a function $f$ which belongs to $L^p(0,1)$ for all $p\ge 1$. Then $\lim_{p\rightarrow \infty}\|f\|_p=\|f\|_{\infty}$ (moreover, $\|f\|_p$ is increasing in $p$). This is true even if $\|f\|_{\infty}=\infty$. Question: How slow (fast) can $\|f\|_p$ grow when $\|f\|_{\infty}=\infty$? More precisely, given any positive increasing function $\Phi$ with $\lim_{p\rightarrow \infty}\Phi(p)=\infty$, can we always find a function $f$ which belongs to $L^p(0,1)$ for all $p\ge 1$, and $\|f\|_{\infty}=\infty$, such that $\|f\|_p\le (\ge)\Phi(p)$ for large $p$?","['banach-spaces', 'real-analysis']"

One particular basis for the field extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ obtained by adjoining the roots of $f$ is given by $\{\alpha_j\}_{j=1}^d$.  For which $k$ does the set $\{\alpha_j^k\}_{j=1}^d$ also provide a basis? If this is in general a difficult question, could I at least show that I obtain a basis for infinitely many $k$? Example: Consider the polynomial $x^2-2$.  The $k$th powers of the roots $\{\pm \sqrt{2}\}$ provide a basis for my field extension precisely when $k$ is odd. Edit: As Gerry Myerson points out, and as my example indicates, I am actually more interested in when the $k$th powers of the roots generate the extension over $\mathbb{Q}$.

75706,Does there exist a ring which is not a principal ideal ring and which has exactly six different ideals?,"Does there exist a ring which is not a principal ideal ring and which has exactly six different ideals? (For me a ring is commutative with a unit element.) I can show that any ring having at most five ideals is a principal ideal ring. EDIT: The proof goes as follows, it is not so hard. Suppose that $R$ is a ring which is not principal and which has at most five ideals. Then there must exist a proper ideal of the form $(\alpha,\beta)$ in $R$ which is not principal. Then $(0), (\alpha),(\beta),(\alpha, \beta), R$ must be the five different ideals of $R$. But what about $(\alpha + \beta)$? It cannot be $(0)$ or $(\alpha,\beta)$ or $R$. Say that it is $(\alpha)$. Then we get that $\alpha \mid \beta$, hence $(\alpha,\beta) = (\alpha)$, contradiction! Similarly, it cannot be $(\beta)$.

75715,"Number of primefactors in $ f(n,W) = \prod_{k=1}^W (p_k^n -1) \text{ where } p_k=Prime(k) $","I'm reviving an old fiddling, although I do not yet really see its benefit. Beginning with the eulerproduct for the zeta-function in the representation $\small \zeta(n)=\prod {1\over 1-p^{-n} } = \prod {p^n \over p^n-1 }$ I asked whether it might be meaningful to try to find an asymptotic expression for the occurences of primefactors in the denominator, depending on the number W of Eulerterms and then exponent n . So I define 
$$\ z(n,W) = \prod_{k=1}^W p_k^n - 1 \qquad p_k \in \mathbb P $$ 
and count the primefactors $\small q_k $ (with multiplicity) in 
$$\small z(n,W) = q_1^{a_{1,n}} q_2^{a_2} q_3^{a_3} \ldots  $$
Of course this is increasing with W and erratically. But due to the randomness and seemingly uniform distribution of the primes with respect to their moduli to any primes I seem to get meaningful constants for the first few, say 20, primes $\small q_k$ when W goes to 10000 or to 100000 and I evalute their relative frequencies $\small z(n,W)/W $. I get the provisorical formula for the exponents of the primefactors $\small q_k \gt 2$ 
$$ {a_{k,n}\over W} \sim gcd(n,q_k-1)\cdot {q_k + (q_k - 1)\{n,q_k\} \over (q_k -1)^2} $$ where the bracketed expression means ""exponent of primefactor $\small q_k$ in n "" My first question is: can this be justified? If I understand things correctly, this would require, that the primes are not only equally distributed modulo any prime, but even modulo any prime-power, and in general completely ""symmetric"" , just like $\small \mathbb N $ it self. My second question concerns the primefactor $\small q_1 = 2$ Here I concluded from the achieved numerical evidence, that the same formula is asymptotically valid with a small correction $$ {a_{k,n}\over W} \sim gcd(n,q_k-1)\cdot {q_k + [2|n]+ (q_k - 1)\{n,q_k\} \over (q_k -1)^2} =  2 + [2|n] + \{n,2 \} $$
where the iverson-bracket $\small [2|n] $ evaluates to 1 or 0 depending on whether 2 divides n or not.   From the construction of the whole expression it looks reasonable under the hypothese, that the distribution of primes (mod 2) , (mod 4) , (mod 8) etc is also ""symmetric"" in the long run. But after a closer look it seems, that there is a nonneglectable small error of 2% say: for W=10000 I expect for exponent n=1 $\small a_1=20000$ but empirically 46 are missing; for W=20000 I get 96 missing and for W=30000 I get 127 missing. (Some more example in that region for W suggest, that this is not a fluctuation around a zero-error, but has a bias) Question 2: Is there some systematic reason for that bigger error with the primefactor 2? And if, what would be a better aymptotic formula/formula for the relative frequency of that primefactor? table for relative frequencies of primefactors q_k( horizontal) and n (vertical), scaled by $\small (q_k-1)^2$, rounded to integers, based on the first W=60000 terms of the Eulerproduct:

For instance the primefactor $\small q_3=5 $ occurs asymptotically in 10 of $\small (5-1)^2 =16 $ cases, or, if W=16000 for the denominator of the partial Eulerproduct with exponent 2 , then we'll have about $\small 10 \cdot W/16 = 1000 $ occurences of the primefactor 5.

I have a couple of related data sets that are small (~150) positive integer samples and that seem rather strange. Because they're small, I don't take their histograms seriously, so I've performed Gaussian kernel density estimation on both of them. (While I haven't been that careful about bandwidth selection, I've at least taken this into account, and doubt it is a significant issue in the present context--but I could be wrong.) The weird thing is this: in both cases, I get a remarkably good-looking fit to a Cauchy distribution (I've done this by hand, no MLE stuff in this instance*, but I've corroborated the fits by looking at normal and log-log plots) which is centered at a positive number (i.e., the KDE basically looks like this ). But as I've said, the samples are (and must be) positive integers, so the support of the distribution is the same. On the other hand, the Cauchy distribution fits very well on the positive region. The only thing that I can imagine producing something like this besides a mistake on my part is that these samples might admit some kind of interpretation of sums of IIDRVs and that leads to the apparent Cauchy-ness due to the generalized CLT . What might cause this? Explanations for mistakes are particularly
  welcome. However, please note my doubts about the kernel bandwidth

From the distribution of the repetition count of every distinct name, is there a way to estimate the size of the fixed list ?

On the other hand, if the distribution of the repeat counts is far away from zero, I can be reasonably confident that the sample size is much larger than the word list, and that I probably have observed the full list already.

75779,Definition of Grothendieck Connection,"I suppose this is not hard, but I thought quite a time about it and don't get what the point is. I'm reading Deligne's ""Equations differentielles..."", where he defines what a Grothendieck Connection is: you consider a smooth projective variety $X$ over the complex numbers and a coherent sheaf $F$ on it. Let $X_1$ be the first infinitesimal neighborhood of the diagonal of $X$ and $p_1,p_2$ the two projections of $X_1$ to $X$. Then one defines a connection as a homomorphism $p_1^*F \rightarrow p_2^*F$, which restricts to the identiy on $X$. Deligne says in a bracket that such a homomorphism is always an isomorphism.
What's the reason for this? Addition: can one formulate a general principle, which roughly says that if I have a homomorphism on the first order neighborhood of the diagonal, which is an iso on $X$, then it is already an iso?

75781,Every collection of disjoint non-empty open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is countable?,"This is my first question on the forum. I'm wondering if the following proof is valid. Proof: Let $\{A_\lambda\}_{\lambda \in L}$ be an arbitrary collection of disjoint non-empty open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. Since every non-empty open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ can be written uniquely as a countable union of disjoint open intervals, we can take the union $A = \bigcup\limits_{\lambda \in L}A_\lambda$ and decompose it $A = \bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{N}} I_n$ in disjoint open intervals which forms a countable collection. We can also decompose each $A_\lambda$ as $\bigcup\limits_{m \in \mathbb{N}}J_{\lambda,m}$. For $\lambda \neq \mu \in L$, $A_\lambda \cap A_\mu = \emptyset$ and this is a new representation of $A$: $$A = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} I_n = \bigcup_{\substack{\lambda \in L \\ m \in \mathbb{N}}} J_{\lambda,m}$$ No matter how complicated the union over $L$ is, the $J_{\lambda,m}$ are disjoint open intervals. Thus, by the uniqueness, the two collections are exactly the same. As the final argument, we produce an injection $\varphi:\{A_\lambda\} \mapsto \{J_{\lambda,m}\}$ picking for each $A_\lambda$ some $J_{\lambda,m}$. I can't see any fault, but the result seems incredibly strong to me. P.S.: stack exchange has some bug related to \bigcup and \bigcap symbols?","['elementary-set-theory', 'analysis']"
75788,A representation theorem of harmonic functions,"I am trying to solve a problem in harmonic functions in Rudin's book(Real and Complex analysis 3rd edition) To clarify the problem I want to ask, we need some notations: (1) $U$ is the open unit disc, and $T$ is the unit circle, the boundary of $U$ in the complex plane (2) $P(z,e^{it})$ is the Poisson Kernel. $$P(z,e^{it})=\frac{1-|z|^2}{|e^{it}-z|^2}$$ for $z\in U$, $e^{it}\in T$ (3)$P[f]$ is the Poisson Integral against $f\in L^1(T)$ (4)$P[d\mu]$ is the Poisson Integral against a complex measure on $T$, defined by $$P[d\mu](z)=\int_T P(z,e^{it})d\mu(e^{it})\quad (z\in U)$$ (5)$C(T)$ is the space consisting of all the continuous complex functions on $T$ (6)We associate to any function $u$ in $U$ a family of functions $u_r$ on $T$, defined by $$u_r(e^{it})=u(re^{it})\quad(0\leq r<1)$$ (7)The measure $\sigma$ is defined by $\sigma=m/2\pi$, where $m$ is ordinary Lebesgue measure on $T$ (8)$||u_r||_1$ is defined by $$||u_r||_1=\int_T |u_r|d\sigma\quad(0\leq r<1)$$ The problem is: Suppose $u$ is harmonic in $U$, and $\{u_r:0\leq r<1\}$ is a uniformly integrable subset of $L^1(T)$. Modify the proof of Theorem 11.30 to show that $u=P[f]$ for some $f\in L^1(T)$. Before stating Theorem 11.30, one needs theorem 11.29. Theorem 11.29: Suppose that (a)$X$ is a separable Banach space, (b)${\Lambda_n}$ is a sequence of linear functionals on $X$, (c)$sup_n||\Lambda_n||=M<\infty$ Then there is a subsequence $\{\Lambda_{n_i}\}$ such that the limit $$\Lambda x=\lim_{i\to\infty}\Lambda_{n_i} x$$ exists for every $x\in X$. Moreover, $\Lambda$ is linear, and $||\Lambda||\leq M$ Proof (Sketch): Note that $\{\Lambda_n\}$ is pointwise bounded and equicontinuous. Since each point of $X$ is a compact set, Theorem 11.29 follows from Arzela-Ascoli Theorem. Besides, it is obvious that $||\Lambda||\leq M$ and that $\Lambda$ is linear. Theorem 11.30: Suppose $u$ is harmonic in $U$, and $$sup_{0<r<1} ||u_r||_1=M<\infty$$ It follows that there is a unique complex Borel measure $\mu$ on $T$ so that $u=P[d\mu]$ Proof: Define linear functionals $\Lambda_r$ on $C(T)$ by $$\Lambda_r g=\int_T gu_rd\sigma\quad (0\leq r<1)$$ Therefore, $||\Lambda_r||\leq M$. By Theorem 11.29 and Riesz representation theorem for the dual of $C(T)$ there is a measure $\mu$ on $T$, with $||\mu$$||\leq M$, and a sequence $r_j\to 1$, so that $$\lim_{j\to\infty}\int_T gu_{r_j}d\sigma=\int_T gd\mu\quad (*)$$ for every $g\in C(T)$. Put $h_j(z)=u(r_j z)$. Then $h_j$ is harmonic in $U$, continuous on $\bar{U}$, and is therefore the Poisson integral of its restriction to $T$. Fix $z\in U$, and apply $(*)$ with $$g(e^{it})=P(z,e^{it})$$ Since $h_j(e^{it})=u_{r_j}(e^{it})$, we obtain $$u(z)=\lim_j u(r_j z)=\lim_j h_j(z)$$, and $$\lim_j h_j(z)=\lim_j\int_T P(z,e^{it})h_j(e^{it})d\sigma(e^{it})=\int_T P(z,e^{it})d\mu(e^{it})=P[d\mu](z)$$ To prove uniqueness, it suffices to show that $P[d\mu]=0$ implies $\mu=0$. Pick $f\in C(T)$, put $u=P[f]$, $v=p[d\mu]$. By Fubini's theorem, and the symmetry $P(re^{i\theta},e^{it})=P(re^{it},e^{i\theta})$, $$\int_T u_rd\mu=\int_T v_rfd\sigma\quad (0\leq r<1)$$ When $v=0$ then $v_r=0$, and since $u_r\to f$ uniformly, as $r\to 1$, we conclude that $$\int_T fd\mu=0$$ for every $f\in C(T)$ if $P[d\mu]=0$. By Riesz representation theorem, $\mu=0$. Any hints will be appreciated. I've really no idea how to modify the proof of Themorem 11.30, because the $L^1$-boundedness of the family $\{u_r\}$ seemes to play an important role in the proof. However, I cannot see the relationship between the boundedness and uniformly integrability. I have goolged this problem, but I cannot find anything helpful. Again, any hints will be appreciated.",['complex-analysis']

75944,Basics of schemes and morphisms of schemes,"I'm currently reading through Hartshorne, and have come across a few things that have left me wondering. (i) Somewhat pedantic, but also because I don't actually know the answer, (in Example 2.3.4) he looks at the affine plane over an algebraically closed field, defined as the scheme of $k[x,y]$, and discusses some of its properties. He says Also, for each irreducible polynomial $f(x,y)$, there is a point $\eta$ whose closure consists of $\eta$ together with all closed points $(a,b)$ for which $f(a,b) = 0$. We say that $\eta$ is a generic point of the curve $f(x,y) = 0$. Now, is $\eta$ unique? The way I read the first sentence, I feel there should be only one such point, but then he says $\eta$ is a generic point instead of the generic point, which really made me feel it was not unique when I read it. (ii) The two definitions before Example 3.2.1 define certain morphisms to be locally of finite type , finite type or simply finite , but the very next example says a scheme (with no morphism between schemes in the example) is of finite type. What does this mean? Perhaps that the scheme itself admits a covering via affine subsets that are the Spec of rings? (iii) Consider $R = \mathbb{C}[x]/(x^2)$. Then Spec $R$ has only one element, namely $(x)$. Hence Spec $R$ is irreducible. In a somewhat entertaining way however, Spec $R$ is not reduced. This follows quite easily from Example 3.0.1 in the book (in particular ""$X$ is reduced if and only if nil $A = 0$"", where nil $A$ is the nilradical of $A$, which in our case is $(x)$) but I'm fairly new to localization, so what hoping someone could make sure I'm not making a silly mistake in trying to show this directly. Is the localization of $R$ at $(x)$ simple $R$ again? (And hence the sheaf $\mathcal{O}((x)) = R$, which certainly has non-zero nilpotents.) I should add, for the last one, I'm sure it was not Hartshorne that decided to use irreducible and reduced for distinct things, but I'm curious if anyone knows why the terminology came about this way?

For a sphere this is simple, $\sqrt{g}=R^2$ and $\mathcal{R}=\frac{2}{R^2}$, where $R$ is the radius. Therefore, $\chi=2$, as suggested by the second formula above.

76139,Figuring out probabilities with Hidden Markov Models,"I'm really new to Math so sorry in advance if this question does not make sense. Also I cross posted this on stats.stackexchange.com also. Background: I'm trying to learn about hidden Markov models and they seem interesting but I was wondering about the probabilities they use to generate their predictions. Most of the information I have read has probabilities already about changing states and staying in the current state. I was on Github and looked up code(mainly python code) to understand a bit better but either they have the probabilities already computed or are calculating it based on occurrences in other documents(in the case of a spell checker, it studied a book to understand the words occurrences as well as the probability of them being beside each other). Problem: But I'm trying to understand the theory of figuring out probabilities for the HMM when I'm not using speech or text recognition.  I'm trying to make a game which is trying to guess numbers based on a users behaviour(i.e. user is given a list of fruit prices and picks a basket of various fruits. We know the individual fruit prices and the users only reports the total cost of their basket, we then try to find the quantities of fruit they choose. They are not adversarial and cannot change their total quantities by more than 5%). My approach was to first find all the possibilities for all days, then using a graph to create edges between nodes that were within 5% and remove all improbable nodes.  Now I have a range and with every turn new paths are being created and impossible ones are being removed.  So within that range I am trying have a program 'zero' in on the correct solution. I think the HMM model would be helpful for this but I'm a bit confused on the application of  Baum–Welch or forward-backward algorithm to create probabilities(that I can feed into my implementation of hmm). If it helps, I originally posted this at stackexchange (alot of details about the game itself as well code I have) . I got a very good solution, to find the nodes with the highest amount of edges as solutions.  Its okay but it doesn't select a solution and if it makes a mistake it simply continues the path. I was also advised from mathexchange that this can be solved as a hidden markov model.  I am basically struggling with applying it to my problem(right now figuring out the probability part. I have been told to create all paths as equally probable but I don't understand how that helps a HMM pick the most probable solution). If anyone has any suggestions or suggested reading or sample code(I'm learning python, but I can try to understand any other code thats provided). If possible can it be explained to a layman(I think I can apply the code if I can clearly understand the theory, which apparently I do not).

76175,Distribution of Ratio of Exponential and Gamma random variable,"A recent question ( Are there any (pairs of) simple distributions that give rise to a power law ratio? ) asked about the distribution of the ratio of two random variables, and the answer accepted there was a reference to Wikipedia which (in simplified and restated form) claims that if $X$ is a Gamma random variable with parameters $(n, 1)$ and $Y$ is an exponential random variable with parameter $1$ , then $Y/X$ is a Pareto random variable with parameters $(1, n)$ .  Presumably $X$ and $Y$ need to be independent for this result to hold.  But, Wikipedia's page on Pareto random variables doesn't seem to include a statement as to what $(1, n)$ means, though based on what it does says, a reasonable interpretation is that the Pareto random variable takes on values in $(1,\infty)$ and its complementary CDF decays away as $z^{-n}$ . My question is:  what is the intuitive explanation for the ratio $Y/X$ to have value $1$ or more?  It would seem that all positive values should occur, and indeed the event $\{Y < X\}$ should have large probability since the Gamma random variable has larger mean than the exponential random variable. I did work out the complementary CDF of $Y/X$ and got $(1+z)^{-n}$ for $z > 0$ which is not quite what Wikipedia claims. Added Note:  Thanks to Sasha and Didier Piau for confirming my calculation that
for $z > 0$ , $P\{Y/X > z\} = (1+z)^{-n}$ which of course implies that $$P\{Y/X + 1 > z\} = P\{Y/X > z-1\} = (1 + z - 1)^{-n} = z^{-n}~ \text{for}~ z > 1$$ and thus it is $Y/X + 1$ which is a Pareto random variable, not $Y/X$ as claimed by
Wikipedia.  This leads to a simple answer to 
a question posed by S Huntsman:  Are there any (pairs) of simple distributions that give rise to a power law ratio? If $W$ and $X$ are the $(n+1)$ -th and $n$ -th arrival times in a (homogeneous) Poisson process, then $W/X$ is a Pareto $(1,n)$ random variable: $P\{W/X > a\} = a^{-n}$ for $a > 1$ . I suspect that this result is quite well known in the theory 
of Poisson processes but I don't have a reference for it.","['probability-distributions', 'probability']"
76176,Enumerating all subgroups of the symmetric group,"Is there an efficient way to enumerate the unique subgroups of the symmetric group? Naïvely, for the symmetric group $S_n$ of order $\left | S_n \right | = n!$, there are $2^{n!}$ subsets of the group members that could potentially form a subgroup. In addition, many of these subgroups are going to be isomorphic to each other. I feel that the question has an easy answer in terms of the conjugacy classes, but I don't see how. If the answer generalizes to all finite groups, please elaborate!","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'symmetric-groups']"
76177,Discrete Math - Bézout Coefficients,"I'm taking a discrete math course, and were on Bézout Coefficients right now. I kind of understand the algorithm, the generalization. However the example in the book is throwing me off. The steps in the Euclidean algorithm to find $\gcd(101, 4620)$ are: $$\begin{align}
4620 &= 45 \cdot 101 + 75  \\
101 &= 1 \cdot  75 + 26  \\
75 &= 2 \cdot  26 + 23  \\
26 &= 1 \cdot  23 + 3  \\
23 &= 7 \cdot  3 + 2  \\
3 &= 1 \cdot  2 + 1  \\
2 &= 2 \cdot  1  
\end{align}$$ This I understand. Now to find the Bézout coefficients they follow these steps. $$\begin{array}{rll}
1 &= 3 - 1 \cdot 2  &\\
  &= 3 - 1 \cdot  (23 - 7 \cdot  3) &= -1 \cdot  23 + 8 \cdot  3  \\
  &= -1 \cdot  23 + 8 \cdot  (25 - 1 \cdot  23) &= 8 \cdot  26 - 9 \cdot  23  \\
  &= 8 \cdot  26 - 9 \cdot  (75 - 2 \cdot  26) &= -0 \cdot  75 + 26 \cdot  26  \\
  &= -0 \cdot  75 + 26 \cdot  (101 - 1 \cdot  75) &= 26 \cdot  101 - 35 \cdot  75  \\
  &= 26 \cdot  101 - 35 \cdot  (4620 - 45 \cdot  101) &= -35 \cdot  4620 + 1601 \cdot  101 \\

76181,Confused about $f: \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \to \mathbb{R}$,"I'm currently watching a lecture on Machine Learning at Stanford university.  The lecturer defines $f$ to be a mapping from $\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ to $\mathbb{R}$.  I understand this to be a function that maps a matrix to a scalar value, i.e. trace, determinant. However, he then goes on to say that the derivative of such a function is defined by the derivative of $f$ with respect to each element which to me would be $\frac{df}{dA_{mn}} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$.  That doesn't make sense : / it's derivative would therefore have a different mapping, which can't be true.

76186,Definition of injective function,"From wikipedia I obtain the following definition of an injective function : Let $f$ be a function whose domain is a set $A$. The function $f$ is injective if for all $a$ and $b$ in $A$, if $f(a) = f(b)$, then $a = b$; that is, $f(a) = f(b)$ implies $a = b$. From this I conclude that a function $f$ is injective if the below statement is true for all $a,b \in A$: $$f(a)=f(b) \implies a=b$$ My question is: Can I re-formulate the above statement as $f(a)=f(b) \iff a=b$ ?","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions', 'definition']"
76211,how to find correlation between 2 arrays of 1's and 0's?,"For my case, I have 2 arrays or sets of data, 100 elements, and the values are only 0 and 1. What test or procedure would measure the correlation or independence of the 2 sets? To give an example of the data, suppose one counted if it rained or not in 2 different cities over a period of 100 days. The data would be recorded as 0 for no rain that day, or 1 for any rain that day. After 100 days, CityA would have data of {0,1,0,0,1 ...} with 100 data points, and CityB would have data of {0,1,1,0,0, ...} also with 100 data points. The question is whether the rain in the 2 cities is correlated positively or negatively, or independent. If it's important, these data sets are time-series, or just that the order is fixed, and the event is mostly randomly distributed over the 100 days. One measure I found was the Phi Coefficient. But the example in my text book says it's for 2 dichotomous values a subject may have, eg smoking and cancer, male/female and pets, married and employed, etc. I was not sure if this applied to my case where it's 2 time series. thanks in advance, and I hope I've phrased my question clearly, if not feel free to ask for more details if needed, thanks",['statistics']

76257,"Euclid / Hilbert: ""Two lines parallel to a third line are parallel to each other.""","Background Many geometry books used to teach high-schoolers these days try to transfer Hilbert's reworking of Euclid's axioms into a (somewhat) palatable form for students. They don't usually seem to go into as much detail, say, about betweenness, but they include an SAS ""Postulate"" rather than an SAS ""Theorem."" In particular, this book by Jurgensen, Brown, and Jurgensen has the following eleven postulates in its first three chapters (I could have them a little off): Ruler Segment addition Protractor Angle addition A line contains two points; a plane contains three noncollinear points; space contains four noncoplanar points Two points define a line Given three points, there exists a plane containing them; three noncollinear points determine a plane If a plane contains two points, then it contains the line connecting them If two planes intersect, their intersection is a line If a transversal crosses parallel lines, then corresponding angles are equal If a transversal crosses two lines and corresponding angles are equal, then the lines are parallel and goes on to state the following theorem without proof: 3-11. If two lines are parallel to a third line, then the lines are parallel. The Question In my tutoring sessions with geometry students, we always use this book because I feel that it's pretty good. But when we get to this point, we go, ""Okay, we're pretty competent at geometry; let's try to prove it."" And we always breeze through the case where the lines are in a plane together, and come up dry in the general case. Looking into Euclid XI tonight, I see that this is the ninth proposition. Its proof uses the sixth: ""If lines make right angles to the same plane, then they are parallel."" This, in turn, uses I.4 (SAS) and I.8 (SSS), which in Jurgensen/Brown/Jurgensen are postulates in the next chapter. So is 3.11 provable from the eleven postulates? Or are the authors just careless--is there a model of postulates 1 through 11 in which there are two noncoplanar lines parallel to a third line? Edit: Some definitions for this context. Two lines are parallel if they are coplanar and nonintersecting. A transversal is a line in a plane intersecting two other lines in that plane at different points. A line and a plane are perpendicular if the line is perpendicular to all lines in the plane through the point of intersection. I'm also not sure if the following (from Chapter 4) can be proved without any triangle postulates: ""If a line is perpendicular to two lines in a plane, then it is perpendicular to all lines in that plane through the point of intersection.""","['geometry', 'axioms']"
