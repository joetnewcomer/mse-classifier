2042801,Difference between State Space and Sample Space,"Aren't they both the same?
According to me they are just different terminologies used for different types of systems. What I understand is that sample space is used when we talk about static systems and state space when we talk about dynamic systems. Am I correct? If not then what exactly is the difference between them? My teacher had asked for the state space in Markov Chain questions, so I'm guessing that state space is used only in dynamic systems? She said that if we roll 2 dice then the sample space will be {1,2,...,6} , but the state space will be {(1,1),(1,2),...,(6,6)} . But as far as I remember, the sample space for rolling 2 dice is {(1,1),(1,2),...,(6,6)} .","['probability-theory', 'statistics']"

2042832,Interpreting a (function of) probability distribution as a random variable?,"Consider, for example, Wikipedia's definition of the entropy of of a discrete random variable $X$ : $$H(X) = \mathbb{E}[I(X)] = \mathbb{E}[-ln(P(X))]$$ Here $\mathbb{E}$
  is the expected value operator, and $I$ is the information content of
  $X$. $I(X)$ is itself a random variable. Since $I(X)$ is a function of $P(X)$, the PMF $P(X)$ itself is considered to be a random variable that takes on the value $P(x)$ in the event $X=x$. Is my interpretation correct? A bit of a background: I see this kind of thing a lot in statistics problems dealing with KL divergence (e.g. in EM or variational inference where we often deal with $\mathbb{E}_{q(z)}[logp(z|\theta)]$), and I've always treated the expected value operator like a ""macro"" where I substitute $\mathbb{E}_{q(z)}[\cdot]$ with $\sum_z \cdot q(z)$ or $\int \cdot q(z) dz$ provided that the argument is some function of some random variable.

2042938,Max dimension of a subspace of singular $n\times n$ matrices,"I am sure the answer to this is (kind of) well known. I've searched the web and the site for a proof and found nothing, and if this is a duplicate, I'm sorry. The following question was given in a contest I took part. I had an approach but it didn't solve the problem. Consider $V$ a linear subspace of the real vector space $\mathcal{M}_n(\Bbb{R})$ ($n\times n$ real entries matrices) such that $V$ contains only singular matrices (i.e matrices with determinant equal to $0$). What is the maximal dimension of $V$? A quick guess would be $n^2-n$ since if we consider $W$ the set of $n\times n$ real matrices with last line equal to $0$ then this space has dimension $n^2-n$ and it is a linear space of singular matrices. Now the only thing there is to prove is that if $V$ is a subspace of $\mathcal{M}_n(\Bbb{R})$ of dimension $k > n^2-n$ then $V$ contains a non-singular matrix. The official proof was unsatisfactory for me, because it was a combinatorial one, and seemed to have few things in common with linear algebra. I was hoping for a pure linear algebra proof. My approach was to search for a permutation matrix in $V$, but I used some 'false theorem' in between, which I am ashamed to post here.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

How do we extricate the permutation matrices from the row elimination matrices? Essentially the idea, if I understand it correctly, is that we perform a series of transformations on a matrix $A$ by applying successive lower triangular matrices that eliminate single elements, thus $L_nL_{n-1}...L_2L_1A = U$. In my understanding, this is computationally useful because lower triangular atomic matrices can be inverted by changing the sign of the off-diagonal element, so $A = L_1^{-1}L_2^{-1}...U$. That's all fine (assuming I'm correct), but the introduction of pivot matrices between each $L_j$ seems to make the problem intractable. In every accounting I've seen some sorcery occurs that looks like this: 
$$L_nP_nL_{n-1}...P_3L_2P_2L_1P_1A = U \Rightarrow P_nP_{n-1}...P_2P_1L_nL_{n-1}...L_2L_1A = U$$ And no one bothers to explain how this happens or in fact even states it explicitly.

2043365,Closed subschemes of $\mathbb{P}^n_R$ ($R$ noetherian).,"This is a follow up to my previous question: Zero subscheme of a section: Making computations. I want to show that every closed subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^n_R$ when $R$ is Noetherian is of the form $V(s)$ (i.e. the vanishing scheme of a section of a vector bundle). The description $\mathbb{P}^n_R$ we have in our algebraic geomtry course is through explicit gluing, so I have no tools regarding graded ideals and graded modules. Here is what I tried ( I think it is wrong) : Let $Z$ denote the closed the closed subscheme and $\mathcal{O}_X \to i_{*}\mathcal{O}_Z$ the associated surjection. Since $i$ is a closed embedding $i_{*}\mathcal{O}_Z$ is a quasi-coherent sheaf on $X$. Therefore its kernel is also quasi-coherent. Since $R$ is noetherian this kernel is of finite type. Let us denote the kernel by $\mathscr{I}$. I know that there exists some integer such that  $\mathscr{I}(m)$ is generated by global sections and those global sections can be identified with  some $f_i \in \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n_R}(m)(\mathbb{P}^n_R)$ homogeneous polynomials of degree $m$. I would like to say that the vanishing subscheme of that family $\{f_i\}_{i=0}^k$ is exactly $Z$. If that were true every closed subscheme would be cut out by polynomials of the same degree and that does not make sense to me at all. How can I solve this? Furthermore, how can I show that once I get this right that closed subscheme is going to satisfy the pullback property I stated in the other question?",['algebraic-geometry']

First, I would have to find the sample's variance, which is $\dfrac{1}{500-1}(0.08-0.05)^2 = 0.0000018$, so the standard deviation is $0.00134$. The discriminating function would be Student's T fonction. The observed T is $\dfrac{0.08-0.05}{0.00134}*\sqrt{500} = 499$. That means that the critical $\alpha$ value would be incredibly small.

2043682,Isogonal operator is the product of an orthogonal map with a homothety,"Exercise $31$ in chapter $8$ of Shilov's Linear Algebra book states that if $A\colon \Bbb R^n \to \Bbb R^n$ is an isogonal operator (that is, $\langle x,y\rangle = 0 \implies \langle Ax,Ay\rangle = 0$, usual inner product), then $A$ is the product of an orthogonal map with a homothety. He gives the following hint in the end: $A$ transforms the standard orthonormal basis $\{e_1,\cdots,e_n\}$ into an orthogonal basis $\{f_1'=\alpha_1f_1,\cdots,f_n'=\alpha_nf_n\}$, where each $f_i$ is an unit vector. Let $Q$ take $f_i$ into $e_i$ - so that $Q$ is orthogonal. Thus $QA$ is diagonal and isogonal. If $\alpha_i \neq \alpha_j$, construct a pair of orthogonal vectors which are carried into non-orthogonal vectors via $QA$. I have a few problems with that sketch. He says that a homothety is of the form $Tx = \lambda x$ for all $x$ but does not exclude the possibility of $\lambda = 0$. If $A = 0$ the problem is trivial, but I could not prove that $A \neq 0$ being isogonal implies $A$ injective. Meaning I don't really know that the $\{f_i\}$ are independent. In other words, I don't know why each $\alpha_i$ is non-zero. When he says that $\alpha_i \neq \alpha_j$ enables us to construct a ""bad"" pair, the obvious choice is to take the diagonals: clearly $\langle e_i+e_j,e_i-e_j\rangle=0$, but $\langle QA(e_i+e_j),QA(e_i-e_j)\rangle = \alpha_i^2-\alpha_j^2$ still could be zero if $\alpha_i =- \alpha_j$. Lastly, I was curious to see if this result is valid for a pseudo-euclidean product in $\Bbb R^n_\nu$, say. I think lightlike vectors would screw everything, but perhaps this discussion is better suited for another question. Can someone help me dot the i's and cross the t's here?

Then it follows that $S$ is non-empty by Archimedean Property, and there is a unique $n \in S$, $a \ge n$ by the well ordering principle. Since $n \in S$, we have $n > t$. ( why? ) Now, consider two possibilities, $n =1$ or $n > 1$. If $n=1$, then $n-1 = 0$, and also $0 < t$ ( how do we know this again? ). If $n > 1$, then $n \in \Bbb N$, but by construction $n-1 \notin S$. ( How? ) So $n - 1 \le t$. (HOW???) Hence $n - 1 \le t < n$.

However, the restriction of an isomorphism $f : \mathrm{Frac}(R)[X] \to \mathrm{Frac}(S)[X]$ to $(\mathrm{Frac}(R))^*$ has range lying in $(\Frac(S))^*$, and since $f(0)=0$ it follows that $f\vert_{\Frac(R)} : \Frac(R) \to \Frac(S)$ is an isomorphism. It doesn't follow that $R \cong S$. That's why I think that a counter-example may come from such examples . See also here . Let

2044724,Maurer-Cartan form and curvature form on a Lie Group,"We know that, given a Lie group, we can build its Maurer-Cartan form $\omega_G=P^{-1}dP$ (I don't explain now the meaning of these symbols, which I think to be generally known). This is a left-invariant form and satisfies the Maurer-Cartan equation $d\omega_G+\omega_G\wedge\omega_G=0$. My question is: how can we relate this form with the so-called ""curvature forms"" on the left-invariant metric (I use ""the"" since they're all equivalent)? I'll explain this question by steps: 1) By ""connection form"" I mean a matrix-valued 1-form on a manifold which satisfies $\nabla e_i=\omega^j_i\otimes e_j$ given a frame $\{e_j\}$. Is there a clear way to obtain the connection form from the M-C form? 2) Given the connection form $\omega$, we define the curvature form $\Theta=d\omega+\omega\wedge\omega$ (i.e. $\Theta^j_i=d\omega_i^j+\omega^j_k\wedge\omega^k_i$). It turns out that $\Theta$ is of the form $\frac{1}{2}R^i_{jkt}\theta^k\wedge\theta^t$, where $\{\theta^j\}$ is the dual coframe of $\{e_j\}$ and $R^i_{jkt}=R_{ijkt}$ is the $(4,0)$ curvature tensor
$$R(X,Y,Z,W)=g(\tilde R(Z,W)Y,X)$$ where $\tilde R$ is the well-known curvature $(3,1)$ tensor $\tilde R(Z,W)Y=\nabla_Z\nabla_W Y-\nabla_Z\nabla_W Y-\nabla_{[Z,W]}Y$. 3) Now, if a relation between the M-C form and the connection form $\omega$ exists, it must not be that they simply are the same thing, since in that case the Maurer-Cartan equation would say that $\Theta$ is $0$, and therefore so is the curvature tensor, which isn't true for all Lie groups.
But since the expression of $\Theta$ and the Maurer-Cartan equation are so similar I suspect that a (less trivial) relation must exist.","['differential-geometry', 'curvature', 'lie-groups']"

2045138,$f$ function with $\nabla f=\bar{0}$,"Let $f:D\subset\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a function with $D$ open and connected set such that $\nabla f=\bar{0}$ for all $x\in D$ Proof that $f$ is a constant function. Hi! I have some problems with this exercise. I think that I have the proof, but, in this, I never use the fact that $D$ is a  connected  set. Can anyone help me? Please. My proof: First, since $\nabla f=\left(\displaystyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial x},\displaystyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right)=(0,0)$, then, $\displaystyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=0$ and $\displaystyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} =0$. Hence, the partial derivatives are bounded, i.e., there exist a $K,M\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$ such that $\left|\displaystyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}  \right|\leq K$ and $\left|\displaystyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}  \right|\leq M$ (I think that anything $K$ and $M$ it works, because the partial derivatives are $0$). Now let $a = (a_1,a_2)$ and $b = (b_1,b_2) \in D$. Then we have:
\begin{align*}
f(a) - f(b) &= f(a_1,a_2) - f(b_1,b_2)
\\
f(a)-f(b) &= f(a_1,a_2) - f(a_1,b_2) + f(a_1,b_2) - f(b_1,b_2)
\end{align*}
Then, by the triangle inequality:
$$|f(a)-f(b)| \leq |f(a_1,a_2) - (a_1,b_2)| + |f(a_1,b_2) - f(b_1,b_2)|$$
And since the partial derivatives exist, we can use the one-dimensional Mean Value Theorem to show that there exists some $c$ such that:
$$\frac{f(a_1,a_2)-f(a_1,b_2)}{a_2-b_2} = \displaystyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a_1,c)$$
And noting how we defined $K$, it follows that
$$|f(a_1,a_2) - f(a_1,b_2)| \leq K|a_2 - b_2|$$
And similarly
$$|f(a_1,b_2) - f(b_1,b_2)| \leq M |a_1-b_1|$$
And using the statement we got from the triangle inequality, we have that
$$|f(a)-f(b)| \leq M|a_1-b_1| + K|a_2 - b_2|$$
And by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have that
$$M|a_1-b_1| + K|a_2 - b_2|
\leq 
\sqrt{M^2 + K^2}\cdot
\sqrt{(a_1-b_1)^2+(a_2-b_2)^2}
=
\sqrt{M^2 + K^2} \cdot
||a-b||$$
Whereby
$$|f(a)-f(b)| \leq \sqrt{M^2 + K^2} \cdot ||a-b||$$
So $f$ is Lipschitz with $L = \sqrt{K^2 + M^2}$. Hence, the function is continuous. But, $M=K=0$ works, we can consider $L=0$ and the nex equality $$0\leq|f(a)-f(b)| \leq 0$$Then $|f(b)-f(a)|=0$ and we can conclude that $f(b)=f(a)$ for all $a,b\in D$. Then, the function is constant. But, in the proof, I never used the connected of $D$. Where is the wrong? Can anyone help me? Thanks.","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis', 'continuity', 'calculus']"

2045183,Singletons in coupon collecting problem,"There are $n$ types of coupons. All types are equally likely to turn up and each ""draw"" of a coupon is independent of others. If someone collects coupons until they have a complete set of all the $n$ types, what is the expected value of the number of coupons that only appear once in this complete set? In the book, they give this solution: Let $X$ be the number of singletons. Let $T_i$ be the $i$th type of coupon collected and $A_i$ the event that there is only one $T_i$ coupon in the set. Then $$\mathbb{E} [X]=\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{P}(A_i)$$
This much I understand. What I do not understand is the following: Now, at the moment when the first type $T_i$ coupon is collected, there remain $n − i$
types that need to be collected to have a complete set. Because, starting at this moment,
each of these $n − i + 1$ types (the $n − i$ not yet collected and type $T_i$) is equally
likely to be the last of these types to be collected, it follows that the type $T_i$ will be the
last of these types (and so will be a singleton) with probability $\frac {1}{
n−i+1}$. I do not understand this derivation of the probability. If $T_i$ just got collected, how is it that it can be collected last of the $n-i$ not yet collected types?","['coupon-collector', 'probability']"

If reposting a similar question like this is against the rules of this forum please tell me! I am still new to this site and eager to learn. Basically I am in electrical engineering (3rd year) but I think I should have done an undergrad in math. I have a limited interest in application and am really much more interested in class when we do rigorous math. At this point I am considering either doing a masters degree in math or going into Control Theory (not control systems, but rather the mathematical theories behind nonlinear control which I guess is more applied math than engineering). What I want to do now is go through textbooks on my own to make up for the butchery of math that happened in my engineering classes. The great thing is that I will have a year-long internship starting in May during which I will have time to dedicate to this. I want to emphasize that although there is a strong chance I will go into Control Theory, I want to cover rigorous math and detach myself almost entirely from engineering. My real question/concern is what textbooks to use for each subject and what order to do it all in. Here is my current plan, I would very much like your input: Real Analysis by Chapman Pugh (I'm already quite deep into it and loving it) Topology by Munkres (Part I: General Topology) Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote (Group Theory) Topology by Munkres (Part II: Algebraic Topology) Smooth Manifolds by John M. Lee And then perhaps more of the Abstract Algebra textbook and/or an intro to Dynamical Systems, Chaos and Fractals. Please note I do have some experience in proofs despite engineering. Some of it is due to computer science courses behind quite rigorous and the rest is self practice. For example I am finding Chapman Pugh quite accessible.","['self-learning', 'real-analysis', 'differential-topology', 'abstract-algebra', 'general-topology']"

2045336,Find the rational canonical form of $A=\left(\begin{smallmatrix} -1 & -2 & 6 \\ -1 & 0 & 3\\ -1 & -1 &4 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$,"Attempt First, the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $\chi_A=(t-1)^3$ and the minimum polynomial is $\mu_A=(t-1)^2$. Since the degree of the minimum polynomial is $2$, the dimension of the largest cyclic subspace cannot exceed 2. Now if $e_1=(1,0,0)^T$  then the cyclic subspace $C_{e_1}$ generated by $e_1$ is $$\mathrm{span}\{e_1, Ae_1\}.$$ Now the space $V$ can be decomposed into a direct sum of cyclic subspaces. so $$V=C_{e_1} \oplus C_x$$ for some $x$. we note that since $V=\mathbb{R}^2$, $C_x$ must be $1$ dimensional. So the minimum polynomial of $A$ restricted to $C_x$ is 1 dimensional. Since this polynomial divides $\mu_A$, we find that the minimum polynomial is $t-1$.  Thus there are two companion matrices, one corresponding to $(t-1)^2$ and one corresponding to $(t-1)$. Thus $$R=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1&0\\ 1 & 2 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}.$$ Questions and concerns I want to make sure my reasoning is correct.
