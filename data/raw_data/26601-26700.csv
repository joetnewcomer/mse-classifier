244323,Finding parametric equations for the rectangular equation $y=x^3$,"I am trying to find a general way of finding parametric equations for a rectangular equation.
The problem I am working on is $y=x^3$, and I have to find two examples of parametric equations. Obviously, for a first example, $x=t$ and $y=t^3$. But, for a second example, I want $x=t^2+1$ (just for the heck of it), how would I find the corresponding equation for y, in terms of t, so that when I substitute either equation into the other, I get $y=x^3$?","['parametric', 'algebra-precalculus']"
244333,Cat Dog problem using integration,"Consider this equation : $$\sqrt{\left( \frac{dy\cdot u\,dt}{L}\right)^2+(dy)^2}=v\,dt,$$ where $t$ varies from $0$ to $T$ , and $y$ varies from $0$ to $L$ . 
Now how to proceed ? This equation arises out of following problem : A cat sitting in a field suddenly sees a standing dog. To save its life, the cat runs away in a straight line with speed $u$ . Without any delay, the dog starts with running with constant speed $v>u$ to catch the cat. Initially, $v$ is perpendicular to $u$ and $L$ is the initial separation between the two. If the dog always changes its direction so that it is always heading directly at the cat, find the time the dog takes to catch the cat in terms of $v, u$ and $L$ . See my solution below : Let initially dog be at $D$ and cat at $C$ and after time $dt$ they are at $D'$ and $C'$ respectively. Dog velocity is always pointing towards cat. Let $DA = dy, \;AD' = dx$ Let $CC'=udt,\;DD' = vdt$ as interval is very small so $DD'$ can be taken straight line. Also we have $\frac{DA}{DC}= \frac{AD'}{ CC'}$ using triangle property. $\frac{dy}{L}= \frac{dx}{udt}\\ dx = \frac{dy.udt}{L}$ $\sqrt{(dx)^2 + (dy)^2} = DD' = vdt \\ \sqrt{(\frac{dy.udt}{L})^2 + (dy)^2} = vdt $ Here $t$ varies from $0-T$ , and $y$ varies from $0-L$ .

244359,Question about the concept of connected set,"From the definition, $Y$ is disconnected if $Y=A\cup B,A,B\ne\emptyset A\cap B=\emptyset$ and $A,B$ are both open. So for proving $\mathbb{Q}$ is not connected, normally the textbook would suggest $\mathbb{Q}\cap(-\infty,r)\bigcup\mathbb{Q}\cap(r,+\infty),r\in\mathbb{I}$. Also the textbook would say the open ball of rational number set is not connected. Here's my question. First, why do we need to consider about $\mathbb{R}$ when proving $\mathbb{Q}$ is not connected?? Aren't we jsut need to consider $\mathbb{Q}$ only? In fact if we just consider $\mathbb{Q}$, it doesn't seem obvious and i first thought that it is connected as i am not sure how to separate it into 2 separated set.  Intiutively, if you consider just $\mathbb{Q}$, the only clopen subset in $\mathbb{Q}$ should be itself and $\emptyset$, isn't it? I couldn't find any subset which are clopen in rational set. Secondly, what if some set which is not familiar with you, how can you really determine whether it is connected or not? Some time the set may be dense and intuitively it seems connected for me but it is not always connected. Some set may even not easy to picture out let alone determine if it is connected Last, how do one show the open ball $B\subset\mathbb{Q}$ is not connected?",['general-topology']
244362,To show that $P(|X-Y| \leq 2) \leq 3P(|X-Y| \leq 1)$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Exercise 1.6.3 from Alon & Spencer's *The Probabilistic Method*: prove that $Pr[|X-Y| \leq 2] \leq 3 Pr[|X-Y| \leq 1]$ for i.i.d. real RVs $X$ and $Y$ (3 answers) Closed 4 years ago . I found this question while browsing through ""The Probabilistic Method"", by Noga Elon. Let X and Y be 2 independent and identically distributed real valued random variables. Prove that:
$$P(|X-Y| \leq 2) \leq 3P(|X-Y| \leq 1)$$ So I tried the following: $$P\{|X-Y| \leq 2\} = P\{|X-Y| \leq 1\} + P\{X-Y \in (1,2]\cup[-2,-1)\}$$
$$= P\{|X-Y| \leq 1\} + P\{X-Y \in (1,2]\} + P\{X-Y \in [-2,-1)\}$$
$$= P\{|X-Y| \leq 1\} + 2P\{X-Y \in (1,2]\}$$
where the last step follows because $X-Y$ has a symmetric distribution. NB: A random variable Z has symmetric distribution if 
$$P(Z \leq z) = P(Z \geq -z) \quad \forall z \in \mathbb{R}$$ Thus the problem boils down to showing
$$P\{X-Y \in (1,2]\} \leq P(|X-Y| \leq 1)$$

244375,Cartier divisor and Dimension of Cohomology Group,"I am doing some practice questions for my exam and I would appreciate help in solving this problem: $D,E$ are Cartier divisors on a nonsingular projective surface $X$. (1) If $D\equiv 0$ show that dim $H^0(X,sD)\leq 1$ for all $s\geq 1$. (2) If $D$ is effective, $D\neq 0$ and $D\equiv E$ show that $H^0(X,tE)=0$ for all $t\leq -1$. (3) Is (2) true if $E=D$ and $X$ is nonsingular affine variety of positive dimension? Here is my workings for (1) and (2): are they correct? By definition, $D\equiv 0$ means $D.C=0.C=0$ for any curve $C$. ( Note : The remainder of this portion was pointed out to be wrong) Since I can easily construct a line intersecting with $D$, this shows that $D=0$.   Then clearly $sD=0$ for all $s\geq 1$.   I know that dim $H^0(X,sD)-1=$ dim$|sD|$, so I can try to show that dim $|sD|\leq 0$.  Since $|sD|=\lbrace D'\geq 0|D'\sim sD\rbrace$, therefore $D'\sim 0$ and $D'=0$.   This shows that $|sD|=\lbrace 0\rbrace$ and hence dim $|sD|=0$. For (2), since $D>0$ and $t\geq -1$, hence deg $tE<0$. $H^0(X,tE)=\lbrace f\in k(X)\setminus\lbrace 0\rbrace|tE+div(f)\geq 0\rbrace\cup\lbrace 0\rbrace$.

Show that $Y$ is countable.

Here they are: 18: Let $y$ be the set $y = \{y_1 , \dots , y_n \} \subset z$. Let $\varphi(x) = (x = y_1) \lor \dots (x=y_n)$. Then $y = \{ x \in \omega : \varphi (x) \}$. 19: Let $F_n$ be the set of all formulas $\varphi$ in $L_S$ such that $\varphi$  consists of $n$ characters.

Suppose that $(A_i)_{i \in \mathbb N}$ and $(B_i)_{i \in \mathbb N}$ are sequences s.t.

244494,Motivating (iso)morphism of varieties,"I am reading course notes on algebraic geometry, where a morphism of varieties is defined as follows ($k$ is an algebraically closed field): Let $X$ be a quasi-affine or quasi-projective $k$-variety, and let $Y$ be a quasi-affine or quasi-projective $k$-variety. A map $f:X\to Y$ is called a morphism of $k$-varieties if $f$ is continuous, and if for every open subvariety $U$ of $Y$ and every regular function $f:U\to k$ the composition $h\circ f$ is a regular function on $f^{-1}(U)$. I have trouble seeing the motivation for this definition.
The above notion of morphism seems to imply that the 'structure' of a variety (what distinguishes it from a mere set) is the following: A topology, the Zariski topology, which is extremely coarse (weak) compared to the Euclidean topology in the case $k=\mathbb{C}$. For every Zariski-open $U\subseteq X$ a specification of which functions $U\to k$ are considered 'nice', i.e. regular. Given that this is indeed the structure we want to assign to a variety, I agree with the above notion of morphism. In particular, I can see that two varieties are isomorphic exactly when their structure is 'the same' (so that the difference between them is just that their points have different names). However, I fail to see why the above two bullets accurately capture what we want them to. In fact, I do not know when we want to consider two varieties as isomorphic, and why. I do not know why we want the curves defined by $x^2+y^2=1$ and $x^2+y^2=2$ to be deemed isomorphic, but not the affine plane and the punctured affine plane (except for just pointing back to the definition I am trying to motivate, and showing that no isomorphism exists algebraically, but that's not enlightening). I do know this in the category of smooth manifolds: I expect two spheres to be diffeomorphic because I can stretch one smoothly to exactly match the other. I expect a sphere and a torus not to be diffeomorphic because no matter how hard I try, I cannot strech the sphere and make it coincide with a torus. Another example: the affine line and the cusp are not isomorphic, and the difference lies exactly in the singularity of the cusp (its... well, cusp). Is this what we want to encode, the behaviour of varieties near singularities (I suspect this is only part of what we want to encode)? Do we want two varieties to be isomorphic if there is a bicontinuous bijection between them that maps singularities to singularities of the same kind? (Here, I do not know what I mean by the 'kind' of a singularity, and in fact I don't even know what exactly I mean by a singularity.) I expect that isomorphic varieties will have 'analogous' singularities at corresponding points, but I suppose there is more to the structure of a variety than this (indeed, not all smooth varieties are isomorphic). What do we want the structure of a variety to entail intuitively? What intuitive/geometric information is encoded in the 'structure' as outlined in the bullets above? Edit. I want to know what is encoded in the structure of a variety on a vague and intuitive level. I do not require mathematical justification for the answers at all (no need to prove that this is what we encode).","['motivation', 'algebraic-geometry', 'intuition']"

244657,Value of $\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{1^n+2^n+\cdots+(n-1)^n}{n^n}$,"I remember that a couple of years ago a friend showed me and some other people the following expression: $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{1^n+2^n+\cdots+(n-1)^n}{n^n}.$$ As shown below, I can prove that this limit exists by the monotone convergence theorem. I also remember that my friend gave a very dubious ""proof"" that the value of the limit is $\frac{1}{e-1}$. I cannot remember the details of the proof, but I am fairly certain that it made the common error of treating $n$ as a variable in some places at some times and as a constant in other places at other times. Nevertheless, numerical analysis suggests that the value my friend gave was correct, even if his methods were flawed. My question is then: What is the value of this limit and how do we prove it rigorously? (Also, for bonus points, What might my friend's original proof have been and what exactly was his error, if any? ) I give my convergence proof below in two parts. In both parts, I define the sequence $a_n$ by $a_n=\frac{1^n+2^n+\cdots+(n-1)^n}{n^n}$ for all integers $n\ge 2$. First, I prove that $a_n$ is bounded above by $1$. Second, I prove that $a_n$ is increasing. (1) The sequence $a_n$ satisfies $a_n<1$ for all $n\ge 2$. Note that $a_n<1$ is equivalent to $1^n+2^n+\cdots+(n-1)^n<n^n$. I prove this second statement by induction. Observe that $1^2=1<4=2^2$. Now suppose that $1^n+2^n+\cdots+(n-1)^n<n^n$ for some integer $n\ge 2$. Then $$1^{n+1}+2^{n+1}+\cdots+(n-1)^{n+1}+n^{n+1}\le(n-1)(1^n+2^n+\cdots+(n-1)^n)+n^{n+1}<(n-1)n^n+n^{n+1}<(n+1)n^n+n^{n+1}\le n^{n+1}+(n+1)n^n+\binom{n+1}{2}n^{n-1}+\cdots+1=(n+1)^{n+1}.$$ (2) The sequence $a_n$ is increasing for all $n\ge 2$. We must first prove the following preliminary proposition. (I'm not sure if ""lemma"" is appropriate for this.) (2a) For all integers $n\ge 2$ and $2\le k\le n$, $\left(\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^n\le\left(\frac{k}{k+1}\right)^{n+1}$. We observe that $k^2-1\le kn$, so upon division by $k(k^2-1)$, we get $\frac{1}{k}\le\frac{n}{k^2-1}$. By Bernoulli's Inequality , we may find: $$\frac{k+1}{k}\le 1+\frac{n}{k^2-1}\le\left(1+\frac{1}{k^2-1}\right)^n=\left(\frac{k^2}{k^2-1}\right)^n.$$ A little multiplication and we arrive at $\left(\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^n\le\left(\frac{k}{k+1}\right)^{n+1}$. We may now first apply this to see that $\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^n\le\left(\frac{n}{n+1}\right)^{n+1}$. Then we suppose that for some integer $2\le k\le n$, we have $\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^n\le\left(\frac{k+1}{n+1}\right)^{n+1}$. Then: $$\left(\frac{k-1}{n}\right)^n=\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^n\left(\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^n\le\left(\frac{k+1}{n+1}\right)^{n+1}\left(\frac{k}{k+1}\right)^{n+1}=\left(\frac{k}{n+1}\right)^{n+1}.$$ By backwards (finite) induction from $n$, we have that $\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^n\le\left(\frac{k+1}{n+1}\right)^{n+1}$ for all integers $1\le k\le n$, so: $$a_n=\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^n+\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)^n+\cdots+\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^n\le\left(\frac{2}{n+1}\right)^{n+1}+\left(\frac{3}{n+1}\right)^{n+1}+\cdots+\left(\frac{n}{n+1}\right)^{n+1}<\left(\frac{1}{n+1}\right)^{n+1}+\left(\frac{2}{n+1}\right)^{n+1}+\left(\frac{3}{n+1}\right)^{n+1}+\cdots+\left(\frac{n}{n+1}\right)^{n+1}=a_{n+1}.$$ (In fact, this proves that $a_n$ is strictly increasing.) By the monotone convergence theorem, $a_n$ converges. I should note that I am not especially well-practiced in proving these sorts of inequalities, so I may have given a significantly more complicated proof than necessary.

244742,"if $S$ is a ring (possibly without identity) with no proper left ideals, then either $S^2=0$ or $S$ is a division ring.","I'm having trouble with this homework problem (from Algebra by Hungerford). If $S$ is a ring (possibly without identity) with no proper left ideals, then either $S^2=0$ or $S$ is a division ring. We've just proven in the previous part that if $S$ is a ring with identity and with no proper left ideals, then $S$ is a division ring. So the strategy is to suppose $S^2 \neq 0$ and prove that $S$ has an identity. The problem also has a hint: Hint: Show that $\{a \in S \mid Sa = 0\}$ is an ideal. If $cd \neq 0$, show that $\{r \in S \mid rd = 0\} = 0$. Find $e \in S$ such that $ed = d$ and show that $e$ is a two-sided identity. Here's what I have so far, with some boring details removed: Note that $S_0 = \{a \in S \mid Sa = 0\}$ is an ideal, because [proof it's an ideal]. Since $S$ has no proper left ideals, we must have $S_0 = 0$ or $S_0 = S$. This means that either $S^2 = 0$ (if $S_0 = S$) or for every non-zero $a \in S$, there is some $b \in S$ with $ba \neq 0$ (if $S_0 = 0$). From now on suppose $S_0 = 0$, and we will show that $S$ is a division ring. Note also that $A(d) = \{r \in S \mid rd = 0\}$ is a left ideal, because [proof it's a left ideal]. Now if $cd \neq 0$ for some $c, d \in S$, then $A(d) \neq S$ because $c \notin A(d)$; but $S$ has no proper left ideals, so $A(d) = 0$. Then $rd = sd$ if and only if $r = s$, for otherwise $(r-s)d = 0$ contradicts $A(d) = 0$. Consider the left ideal $I_a = \{ra \mid r \in S\}$. [proof that it's a left ideal]. Since $S$ has no proper left ideals, we must have $I_a = 0$ or $I_a = S$ for all $a \in S$. If $cd \neq 0$ then $I_d = S$ (so $I_d = S$ for all non-zero $d \in S$, since we showed that for all $d$ there is a $c$ with $cd \neq 0$), and therefore $d \in I_d$ so there is some $e \in S$ with $ed = d$. As we observed before, $rd = sd$ iff $r = s$, and $(re)d = r(ed) = rd$, so $re = r$ for each $r \in S$. In summary, for every $a \in S$ we have some $e \in S$ (specific to this $a$) such that $e a = a$ and $r e = r$ for all $r \in S$. I feel like it should be very easy to show that there is a two-sided identity (e.g. by showing that all of these $e$ are in fact the same), but I can't seem to get there.

$$(v,w) \mapsto \int_X v \wedge w\;.$$ This, together with an observation from Huybrechts lecture notes on K3 surfaces page 40: ...it is not the intersection pairing that defines a polarization, but
  the pairing that is obtained from it by changing the sign of the
  intersection pairing for an ample class. justifies the following question. Question: How does the choice of an ample class $\omega$ comes into the definition of the intersection pairing? It is clear that we need such a class to define a polarization on lower degree cohomology groups, for example on $H^1(X,\mathbb{Z})$. And the well definition of the intersection pairing is related to the existence of an ample class (i.e. the projectivity of $X$). But I don't see how the intersection pairing would change changing the choice of the ample class. It is possible (or even probable) that I'm making a huge mess out of nothing, but I'm quite confused.

244966,Black scholes model type,"I want to study the following market: $$S_1(t)=S_1(t)(\mu_1dt + \sigma_1dW_1(t))$$ $$S_2(t)=S_2(t)(\mu_2dt+\sigma_2dW_2(t))$$ for $t\in [0,T]$, constants $\mu_i,\sigma_i$, initial values $S_i(0)>0$, $i\in\{1,2\}$ and $W_1,W_2$ two Brownian Motion with the following bracket: $$\langle W_1,W_2\rangle =\rho t$$ with $\rho\in\mathbb{R} $. We look at the following payoff: $$(S_1(T)-S_2(T))^+$$ and I want to determine the price at $0$ of an option with the above payoff. It was hinted (on an old exercise from last year) to find a measure $Q$ under which the quotient $S_1/S_2$ is a martingale and calculate the price at $0$ of a European call option with strike $K=1$. Since no bank account was mentioned in the exercise text, I'm a little bit confused. 
Supposing there is a bank account $B(t)$, and assuming absence of arbitrage, we know there is a EMM $Q^1$ under which the discounted assets are martingales, i.e. $S_i(t)/B(t)$ are martingales. In this case I would define the density (of $Q$ w.r.t. to $Q^1$) on $\mathcal{F}_T$ as follows: $$Z_T:=\frac{1}{B(T)}\frac{S_2(T)}{S_2(0)}$$ and $Z_t:=E[Z_T|\mathcal{G}_t]=\frac{1}{B(t)}\frac{S_2(t)}{S_2(0)}$. Then using Bayes formula I'm able to prove that $\frac{S_1}{S_2}$ is a $Q$-martingale. Are you think my observations are correct so far? Now I want to compute 
$$E_Q[(\frac{S_1(t)}{S_2(t)}-1)^+|\mathcal{F}_0]$$ I wrote down: $$E_Q[(\frac{S_1(t)}{S_2(t)}-1)^+|\mathcal{F}_0]=E_Q[(\frac{S_1(t)}{S_2(t)}-1)\mathbf1_{\{\frac{S_1(t)}{S_2(t)}>1\}}|\mathcal{F}_0]$$ Using Bayes gives $$E_Q[(\frac{S_1(t)}{S_2(t)}-1)\mathbf1_{\{\frac{S_1(t)}{S_2(t)}>1\}}|\mathcal{F}_0]=\frac{1}{Z_0}(E_{Q^1}[\frac{S_1(t)}{S_2(t)}Z_t\mathbf1_{\{\frac{S_1(t)}{S_2(t)}>1\}}|\mathcal{F}_0]-E_{Q^1}[Z_t\mathbf1_{\{\frac{S_1(t)}{S_2(t)}>1\}}|\mathcal{F}_0])=\frac{1}{B(0)}(E_{Q^1}[\frac{S_1(t)}{B(t)}\mathbf1_{\{\frac{S_1(t)}{S_2(t)}>1\}}|\mathcal{F}_0]-\frac{1}{S_2(0)}E_{Q^1}[\frac{S_2(t)}{B(t)}\mathbf1_{\{\frac{S_1(t)}{S_2(t)}>1\}}|\mathcal{F}_0])$$ Under $Q^1$, $\frac{S_i}{B}$ is given by $$S_i(t)=S_i(0)\exp{(\sigma_iW^*-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_i^2t)}$$ Where $W^*=W_t+\frac{\mu_i-r}{\sigma}t$ is $Q^1$ Brownian motion. Hence the above is under $Q^1$, $\exp{(Z)}$ distributed, where $Z$ is normal distributed with mean $-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_i^2t$ and Variance $\sigma^2t$. Is it true, that this conditional expectations reduce to expectations? If not, how would you calculate this? However I am not at all sure about this derivation so far. Since the bracket of $W_1$ and $W_2$ is explicitly given, I thought somewhere I have to use it.

Can we generalize the number of strings that can be sorted in a minimum of any given number of swaps between 0 and $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ inclusive?

245320,Edmund Landau's Problems,Landau's problems are four conjectures about prime numbers which were unsolved at the time Edmund Landau presented them at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1912. They include: Goldbach's conjecture Twin prime conjecture Legendre's conjecture Conjecture that there are infinitely many primes of the form p = n^2 + 1. It is a hundred years later and I think all four problems are still unsolved. Is this statement true? Does anyone know if there is any recent progress on any of these? Thanks for any additional insights or pointers. -A,['number-theory']
245325,Inverses in the ring of formal power series over a field.,"Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field, and consider $\mathbb{F}[[x]]$, the ring of formal power series with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}$, i.e. the set of expressions of the form
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n x^n,\quad a_n\in\mathbb{F}$$
with the usual rules for addition and multiplication. How to show that any element that does not belong to the principal ideal $\langle x\rangle$ is invertible?","['power-series', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
