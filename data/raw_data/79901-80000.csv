1030229,What are some good references on how probability theory got mathematically rigorous?,"I am working on a term paper for an analysis course and I thought it would be interesting to talk about the connection between analysis and probability theory. Honestly, it would also benefit me a lot as a student in statistics. Knowing the historical context of the things I'm learning about would help me better understand their significance. I vaguely remember from some of my probability courses that people have discovered the intuition of law of large numbers and central limit theorem very early, yet early attempts to put it on rigorous mathematical foundation failed, until the development of measure theory, Lebesgue integration, Fourier transformation, and so on. I am wondering whether there are some nice books/review papers that summarize this process. An ideal reference would include something like, someone tried to prove the law of large numbers, yet failed, since the integration theory back then wasn't adequate, someone tried doing the central limit theory and came up with the characteristic function idea, yet the one-to-one mapping between random variables and characteristic functions couldn't be established, due to some other lack of math tools back then. Finally Kolmogorov came into the picture, put together a complete set of tools and finished the job, by filling in something and something some earlier mathematicians missed.","['statistics', 'math-history', 'probability-theory', 'soft-question', 'probability']"

1030328,The action of a Lie algebra on a manifold is a Lie algebra homomorphism. How to show it?,"By definition, the action of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ on a manifold $M$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism, $\mathcal A: \mathfrak g\rightarrow\mathfrak X(M), \xi\mapsto\xi_M$ such that the action map $\mathfrak g\times M\rightarrow TM, (\xi,m)\mapsto\xi_M(m)$ is smooth. Now, if we know the action of a Lie group $G$ on the manifold $M$, $G\times M\rightarrow M, (g,m)\mapsto gm$, then an action of the corresponding Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ is thus $\xi_M=\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\exp(-t\xi)m$ First, I would like to show that this action is linear in $\xi$. Pick $a\in\mathbb R$, one obtains $\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\exp(-ta\xi)m=a\frac{d}{dt'}|_{t'=ta=0}\exp(-t'\xi)m=a\xi_M$. Then, if you pick a second vector $\eta\in\mathfrak g$, form a 3rd one $\xi+\eta=\zeta$ and consider the induced vector on $M$, $\zeta_M=\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\exp(-t\zeta)m=\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\exp(-t\xi-t\eta)m$ I want to prove $\zeta_M=\xi_M+\eta_M$, but got stuck.

1030445,The integral $\int_{|z|=2}\log\frac{z+1}{z-1}dz$,"Let $\log$ be the branch of the logarithm that extends the usual real logarithm, and consider on $D=\Bbb C\smallsetminus [-1,1]$ the function $$f(z)=\log\frac{z+1}{z-1}$$ I have to find the integral of $f$ around the circle $|z|=2$. Now, as an example, consider the integral $$\int_{|z|=2}\frac{e^{z+z^{-1}}}{1-z^2}dz$$ Using the biholomorphic mapping $B(0,1)^\times\to D$ that sends $z\to \frac 1 2(z+z^{-1})$ I got the integral $$\frac 1 2\int_\gamma \frac{e^{2z}}{1-z^2}dz$$ and $\gamma$ is a closed path inside $B(0,1)^{\times}$. This means the integral vanishes. I am trying to do something similar here. So if I take $w=\frac{z+1}{z-1}$, I get that $\frac{(w-1)^2}2=\frac{2}{(z-1)^2}$ and $dw=-2dz/(z-1)^2$, so I ultimately want to look at $$-2\int_{\gamma^{-}}\frac{ \log w}{(w-1)^2}dw$$ where $\gamma$ is a circle that passes through $1/3,3,-3/5+4/5 i$. Using the computer I got the circle is $$(x-5/3)^2+(y-5/2)^2=\frac{7225}{900}$$ Add This circle's orientation is now reversed. Even without this one sees $1$ is an interior point, so the integral should equal, by Cauchy, $4\pi i$ (not $-4\pi i$).

Am I right? 2- He claims if $M$ is a factor, then every nonzero two-sided ideal is $\sigma-$weakly dense in it. I think in this situation, there is just a nonzero $\sigma-$ weak closed two sided ideal because the central projections are $1, -1$ and ${\cal m}_1=M(1) = M(-1) ={\cal m}_2$,  but there may be different two sided ideals with equal $\sigma- $ weak clusers.

1030708,Integration with respect to signed measure and Radon Nikodym theorem,"I aim to show the following question: Let $\mu$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure, and $\lambda$ a finite signed measure on $(X,M)$ satisfying $\lambda\ll\mu$, let $h=\frac{d\lambda}{d\mu}\in L^1(\mu)$. Show that $$\int fd\lambda=\int fhd\mu,\quad\forall f\in L^1(\lambda),fh\in L^1(\mu)$$ Approach in Suggested Solution $\underline{Step1}$, let $f=\chi_E, E\in M$ then $$\int \chi_E d\lambda=\lambda(E)=\int_E h d\mu=\int \chi_E h d\mu$$ Then let $s\ge 0$, $s$ be simple function, the statement also follows. $\underline{Step2}$ let $f\ge 0$, measurable, pick $0\le s\le f$, then $0\le sh\leq fh$ on $\{h\ge 0\}$, and $0\le -sh\leq -fh$ on $\{h< 0\}$, hence $$\begin{align}\int  f d\lambda&=\int_{\{h\ge 0\}}f d\lambda-\int_{\{h< 0\}}-f d\lambda\\
&=\sup_{0\le s\le f}\int_{\{h\ge 0\}}s d\lambda-\color{blue}{\sup_{0\le s\le f}\int_{\{h< 0\}}-s d\lambda}=\cdots
\end{align}$$ My approach I use the definition that $\color{green}{\int fd\lambda=\int fd\lambda^+-\int fd\lambda^-}$, where $\lambda^+,\lambda^-$ is the Jordan decomposition of $\lambda$. Step 1 is the similar to above except the definition. $\int \chi_E d\lambda=\int \chi_E d\lambda^+-\int \chi_E d\lambda^-=\lambda^+(E)-\lambda^-(E)=\lambda(E)=\cdots$ $\underline{Step2}$ I use monotone convergence theorem. Let $f\ge 0$, measurable, pick $0\le s_n\uparrow f$, then $0\le s_nh\uparrow fh$ on $\{h\ge 0\}$, and $0\le -s_nh\uparrow -fh$ on $\{h< 0\}$, by step 1( for the last identity),
$$\int_{\{h< 0\}} s_n d\lambda^+-\int_{\{h< 0\}} s_n d\lambda^-=\int_{\{h< 0\}} s_n d\lambda=-\int_{\{h< 0\}} -s_nhd\mu$$
Then by MCT, LHS and RHS converges to corresponding limits hence
$$\int_{\{h< 0\}} f d\lambda^+-\int_{\{h< 0\}} f d\lambda^-=-\int_{\{h< 0\}} -fhd\mu=-\int fh^-d\mu$$
The last identity uses the definition of $h^-$, similarly, we have
$$\int_{\{h\ge 0\}} f d\lambda^+-\int_{\{h\ge 0\}} f d\lambda^-=\int fh^+d\mu$$ Add above two equation, we have $$\int f d\lambda^+-\int f d\lambda^-=\int fhd\mu$$
Then by definition of integration w.r.t signed measure, we have $\int fd\lambda=\int fhd\mu$ Questions It seems that my definition ($\color{green}{green}$ color text)  is different from  that used in the suggested solution. It seems to define integration with signed measure analogue to integration with measure, that is from simple function to nonnegative measurable function to integrable function. Which definition is correct? Is there any standard definition? Why the $\color{blue}{blue}$ colored step in the suggested solution is correct? In the case $-f<0$ is the definition of integral still be $\sup$? Is my approach correct? I will discuss the case $f$ is integrable in my step 3. But I think that part is easier. I am sorry it's a long post. But since I am not confident enough to judge which step is correct, I included all the related steps in my post. Please let me know if there is anything unclear. Also I know it's usually not a good idea to ask three questions in one post, but I think they are highly related here, so I decided to include all of them.

1031212,$\sigma$-weak topology versus weak operator topology,"The reference text for this question is: 
Pedersen, Analysis Now, GTM 118. The $\sigma$-weak topology on $B(H)$ (the bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space $H$) is the weak$^*$-topology on $B(H)$ seen as the dual of the Banach algebra $B_1(H)$ ($T\in B_1(H)$ if $T$ is a compact operator such that its norm
in $B_1(H)$ is $tr(|T|)<\infty$ - see Pedersen 4.6.10, 3.4.6, 3.4.12, 3.4.13). The weak operator topology on $B(H)$ is the one generated by the semi norms
$|(Tx,y)|$ as $x,y$ range in $H$ and $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the inner product on $H$
- see Pedersen 4.6.1. It is shown in Proposition 4.6.14 that the weak operator topology and the 
$\sigma$-weak topology overlap on the ball $B(H,n)$ of operators $T\in B(H)$ of norm at most $n$. This gives that any $\sigma$-weakly continuous functional $\phi$ when restricted to $B(H,1)$ is continuous with respect to the weak operator topology. Now propositions 4.6.11 and 4.6.4 give the following characterizations of continuous functionals in these topologies: 4.6.11: a functional $\phi:B(H)\to\mathbb{C}$ is $\sigma$-weakly continuous if and only if there exists sequences $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of elements of $H$ such that
$\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}}||x_n||+\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}}||y_n||<\infty$ and
$\phi(S)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}}(S(x_n),y_n)$. 4.6.4: a functional $\phi:B(H)\to\mathbb{C}$ is continuous with respect to the weak operator topology if and only if there exists sequences 
$(x_0,\dots, x_n)$ and $(y_0,\dots,y_n)$ of elements of $H$ such that
$\phi(S)=\sum_{j=0,\dots, n}(S(x_j),y_j)$. I can follow the proof of proposition 4.6.14, but I don't understand how this
translates at the level of these different characterizations, i.e.: Assume $\phi(S)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}}(S(x_n),y_n)$ is $\sigma$-weakly continuous, what are the vectors $(z_0,\dots, z_n)$ and $(w_0,\dots,w_n)$ such that $\phi(S)=\sum_{i\leq n}(S(z_i),w_i)$ for all operators $S$ of norm at most 1? How can it happen that a $\sigma$-weak continuous $\phi$ functional is such that
$\phi\restriction B(H,n)=\psi_n$ with $\psi_n$ continuos for the weak operator topology but for all $n$ $\phi\neq\psi_n$? Some examples would be illuminating. Thanks in advance","['operator-theory', 'operator-algebras', 'von-neumann-algebras', 'functional-analysis']"

1031256,Do Cantor's Theorem and the Schroder-Bernstein Theorem Contradict?,"I am confused as to how Cantor's Theorem and the Schroder-Bernstein Theorem interact. I think I understand the proofs for both theorems, and I agree with both of them. My problem is that I think you can use the Schroder-Bernstein Theorem to disprove Cantor's Theorem. I think I must be doing something wrong, but I can't figure out what. Can someone tell me where I am going wrong? Here's how I think I can prove that the set of all natural numbers has the same cardinality as its power set.
Cantor's Theorem says that the power set of any set A has greater cardinality than A. Specifically, the set of all natural numbers, $\mathbb{N}$, is countably infinite, while its power set $P(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountably infinite. The Schroder-Bernstein Theorem says that, for two sets $A$ and $B$, if there exist one-to-one functions $f:A\mapsto B$ and $g:B \mapsto A$, then sets $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality. I will try to use this to prove that the set of all natural numbers N has the same cardinality as its power set $P(\mathbb{N})$. I need to prove that there exist one-to-one functions $f:\mathbb{N}\mapsto P(\mathbb{N})$ and $g:P(\mathbb{N})\mapsto \mathbb{N} $ $f:\mathbb{N}\mapsto P(\mathbb{N})$ Define $f:\mathbb{N}\mapsto P(\mathbb{N})$, $n\mapsto f(n)=\{n\}$ For each output $f(n)$, there can only be one n corresponding to $f(n)$, so $f$ is a one-to-one function. $g:P(\mathbb{N})\mapsto \mathbb{N} $ Define $g:P(\mathbb{N})\mapsto \mathbb{N} $ as follows Each element of $P(\mathbb{N})$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, as represented by $\{{a}_{1},{a}_{2},\dots ,{a}_{k}\}$ where ${a}_{1},{a}_{2},\dots ,{a}_{k}$ are elements of $\mathbb{N}$ For each element $s=\{{a}_{1},{a}_{2},\dots ,{a}_{k}\}$ of $P(\mathbb{N})$, the elements of $s=\{{a}_{1},{a}_{2},\dots ,{a}_{k}\}$ are ordered from lowest to highest, so that ${a}_{1}<{a}_{2}<\dots <{a}_{k}$. The order of a set does not matter, so this can be done without creating a new set. For each element $s=\{{a}_{1},{a}_{2},\dots ,{a}_{k}\}$ of  $P(\mathbb{N})$, $g(s)={{p}_{1}}^{{a}_{1}} *{{p}_{2}}^{{a}_{2}} * ... * {{p}_{k}}^{{a}_{k}}$, where ${p}_{1},{p}_{2},...,{p}_{k}$ are each the $k$th prime number. Ex. ${p}_{1}=2, {p}_{2}=3, {p}_{3}=5,\dots$ $P(\mathbb{N})$ contains the empty set, so $g(\emptyset)=0.$ The set of all prime numbers is countably infinite, so it has the same cardinality as the largest element of $P(\mathbb{N})$, which is $\mathbb{N}$. Each output $g(s)$ is the prime factorization of some number n. Each number n has a unique prime factorization, so there is only one s in  $P(\mathbb{N})$ whose $g(s)$ is the prime factorization of n. Since the elements of $s=\{{a}_{1},{a}_{2},\dots ,{a}_{k}\}$ are ordered from lowest to highest, ${a}_{1}$ is the only element of $s$ that can be $0$. Thus, ${p}_{1}=2$ is the only prime number that can have an exponent of 0 in the output. Thus, it is impossible for any set $s$ in  $P(\mathbb{N})$ to have the same output $g(s)$ as a set of different length in $P(\mathbb{N})$ . In other words, it is impossible to add or remove an element of s to create a new set ${s}_{2}$ so that $g(s)=g({s}_{2})$. Every element $s$ of  $P(\mathbb{N})$ has a unique output $g(s)$, so $g:P(\mathbb{N})\mapsto \mathbb{N} $ is a one-to-one function. So $f:\mathbb{N}\mapsto P(\mathbb{N})$ and $g:P(\mathbb{N})\mapsto \mathbb{N} $ are both one-to-one functions. So $\mathbb{N}$ and  $P(\mathbb{N})$ have the same cardinality. I'm fairly certain that both Cantor's Theorem and the Schroder-Bernstein Theorem are correct, so where does my proof go wrong?","['discrete-mathematics', 'elementary-set-theory']"

1031451,Can the choice of epsilon be arbitrary in epsilon-delta proofs?,"I've been reading Spivak's chapter on limits and something that I don't feel I understand entirely is how the epsilon is decided upon. It makes sense to me in the context of  $\,|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$ where it appears just on it's own (representing any positive number) but Spivak seems to invoke an arbitrary value of epsilon in some of the given proofs. For example in proving that:
$$ \lim_{x\to a}[f(x)+g(x)]=\lim_{x\to a}[f(x)]+\lim_{x\to a}[g(x)]$$
he says if:
$$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=l \;\; \text{and} \;\;\lim_{x\to a}g(x)=m$$
then for any $\epsilon>0$ then there are $\delta_1,\delta_2>0$ such that for all $x$:
$$ 0<|x-a|<\delta_1 \implies |f(x)-l|<\frac{\epsilon}{2} \\ 0<|x-a|<\delta_2 \implies |g(x)-m|<\frac{\epsilon}{2} $$
He then carries on to show that $|(f+g)(x)-(l+m)|<\epsilon$. I feel like I understand the proof he gives but I just wanted to clarify whether it matters how he defined what the epsilon was. Since for example if he had started with expressions without the $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ but rather:
$$0<|x-a|<\delta_1 \implies |f(x)-l|<\epsilon$$
wouldn't the outcome be $|(f+g)(x)-(l+m)|<2\epsilon$; which I assume still says that it's bounded, and since $\epsilon$ was any positive number it shouldn't matter. Though I'm not certain, so I suspect there's an error in my understanding. Another example is if you tried proving that: $$\lim_{x\to 1} 2x-2=0$$
then instead of writing just epsilon, one wrote some positive constant $c$ times epsilon so:
$$ |(2x-2)-0|<c\times\epsilon\;\; \rightarrow \;\; |x-1|<\frac{c\times \epsilon}{2}$$ therefore let $\delta =\frac{c\times\epsilon}{2}$ which would still seem to prove it even if we hadn't had the $c$ that is with $\delta=\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ . I know it's not a proper proof but hopefully you see what I'm trying to say (or indeed what I'm doing incorrectly). Hopefully my question isn't too badly written or that there isn't one asking the same thing, I have found this which is from the same part of the book but I still don't feel sure whether or not the choice of epsilon changes the validity proof.","['epsilon-delta', 'calculus', 'algebra-precalculus', 'limits']"

Solution based on the comments below: $$\hat{f}'(t)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{1}{h}\left(\int_\mathbb{R}e^{-i(t+h)x}f(x)\,d\lambda(x)-\int_\mathbb{R}e^{-itx}f(x)\,d\lambda(x)\right) \\=\lim_{h\to0}\int_\mathbb{R}\frac{\cos(-(t+h)x)-\cos(-tx)}{h}f(x)\,d\lambda(x) \\+ i \lim_{h\to0}\int_\mathbb{R}\frac{\sin(-(t+h)x)-\sin(-tx)}{h}f(x)\,d\lambda(x)$$ By the mean value theorem, $$\left|\frac{\cos(-(t+h)x)-\cos(-tx)}{h}f(x)\right|\leq|xf(x)|$$ and $$\left|\frac{\sin(-(t+h)x)-\sin(-tx)}{h}f(x)\right|\leq|xf(x)|.$$ Hence, since $|xf(x)|$ is integrable by assumption, we get by the dominated convergence theorem that
$$\hat{f}'(t)=\int_\mathbb{R}\lim_{h\to0}\frac{\cos(-(t+h)x)-\cos(-tx)}{h}f(x)\,d\lambda(x) \\+ i\int_\mathbb{R}\lim_{h\to0}\frac{\sin(-(t+h)x)-\sin(-tx)}{h}f(x)\,d\lambda(x)\\=\int_\mathbb{R}x\sin(-tx)f(x)\,d\lambda(x)+i\int_\mathbb{R}-x\cos(-tx)f(x)\,d\lambda(x)\\=\int(-ix)e^{-itx}f(x)\,d\lambda(x).$$","['lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'fourier-analysis']"

Let $L$ be the holomorphic line bundle associated to the divisor $D=p$.

Does this generalize to meromorphic sections, i.e. does any meromorphic section vanish at $p$? I know that any meromorphic section will differ from $\sigma$ by a meromorphic function, i.e. $\sigma ' = f \sigma$. A priori $f$ could have poles in $p$, allowing $\sigma '$ to be non zero at $p$.

Similarly, if $\gamma:S^1\to\mathbb{R}^2\setminus\{p\}$ for some $p\in\mathbb{R}^2$, the winding number of $\gamma$ around $p$ is the winding number of the translation $\gamma-p$. As we all know, the winding number can be defined rigorously by means of algebraic topology / two-variable calculus / complex variables. 2) Let $\gamma:S^1\to\mathbb{R}^2$ smooth with non-vanishing derivative. The turning number of $\gamma$ is the winding number of $\dot{\gamma}$. My question is about the following Claim: Let $\gamma:S^1\to\mathbb{R}^2$ be a simple loop with non-vanishing derivative. Then the turning number of $\gamma$ is either $1$ or $-1$. Furthermore, for any $p$ in the area enclosed by $\gamma$, the winding number of $\gamma$ around $p$ is equal to the turning number. This claim seems to be rather intuitive, but I can't think of an elementary way to prove it. One way, I guess, is to use the fact that any such loop is isotopic either to the standard embedding $S^1\hookrightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$, or to an embedding with the same image but reversed orientation. For these two embeddings the turning number can be computed directly, and then the claim follows from invariance under isotopy.

1031692,Number of distinct angles that can be formed on a square grid,"Given a set of grid points arranged in an $n$ by $n$ square (in 2 dimensions): How many distinct proper (acute or obtuse) angles can be formed having a vertex on one grid point and line segments ending on two other grid points? For example, on a $2 \times 2$ grid you can form only $2$ distinct angles, 
with cosines equal to $0$ (for example $\angle (0,0)(0,1)(1,1)$)  and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. (I find it convenient to classify the angles by their cosines, because the law of cosines lets you easily get the cosine of each angle of a triangle on the grid.) On a $3 \times 3$ grid, by adding that layer of 5 more points, you can form an additional $8$ distinct angles, with 
$$\cos \alpha \in \{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}},\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}},\frac{3}{5},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{3}{\sqrt{10}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}, \frac{4}{5}, - \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}   \} 
$$
Here I have arranged these values in an order that came from the following reasoning:  To make a new angle, you must make a triangle with two vertices more that $n-1$ apart in either the horizontal or the vertical direction (or both.  So I start with one point at
the upper left grid point, slide a second point along the opposite edge, and work my way through all combinations of on point on each of two opposite edges.  For each  such combination, the third point can in principle be on any of the remaining grid points. A very crude upper limit can be estimated  by saying there are $\binom{n^2}{3}$ possible triangles, thus   $3 \binom{n^2}{3}\approx \frac{n^6}{2}$ angles; but of course most of those angles will duplicate each other. By considering the ordering described above, one eliminates a number of angles that are just translations, flips, or $90^\circ$ rotations of others already counted. Here, the naive upper limit for the added angles would be $3$ for the angles in a triangle, times $\binom{n+1}{2}$ for the ways to choose the two edge vertices, divided by $2$ to account for flips about the horizontal center of the square, times $(n^2-2)$ internal points.  That gives a naive upper limit of about $\frac{3n^4}{4}$ points added when the square side increases from $n-1$ to $n$, thus a naive upper limit of 
$$
\Bbb{A}(n) \leq \frac{3n^5}{20}
$$
But that is also much too large.  Some triangles are duplicates because of: Much of the time, one or two of the angles in a new large triangle overlays an angle that can fit in a smaller grid. Any time the third vertex of the triangle lies below the first vertex, the whole triangle can be translated upward such that the first vertex lies on a corner. Symmetry that we have not yet discounted for (for example, some triangles are isosceles [although noe will be equilateral]). A side of a triangle passes through a grid point, allowing an angle to have been created on a smaller grid even though the triangle at hand is large.  The counting of these cases involves the totient function. A triangle is similar to some other smaller triangle in some obvious way involving $45^\circ$ rotations. When a side that is neither horizontal nor vertical happens to have integer length due to Pythagorean relationships, angles involving that side are usually duplicated in other triangles with a horizontal or vertical side of that length. There are some numerical ""coincidences"" that cannot be anticipated by accounting for those other effects. This is fundamentally a number theory problem. Although I originally suspected that the number of distinct angles grows like $n^4$, I have not been able to show this, nor get a handle on what the coefficient would be.  I do know that for modest values of $n$, the growth  appears to be much slower than this, perhaps as slow as $n^3$. $\Bbb{A}(4)$ Appears to be $2 + 8 + 18 = 28$. I'm pretty sure that pattern breaks down 
by $\Bbb{A}(5)$. Any progress or solution on this would be appreciated. Added after a few days: I have tightened the upper limit:  Since any triangle touching the right and left sides can be translated and possibly flipped so that it has one vertex on the upper left corner and one on the right side, and since among those triangles the ones with the third vertex above the line joining the sides replicate triangles with the third vertex below that line, the upper limit, ignoring symmetries, coincidences, and so forth, is just $\frac{3n^2}{16}$ new angles for layer $n$. Thus 
$$
\Bbb{A}(n) \leq \frac{3n^4}{16}
$$ I did an automated computation of $\Bbb{A}(n)$ for $n \leq 100$ and observe that 
$$
\Bbb{A}(n) \leq \frac{n^4}{8}
$$
and that it appears to approach that limit. The numbers in the sequence for $n = 2$ through $10$ are
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
2 & 2 \\ 3 & 10 \\ 4 & 28 \\ 5 & 66 \\ 6 & 154 \\ 7 & 269 \\ 8 & 473 \\ 9 & 781 \\ 10 & 1156
\end{array}
$$
I want to submit this as a new sequence in OEIS, but I won't until somebody else has confirmed my results by their own calculation, at least for ten more values of $n$.  To be confident that this is a confirmation, I am not displaying the number of angles for 
all further values of $n$, but I will say that $\Bbb{A}(21) = 23640$, 
$\Bbb{A}(50) = 759308$, and $\Bbb{A}(100) = 12335703$,. To increase the chances of somebody providing the verification I need,, I am offering a bounty for even the values of $\Bbb{A}(n)$ from $10 < n < 21$. Agreement in those ten numbers will tell me that my program was correct, and I will submit this to the Online Encyclopaedia of Integer Sequences.

1031738,How to represent real algebraic numbers with period integrals,"Background: A real period is defined to be the value of an integral of the form $$\int_D R(x_1,\cdots,x_n)dV$$ where $R$ is a rational function with rational ceofficients, and $D\subseteq\Bbb R^n$ is a set of points satisfying a system of inequalities involving rational functions also with rational coefficients (combined via the Boolean operators and and or ), and the integral converges absolutely. A period is then a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are real periods. The set of periods is called $\cal P$. In my other question here , I've asked why we can simplify this definition to only volume integrals over domains defined by polynomial inequalities, and why we can generalize the definition by replacing both instances of the phrase ""rational coefficients"" with ""(real) algebraic coefficients."" So, question : how do we express an arbitrary (wlog real) algebraic number as a period integral? I know using the argument principle from complex analysis, if $w$ is a root of $f(z)$ then $$\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\partial D}z\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz=w$$ where $D\subset\Bbb C$ is a disc of small enough radius around $w$ to not include any other zeros. (This is assuming that $w$ has multiplicity one, for instance take $f$ to be its minimal polynomial, and the boundary of the disc $\partial D$ is oriented clockwise.) But it's not obvious to me how to convert this into a real (multidimensional) integral. Perhaps I could invoke a continuum of different $D$ whose $\partial D$s form there own disk (like an onion), and then convert via polar coordinates? There's also the issue of $2\pi i$ to contend with as well. (Conjecturally, $\frac{1}{2\pi i}$ is not a period.) (I can figure out why $\cal P$ is closed under addition: we can always write $$\int_A R(\vec{x})dV+\int_B S(\vec{x})dV=\int_{\large A\sqcup(B+\vec{v})} \hskip -0.5in R(\vec{x})+S(\vec{x}-\vec{v})\,dV $$ for some rational-coordinate displacement vector $\vec{v}$ of sufficiently large magnitude, in which case $A\sqcup(B+\vec{v})$ can be described in the obvious way. Furthermore we can write $$\int_A \hskip -0.05in R(x_1,\cdots,x_n)dV \hskip -0.05in \times \hskip -0.05in \int_BS(x_1,\cdots,x_k)dV \hskip -0.05in = \hskip -0.05in \int_{A\times B} \hskip -0.2in R(x_1,\cdots,x_n)S(x_{n+1},\cdots,x_{n+k})dV $$ describing $A\times B$ in the obvious way as well, so I know how $\cal P$ is closed under multiplication.)","['multivariable-calculus', 'algebraic-geometry']"

So $4(1-2\sin t)^2+4(2\sin t+1)\cdot (6\sin t-5)\geq 0$ $\displaystyle (1-2\sin t)^2+(2\sin t+1)\cdot(6\sin t-5)\geq 0$ So we get $16\sin^2 t-8\sin t-4\geq 0\Rightarrow 4\sin^2 t-2\sin t-1\geq 0$ Now HGow can I solve after that, Help me Thanks",['algebra-precalculus']
1031900,Trigonmetric sum of inverses,"Prove that:
  $$\sum^{45}_{k=1}\frac{1}{\cos1^\circ-\cos(87+4k)^\circ}=\frac{1}{2\sin 1^\circ}$$ Numerically, this is accurate comparing the lhs and rhs .
Some ideas: We can transform the question into proving that: $$\sum^{45}_{k=1}\frac{1}{\sin(43+2k)^\circ\sin(44+2k)^\circ}=\frac{1}{\sin 1^\circ}$$
Since clearly every term is positive, there is no hope in trying to cancel terms. I have also tried to transform this into a sum of inverses of roots of an equation so that I can use Vieta's formulae, but I have had no success.","['trigonometry', 'summation', 'algebra-precalculus']"

First, I don't know how to express the leading terms on the left hand side before the $\dfrac{n}{(n+1)!}$ (or if doing so is even necessary to solve the problem). I am also assuming that the right high side should initially be expressed $1 - \dfrac{1}{(n+2)!}$. But where to go from there.

1031913,Find a symmetric random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ that is transient.,"I wanted to know if it is possible find a symmetric random walk on $Z$ that is not recurrent. Let $X$ have the following distribution, with a probability $1/2^{i+1}$, $X=\pm b_i$. Let $$S_n=\sum_{k=1}^n X_k$$
be the random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ with $X_k$ having the same distribution as $X$. The problem is to find $b_n$ such that $S_n$ is transient. We need to find $b_n$ large enough so that $E(X)$ is not defined (otherwise it would be 0 by symmetry and thus recurrent). I think $b_n=2^n$ is sufficient, but am having trouble showing transience. We know that a random walk is transient iff $$\int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{1}{1-\varphi_X(t)}dt<\infty$$ I computed the characteristic function of $X$ as follows: $$\varphi_X(t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}e^{it2^n}+\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}e^{it2^{-n}}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos(t2^n)}{2^n}$$ But I am unsure of how to proceed.","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

Define a relation $\sim$ on $S^n$ as: For all $\mathbf v,\mathbf w\in S^n$, $\mathbf v\sim \mathbf w$ if and only if $\mathbf v=-\mathbf w$. I am trying to show that $S^n/\sim \ \cong \ \mathbf R P^n$. Let $\pi:\mathbf R^{n+1}\setminus\{\mathbf 0\}\to \mathbf R P^n$  be the canonical projection and $i:S^n\to \mathbf R^{n+1}\setminus \{\mathbf 0\}$ be the inclusion map. I want to show that $\pi\circ i:S^n\to \mathbf R P^n$ is a quotient map. It is clear that $\pi\circ i$ is surjective. 
We show that $\pi\circ i$ is continuous.
Let $U$ be open in $\mathbf R P^n$.
Then $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is open in $\mathbf R^{n+1}$.
Noting that $i^{-1}(\pi^{-1}(U))=S^n\cap \pi^{-1}(U)$, we infer that $i^{-1}(\pi^{-1}(U))$ is open in $S^n$.
Therefore $(\pi\circ i)^{-1}(U)$ is open in $S^n$ and the continuity of $\pi\circ i$ is established. Now we need to show that if $(\pi\circ i)^{-1}(U)$ is open in $S^n$ for some subset $U$ of $\mathbf R P^n$, then $U$ is open in $\mathbf R P^n$. I am stcuk here. Can somebody help? Thanks.
