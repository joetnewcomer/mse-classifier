1924742,Prove the triangle inequality on the sphere $S^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.,"Let $S^2 = \{x=(x_1,x_2,x_3) \in \mathbb{R}^3: x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=1\}$ be the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $d_i(x,y) = \cos^{-1}(x\cdot y)$, where $x\cdot y$ is the usual dot product of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$, be the intrinsic metric on $S^2$ (the length of the great circle arc joining $x$ and $y$). Prove that $d_i$ satisfies the triangle inequality, $d_i(x,z) \le d_i(x,y)+d_i(y,z)$. It has been suggested that I use the Gram Matrix $$A=\left( \begin{array}{ccccc}
x\cdot x &\ & x\cdot y &\ & x\cdot z \\
y\cdot x &\ & y\cdot y &\ & y\cdot z \\
z\cdot x &\ & z\cdot y &\ & z\cdot z 
\end{array} \right)$$ and the fact that $det(A) \ge 0$ and somehow reduce the desired inequality, $\cos^{-1}(x\cdot z) \le \cos^{-1}(x\cdot y)+\cos^{-1}(y\cdot z)$, to $det(A)\ge 0$. I'm just missing out on how to do that. Thank you.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"
1924769,Supremum of a smooth function is smooth,"I'm fairly sure that this is an easy question, but I can't quite prove my suspicions. For $f\in\mathbf{C}^\infty(\mathbf{R})$, let $g(t):=\sup_{t\leq x} f(x)$. Then $g\in\mathbf{C}^\infty(\mathbf{R})$. I want to say that this is true, but I'm unable to fully justify it. In my mind, I'm effectively viewing $g$ as a smooth step function that always increases, moving from one hill of $f$ to the next higher hill of $f$ as $t$ increases. $g$ moves from that earlier hill to the next hill with $f$ (aka smoothly), so the only possible points where $g$ can be not smooth are the points $\{x \mid f(x)=\max_{t\leq x}{f(t)}, f'(x)=0, f''(x)<0\}$. These are the points where $g(x)$ stops following $f(x)$ and instead is the zero function until $f(x)$ ""catches up"" again, heading for the next higher hill. However, when I try and construct a proof for why these points cannot be true for contradiction, I can't get anywhere.

1924980,"Show $\dim(U) = d_1^2 + d_2^2 + \cdots + d_k^2$, where $U$ is the set of matrices that commute with a diagonalizable matrix $A$","I asked this question last night, but I have made some additional progress where I have another question. Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ diagonalizable matrix with distinct eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_k$ with corresponding multiplicities $d_1, \ldots, d_k$. Show that $$\dim(U) = d_1^2 + d_2^2 + \cdots + d_k^2,$$ where $U = \{B \in M_n \,|\, AB = BA \}$. PROOF: Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ diagonalizable matrix with eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_k$ and respective multiplicities $d_1, \ldots, d_k$. Since $A$ is diagonalizable, $D = P^{-1}AP$ is a diagonal matrix. Observe that for any $B \in U$, $$P^{-1}AP = D \implies P^{-1}ABP = D(P^{-1}BP)$$ and likewise $$P^{-1}BAP = (P^{-1}BP)D.$$ This implies that we need only determine matrices $C$ such that $CD = DC$. Let $$D = \begin{pmatrix}\lambda_1I_1 & & & \\ & \lambda_2I_2 & & \\ & & \ddots & \\ & & & \lambda_kI_k\end{pmatrix}.$$ Note that $I_i$ is the identity matrix of size $d_i \times d_i$. Partition $C$ as such: $$C = \begin{pmatrix}C_{11} & C_{12} & \cdots & C_{1k} \\ C_{21} & C_{22} & & C_{2k} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ C_{k1} & C_{k2} & \cdots & C_{kk}\end{pmatrix}$$ Because $C$ and $D$ should commute, $CD = DC$ and so for any $i, j = 1, \ldots, k$, we have $$\lambda_iC_{ij} = C_{ij}\lambda_j \implies (\lambda_i - \lambda_j)C_{ij} = O.$$ Because each eigenvalue is distinct, it is not possible that $\lambda_i - \lambda_j = 0$ (for $i = j$), which leaves that $C_{ij} = O$ where $i \ne j$. So $C$ is block diagonal. Here's where I'm stuck. I'm not sure what comes next to deduce $\dim(U)$. I think I need to find the dimension of each $C_{ii}$. How can I find the dimension of each $C_{ii}$? Surely it isn't as easy as saying that each $C_{ii}$ is $d_i \times d_i$, is it?","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'proof-writing', 'linear-algebra', 'vector-spaces']"

The power of an F-Test is the probability of rejecting $H_0$ for a given value of $\lambda$. If $F_\alpha$ is the upper $\alpha$ percentage point of the central $F$ distribution, then the power, $P(p,q,\alpha,\lambda)$ can be defined as $P(p,q,\alpha, \lambda) = Prob(z\geq F_\alpha)$.

1925062,Proof that columns of an invertible matrix are linearly independent,"Explain why   the columns of  an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ are linearly
  independent when $A$ is  invertible. The proof that I thought of was: If $A$ is invertible, then $A \sim I$ ($A$ is row equivalent to the identity matrix). Therefore, $A$ has $n$ pivots, one in each column, which means that the columns of $A$ are linearly independent. The proof that was provided was: Suppose $A$ is invertible. Therefore the equation $Ax = 0$ has only one solution, namely, the zero solution. This means that the columns of $A$ are linearly independent. I am not sure whether or not my proof is correct. If it is, would there be a reason to prefer one proof over the other?

1925106,Computing convolutions involving harmonic numbers.,"By using the generating function of Stirling numbers ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_numbers_of_the_first_kind ) we can fairly easily find the following identity:
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{\begin{array}{r} n_1+n_2=n \\n_1\ge1,n_2\ge1\end{array}}
 \frac{2 H_{n_1-1}}{n_1} \cdot \frac{1}{n_2} = 3 \frac{[H_{n-1}]^2 - H^{(2)}_{n-1}}{n}
\end{equation}
This follows from computing the power series expansion of $[\log(1-x)]^3$ in two different ways firstly from the generating function and secondly using convolutions. Now, the question is how do we compute more generic convolutions like the following:
\begin{equation}
{\mathfrak S}_q^{(p)}(n):=\sum\limits_{\begin{array}{r} n_1+n_2=n \\n_1\ge1,n_2\ge1\end{array}}
 \frac{H^{(p)}_{n_1-1}}{n_1^q} \frac{1}{n_2} = ?
\end{equation}
where $p,q$ are positive integers.
Note that if we didn't have the harmonic numbers in the numerator we can always compute the convolution using partial fraction decomposition and the definition of generalized harmonic numbers. However in our case this technique does not seem to work. How do we proceed in here?","['summation', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1925131,How can I prove that every rational number can be expressed as the sum of $1/n$? (for a set of integer n chosen by a certain algorithm),"So there is this extra exercise in my textbook. I looked it over with the TA and neither of us could solve it. The exercise goes like this: Let $\alpha$ be positive and rational. Then, choose the smallest natural number $N_0$ such that $1/N_0 \leq \alpha$. Now let $\alpha_1=\alpha-1/N_0$. Now choose $N_1$ as the smallest natural number such that $1/N_1 \leq \alpha_1$ etc. The exercise is to prove that this algorithm terminates for every rational $\alpha$. (i.e. at some point $\alpha_i=N_i$ and it will end as $0$) It's easy to prove that $\alpha_i$ becomes arbitrarily small, but I don't see any approach to prove it reaches zero.","['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"

1925220,Adjunction formula for sub varieties of $\mathbb{P}^n$,"I am having some trouble in using the adjunction formula to compute the canonical bundle of a hyper surface of degree d in $\mathbb{P}^n$. My first question is more general and deals with the definition of the line bundle associated to a sub variety. Fix notations: $Y \subset X$ smooth sub variety of dimension $dim(X) - 1$.
Being of codimension one $Y$ is locally given by $Y \cap U = V(f) \cap U$, $f \in \mathcal{O}(U)$ (i.e. for all $p \in Y$ there exists such $U$ that contains $p$). We then define the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(Y)$ to be the one with transition functions $\{f/g \in \mathcal{O}(U \cap V)\}$ if $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$.
What I don't understand is why this construction gives a line bundle over $X$. To define a line bundle over $X$ we need the open sets where the transition functions are defined to be a cover of $X$, but I don't find any reason this should be true. Am I missing something? Let's focus on $Y = \{ F = 0 \} \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ hyper surface of degree d. I want to use the adjunction formula to compute the canonical bundle of $Y$. I know that:
$K_Y = (K_{\mathbb{P}^n} \otimes \mathcal{O}(Y)) \rvert_Y$, I also know that $K_{\mathbb{P}^n} = \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(-n-1)$ (the line bundle whose sections are homogenous polynomial of degree -n-1). Putting these things together I get: $K_Y = (\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(-n-1) \otimes \mathcal{O}(Y)) \rvert_Y$. I know the answer is $K_Y = \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(d-n-1) \rvert_Y$, so I am trying to show that $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(d) = \mathcal{O}(Y)$.
Suppose $p \in Y$ is such that $p_i \neq 0$ and further suppose that $f_i(z) = F(z_1, \dots, z_{i-1}, 1, z_{i}, \dots, z_n)$ has derivative respect to $z_j$ non zero. Then we know that locally $Y$ is given by: $$Y \cap U = \{ [z_0 : \dots : z_n] \in \mathbb{P}^n : \frac{z_j}{z_i} = \psi_{i}^j(\frac{z_1}{z_i}, \dots , \frac{z_n}{z_i}) \}$$ Where $\psi_i^j$ is given by the Implicit Function Theorem. From here I don't know how to go on. I don't see any reason why the transition functions defined via this local interpretation of $Y$ should give rise to $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(d)$.

Given two C*-algebras $A,B$, the book proves that $K_0(A\bigoplus B)\cong K_0(A)\bigoplus K_0(B)$. I'm assuming that the book means $A\bigoplus B$ to be a direct sum over C*-algebras (as opposed to vector spaces). Now to calculate $K_0(C_0(\mathbb{R}))$.  The book has a ""warm up"" exercise that shows for $X$ Hausdorff with separation $X=X_1\cup X_2$, then $C_0(X)\cong C_0(X_1)\bigoplus C_0(X_2)$ (as both vector spaces and c*-algebras).

Aside from $S^1$ being connected so the warm up is a bit misleading, my issue is that I can show that $C(S^1)\cong C_0(\mathbb{R})\bigoplus\mathbb{C}$ as vector spaces, but the direct sum does not hold as algebras (in partciular $C_0(\mathbb{R})$ is not unital so its unitization is not isomorphic to itself plus a copy of $\mathbb{C}$).

If we are dealing with functions in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ rather than $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, then the answer to this question would be yes, and seen in this question here . However, in the $L^2$ case we are seemingly missing a step. We can of course start by applying monotone covergence: $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \sum_{n=1}^\infty |f_n|^2 dx = \sum_{n =1}^\infty \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |f_n|^2 dx \le C.$$ Hence $\sum_{n =1}^\infty |f_n|^2$ converges to a finite number almost everywhere. But this does not then imply that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n$ converges almost everywhere (and we would have this implication in the $L^1$ case).

1925614,Dirac delta distribution and sin(x) - what can be a test function?,"I read about the Dirac delta distribution some days ago to better understand distributions (or generalized functions), but I've become a bit confused. I used $\delta$ as a ""function"" ($\delta(x)$) until now, without thinking about its strict definition. I usually used the following formula:
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(x) f(x) dx = f(0),
\end{equation}
but never thought about the properties of the $f(x)$ functions.
Now as I understand, distributions are linear, continous functionals from some vector space of test functions $\mathcal{D}$, where the functions in $\mathcal{D}$ are smooth and have compact support. Also, I've read that the test function space can be extended to the Swartz-functions (~ rapidly decreasing functions (faster than polynomial)). But - if I'm correct -, none of these space include e.g. sin(x), cos(x), or any polynomial, etc., but it looks for me, that people use integrals with Dirac-$\delta$ in the same way ( Understanding Dirac delta integrals? ). So, my question is that, is there any other extension of the test function space to include these ones? And also, how can we deal with complex test functions? These are probably interesting from the Fourier transformation point of view.

Then I have $$y = \frac{-1 - 3e^{2xe^x - 2e^x}}{1 -3e^{2xe^x - 2e^x}}$$ which seems to imply that the denominator must be negative and obviously not zero, so I get $$- \ln(3) \le 2xe^x - 2e^x$$ this is true for $x > M$ where $M$ is a big enough number but this contradicts the second question because the interval on which $y$ is defined would be as large as wanted towards $+ \infty$.

Definition: A subset $A$ of a topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be saturated if it is an intersection of open sets in $(X,\tau)$ It is easy to show that every open set is a saturated set in $(X,\tau)$  because it is the intersection of itself with the set $X$ 1) Prove that in a $T_1$ space every subset of $X$ is a saturated set. 2) Give an example of a topological space that has at least one subset that it's not saturated 3) It is true that if the topological space $(X,\tau)$ is such that every subset is saturated, then   $(X,\tau)$ is a  $T_1$ space? This is what I did: 1) Let $A\subseteq X$ and $a\in X \setminus A$. Then $X\setminus A=\bigcup\{\{y\}:y\in $X\A$ \}$. In a $T_1$ space every singleton is closed and $A=\bigcap\{$X \ {y}$:y\in $X\A$\}$. So we proved that $A$ is an intersection of open sets. 2) Let $X=\{a,b\}$ and $\tau=\{X,\emptyset\}$.
If we take the set $\{a\}$ we see that this set is not an intersection of open sets in this topological space. 3) Suppose that every subset of $X$ is saturated and and $t\in X$.
 A necessary condition for a space to be $T_1$ is that every singleton must be a closed set. We have that $\{t\}=\bigcap\{A_j:j \in$ $J ,A_j\in\tau \}$ and $X\setminus  \{t\}=\bigcup\{X$ \ $A_j,j\in J\}$. The set $\{t\}$ has been written as a union of closed sets. But if $X,J$ are infinite ,then we know that an infinite union of closed sets is not necessarily closed. I would prefer a counterexample in 3) but i did not come up with something.

Specifically, it doesn't indicate whether $g$ should be injective or not, but I proved that such is not possible if $g$ is injective. I tried to prove part (b) generally like so: PROOF: Suppose $f: A \to B$ such that $f$ is not injective and $g:B \to C$ . Then, by definition, there exist $x_1, x_2 \in A$ with $x_1 \ne x_2$ such that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ . Thus, not for every $x_1, x_2 \in A$ with $x_1 \ne x_2$ is $f(x_1) \ne f(x_2)$ . For such $x_1, x_2$ where $x_1 \ne x_2$ , this would imply that $g[f(x_1)] = g[f(x_2)],$ yet $x_1 \ne x_2$ from the start. So no, it is not possible. $\square$ Is this valid reasoning that covers all possibilities for what $g$ is? Secondly, is my example for part (c) valid? EXAMPLE: Let $f: [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ , $g: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ such that $f(x) = \sqrt x$ and $g(x) = x^2$ . Then, $$g \circ f = g[f(x)] = g[\sqrt{x}] = \left(\sqrt x\right)^2 = x$$ Clearly, $f$ is injective on the given domain, $g$ is not injective on its domain, yet $g \circ f$ is injective from $[0, \infty)$ to $\mathbb R$ .

My best attempt so far is to rewrite the condition as: $\int_0^1 dx\ \ln(f(a_1,b_1,x)) = \int_0^1 dx\ \ln(f(a_2,b_2,x))$, which gives me:
$a_2 = a_1 + \int_0^1 dx\ \frac{b_1 - b_2}{x}$. That is divergent, so I will never get a number out of it. I can of course solve it numerically, which I in fact already do.

Thus, we have $$A \sim \mathbb N \tag{$A$ is countable}$$ $$B \not \sim \mathbb N \tag{$B$ is not countable}$$ $$A \not \sim B,$$ because one is countable, and the other is not, so there does not exist a bijection between the two. $$A \not \sim B \not \sim \mathbb N$$ $$A \not \sim \mathbb N \not \sim B,$$ which is a contradiction since we assumed $A$ is countable $\implies A \sim \mathbb N$.

Let $\Theta_0\subset\Theta$ be some subset of those parameters satisfying the property,
$$

$$
H_0 : \theta \in \Theta_0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ H_1: \theta\not\in\Theta_0.

Let $\mathbf{X}^n$ be a set of $n$ i.i.d. data points drawn from a bivariate normal. Then usually I would use a likelihood ratio test statistic for the purposes of evaluating the test. In particular,
$$
\Lambda\left(\mathbf{X}^n\right) = \frac{\sup_{\theta \in\Theta_0} \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{X}^n;\theta\right)}{\sup_{\theta \in\Theta} \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{X}^n;\theta\right)}

$$
\theta^\star = \arg\sup_{\theta\in\Theta}\mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{X}^n;\theta\right)

is an element of $\Theta_0$. That is to say, that the maximum likelihood parameter configuration is an element of the null hypothesis set. When this is true, it is fairly easy for me to verify that $-2\log\Lambda \sim\chi^2_1$. This is apparent because if the maximum likelihood estimate of $\mu_x$ is less than or equal to zero, then the full parameter space has an additional degree of freedom in $\sigma_{xy}$. But when $\theta^\star \not\in\Theta_0$, the distribution will be most messy and undesirable. What I would like to show is that the asymptotic distribution of $\log\Lambda\left(\mathbf{X}^n\right)$ is still $\chi^2_1$ under the null. My ""proof"" of this would be quite straightforward since, due to the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimate,
$$
\mathbb{P}\left[\lim_{n\to\infty} \theta^\star = \theta\right] = 1,
$$ 
and under the null we have that $\theta\in\Theta_0$ and hence almost surely $\theta^\star\in\Theta_0$. This brings us back to the case where the denominator in the likelihood ratio statistic has a single extra degree of freedom and therefore the statistic goes to a $\chi^2_1$. I would like to know if this reasoning regarding the asymptotic distribution of $\log\Lambda\left(\mathbf{X}^n\right)$ is correct.","['normal-distribution', 'bivariate-distributions', 'maximum-likelihood', 'statistics', 'log-likelihood']"

Both sums add very small numbers in the end ( e.g. $\frac{1}{10000000000}$ ), yet one always stays smaller than two and one goes way beyond that. You would think ( again, on an intuitive level, the math is clear) that the numbers become so small that there is a certain number that doesn't change anymore (significantly).

Lebesgue differentiation theorem (quantitative version). Let $f :  [0,1] \mapsto [0,1] $ be $(\epsilon,n)$ measurable. Then for all $x$ in $ [0,1] $ outside of a set of measure $O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ we have $\frac{1}{r} \int_x^{x+r} f(t) \, dt = f(x) + O(\sqrt{\epsilon}) $ for all $0 < r < \sqrt{\epsilon}2^{-n} $.

$$C/{\sum_{A\in\mathcal{F}}A}=\underrightarrow{\lim}C/A$$ I say that the hint is strange because $\displaystyle {\sum_{A\in\mathcal{F}}A}=C$","['category-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'limits-colimits', 'modules']"
1926598,Construct a merely finitely additive measure on a $\sigma$-algebra,"Is it possible to give an explicit construction of a set function, defined on a $\sigma$-algebra, with all the properties of a measure except that it is merely finitely additive and not countably additive? Let me elaborate. By ""explicit"" I mean that the example should not appeal to non-constructive methods like the Hahn-Banach theorem or the existence of free ultrafilters. I'm aware that such examples exist, but I'm looking for something more concrete. If such constructions are not possible, I'm especially interested in understanding why that is so. This question is similar, but, so far as I can tell, not identical to several other questions asked on this site and MO. For example, I've learned that proving the existence of the ""integer lottery"" on $P(\mathbb{N})$ requires the Axiom of Choice ( https://mathoverflow.net/questions/95954/how-to-construct-a-continuous-finite-additive-measure-on-the-natural-numbers ). That's the sort of result I'm interested in, but it doesn't fully answer my question. My question doesn't require that the $\sigma$-algebra in question be $P(\Omega)$, and I'm interested in general $\Omega$, not just $\Omega = \mathbb{N}$.","['real-analysis', 'set-theory', 'measure-theory']"
1926632,Complex SO(n) and Degenerations,"Let's say you have a matrix $A\in\Bbb C^{n\times n}$ with $A^T A = 0$, like for example this one:
$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & -i \\ i & 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$
I ask the following: Question: Is there a sequence of matrices $(S_k)_{k\in\Bbb N}$ with $S_k^T\cdot S_k = I$ and $\lim\limits_{k\to\infty} S_k A = 0$ ? For the matrix above, you can pick $\theta_k:=k\cdot(1-i)$ and
$$
S_k = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta_k) & -\sin(\theta_k) \\ \sin(\theta_k) & \cos(\theta_k) \end{pmatrix}.
$$
This is not entirely obvious, but a straightforward computation. I say that because a computer algebra system did it. PS: I have somewhat involved reasons to ask this question, and laying them out would basically just yield many paragraphs full of buzzwords, and I do not think it would make the question any more clear. I do believe that the answer is affirmative, though. Edit: I decided to add at least a few buzzwords. Let $O_n=\{ S\in\mathbb C^{n\times n} \mid S^T S = I \}$ be the orthogonal group. It is a reductive group acting on the space $W=\Bbb C^{n\times n}$ by left multiplication. I am asking whether the Nullcone of this action is equal to $N=\{ A \mid A^T A = 0 \}$. Note that $N$ is closed and certainly contains the Nullcone, because if a sequence $(S_k)$ with the above property exists, then $A^TA=A^TS_k^TSA=(S_kA)^T(S_kA)\to 0$ as $k\to\infty$, which means $A^TA=0$.","['complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'matrices', 'algebraic-groups', 'lie-groups']"

Simmons' Differential equations : theory, technique, and practice. I just began this book and I am learning how to solve some basic first-order linear equation. This problem states that the solution of a first-order linear equation must be a family of curves of the form
$$
y = c · f(x) + g(x)
$$ Then it requires me to show that the differential equation of any such family is linear and first-order. It seems to me a very strange question. I can attempt to construct an equation, by writing
$$
\frac{y-g(x)}{f(x)}=c
$$
then differentiate both sides, producing a differential equation without arbitrary constant c:
$$
f(x)\frac{dy}{dx}-y=f(x)g'(x)-g(x)f'(x)

1926845,Prove that the functions $f_n(x) = \frac{(x-i)^n}{\sqrt{\pi}(x+i)^{n+1}}$ are orthonormal using the residue theorem,"Note: edited a mistake in parametrizing the integral! Question: Let the complex valued function $f_n$, $n\in Z$, be defined on $R$ by: 
$$f_n(x) = \frac{(x-i)^n}{\sqrt{\pi}(x+i)^{n+1}}.$$ 
Prove that these functions are orthonormal; that is,
$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_m(x)\overline{f_n(x)}dx = \delta_{nm}.$$ My attempt: So, I think I have most of this problem, but I'm struggling to come up with a rigorous justification of one of the steps. Here is what I have so far: The case where $n=m$ is straightforward: we then have
$$f_m(x)\overline{f_n(x)} = \frac{1}{\pi(x^2+1)},$$
and thus
$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_m(x)\overline{f_n(x)}dx = \frac{1}{\pi}\arctan(x)|_{-\infty}^\infty = 1.$$ Next, we assume that $m < n$. Then,
$$f_m(x)\overline{f_n(x)} = \frac{1}{x^2+1}\frac{(x+i)^{n-m}}{\pi(x-i)^{n-m}}.$$
Consider the contour $\gamma_R = C_R \cup [-R,R]$, where $C_R$ is the semi-circle of positive orientation in the upper half plane with radius $R$. Now, by the residue theorem (I'm being lazy and not writing out the steps, but I swear it works out!), for large enough $R$, since the function has a pole at $i$, we have:
$$\int_{\gamma_R}\frac{(z+i)^{(n-m)-1}}{\pi(z-i)^{(n-m)+1}}dz = 0,$$
so if we can show that 
$$\lim_{R\to\infty}\int_{C_R}\frac{(z+i)^{(n-m)-1}}{\pi(z-i)^{(n-m)+1}}dz = 0,$$
we will be done. So, this is the part that I always struggle with on these integrals. I parametrized the integral as:
$$\int_{0}^\pi\frac{(Re^{i\theta}+i)^{(n-m)-1}}{\pi(Re^{i\theta}-i)^{(n-m)+1}}iRe^{i\theta}d\theta,$$
and I've been trying to use the basic absolute value/length inequality to write:
$$\int_{0}^\pi\frac{(Re^{i\theta}+i)^{(n-m)-1}}{\pi(Re^{i\theta}-i)^{(n-m)+1}}iRe^{i\theta}d\theta\le R \cdot \sup_{z \in C_R} \left|\frac{1}{(Re^{i\theta}+1)^2} \right|\frac{|Re^{i\theta}+1|^{n-m}}{|Re^{i\theta}-1|^{n-m}}\cdot |Re^{i\theta}|$$
But I can't seem to get anywhere from here. Normally I ask for just hints, but because I am so very bad at this, I'm hoping that someone would be willing to walk through a super rigorous method for showing this in baby steps. I can kindof see generally why it would work, since the denominator has a lower degree than the numerator, but I would really like to understand a step-by-step version.
