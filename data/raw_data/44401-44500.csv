443281,why $\frac{d}{dy}$ can pass through integral w.r.t. $x$?,"When I calculate integration of multivariables, many books use the following step without proofing. I want to know that why it is true:
$$\frac{d}{dy}\left[\int^a_b f(x,y)dx\right]_{y=k}=\int^a_b \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left[f(x,y)\right]_{y=k}dx$$ I also wonder that whether it is true when the integral or differentiation become indefinite. Which is :
$$\frac{d}{dy}\int f(x,y)dx=\int\frac{\partial}{\partial y} f(x,y)dx$$
$$\frac{d}{dy}\int^a_b f(x,y)dx=\int^a_b \frac{\partial}{\partial y} f(x,y)dx$$

443296,Explicitly writing out a differential 2-form,"In Tu's An Introduction to Manifolds , one question asks: At each point $p\in \mathbb{R}^3$, define a bilinear function $\omega_p$ on $T_p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ by:
  $$\omega_p(\underline{a},\underline{b})=\omega_p((a^1,a^2,a^3),(b^1,b^2,b^3))=p^3(a^1b^2-a^2b^1)$$
  For tangent vetors $\underline{a},\underline{b}\in T_p(\mathbb{R}^3)$, where $p^3$ is the third component of $\underline{p}=(p^1,p^2,p^3)$. Since $\omega_p$ is an alternating bilinear function on $T_p(\mathbb{R}^3)$, $\omega$ is a 2-form on $\mathbb{R}^3$. Write $\omega$ in terms of the standard basis $dx^i\wedge dx^j$ at each point. I understand that we write this as $\omega=a_{ij}dx^i\wedge dx^j$, with $a_{ij}=\omega(e_i,e_j)$ where $e_1,e_2,e_3$ span $T_p(\mathbb{R})$. With this I find that all constants vanish apart from $a_{12}$ and $a_{21}$, which lead to:
$\omega=p^3dx\wedge dy-p^3dy\wedge dx=2p^3dx\wedge dy$. In the solutions however, since an alternating function of two arguments is completely determined by its actions on $w(e_{k},e_{l}),k<l$, Tu sums only over $i<j$ leading to $\omega=p^3dx\wedge dy$. My question is, I thought that whether or not a multilinear function is alternating, you should be able to characterise it by feeding it all possible combinations of basis elements. But it seems in this case that leads to a different answer. Why is this?",['differential-geometry']

443349,Why $\omega$ can't be bijectively mapped to $\omega +1$,"Let $\omega$ be the order type of the totally ordered set $\mathbb{N}$, and $\omega +1$ the set $\Bbb{N}\cup \{0\}$. $0$ is greater than all the natural numbers as per this ordering. My question is why can't $\Bbb{N}$ be bijectively mapped to $\Bbb{N}\cup\{0\}$? I understand the basic argument: There is no element in $\Bbb{N}$ which maps to $\{0\}$. $\Bbb{N}$ is bijectively mapped to a proper subset of $\Bbb{N}\cup\{0\}$. A set can't be bijectively mapped to a proper subset of the co-domain and also the co-domain. But I'm not confident about whether these arguments work for infinite sets. One of the reasons being I used to think if a set can be bijectively mapped to another set, then any permutation of that set can be bijectively mapped to the same set. But this is not true for mapping $\Bbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ to $\Bbb{N}$. Hence I'm not quite sure what arguments are valid for infinite sets. My questions: 1. Do my arguments work for infinite sets? If not, what arguments are required to prove that $\omega$ can't be bijectively mapped to $\omega + 1$? 2. Is picking out every element from the co-domain and proving that it has been injectively mapped to the only way of proving bijection? Does the selection of such an element assume the axiom of choice?

443394,Can it happen that an object will not cast any shadow at all?,"I am puzzled by a question in Trigonometry by Gelfand and Saul on p. 57. Can it happen that an object will not cast any shadow at all? When and where? You may need to know something about astronomy to answer this question. I have drawn a diagram with the height of the object represented by $h$ and the length of the shadow $l$ ( I don't know how to upload it, sorry). To calculate the length of the shadow I used $\cot \theta = \dfrac{l}{h}$ Which rearranging gives $l = h\cot \theta$ We want $l = 0 $, which I think occurs when $\theta = 90$. I say think because my calculator says $tan 90$ is a ""math error"" (my calculator can't calculate $\cot$ directly). Am I correct in saying the shadow is of zero length when $\theta = 90$ ?

The visual proof of the addition formula for $\sin(a+b)$ is here : Also it is easy to generalize (in any way: algebra , picture etc) to an addition formula for $\sin^n(a+b)$ where $n$ is a given positive integer ? EDIT 4 COMMENTS : $1)$ I prefer the addition formula's to have as little sums as possible. I assume this is equivalent to allowing and preferring large power of $\sin$ and $\cos$ ; e.g. $\sin^4(a+b)=$ expression involving $\sin^2$, $\sin^4$ and $\cos^4$ and no other powers of $\sin$ or $\cos$. In one of the answers, the poster just used the binomium. That works nice, but Im not sure I like the output of that answer. We get $n$ sums for $sin^n(a+b)$ and I assume we can do better if we allow powers of $\sin$ and $\cos$. I could be wrong ofcourse. $2)$ I bet against the existance of visual proofs for $\sin^n(a+b)$ for $n>1$. But I could be wrong. $3)$ Not trying to insult the answers and comments but I am skeptical about the use of complex numbers (and $\exp$) to solve this issue EFFICIENTLY. I know Euler's formula for $\exp(i x)$ but still. I could be wrong about this too ofcourse. $4)$ My main intrest is in the $\sin^2$ case. I assume it has many forms. Can the addition formula for $\sin^2$ be expressed by $sin^2$ only ? I think so. (One of the reason I think so is because $\cos^2$ can be rewritten.)","['geometry', 'exponentiation', 'trigonometry']"

If $u,v\in {W^1(\Omega)}$ and $uv,uDv+vDu\in L^1_{\operatorname{loc}}(\Omega)$, then we have the product formula
$$D(uv)=uDv+vDu.$$ The definition I use for weak derivative: A function $u\in L^1_{loc}(\Omega)$ has a $\alpha-$th weak derivative in $\Omega$ if there is a function $v\in L^1_{\operatorname{loc}}(\Omega)$ with: $$\int_{\Omega}uD^\alpha\phi=(-1)^{|\alpha|}\int_{\Omega}v\phi dx\quad \forall\,\phi\in C^\infty_0(\Omega)$$
$u\in W^1(\Omega)$ means it has first weak derivative. I searched on the internet. Most of them just proved the case of $u\in W^1(\Omega)$ and $v\in C^1(\Omega)$. This is the first step of the proving. I want to prove the general case by approximation. Namely, let $v_\epsilon$ denote the regularization (or mollification) of $v\in W^1(\Omega)$,
then it is true
$$D(uv_\epsilon)=v_\epsilon Du+uDv_\epsilon$$

$$\int_{\Omega}uv_\epsilon D\phi=-\int_{\Omega}(v_\epsilon Du+uDv_\epsilon)\phi dx\quad \forall\,\phi\in C^\infty_0(\Omega)$$

$$\int_{\Omega}(v_\epsilon Du+uDv_\epsilon)\phi dx\to \int_{\Omega}(v Du+uDv)\phi dx\text{ as }\epsilon\to 0$$
But I can not accomplish, even for the first limit. Can anyone give me some idea? Maybe I am heading a wrong direction. But I am quite convinced that the mollification is so good that this must be true. On the other hand, this formula is very elementary in Sobolev space. Probably you can prove this proposition by distribution theory(or generalized function), however, it sounds cheating for me somehow, because here our definition has noting with distribution.","['weak-derivatives', 'sobolev-spaces', 'partial-differential-equations', 'real-analysis']"

443448,measures on the family of locally measurable subsets,"I am contemplating over the exercise about the ways to extend a measure to a collection of locally measurable subsets. To be precise: Let $(X,\mathcal M,\mu)$ be a measure space. Assume that $\mu$ is semifinite (i.e. each measurable set of infinite measure contains measurable sets of arbitrarily large finite measure). Let $\mathcal C$ denote the collection of locally measurable subsets of $X$. (Recall that a subset $E\subseteq X$ is called locally measurable if for each $B\subseteq \mathcal M$ with $\mu(B)<\infty$, the intersection $E\cap B$ belongs to $\mathcal M$.) It can be shown that $\mathcal C$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, so one can extend measure $\mu$ from $\mathcal M$ to $\mathcal C$ in at least two different ways: for every $E\in\mathcal C$ define $\bar{\mu}(E)=\mu(E)$ if $E\in\mathcal M$ and $\bar{\mu}(E)=\infty$ if $E\notin\mathcal M$; $\underline{\mu}(E)=\sup\{\mu(B)\mid B\in\mathcal M,\, B\subseteq E\}$. One can show that each of these functions is indeed a measure on $\mathcal C$ making $(X,\mathcal C)$ a saturated measure space.

In particular, putting $e^{-0.9x}$ and $e^{-1.9x}$ in (1) clearly makes convergence non-uniform. One difficulty here is that the Taylor remainder formula is effective only up to $x\approx N/e$, and the maximum of the difference is at $x\approx N$.

C. da Silva ( http://www.math.ist.utl.pt/~acannas/Books/lsg.pdf ) the author gives the following definition: $$ \mathcal{L}_{v_t}\omega := \frac{\mathrm d }{\mathrm d t} (\rho_t)^*\omega\big|_{t=0} $$ where $\rho_t$ satisfies $$ \frac{\mathrm d \rho_t}{\mathrm d t} = v_t\circ\rho_t \qquad \text{and} \qquad \rho_0 = \mathrm{id}. $$ I wonder if this actually makes sense. For time-independent vector fields $v_t=v$ it totally does, but in the time dependent case I have the following objections: The right-hand side of the definition of $\mathcal{L}_{v_t}$ does not use the parameter $t$ . Or is the $t$ in the left-hand side just to denote that we have a time-dependent vector field? But on page 40 the author uses the Cartan formula $$ \mathcal{L}_{v_t}\omega = i_{v_t}\mathrm{d\omega} + \mathrm{d}i_{v_t}\omega $$ where the right-hand side certainly depends on the parameter $t$ . The formula $$ \frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dt}\rho_t^*\omega = \rho_t^*\mathcal{L}_{v_t}\omega$$ given on page 36 seems to be wrong when you use the definition of $\mathcal{L}_{v_t}$ given above. For me everything works when I define instead $$ \mathcal{L}_{v_s} \omega:= \frac{\mathrm d }{\mathrm d t} (\rho_{s,t})^*\omega\big|_{t=s} $$ where $\rho_{s,t}$ satisfies $$ \frac{\mathrm d \rho_{s,t}}{\mathrm d t} = v_t\circ\rho_{s,t} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \rho_{s,s} = \mathrm{id}. $$ Does this make sense to you?","['differential-forms', 'derivatives', 'definition']"

443644,How to turn a topological space into a semi-decidable logic?,"In two interesting posts( here and here ),it is mentioned that ""there is a close connection between semi-decidable logics and topological spaces"" Michael O’Connor wrote: In fact, given a topological space, you can form a semi-decidable logic by making a propositional symbol $P_U$ for each open set $U$ . You can then interpret all propositional formulas as open sets by interpreting $\lor$ as union and $\land$ as intersection. Finally, take as a set of axioms the set of all statements $P \vdash Q$ where the open set corresponding to $P$ is a subset of the open set corresponding to $P$ . This set is closed under the inference rules given. You can also start with a semi-decidable logic and generate a topology; this is a form of Stone duality.  In general, if you start with a topological space, translate to a semi-decidable logic, then translate back, you might not get your original space back.  However, you will if the space you start with is sufficiently nice (e.g., Hausdorff). Question: Could anyone give a concrete example of how this can be done? For example what's semidecidable logic of $\omega^{\omega}$ with a product topology? What is $P_U$ , if $U = \{0\} \times \omega^{\omega}$ ? Any reference on this topic is also welcome.

Proof Since $G$ is not abelian, the order of its center cannot be $p^3$. Since it is a $p$-group, the center cannot be trivial. So the order of $Z(G)$ is either $p^2$ or $p$. Suppose, for contradiction, that $Z(G) = p^2$. Since $p$ is prime, we can assume that a subgroup $H= \langle p \rangle$ of order $p$ exists in $G$. We can also assume that $H$ and $Z(G)$ are disjoint. Otherwise, if there didn't exist a disjoint subgroup of order $p$, then the order of $G$ would be $p^2$. Since $Z(G)$ is the center, they commute with p. Since they commute with $p$, they must also commute with all powers of $p$.

444006,A fake proof of pull-back of an ample divisor is ample,"Let $\pi: X \to Y$ be a morphism between projective varieties and $H$ be an ample divisor on $Y$. I want to ""show"" $\pi^*H$ is ample on $X$ by the following argument: Let $N_1(X)_\mathbb{R},N_1(Y)_\mathbb{R}$ be vector spaces of 1-cycles module numerical equivalence, and let $NE(X),NE(Y)$ be the cones of effective 1-cycles in $N_1(X)_\mathbb{R},N_1(Y)_\mathbb{R}$ with $\overline{NE(X)},\overline{NE(Y)}$ being their closures. Then we have a continuous map $\pi_*:  N_1(X)_\mathbb{R} \to N_1(Y)_\mathbb{R}$
  defined by $[C] \mapsto [\pi_* C]$. Where if $C$ is an irreducible curve, then $\pi_* C$ is defined to be $\deg(\pi)\pi(C)$ when $\pi$ does not contract $C$, and $0$ otherwise. $\pi_*$ induces a continuous map $\pi_*: \overline{NE(X)} \to \overline{NE(Y)}$. Kleiman's criterion shows: $H $ is ample $\iff$ $\forall ~C' \in \overline{NE(Y)}, H\cdot C'>0$ . Let $C \in \overline{NE(X)}$, and $C_i \to C$. Then by projection formula, we have $\pi^* H \cdot C_i = H \cdot \pi_* C_i > 0$, and hence $\pi^* H \cdot C>0$. By  Kleiman's criterion again, $\pi^*H$ is an ample divisor. I know ampleness does not behave quite well under pull back, one need some extra condition (e.g. finite morphism) to make sure $\pi^*H$ preserve ampleness. There must be something wrong in the above argument, and I will be very appreciated if someone can point it to me!!",['algebraic-geometry']

I feel like way 1 is better for my sets. I also imagine that interpolation or trend curves may have non-physical variations, e.g. Runge oscillations in the case of polynomial interpolation.

444068,"Question regarding calculus, graph of functions, point of inflection.","We're studying the application of derivatives in mathematics right now. This refers to a question which arose in my head while solving a particular problem. The problem was: A function $f(x)$ is continuous and twice differentiable. The line segment joining $\big(a, f(a)\big)$ and $\big(b, f(b)\big)$ intersects the graph at $\big(c,f(c)\big)$, prove that there exists a $t\epsilon(a,b)$ such that $f''(t) = 0$. Now this part is easy enough. There will exist a point in the interval $(a,c)$ such that the slope of the tangent at the point will be equal to the slope of the line segment $AB$. Similarly, another point with the same condition will exist in the interval  $(c,b)$. We know that the concavity of a graph changes between two extremas (for a continuous and differentiable curve), and therefore there will exist a point of inflection $\big(t, f(t)\big)$ around which the second derivative $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ $\big(= f''(x)\big) $ changes its sign and thus the value of $f''(t)$ will be $0$. Now my confusion starts. A student raised a doubt, saying that although there HAS to be a point $t$ such that $f''(t) = 0$ it is possible that there is no point of inflection . He said that this may happen when there is a 'm'-shaped graph: To my surprise, my professor accepted the argument ! I felt that it could not be true, since there ARE existing points between A and C and between C and B where the concavity IS changing! The portion of the graph just about C is concave upwards, while the other parts of the graph are concave downwards. When I pointed this out to the professor, he disagreed, saying that if the graph narrows to a point at C, then there won't be any portion facing upwards. I have a problem with this too. If the graph narrows to a point, then that means that $f(x)$ will NOT be differentiable at C! And if it does not, there always WILL be some part - no matter how small - which faces upwards. When I raised objections again, I was told to observe the graph of $f(x) = \sin^2(x)$ - which - at points $\pi, 2\pi, 3\pi$, etc($±n\pi$). touches the x-axis, but still doesn't have a point of inflection. If I still had a doubt, I was to meet him after class (which didn't happen since he left before our last lecture was over). So I checked the $f(x) = \sin^2(x)$ graph too. I checked it's second derivative - which is $2\cos(2x)$. The graph of this is a wave, which intersects the $x$ axis at $\frac{n\pi}{4}$ as shown here . This graph indicates that $f(x) = \sin^2(x)$ does have inflection points about which the sign of $f''(x)$ (and so the concavity of the graph) changes. I'm not going to meet this professor for another week, and I need this cleared. Can anybody confirm whether I am correct or my professor is?","['graphing-functions', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"

Question: How well is the distribution of the supremum $\sup_{x\in K}W(x)$ approximated by the maximum $\max_{i\le k}W(x_i)$?

It is not a priori clear what a good measure of distance between the distribution of $\sup_{x\in K}W(x)$ and $\max_{i\le k}W(x_i)$ would be. Several possible choices present themselves: For example the total variation distance, the Levy-Prokhorov distance and the Kolmogorov distance.

This defines a graph on $G$. It is always fairly symmetric: $N_G(H)$ acts on the left and $G$ on the right as graph automorphisms. For some choices of $H\leq G$ the automorphism group of the graph is much (much) larger. For $H$ a Sylow $2$-subgroup of $G=S_5$, the resulting graph has 3840 undirected edges on 120 vertices and is extremely symmetric: the automorphism group $X$ of the graph has structure $2.A_6.2.2^4.2.2^4.2.2^4.A_8^{15}$ and acts vertex, edge, and arc-transitively.

444337,An elementary problem in Group Theory: the unique noncyclic group of order 4,"Following the advice given in this question , I have started to study Group Theory from the very basics. My reference text is Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote. While going through the exercises (page 24) I found one problem which required more effort than others: Assume $G = \{1, a, b, c\}$ is a group of order $4$ with identity $1$. Also assume that $G$ has no elements of order $4$. Use the cancellation laws to show that there is a unique group table for $G$. Deduce that $G$ is abelian. I proceeded with solution as follows. Since $G$ is of even order there must be at least one element of order $2$ (this statement itself was one of the problems in the exercises and is easy to handle). From the wording of the question it seems that none of the elements $a, b, c$ is singled out with specific properties and hence $a, b, c$ must behave in exactly the same manner. Hence each of them is of order $2$. Thus $a^{2} = b^{2} = c^{2} = 1$. Next I analyze product $ab$. Clearly it can't be $a$ (as $b$ is non-identity), or $b$ (as $a$ is non-identity) or $1$ (because $ab = 1 = aa$ implies $b = a$). Hence $ab = c$ and similarly $ba = c$. By the similar nature of all elements $a, b, c$ it follows that $bc = cb = a$ and $ca = ac = b$. Thus the operation of the group is defined properly for all elements and clearly it is abelian. I think my solution is OK, but I am not sure. Note that I have not used the fact that $G$ has no elements of order $4$. Please let me know : 1) if my solution is correct. If not then point out the flaws. 2) if there is any better / shorter solution. If so provide hints and not solution. The question may sound too easy / simple but I request to treat me like a beginner who has never heard of Group Theory and is reading fresh from the reference text I mentioned. Thanks in advance for your inputs. EDIT: Thinking further about this problem I wondered what would happen if an element of order $4$ was allowed in $G$. In that case I think that the group has to be isomorphic to the group $G_{1} = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ with modulo $5$ multiplication as the group operation. The argument is as follows. Suppose $a$ is of order $4$ and let $b$ be its inverse then $b$ is also of order $4$. Now $c$ has to be its own inverse so that $c^{2} = 1$. Again $a^{2} \neq 1$ (as $ab = 1$), $a^{2} \neq a$ (as $a \neq 1$), $a^{2} \neq b$ (as it would mean $b^{2} = 1$ and thus $b$ would be of order $2$). Hence $a^{2} = c$ and similarly $b^{2} = c$. Next we can see that $ac \neq a$, $ac \neq c$, $ac \neq 1$ (as $ab = 1$) so that $ac = b$. Similarly $ca = b$, $bc = a$, $cb = a$. Also it is clear that this group turns out to be cyclic with both $a$ as well as $b$ as generators. And it also follows that there are the only two ($G$ in original question and $G$ in new variation) groups of order $4$ upto isomorphism.  I hope I have learnt something from the answers given for the original question and this solution is correct. Please let me know if there is any problem with this reasoning.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
444348,What's the symbol m in this sum?,"I'm supposed to write some code to calculate the inertia moments of a shape, but I am afraid I have been given too little information. The matrix that I must obtain is this one: $$
\begin{vmatrix}
J_{xx} = \sum \limits_i m_i y_i² & 
J_{xy} = -\sum \limits_i m_i x_i y_i\\
J_{xy} = -\sum \limits_i m_i x_i y_i & 
J_{yy} = \sum \limits_i m_i x_i² \end{vmatrix}
$$ Which we can denote by
$$
\begin{vmatrix}
A & 
-F\\
-F& 
B \end{vmatrix}
$$ Apparently, the eigenvectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ obtained from that matrix, with $$
v_n = \begin{vmatrix}
-F \\
-A+r_n\end{vmatrix}
$$ and $r_n$ being the corresponding eigenvalue, will determine the orientation of the shape. The problem is that it is nowhere stated what the $m$ in the sums is supposed to be. Knowing that it's just a shape, is it possible that this mass is always 1 in this case? In addition, I think the $x$ and $y$ values of each point have to be measured from the centre of mass of the shape, but I'm not sure. Is anyone familiar with these concepts and kind enough to clear out my doubts?","['notation', 'geometry']"
444358,The Birthday Problem,"I've been reading about the birthday problem which, as I'm sure many of you will know, is a statistical problem which aims at finding out the how many people you would need in a random group to be certain that two of them shared a birthday. I've read the wikipedia article and am happy with the concept and the answers to this problem. What I'm interested in doing is expanding the principle. I've been trying to work out the answer to a similar problem, but where you simply wanted to know the probability that two people were born in the same week and in the same month. I'm not really sure how to go about this, though, so my first question is: is there a general equation I can use to extend the problem to these cases? But, I know there are many articles and stackexchange questions on this, so I wouldn't ask unless I had a specific problem, which is this: Suppose a person has met 500 people in their lifetime. What is the probability that seven of those 500 share a birthday in the same two month period? I think the answer to my last question is that it's certain. But could I ask what is the smallest number of people you would need for the probability that - in a group of 500 people - the probability of them sharing a birthday in a two month period is less that 50%? If that makes sense? Okay, thank you everybody, edited to tidy up: Question 1: What is the smallest group of randomly selected people required such that the probability that two of them share a birthday within one week of each other is at least 75%? Question 2: What is the smallest group of randomly selected people required such that the probability that two of them share a birthday within thirty days of each other is at least 75%? Question 3: What is the smallest group of randomly selected people required such that the probability that seven of them share a birthday within sixty days of each other is at least 75%? Question 4: In a group of 30 randomly selected people, what is the probability that seven of them will share a birthday with fifty days? I hope that's a lot clearer. I had no idea how to word these questions until I posted this and am grateful to everyone who's contributed for helping me do so :)","['statistics', 'birthday', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"
