4571143,Confusion about Zorn's lemma.,"I'm reading the book Notes on Lattice Theory , J. B. Nation and am confused about the proof of two equivalent axioms of AC (in Appendix 2: The Axiom of Choice, p137), the two axioms are: Zorn's Lemma If every chain in an ordered set $P$ has an upper bound in $P$ , then $P$ contains an maximal element. Hausdorff Maximality Principle Every chain in an ordered set $P$ can be embedded in a maximal chain. I have only basic knowledge about set theory and get confused about the proof from Zorn's Lemma to Hausdorff Maximality Principle: Given an ordered set $P$ , let $Q$ be the set of all chains in $P$ , ordered by set containment. If $\{C_{\alpha}: \alpha \in A\}$ is a chain in $Q$ , then $\bigcup C_{\alpha}$ is a chain in $P$ that is the least upper bound of $\{C_{\alpha}: \alpha \in A\}$ . Thus $Q$ satisfies the hypothesis of Zorn's Lemma, and hence it contains a maximal element $C$ , which is a maximal chain in $P$ . Isn't it possible that $\{C_{\alpha}: \alpha \in A\}$ is an infinite set? If possible, is there any constraint on the use of a union of infinite many sets? Like my proof below: For any chain $C$ of $\mathbb{N}$ , the sum of every element of $C$ is an upper bound of $C$ , can I use Zorn's Lemma here and say $\mathbb{N}$ has a maximal element? And I always feel lost when proofs have something to do with infinite stuff, is there any book about infinity? Many thanks!","['elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory']"
4571175,computing a connection coefficient over a framed open set,"It is well known that given a connection on a $\mathbb{K}$ vector bundle $E$ over some manifold $M$ with rank $r$ , there is a $U\subset M$ is a framed open set with frame $e= \{ e_i \}_{i=1}^r $ , such that we have a connection form matrix $\omega \in \Omega ^1 (U, \text{Mat}_{r\times r}(\mathbb{K})$ with respect to this frame. It satisfies $$
\nabla_X(\tilde{e}_i)=\sum_j \omega^i_j(X)e_j
$$ if $\tilde{e}_i$ is a globally defined section that agrees with $e_i$ on $U$ . I understand that given a vector bundle, we can always find framed open sets in which we can define the connection locally. Now, my question is given a connection and a framed open set, can we always have a connection form with respect to this frame (we of course still have connection via restriction of $\nabla$ )? I think that this does not hold when the section cannot be extended. Usually, when given a connection, we can compute the connection form by evaluating the expression $\nabla_X(\tilde{e}_i)$ since most cases I have seen, $e_i$ can be extended globally for the given frame so this question never occured to me. But considering my question, does one have to be careful with a choosing a frame in which we wish to find a connection over?","['manifolds', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"
4571179,Existence of A Smooth Function Under a Positive Continuous Function,"Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. Let $f : M \to \mathbb{R}$ be a positive continuous function. Then is it true that there exists a positive smooth function $g : M \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $0 < g \le f$ ? This seems obvious, but I do not know how to approach. Thank you. (Edit) I think I proved it. If $M$ is compact, then $f$ has minimum, say $m > 0$ , so we can consider the constant function $g = m$ . If $M$ is noncompact, then consider some nice partition $\{ K_i \}_i$ of $M$ by compact sets, and let $m_i > 0$ be the minimum of $f|_{K_i}$ . Now we may take some nice smooth function $g$ such that $g \le m_i$ on each $K_i$ .","['continuity', 'differential-geometry', 'smooth-functions', 'real-analysis']"
4571192,Can a self-map of a vector space preserve a nondegenerate bilinear form without being linear?,"Let $V$ be an infinite-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ . Let $B:V\times V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a nondegenerate bilinear form, i.e., a bilinear form satisfying $$ B(x,y)=0,\;\forall y\in V \Rightarrow x=0.$$ Suppose $\phi:V\rightarrow V$ is a self-map satisfying $B(x,y)=B(\phi x, \phi y)$ for all $x,y\in V$ . My question is this: Is $\phi$ necessarily linear? If ""no"", what's an example? The answer is yes if $\phi$ is surjective, by an argument I will share momentarily. What I want to know is if there exists a non-surjective nonlinear $\phi$ and a $B$ satisfying the above. The question is motivated by a passage in Peter Lax's book Functional Analysis , which gives a proof that relies on this assumption. On p. 59, Lax writes the following. (Hopefully the meaning of Lax's notation can be inferred from context, but just in case: $H$ is a Hilbert space and there is a fixed self-map of $H$ for which the image of $x\in H$ is denoted by $x'$ , and similarly for other variables.) ""We stated in chapter 5 that every isometry of a Banach space onto itself that maps $0$ into $0$ is linear. We give now a new proof of this in Hilbert space: [... here Lax verifies that an isometry fixing the origin preserves the Hilbert space inner product...] Now denote $x+y$ by $z$ , and let $u$ be any vector in $H$ . Using [the preservation of the inner product] we have $$ (z',u')=(z,u) = (x+y,u) = (x,u) + (y,u) = (x', u') + (y',u') = (x'+y',u'). $$ Thus $$(z'-x'-y',u')=0$$ for all $u'$ . This can be only if $z'=x'+y'$ . The virtue of this proof is that it applies even when the scalar product is not positive, as long as it is nondegenerate, meaning that no $u$ is orthogonal to all points. My question arose from making sense of Lax's final comment here. If the scalar product is not positive, then it doesn't induce a metric, so it becomes unclear to me what it should mean for the metric to be complete, and therefore unclear to me how to interpret the notion of ""Hilbert space"" in this broader context. On the other hand, the argument makes no use of completeness, and the metric structure only enters through the inner product, so presumably the scope of Lax's final comment above is really just spaces equipped with a nondegenerate bilinear form (as in the question above). This led me to a question about what Lax wants to replace the isometry with in this broader context. He defines an isometry as (distance-preserving and) surjective, and implicitly uses this in the argument above because prima facie, ""for all $u'$ "" means ""for all $\phi u$ with $u\in H$ ""; this only ranges across all of $H$ if $\phi$ surjects. So the claim that results from a straightforward generalization of the above argument is that if $\phi$ preserves $B$ and is surjective onto $V$ , then $\phi$ is linear. So this made me curious: what happens if $\phi$ is not surjective?","['linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis']"
4571232,Estimation: An integral from MIT Integration bee 2022 (QF),"We need to determine the value of: $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt n\cdot \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} (1-3x^2+x^4)^n\mathrm{d}x$$ Since a limit has been given, one suspects that, as usual, the integral is not easy to evaluate in general and some estimates have to be made. Some promising starts (and observations) include: The polynomial always lies between $5/16$ and $1$ in the given range. Perhaps we can ignore some higher order terms (even $x$ has modulus less than one)? But the problem is that exponent $n$ . Reduction formula and integration by parts can give a recursion. But all reasonable ways of splitting the integrand seem to complicate matters rather than simplify them. We can now take some hints from the limits. Perhaps some trigonometric substitution can aid. A reasonable one is $x^2=\frac 14\sin \theta$ or $x=\frac 12 \cos\theta$ but there is not much one can do due to the quadratic polynomial. Factorize the polynomial as $x^2-3x+1$ has all real roots? But I still get stuck. But I am unable to make any of these work. Does anyone have any suggestions?","['limits', 'definite-integrals']"
4571236,Why is the rank of an element of a null space less than the dimension of that null space?,"I'm trying to understand a statement I came across in a paper.

The paper states that, since $B$ is in the null subspace of $A$ , $$ \textrm{rank}(B) \leq \textrm{dim}\big(\mathcal{N}(A)\big)\,,    $$ where $\mathcal{N(.)}$ returns the null subspace of the argument.

4571342,Computing Theta Characteristics of Hyperelliptic Curves,"Take a hyperelliptic curve $C$ (nonsingular, algebraically closed field) of genus $g$ . The theta characteristic(s) of the curve are defined to be the line bundles $\{\theta\in Pic^{g-1}(C)|\theta^{\otimes 2} = \omega_C\}$ , where $\omega_C$ is the canonical sheaf. We can (after fixing some $\theta$ ) write $\theta=\mathscr{O}_C(\Theta)$ and $\omega_C=\mathscr{O}_C(K)$ for the canonical divisor $K$ and corresponding theta divisor $\Theta$ . It is well-known that there are $2^{2g}$ theta characteristics for a genus $g$ hyperelliptic curve. Since we are in the nonsingular case we can consider $\Theta,K$ as Weil divisors. In particular we must have $[2\Theta]=[K]$ . Naively I hoped to simply formally divide the coefficients in $K$ by $2$ to find a $\Theta$ , but although the degree of $K$ is even, the coefficients of it are all not even (for example the coefficients at the Weierstrass points are $1$ ). Question: How does one calculate $\theta,\Theta$ in practice? Are there any examples of this for low-genus curves?

As mentioned here , Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis proves the theorem using a fair bit of measure theory. The theorem, however, is very easily stated with little measure theory; one would only need said theory to define the meaning of ""a.e."", which could be done as follows: Definition: for an arbitrary $x\in\mathbb{R}$ , let $P(x)$ be a statement about $x$ (e.g. "" $x$ is rational"", "" $x$ is larger than 2"", etc.). We write $$Â¬P:=\{x\in\mathbb{R} : P(x) \text{ is false}\}$$ We say that $P$ holds almost everywhere iff $$\inf\left\{\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(b_k-a_k) : Â¬P\subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}[a_k,b_k] \right\} = 0.$$ Considering that the above is the only bit of measure theory we need to state the theorem, is it possible to prove the theorem without invoking any more measure theoretical machinery?","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'alternative-proof', 'absolute-continuity', 'derivatives']"
4571527,Find a completion of the following spaces,"Find a completion of the incomplete metric space $(X,d)$ , where a) $X=\Bbb{Q}$ , where $\forall{q,r}\in{X}$ $d(q,r) = \lvert {\arctan(q) - \arctan(r)}\rvert$ b) $X=(0,1)\setminus \mathbb{Q}$ , where $\forall{x,y}\in{X}$ $d(x,y)=|x-1|+|y-1|$ for $x\neqÂ y$ , $d(x,x)=0$ For part a), I suspect that the metric $d$ is equivalent to the usual Euclidean metric $\lvert {q-r}\rvert$ .

Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post . Closed 6 months ago . Improve this question I have a university lecturer that puts a lot of emphasis on the writing quality of an answer, not just if its correct. He wants our answers to be 5 things, Clear, Complete, Concise, Coherent and Correct. He says he doesn't believe in perfect answers so can be very nit-picky over our solutions, but it also means he can be contradictory. For example in one of my solutions he said i had been repetitive but firstly, the repeated line (which was something like, ""by the law of total variance"") was there to help the narrative of the answer - which he puts so much emphasis on - and it was repeated from part 1 of a question after quite a few lines of integration. But secondly and more importantly, in his very own solution, he had the exact same repetition. And he said my answer was very good and he was being really nitpicky but that i could at some point write more detail, like write ""the pdf of X is f(x)=..."" rather than just go straight into ""f(x)=..."" So my question is how do you strike a balance between explaining enough and becoming too laborious? Also what are some good connecting words in proofs and 'show me' questions and when do you use which? Because i just tend to stick in 'and', 'because', 'so' 'thus' etc, when prehaps sometimes it isn't strictly true (but does get the point across) An example of such a question: Let X~Gamma( $\alpha,\beta$ ) where $\beta$ is a rate parameter. Find the MGF of X and
use this to show that $\Bbb{E}(X)=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$ and $var(X)=\frac{\alpha}{\beta^2}$ Let X~Gamma( $\alpha , \beta$ ) Then the PDF of X is: $$f(x)=\frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}x^{(\alpha-1)}e^{-\beta x}dx $$ ,for $x>0$ and 0 otherwise, where $$\Gamma(\alpha)=\int_0^\inf t^{\alpha-1}e^{-t}dt$$ $$M_X(t)=\mathbb{E}(e^{tX})=\int_0^\inf e^{tx}f(x)dx$$ $$=\frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^\inf e^{tx}x^{\alpha-1}e^{-\beta x}dx$$ $$=\frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}int_0^\inf x^{\alpha-1}e^{-(\beta-t) x}dx$$ Let $$u=(\beta-t)x$$ $$\iff x=\frac{u}{\beta-t}$$ $$\implies dx=(\beta-t)du$$ So $$M_X(t)=\frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^\inf (\frac{u}{\beta-t})^{\alpha-1}e^-u(\beta-t)du$$ $$=\frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}(\frac{1}{\beta-t})^{\alpha}\int_0^\inf u^{\alpha-1}e^{-u}du$$ $$\frac{\beta^\alpha}{(\beta-t)^\alpha}$$ To show that $\Bbb{E}(X)=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$ and $var(X)=\frac{\alpha}{\beta^2}$ :
Using differentiation gives us: $$M'(t)=\frac{\alpha\beta^\alpha}{(\beta-t)^{\alpha+1}}$$ and $$ M''(t)=\frac{\alpha(\alpha+1)\beta^\alpha}{(\beta-t)^{\alpha+21}}$$ It follows that $$\Bbb{E}(X)=M'(0)=\frac{\alpha\beta^\alpha}{\beta^{\alpha+1}}=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$$ and $$\Bbb{E}(X^2)=M''(0)=\frac{\alpha(\alpha+1)\beta^\alpha}{\beta^{\alpha+21}}=\frac{\alpha(\alpha+1)}{\beta^2}$$ Hence $$ var(X)=\Bbb{E}(X^2)-\Bbb{E}(X)^2$$ $$=\frac{\alpha(\alpha+1)}{\beta^2}-\frac{\alpha^2}{\beta^2}$$ $$=\frac{\alpha}{\beta^2}$$ as required I know i need connecting words before i calculate the M(t) but i have no idea what to put, plus I'm not sure if where I've put ""it follows that"" is strictly true, also i feel like where i've used ""So"" there might be a better word to use but i can't think what","['proof-writing', 'soft-question', 'probability']"

4571604,Remainder Theorem vs. Factor Theorem,"Is it right to say that the remainder theorem and the factor theorem are similar, but not the same processes? For context, this was a question on a homework sheet provided to me by my advanced functions teacher. The question asked for a way other than remainder theorem to determine if a binomial was a factor of a polynomial. I argued that factor theorem was a way, but she said that the two were basically the same and that synthetic division would be the correct answer. My train of thought was: Remainder Theorem - for any polynomial f(x), if you divide it by the binomial xâa, the remainder is equal to the value of f(a). Factor Theorem - if a is a zero of a polynomial f(x), then (xâa) is a factor of f(x) I concluded, with the help of an online resource, that the remainder theorem links the remainder of division by a binomial with the value of a function at a point, while the factor theorem links the factors of a polynomial to its zeros. While they may seem the same, mathematically, they are different, right? That's why they are two distinct theorems and not one. I also thought that if the ""remainder theorem and factor theorem are basically the same"" then the remainder theorem and synthetic division are also the same because you are using the rational zeroes theorem in both cases.

4571793,Why do we require a function to be measurable in order to define its Lebesgue Integral?,"Let be $f : X \to [0; + \infty)$ measurable .

I cannot understand why do we require $f$ to be measurable . My thought is: we don't really need f to be measurable (I never mentioned it in the definition of the integral, I only said that $f(x)$ should be always not-smaller than any simple function $s(x)$ ). We never use it in the definition of the Lebesgue Integral . What we really need and indeed use is that the any simple function $s(x)$ be measurable (otherwise I cannot integrate it). Now, my guess is: do we require $f(x)$ to be measureable in order to be sure that all its approximation (i.e. the simple function ) are indeed measurable ?

Let $ x_0 \in X $ be a point.
Prove that if $ \varphi \colon X \setminus \{ x_0 \} \to Y \setminus A $ is a homeomorphism, then there exists a homeomorphism $ f \colon X \to Y / A $ . I think that I can intuitively see why this is true, but I cannot formally prove this statement. My attempt Let $ f $ be given by $$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
    (q \circ \varphi)(x) &\text{ if } x \neq x_0 \, , \\
    a &\text{ otherwise} \, ,
\end{cases}
$$ where $ q \colon Y \to Y / A $ is the quotient map and $ a \in q(A) \subset Y / A $ is a fixed point.
Since $ \varphi $ and $ q \colon Y \setminus A \to Y / A $ are homeomorphisms (we restricted $ q $ to $ Y \setminus A $ - this is a homeomorphism onto its image), we know that $ f $ is a bijection.
We need to prove that $ f(U) $ is open for any open $ U \subset X $ and $ f^{-1}(O) $ is open for any open $ O \subset Y / A $ .
Let $ U \subset X $ .
If $ x_0 \not \in U $ , then $ f(U) $ is clearly open in $ Y / A $ , because $ f(U) = (q \circ \varphi)(U) $ .
If $ x_0 \in U $ , then $$
f(U)

            = (q \circ \varphi)(U \setminus \{ x_0 \}) \cup \{ a \} \, .
$$ Let $ f(U) = W $ .
We know that $ W $ is open if and only if $ q^{-1}(W) = \varphi(U \setminus \{ x_0 \}) \cup A $ is open. I don't know how to proceed from here. Similarly, I do not know how to prove $ f^{-1}(O) $ is open given an open $ O \subset Y / A $ such that $ a \in O $ , but it seems to me that the proof must use a very similar argument.

I have some wood boards that are initially similar to those in the first picture. It would be simple to join them by cutting each end at a 45Â° angle. Boards while flat However, they will not be laying flat (that is, Z=0 for all bottom edges). The bottom face will be tilted up AÂ° from the outside such that the inside edges are raised above the Z=0 plane. (A = 30Â° in the picture.) My goal is to cut the ends of the boards with the same angles such that the cut edges will join face to face. After the boards are tilted up, B cannot have been cut at 45Â° if the faces are the join. Also, the cut edge is no longer 90Â° from the face (like the other 3 edges on each board). How do I calculate B and C given an angle A? Essentially, the cut faces need to be parallel to the Z-axis. The purpose of this calculation is because the boards can only be held steady when laying flat and the saw blade must have its angles adjustedâbut to what? Thanks for any help orienting my thinking about the steps for solving this problem! In other situations there would be more than 4 boards being joined, so the 45Â° would actually be another number (like 22.5Â° with 8 boards).

4572181,inner products on polynomials,"So, I was studying about orthogonal polynomials and saw general examples of inner products on $\mathbb{R}[x]$ , mostly of the forms $$\langle f,g\rangle=\int f(x)g(x)q(x)dx,$$ for some kind of density $q$ ; and an inner product of the form $$\langle f,g\rangle=\sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k)g(x_k),$$ for some fixed set of $x_1,...,x_n$ (mostly the eigenvalues of some matrix). As it happens, in both cases we have that the product is of the form $$\langle f,g\rangle=\int fgd\mu,$$ for some measure $\mu$ defined on the borelians (the first case the absolut continuous $d\mu =qdm$ and the second the dirac measure supported on $x_j$ ) My intuition is that for all cases there should be some measure, which we can define from the inner product. This intuition comes from Riez-Markov theorem, but there is no topological structure to be used here, so I cannot use it. so the question is: Is it true that every positive semi-definide inner product on $\mathbb{R}[x]$ is of the kind $$\langle f,g\rangle=\int fgd\mu,$$ for some measure $\mu$ that can be determined by the inner product?

4572312,Sum of an irreducible representation.,"I am trying to prove the following statement: Let $\mathfrak{X}$ be an irreducible $F$ -representation of $G$ over an arbitrary field. Show that $\sum\limits_{g\in G}\mathfrak{X}(g) = 0$ unless $\mathfrak{X}$ is the principal representation. I know that there are many different proofs of this fact, but I wanted to prove this statement on my own, and I have not yet seen a proof similar to mine (although I may be wrong). But is this proof correct? Unfortunately, as it has already turned out, this proof doesn't work for an arbitrary field, but it is probably true for a field with characteristic $0$ !!! Proof: Let $\mathfrak{X}$ be the principal representation, then by definition $\forall g\in G\Rightarrow \mathfrak{X}(g) = 1_{F}$ . Then $$\sum\limits_{g\in G}\mathfrak{X}(g) = \sum\limits_{g\in G}1_{F} =|G|\cdot 1_{F}$$ Now let $\mathfrak{X}$ not be the principal representation. Let $T = \sum\limits_{g\in G}\mathfrak{X}(g)$ . Note that $\forall a \in G$ $$\mathfrak{X}(a)T = \mathfrak{X}(a)\sum\limits_{g\in G}\mathfrak{X}(g) = \sum\limits_{g\in G}\mathfrak{X}(ag) = T.$$ Then it follows that $T^2 = |G|\cdot T$ . Then the polynomial $x^2 -|G|x$ is annulling for $T$ . Then the Jordan form of $T$ (up to permutations of Jordan cells) can take the following forms: Either $|G|\cdot I$ ; or zero matrix; or a matrix with several units diagonally (not completely filling it), and the rest of all values are zero, and multiplied by $|G|$ . Note that only the zero matrix among all these types of matrices has a trace equal to zero! Let $\chi$ be the character associated with $\mathfrak{X}$ . Consider the following expression $$S = \sum\limits_{g\in G}\chi(g) = [\chi, 1_G] = 0.$$ The last equality holds because $\chi\in Irr(G)$ and $\chi \neq 1_G$ . Since $\chi(g) = tr(\mathfrak{X}(g))$ and $tr(A + B) = tr(A) + tr(B)$ for any matrices $A$ and $B$ , we get that $S = tr(T) = 0$ . But only the zero matrix among the possible candidates for the role of $T$ had a zero trace. So $T = 0$ , which was required to be proved. $\blacksquare$","['representation-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'solution-verification']"

In this problem we will establish the ""binomial
series"" $$(1+x)^\alpha=\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty \binom{\alpha}{k}x^k, |x|<1$$ for any $\alpha$ , by showing that $R_{n,0}(x)=0$ . The proof is in
several steps, and uses the Cauchy and Lagrange forms as found in
problem 10-21. (a) Use the ratio test to show that the series $\sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty \binom{\alpha}{k} r^k$ does indeed converge for  > $|r|<1$ . (b) Suppose first that $0\leq x<1$ . Show that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}
 R_{n,0}(x)=0$ , but using Lagrange's form of the remainder, noticing
that $(1+t)^{\alpha-n-1}\leq 1$ for $n+1>\alpha$ . (c) Now suppose that $-1<x<0$ ; the number $t$ in Cauchy's form of the
remainder satisfies $-1<x_t\leq 0$ . Show that $$|x(1+t)^{\alpha-1}|\leq |x|M, \text{ where }
 M=\max(1,(1+x)^{\alpha-1}),$$ and $$\left | \frac{x-t}{1+t} \right |=|x|\left ( \frac{1-t/x}{1+t} \right

The issue is proving the last part, namely that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} R_{n,0}(x)=0$ . The solution manual has the following $$|R_{n,0}(0)|=\left | (n+1)\binom{\alpha}{n+1}x(1+t)^{\alpha-1} \left(\frac{x-t}{1+t}\right )^n \right |\tag{2}$$ $$\leq |x\alpha M|\cdot \left |\binom{\alpha-1}{n}x^n\right | \to 0

Then there exists a polynomial $q$ such that $$p(z)=(z-\lambda)q(z)$$ Evaluating $p(T)$ for $v$ we get $$p(T)v=((T-\lambda I)q(T))v=0$$ Given that $p$ is the polynomial of the smallest degree that satisfies $p(T)v=0$ , we have that $q(T)v\ne 0$ as $\deg q <\deg p$ . Then the above equation implies that $$(T-\lambda I)(q(T)v)=0$$ Because $q(T)v\ne 0$ , the above equation implies that $T-\lambda I$ is not injective.

Edit: A guiding motivation to my question relates to convergence discussed in a problem such as this: Dense subspace of the space of functions vanishing at infinity , where one acceptable approach is this . If I understood that answer correctly, we are showing that we can approximate a continuous function $\tilde{f}_k$ with a compact support in the infinity norm with a sequence of smooth compactly supported functions $g_{k,m}$ . We are taking it as granted that we can approximate a continuous function $f$ vanishing at infinity with such $\tilde{f}_k$ s, so in the end we are approximating $f$ with a sequence that itself is approximated with some other functions. Therefore once wrote out, the entire expression is something like $$\lim_{k\to \infty}||f - \tilde{f}_k||_\infty = \lim_{k\to \infty}||f - \lim_{m\to\infty}g_{k,m}||_\infty$$","['real-analysis', 'functions', 'uniform-convergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits']"

Their distance D is given as the length of the great circle arc length between their base points. How tall can a third elevation H (which is located on the arc between the basepoints of H1 and H2) at an arc length distance d from H1 become, before it obstructs G2 as seen from G1 or vice-versa? Assumptions made: Simplified the problem to two dimensions Heights are surface normals so they originate from, and intersect at, the circle center 0 < d < D No obstruction between G1 and G2 by the surface arc alone (no negative values for H) Drawing: This is how far I got before I realized that this approach must be somehow flawed: The central angle between H1 and H2 in radians is Ï = D / r The central angle between H1 and H in radians is Î² = d / r The radius is just a constant, thus we assume h1 = H1 + r h2 = H2 + r Distance G between summit points G1 and G2 with law of cosines: GÂ² = h1Â² + h2Â² - 2 * h1 * h2 * cos(Ï) Angle Î± as difference to 180Â° (Ï rad) of the angle between line g and H2 with law of sine Î± = Ï - Ï - arcsin((h1 * sin(Ï)) / G) Angle Î³ similarly from the triangle h1_h_g Î³ = Ï - Î± - Î² Missing length h (Hx+r) with law of sines: h = (h1 * sin(Î±)) / sin(Î³) Finally, subtract the constant radius H(d) = h(d) â r When I attempted to find a formula for the unknown height H as a function H = f(H1, H2, D, d), somewhere between steps 7 and 8, I must have painted myself in a corner.

4572929,"Random walk's leading, asymptotic haven't-returned-to-origin probability","In $1d$ and $2d$ , the probability that a simple random walk of length $n$ never returns to the origin asymptotes to $0$ as $n \to \infty$ . What is the leading asymptotic behavior of this decay at large $n$ ? A nice proof of recurrence in $1d$ and $2d$ is given here , where it's shown that the expected number of returns to the origin is, up to multiplicative constants, $\sim \sqrt{n}$ and $\sim \log(n)$ in $1d$ and $2d$ respectively. With an asymptotically infinite number of returns, the probability of returning must be $1$ . I'm tempted that these expected number of returns roughly point to the asymptotic probability of never returning to the origin in $n$ steps. That is, I anticipate that, up to multiplicative constants, the probability of never returning in a walk of $n$ steps in $1d$ and $2d$ is $\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ and $\sim \frac{1}{\log(n)}$ respectively. This is just a guess, but I show below the $1d$ guess is in fact correct. One can show that in $1d$ , the guess of $\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ up to multiplicative factors is correct for the probability of no returns in $n$ steps. One can find the entire distribution of the number of returns in time $2n$ in $1d$ ; the probability of $k$ returns is $\frac{\binom{2n-k}{n-k}}{2^{2n}}2^k$ . The probability of no returns in $2n$ steps is then $\frac{\binom{2n}{n}}{2^{2n}}$ (which is curiously the probability of returning on exactly the $2n$ th step); this probability goes as $\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n}}$ , confirming the guess. Thus, only the $2d$ case is left to investigate. At one point, I found a somewhat complicated recursion relation for the exact probability of never returning to the origin in $2n$ steps; I'm going to try to dig that up. However, I anticipate there are simpler methods of estimating the asymptotic probability of no return up to multiplicative constants that won't need to first pass through calculating the exact probability of never returning.","['random-walk', 'stochastic-processes', 'asymptotics', 'probability']"

\end{align*} for each point $y\in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ where $\varphi$ is differentiable. This looks scary, not simple really, but I gave it a shot before asking here. Let $\epsilon>0$ and let $y\in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ be such that $\nabla\varphi(y)$ exists. Then \begin{align*}
&\int_{\|x-y\|>\epsilon} \frac{\varphi(y)-\varphi(x)-\nabla\varphi(x)\cdot(y-x)}{(\|x-y\|^2+|\varphi(x)-\varphi(y)|^2)^{n/2}} f(x)  \, dx \\

\end{align*} With $y$ fixed, we define a function $g$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\setminus\{y\}$ by $$ g(x) = \frac{\varphi(x)-\varphi(y)}{\|x-y\|}. $$ Notice that for almost every $x\in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ we have $$ \partial _jg(x) = \frac{\partial_j\varphi(x)\|x-y\|-(\varphi(x)-\varphi(y))\frac{x_j-y_j}{\|x-y\|}}{\|x-y\|^2} = \frac{\partial_i\varphi(x)}{\|x-y\|} - (\varphi(x)-\varphi(y))\frac{x_j-y_j}{\|x-y\|^3} $$ which implies $$ \nabla g(x)\cdot(x-y) = \frac{\nabla\varphi(x)}{\|x-y\|}\cdot(x-y) - (\varphi(x)-\varphi(y))\frac{\|x-y\|^2}{\|x-y\|^3} = \frac{\nabla \varphi(x)(x-y) - \varphi(x) + \varphi(y)}{\|x-y\|}. $$ Hence $$ \nabla(\lambda\circ g)(x)\cdot(y-x) = \lambda'\left(\frac{\varphi(x)-\varphi(y)}{\|x-y\|}\right)\frac{\varphi(y)-\varphi(x)-\nabla\varphi(x)\cdot(y-x)}{\|x-y\|} $$ by Chain Rule.

i\pi{e^{-i\pi/(2\beta)}\over \sin\pi/(2\beta)}r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta) & = i\pi{\cos(\pi/2\beta)-i\sin(\pi/2\beta)\over\sin(\pi/2\beta)}r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)\\
& \overset{\mathrm{\operatorname{Re}}}{=} {-\pi r\over\sin(\pi/2\beta)}(\cos(\pi/2\beta)\sin\theta-\sin(\pi/2\beta)\cos\theta)\\
& = -\pi r{\sin(\theta-\pi/2\beta)\over\sin(\pi/2\beta)}\\
\end{align*} Note that $0<\theta<\pi/\beta$ so $$-{\pi\over 2}<-{\pi\over 2\beta}<\theta-{\pi\over 2\beta}<{\pi\over 2\beta}<{\pi\over 2}$$ and $\sin$ is strictly increasing function on $(-\pi/2,\pi/2)$ . This implies ${\sin(\theta-\pi/2\beta)\over\sin(\pi/2\beta)}<1$ . But this is not good. $$|F(z)| = |g(z)e^{\gamma z}|=|g(z)|e^{\operatorname{Re}(\gamma z)} = ce^{\pi r(1-\epsilon)},\quad\epsilon<1,$$ by the above argument. So we can't apply P-L principle. Even if I can apply, I'm not sure how the function is bounded on the boundary of the given sector. I'm stuck here. Could you help?","['complex-analysis', 'fourier-analysis']"

Define the category $\operatorname{Mod}^{a}_{R,I}$ of almost modules to be the Serre quotient of $\operatorname{Mod}_R$ by those $I$ -torsion $\operatorname{Mod}_{R/I}$ .

One notices two significant facts: There's an adjunction triple $j_!\dashv j^*\dashv j_*$ ; and The counit $f^* f_* \Rightarrow\operatorname{id}$ is an isomorphism; which induces one's wonder on if there's an open geometric embedding of (ringed) topoi for which objects of $\operatorname{Mod}_R$ and $\operatorname{Mod}^{a}_{R,I}$ are quasi-coherent modules. Also, recall (from SGA 4 or something, if someone can recall where it is please comment) that if one decomposes say a scheme $X$ into a pair of mutually complementary components $U,Z$ , one open, open closed, one has where the composition of any two consecutive morphisms in the same direction results in the zero functor. Surprisingly, one can ""decompose"" a topos over $\operatorname{Spec}R$ in a similar fashion: where the three functors on the last are given by the usual functors for change of rings . Moreover, Bhatt (pp. 21-22) and Gabber-Ramero (at p. 11) both mentioned that there supposes to exist an ""almost topos"" explaining these geometric phenomena; i.e., according to Bhatt, there supposed to be a ""open subscheme"" complementary to the closed $Z$ , the localization on which results in $\operatorname{Mod}_{R/I}$ .

Now let $Y$ be a irreducible hypersurface, then the section $s\in H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(Y))$ with $Z(s)=Y$ gives rise to a sheaf homomorphism $\mathcal{O}(X)\to \mathcal{O}(Y)$ and dually to $\mathcal{O}(-Y)\to \mathcal{O}_X$ .

My goal is not to find the exact position of the rope at every position, but to find the exact position of the added weight. As you can see in the image. The blue line from D to E is the rope, hanging without any attached weight with the length $l$ , the gray lines $i$ and $j$ represent a stage, where a weight is added at the point B assuming, that the rope is fully stretched, and the cable weight can be neglected. $l = i + j $ Now in the real world, the rope will not be fully stretched, if the weight is not big enough.

4573413,When can we continuously extend a linearly independent set to a basis?,"As we all know, any linearly independent subset of $\Bbb{R}^n$ (or vector spaces in general) can be extended to a (Hamel) basis. I'm wondering when this can be done continuously. To put it precisely: For which $m, n \in \Bbb{N}$ , where $m < n$ , does there exist a continuous map $\phi$ from the set of real $m \times n$ rectangular matrices of full row rank, to $\operatorname{GL}_n(\Bbb{R})$ , such that the submatrix made from the first $m$ rows of $\phi(A)$ is always $A$ ? My work so far: This is a generalisation of an older question that someone else asked, which I answered (twice). One of my answers shows that this cannot be done when $n$ is odd and $m = 1$ , using the hairy ball theorem. If such a map existed, then restriction to any row but the first would produce a continuous function mapping a non-zero vector to a linearly independent vector, which contradicts the hairy ball theorem. Of course, this doesn't work so well when $n$ is even. If $n$ is even, we can simply map $$(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{n-1}, v_n) \mapsto (v_2, -v_1, \ldots, v_n, -v_{n-1}),$$ i.e. swapping pairs of coordinates and negating one. As such, we always get a vector orthogonal to the original vector, and the map is clearly continuous. And, of course, one could simply pick other pairings as well, to get other vectors orthogonal to the original vector. However, there's no guarantee that we could build a whole basis from these maps! If $m = n - 1$ , then such a map exists. Indeed, all we need is a continuous map that takes $A$ and produces a vector linearly independent of all the rows. We can do that by generalising the cross product. We define: $$\psi(A) = \det\begin{pmatrix} \matrix{e_1 & e_2 & \ldots & e_n} \\ A \end{pmatrix},$$ where $e_1, \ldots, e_n$ are the standard basis vectors for $\Bbb{R}^n$ . We compute the ""determinant"" in much the same way as the usual mnemonic for the cross product: $$u \times v = \det \begin{pmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{pmatrix} = \det\pmatrix{u_2 & u_3 \\ v_2 & v_3}\hat{i} - \det\pmatrix{u_1 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_3}\hat{j} + \det\pmatrix{u_1 & u_2 \\ v_1 & v_2}\hat{k}.$$ This $\psi$ works in much the same way: taking $\psi(A) \cdot v$ for some $v \in \Bbb{R}^n$ , the result becomes $\det \pmatrix{v \\ A}$ , so if $v$ is already a row of $A$ , the result is $0$ . Thus, $\psi(A)$ is orthogonal to the rowspace of $A$ , and hence adding it as a row to $A$ will produce an invertible square matrix. Given the determinant is continuous, this is also a continuous choice. Searching yielded some other related posts , but both start with a one parameter family of vectors/rectnagular matrices, rather than considering a function on the full set of matrices. As such, they are asking something weaker. So, is there some characterisation of when such a map exists?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

4573615,Why do the ideas in Sheaf theory seem analogous to concepts of Manifold theory?,"I had this thought when studying ""Sheaf Theory through Examples"" by Daniel Rosiak. In the introduction, there is the exploration of how one can fit together data of different sensors observing the same space. Here is a picture from page-11, This system of mutually compatible local data assignments or âmeasurementsâ of the happenings on the spaceâwhere the various data assignments are, piece by piece, constrained by one another, and thereby patched together to supply an assignment over the entire space covered by the individual regionsâis, in essence, what constitutes our sheaf. Hmm this feels like the motif we have in Differential Geometry where we chart Manifolds. And now consider this section about the motivation behind the name of Sheaf: Here one thinks of various regions as the parcels of an overall space covered by those pieces, the collection of which then serves as a site where certain happenings are held to take place, and the abstract sensors capturing local snapshots or measurements of all that is going on in each parcel are then regarded as being collected together into âstalksâ of data, regarded as sitting over (or growing out of) the various parts of the ground space to which they are attached. A selection of a particular snapshot made from each of the intersecting regions) and collation (along unions of regions) of these sections captures how the various stalks of data are bound together. pg-12,13 And this seems like the concept of a bundle in Differential Geometry!

4573746,Boundary conditions for differential forms,"I am trying to understand differential forms on manifolds with boundaries, and I am a bit confused with the boundary conditions. For the following, let $(M,g_M)$ be a smooth Riemannian manifold with boundary $\partial M$ , define $\iota:\partial M\hookrightarrow M$ the inclusion of the boundary, and $\star$ is the Hodge-star with respect to $g_M$ . In [1] the authors define the space of $p$ -forms satisfying Dirichlet $(\Omega^p_{\text{D}}(M))$ and Neumann $(\Omega^p_{\text{N}}(M))$ boundary conditions. Their definition, towards the end of page 3, is equivalent to \begin{align}
\Omega^p_{\text{D}}(M) &:= \Big\lbrace\omega\in\Omega^p(M)\ \Big\vert\ \iota^*\omega = 0\Big\rbrace \\
\Omega^p_{\text{N}}(M) &:= \Big\lbrace\omega\in\Omega^p(M)\ \Big\vert\ \iota^*\star\omega = 0\Big\rbrace .\end{align} Verbosely, this defines Dirichlet $p$ -forms , as $p$ -forms that vanish upon eating vectors that are tangent to $\partial M$ , and Neumann $p$ -forms as $p$ -forms that vanish upon eating vectors normal to $\partial M$ . Had I not seen that definition I would have defined Dirichlet $p$ -forms in the same way, but the Neumann ones I would define by demanding that their derivative along the normal directions to $\partial M$ vanishes, in the same fashion as one does for functions. This translates to demanding that $$\iota^*\star\mathrm{d}\omega = 0.$$ My question is, is my definition of Neumann $p$ -forms the same as [1]'s ? I would expect not, as having vanishing $\star\mathrm{d}\omega$ is clearly less restrictive than having vanishing $\star\omega$ . But then, if not, why is their definition justified as Neumann boundary conditions ? I.e. how does it generalize the usual Neumann boundary conditions for functions in a natural way , and why is my naive definition wrong ? Moreover, a space that is important is the space $$\Omega^p_{\text{important}}(M) := \Big\lbrace\omega\in\Omega^p(M)\ \Big\vert\ \iota^*\mathrm{d}\omega = 0\Big\rbrace.$$ This space arises naturally in gauge theories as the space of gauge transformations that vanish on the boundary.

We donât know yet that $X$ belongs to the circumcircle of new triangle $\triangle {DES}$ but we can show this proving that the quadrilateral $DESX$ is cyclic. For this, already having the coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$ of the points $D,E,S,X$ we can verify the Ptolemy's theorem: $$\overline{DE}\cdot\overline{XS}+\overline{DX}\cdot\overline{ES}=\overline{DS}\cdot\overline{XE}$$ Another way is using the equation of the circumcircle of $\triangle {DES}$ $$\det\begin{vmatrix} x^2+y^2&x&y&1\\x_1^2+y_1^2&x_1&y_1&1\\ x_2^2+y_2^2&x_2&y_2&1\\ x_3^2+y_3^2&x_3&y_3&1\end{vmatrix}=0$$ and verify this equality  putting the fourth point $X$ instead of the generic $(x.y)$ .","['euclidean-geometry', 'proof-writing', 'circles', 'geometry', 'triangles']"
