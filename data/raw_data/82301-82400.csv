1073612,Derivative of a composition of function - nice proof,"Let's consider the well known ""fake"" proof below for the derivative of the composition of functions: Let $E,G$ be intervals of $\mathbb{R}$, let $F$ a subset of a normed vector space, let $f:E\rightarrow F,g:G\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be derivable functions on $E,G$. We suppose that $g(G)\subset E$. Let $a\in G$, we prove that $(f\circ g)'(a)=g'(a)\cdot f'(g(a))$ : $\displaystyle\dfrac{f\circ g(x)-f\circ g(a)}{x-a}=\dfrac{f\circ g(x)-f\circ g(a)}{g(x)-g(a)}\cdot\dfrac{g(x)-g(a)}{x-a}\to_{x\to a}(f\circ g)'(a)=g'(a)\cdot f'(g(a))$ This proof might be wrong because we can't assume that $g(x)-g(a)$ isn't $0$ n a neighborhood of $a$, but it nonetheless seems really nice, and the ""real"" proof I know isn't quite as nice. What's the ""nicest"" proof of this property that doesn't use ""too high level"" maths (understand : a proof on the same level as the one above) ?

1073736,Normal subgroups in groups of odd order,"I put the following question in my first-year algebra final this year: Suppose $G$ is a finite group of odd order and $N$ is a normal subgroup of order $5$. Show that $N\le Z(G)$. (By the way, this problem has been posed on this site before.) The proof that I guided them through goes like this: all the conjugacy classes of $G$ have odd order; since $N$ is normal, it is a union of conjugacy classes. The only possibilities are $3$, $1$, $1$, and five $1$'s. In either case, $N$ contains a nonidentity element whose conjugacy class consists only of itself, so it is in $Z(G)$; but that element generates $N\cong \mathbb{Z}/5$ and the result follows. So let $S(p)$ be the following statement: If $G$ is a finite group of odd order and $N$ is a normal subgroup of order $p$, then $N\le Z(G)$. For which (odd) $p$ does this hold? The argument above shows that it holds for $p=5$, but pretty clearly that proof will not work for $p>5$. In fact, if $p$ is any prime that is not a Fermat prime, $S(p)$ is false; a counterexample follows. 
Let $q$ be an odd prime dividing $p-1$, and consider the nonabelian group $G$ of order $pq$. It must have only one $p$-Sylow subgroup, since the number of such subgroups divides $q$ is and $\equiv 1\mod{p}$, so it is normal. So $G$ satisfies the conditions of the theorem. But the center of $G$ is trivial since otherwise $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic and thus $G$ would be abelian. This counterexample does not work when $q=2$ since the group of order $pq$ has even order. So my question is: does $S(p)$ hold when $p$ is a Fermat prime?","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'normal-subgroups']"

1073822,Hahn-Banach proof of existence of Haar measure,"I'm reading these notes of Terry Tao on the Haar measure (and related topics) on a locally compact Hausdorff group $G$. When he goes through the construction of the Haar measure, he does so by way of the Riesz representation theorem: if we had a linear, translation-invariant functional that satisfied a positivity property, by the Riesz representation theorem we'd get our measure. To that end he constructs, for any $f_1, \ldots, f_n \in \mathcal{C}_c(G)^+$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, a functional $I = I_{f_1, \ldots, f_n, \varepsilon}$ that is Homogeneous, ""Almost linear"" on the functions we've chosen in the sense that $|I(f_i + f_j) - I(f_i) - I(f_j)| < \varepsilon$, Translation-invariant, Nontrivial in the sense that it is nonzero on a predetermined nonzero $f_0$, and Uniformly bounded (in the $f_i$ and $\varepsilon$) by a sublinear functional $K$. He then sketches a couple different arguments to show the existence of the functional that we want from here. One of the arguments he talks about uses the Hahn-Banach theorem. The gist, he says, is If one lets $\mathcal C$ be the space of all tuples $(f_1,\ldots,f_n,\epsilon)$, one can use the Hahn-Banach theorem to construct a bounded real linear functional $\lambda: \ell^\infty({\mathcal C}) \rightarrow {\mathbb R}$ that maps the constant sequence $1$ to $1$. If one then applies this functional to the $I_{f_1,\ldots,f_n,\epsilon}$ one can obtain a functional $I$ with the required properties. Could someone explain this argument or point me to a source where it's worked out in more detail? I can't even get started on how this would go.","['measure-theory', 'harmonic-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"

1073961,Is There An Injective Cubic Polynomial $\mathbb Z^2 \rightarrow \mathbb Z$?,"Earlier, I was curious about whether a polynomial mapping $\mathbb Z^2\rightarrow\mathbb Z$ could be injective, and if so, what the minimum degree of such a polynomial could be. I've managed to construct such a quartic and rule out the existence of such a quadratic, but this leaves open the question of whether a cubic might exist. Equivalently my question is: Can a cubic polynomial of two variables with integer coefficients be injective? My intuition is that there probably is such a function since there is a quadratic bijection $\mathbb N^2\rightarrow\mathbb N$ so if we allow ourselves an extra ""degree"" to compensate for the transition from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb Z$, it seems like it ought to be sufficient. However, I have yet to come up with an example that I suspect of being injective nor any general method I might use to try to prove injectivity. The Part of This Post That Isn't A Question, But That Helps Motivate It Or Maybe Inspire Someone: So far I have determined that there is an injective quartic and there is not an injective quadratic. To construct the quartic which is injective, note that the map $f:\mathbb N^2 \rightarrow \mathbb N$ defined by $f(x,y)=(x+y)^2+y$ is injective and so is the map $g:\mathbb Z\rightarrow \mathbb N$ defined by $g(n)=2n^2-n$. Then, one can set
$$P(x,y)=f(g(x),g(y))$$
as an injective polynomial (of degree $4$) in the two variables. No quadratic polynomial may exist because any integer valued polynomial of degree two has a (non-zero) multiple expressible as:
$$P(x,y)=(ax+P_1(y))^2+P_2(y)$$
where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are polynomials with integer coefficients. Then, if we choose some $y_1$ and a $y_2$ such that $y_1\equiv y_2 \pmod{4aP_1(y_1)}$, we clearly have that $P_1(y_1)\equiv P_1(y_2)\pmod a$ and that $P_2(y_1)-P_2(y_2)=4aP_1(y_1)k$ for integer $k$. Then, we can choose two integers $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $$c_1^2-c_2^2=P_2(y_2) - P_2(y_1) $$
$$c_1\equiv c_2 \equiv P_1(y_1)\equiv P_1(y_2) \pmod a$$
In particular the values
$$c_1=P_1(y_1)+ak$$
$$c_2=P_1(y_1)-ak$$
satify the above. Then, choosing $$x_1=\frac{c_1-P_1(y_1)}{a}$$ $$x_2=\frac{c_2-P_1(y_2)}{a}$$ yields that $P(x_1,y_1)=P(x_2,y_2)$, since their difference is $(c_1^2-c_2^2) - (P_2(y_2)-P_2(y_1))$ which we chose the $c$'s to make $0$. I have no idea how to approach the cubic case. A Moderately Surprising Computational Result Using Mathematica, I determined that there is no polynomial of degree three with integer coefficients with absolute value $2$ or less which is injective over the domain $(\mathbb Z \cap [-2,2])^2$. This surprises me, but it such a small set of polynomials that it might not mean anything other than that we might expect large-ish coefficients if a suitable polynomial does exist. (It could also be indicative of the fact that no such polynomial exists). I would have checked a larger range, but my computer crashed. I also thought the solving the one-dimensional case completely might help, and can see that $$x\mapsto ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$$ is injective if and only if it cannot be written as $a(x-A)(x-B)\left(x-\frac{C}a\right)+k$ for integer $a,A,B,C,k$ - but this isn't super helpful, far as I can tell. However, the statement $f(x,y)$ is injective is equivalent to asserting that $t\mapsto f(m_1t + b_1,m_2t+b_2)$ is injective for all $m_1,b_1,m_2,b_2\in\mathbb Z$ with not both $m$ equalling $0$ - so this could be used to eliminate some cases, if nothing else.","['polynomials', 'number-theory']"

1074166,Prove that $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are not isomorphic as groups [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Prove that the additive groups $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are not isomorphic. (4 answers) Closed 6 years ago . I'm working on the following problem: Prove that $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are not isomorphic as groups. Here is my attempt at a solution: If $\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Q}$, then there must exist a bijective homomorphism $\varphi: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q}$. Consider $\varphi(x) = x$. Clearly, this is a homomorphism as it is the identity map. Moreover, it is also clearly injective. However, it fails to be surjective since there exist elements of $\mathbb{Q}$ that are not mapped to by $\varphi$ (like $3/2$ or $1/4$). Hence, since $\varphi$ is an injective homomorphism, but not surjective, we see that there cannot exist a bijection between $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, $\mathbb{Z} \not \cong \mathbb{Q}$. Could anyone critique this solution? Am I on the right path?","['abstract-algebra', 'solution-verification']"

1074778,General form for the rotation of a function.,"When rotating linear functions, I would approach the task geometrically (find invariant point etc.), yet I tried using a matrix which worked nicely. This was what I did to rotate $y=2x+1$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ about the origin. $$\begin{pmatrix}

 \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}

\begin{pmatrix}
x\\ 2x+1\end{pmatrix}

\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}
1-x\\ 3x+1

When I try to generalize this, I obtain: $$x'=x\cos(\theta )-y\sin(\theta)\; ,\; y'=x\cos(\theta )+y\sin(\theta).$$ The problem is I can only seem to eliminate one of either $x$ or $y$ . Is it possible to eliminate both? Other related questions I have are: Can you use matrices to rotate a function around an arbitrary point, not the origin? Can this concept by applied to 3-dimensions?
