735880,When is the composition of a function with Dirac delta a valid distribution?,"If $f:\mathbb{R}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is nicely behaved, one can view $\delta(f)$ as a distribution (linear functional on $C^{\infty}_c(\mathbb{R}^k)$)- but what if you don't have nicely behaved functions? Is $\delta(xy)$ a valid distribution on $\mathbb{R}^2$? Is it consistent to define $\int f(x,y)\delta(xy)dxdy = \int f(x,0)dx + \int f(0,y)dy$? My motivation is a slightly more sophisticated example: For spinor-helicity variables $\lambda_i,\tilde{\lambda}_i$, $i = 1,2,3$, which are two-component complex vectors, conservation of momentum is enforced by: $$\delta^{2 \times 2}(\lambda_1\tilde{\lambda}_1^{T} + \lambda_2\tilde{\lambda}_2^{T} + \lambda_3\tilde{\lambda}_3^{T})$$ (The expression inside is a $2 \times 2$ matrix with complex entries). However there is a similar 'kink' in this set, comparable to the origin in $xy = 0$ (it occurs when all the $\lambda_i$ are parallel and all the $\tilde{\lambda}_i$ are parallel). Is this a well-defined distribution?","['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'distribution-theory']"

735916,What's the role of $h(x)$ (base measure) in the definition of exponential family,"While the correct definition of exponential family is $$
f_X(x\mid\theta) = h(x) \exp \left (\eta(\theta) \cdot T(x) -A(\theta)\right ),
$$ it seems that in many materials I read, they don't pay much attention to $h(x)$. Sometimes, authors just drop this term. Can somebody tell me more about the meaning of this $h(x)$ term? The most detailed description about this term I've found is ""simply reflects the underlying measure w.r.t. which $p(x\mid\theta)$ is a density."" (See http://stat-www.berkeley.edu/pub/users/mjwain/Fall2012_Stat241a/reader_ch8.pdf ). Also, some people call it ""base measure"". I kind of understand that $h(x)$ may not be important because it's trivial in most cases (1 or a constant like $1/\sqrt{2\pi}$), but for some distributions, e.g. Poisson, this term is nontrivial ($1/x!$), and it moderates the exponential term so greatly. My understanding of this term is 1) it assigns a base probability to each element in the space of $x$, and the exponential term modifies this base probability. 2) it's here so that we don't get unbounded log-partition function $A(\theta)$, in cases like Poisson. Can anybody tell me more about this $h(x)$, and any comment on my understanding of it is welcomed.",['probability']

736004,How do I measure the goodness of cosine similarity scores across different vector spaces?,"I am a computer scientist working on a problem that requires some statistical measures, though  (not being very well versed in statistics) I am not quite sure what statistics to use. Overview: I have a set of questions (from StackExchange sites, of course) and with this data, I am exploring algorithms that will find similar questions to one I provide. Yes, StackExchange itself already performs this function, as do many other Q&A sites. What I am trying to do is analyze the methods and algorithms that people employ to accomplish this task to see which methods perform best. My problem is finding appropriate statistical measures to quantitatively determine ""which methods perform best."" The Data: I have a set of StackExchange questions, each of which is saved like this: {'questionID':""..."", 'questionText':""...""} . For each question, I have a set of other questions either linked to it or from it. It is common practice for question answer-ers on StackExchange sites to add links to other similar posts in their answers, i.e. ""Have you read this post [insert link to post here] by so-and-so? They're solving a similar problem..."" I am considering these linked questions to be 'similar' to one another. More concretely, let's say we have question A .
Question A has a collection of linked questions {B, C, D} . So A_linked = {B, C, D} .
My intuition tells me that the transitive property does not apply here. That is, just because A is similar to B , and A is similar to C , I cannot confirm that B is similar to C . (Or can I?)
However, I can confidently say that if A is similar to B , then B is similar to A . So, to simplify these relationships, I will create a set of similar pairs: {A, B}, {A, C}, {A, D} These pairs will serve as a ground truth of sorts. These are questions we know are similar to one another, so their similarity confidence values equals 1. So similarityConfidence({A,B}) = 1 Something to note about this set-up is that we know only a few similar questions for each question in our dataset. What we don't know is whether some other question E is also similar to A . It might be similar, it might not be similar, we don't know. So our 'ground truth' is really only some of the truth. The algorithm: A simplified pseudocode version of the algorithm is this: for q in questions: #remember q = {'questionID':""..."", 'questionText':""...""}
     similarities = {} # will hold a mapping from questionID to similarity to q
     q_Vector = vectorize(q) # create a vector from question text (each word is a dimension, value is unimportant)
     for o in questions: #such that q!=o
          o_Vector = vectorize(o)
          similarities[o['questionID']] = cosineSimilarity(q_Vector,o_Vector) # values will be in the range of 1.0=identical to 0.0=not similar at all
     #now what??? So now I have a complete mapping of cosine similarity scores between q and every other question in my dataset. My ultimate goal is to run this code for many variations of the vectorize() function (each of which will return a slightly different vector) and determine which variation performs best in terms of cosine scores. The Problem: So here lies my question. Now what? How do I quantitatively measure how good these cosine scores are? These are some ideas of measurements I've brainstormed (though I feel like they're unrefined, incomplete): Some sort of error function similar to Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). So for each document in the ground-truth similarities list, accumulate the squared error (with error roughly defined as 1-similarities[questionID] ). We would then divide that accumulation by the total number of similar pairs *2 (since we will consider a->b as well as b->a ). Finally, we'd take the square root of this error. This requires some thought, since these values may need to be normalized. Though all variations of vectorize() will produce cosine scores in the range of 0 to 1, the cosine scores from two vectorize() functions may not compare to one another. vectorize_1() might have generally high cosine scores for each question, so a score of .5 might be a very low score. Alternatively, vectorize_2() might have generally low cosine scores for each question, so a .5 might be a very high score. I need to account for this variation somehow. Also, I proposed an error function of 1-similarities[questionID] . I chose 1 because we know that the two questions are similar, therefore our similarity confidence is 1. However, a cosine similarity score of 1 means the two questions are identical. We are not claiming that our 'linked' questions are identical, merely that they are similar. Is this an issue? We can perform recall (number of similar documents returned/number of similar documents), so long as we set a threshold for which questions we return as 'similar' and which we do not. Although, for the reasons mentioned above, this shouldn't be a predefined threshold like similarity[documentID]>75 because each vectorize() function may return different values. We could do a recall @ k , where we only analyze the top k posts. This could be problematic though, because we don't have the full ground truth. If we set k=5 , and only 1 document ( B ) of the 3 documents we knew to be relevant ( {B,C,D} ) were in the top 5, we do not know whether the other 4 top documents are actually equally or more similar, but no one linked them. Do you have any other ideas? How can I quantitatively measure which vectorize() function performs best?","['statistics', 'data-mining', 'algorithms']"

736117,Infinite Series with factorial,"I'm having trouble manipulating the function of this series which has factorials to show that it converges or diverges using the ratio test. The series is $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{(k!)^2}{(2k)!}$.  The following are the steps I used, but I made a mistake expanding/canceling the factorial portion somewhere which I can't figure out.. First write the limit using ratio test:
$$\lim\limits_{k\to\infty}\dfrac{((k+1)!)^2}{(2k+2)!}\cdot\dfrac{(2k)!}{(k!)^2}$$
Expand to cancel factorials:
$$\lim\limits_{k\to\infty}\dfrac{((k+1)(k!))^2}{(2k+2)(2k+1){(2k)}!}\cdot\dfrac{(2k)!}{(k!)^2}$$ Then after canceling I got: $$\lim\limits_{k\to\infty}\dfrac{(k+1)^2}{(2k+2)(2k+1)}$$ This would result in polynomials of the same degree in the numerator and denominator, and the coefficients of the $k^2$ term would be 1 and 4, so I said the series converges because $\dfrac{1}{4} < 1$ which means the series converges by the ratio test.

736152,Coefficients of the Weierstrass $\wp$'s Laurent expansion,"I am trying to study the Weierstrass $\wp$ function using a combination of texts from Alfors; Cartan; Freitag and Busam; and Siegel. But I am having some trouble because I would like to try to avoid starting from the Ansatz equation approach given in most of the texts. I would like to derive the coefficients of $\wp$'s Laurent expansion by considering the differential equation $$(\wp^{\prime})^{2}=4\wp^{3} -g_{2}\wp(w) - g_{3}.\qquad (1)$$ By writing 
$$\wp = \sum_{k=-N}^{\infty}a_{k}\omega^{k}\qquad (2)$$ and substituting (2) into (1) to get the form $$\wp(\omega) = \frac{1}{\omega^{2}} + a_{2}\omega^{2} + a_{4}\omega^{4} + \dots\qquad (3)$$ where I found $(3)$ in Freitag and Busam's Complex Analysis . Intuition I gained from studying the Ansatz equation approach suggests this must be true, but even considering this for small $N$, the combination of the derivative (I am assuming I can safely differentiate term wise) and the cubic are creating multinomial expansions that seem to have no hope of cancellation when powers of $\omega$ are compared on the left and the right hand side. Using achille hue's suggestion and some additional work, I was able to reduce the problem down to $$\wp(\omega) = \frac{1}{\omega^{2}} + a_{1}w^{2} + a_{2}w^{4} + \dots$$ Further substitution into the differential equation $$\wp^{\prime\prime}(\omega) = 6(\wp(\omega))^{2} - \frac{g_{2}}{2}$$
yields $$\frac{6}{\omega^{4}} +2b_{1} + \sum_{k=2}^{\infty}(2k)(2k-1)b_{k}\omega^{2k} = 6\left[ \frac{1}{\omega^{2}}  + b_{1}\omega^{2} + \sum_{k=2}^{\infty}b_{k}\omega^{2k}\right]^{2} - \frac{g_{2}}{2}.$$ and the article here from mathworld.wolfram mentions the existence of a recurrence relation closed form solution given by equation (7).

736764,"Involutions, RSK and Young Tableaux","Let $S_n$ be the symmetric group on $n$ elements. The Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) correspondence sends a permutation $\pi\in S_n$ to a pair of Standard Young Tableaux $(P,Q)$ with equal shapes $\mbox{sh}(P)=\mbox{sh}(Q)=\lambda$, where $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_r)$ and $\lambda_1\geq\lambda_2\geq\cdots\geq \lambda_r$. A well known fact is that if $\pi$ is an involution ($\pi^2=1$) then $P=Q$. A nice way to think about involutions is by their cycle types: they must have only fixed points or 2-cycles. I have a few questions on what is known in this area. 1) Suppose we fix a shape $\lambda$. Is anything known about the class of involutions whose RSK correspondence gives tableaux of shape $\lambda$? Is there anything particularly special about them? For general permutations $\pi$, this question is essentially intractable but, my hope is for involutions there is something extra special that can be said. The only things that I can think of are stuff like Greene's theorem on how the lengths of each row/column relate to the longest increasing/decreasing subsequences of the permutation. As well, the number of odd-length columns equals the number of fixed points. This unfortunately doesn't say much about the involutions involved. 2) Are there any other (not necessarily directly related to RSK) known bijections between involutions and Standard Young Tableaux? In particular, are these other bijections more amenable to answering questions similar to (1) about which subset of involutions maps to a specific shape $\lambda$?","['young-tableaux', 'permutations', 'representation-theory', 'combinatorics']"

737274,A solvable group with composition series is finite,I want to prove the following. A solvable group G with composition series is finite From the definition of a solvable group I know there exists a normal series: $\lbrace 1 \rbrace \le G_{n} \leq G_{2} \leq \dots \leq G_{0} = G$ Where each factor is abelian. If this is a composition series I can conclude that each factor is simple and thus simple and abelian which means they must be of the form $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ for some prime $p$. From this I can see how we conclude that $G$ must be finite. So I only need to consider the case when this series is not the composition series and here I'm stuck. Maybe I'm making some things more complicated. I would appreciate your help/hints.,['group-theory']
737302,"Plotting polar equations of circles not centered at (0, 0)","Good afternoon guys! I'm fairly new to polar coordinates and polar equations, so bear with me please. I understand the equation of a circle with radius $a$ centered at the polar coordinate $(r_0, \phi)$ is as follows: $$
r = r_0cos(\theta-\phi)+\sqrt{a^2-r_0^2sin^2(\theta-\phi)}
$$ Where $(r, \theta)$ represents any arbitrary point on the circle. I understand how to derive this equation from Cartesian coordinates as well, and I can recognize how the equation works with relative ease. My problem comes when I try to graph the circle. How would one go about doing it? Take the following example: Let $r_0=5$, $a=2$, and $\phi=tan(3/4)$, meaning we are representing a circle with radius $2$ centered at the Cartesian coordinate $(4, 3)$. If we sub in the values, we get: $$
r = 5cos(\theta-tan(3/4))+\sqrt{4-25sin^2(\theta-tan(3/4))}
$$ Now if the circle was centered at $(0, 0)$, to plot such a thing we could simply just start at $\theta=0$ and work our way up to $\theta=2\pi$, subbing in the values as we go and solving for the new radius (which would always be $a$). But since this circle isn't centered at $(0, 0)$, it means that certain lines with angle $\theta$ will never intersect the circle. In this case, if we subbed in $\theta=0$, then $\sqrt{4-25sin^2(\theta-tan(3/4))}$ would evaluate to a complex number, since the line at angle $\theta=0$ does not intersect the circle described by the equation above. Obviously this isn't something we want. So where do you start plotting such an equation? How do you know which angles to use and which angles to avoid in order to get the points on the circle?","['geometry', 'polar-coordinates']"

737612,How to understand structure groups?,"I'm studying fiber bundles and I'm somewhat confused on how Structure Groups appears. The definition of fiber bundle I have is the following: A bundle is a tuple $(E,B,\pi)$ where $E,B$ are topological spaces and $\pi: E\to B$ is a continuous surjection. A fiber bundle is a tuple $(E,B,\pi,F)$ where $(E,B,\pi)$ is a bundle and $F$ is a topological space such that there's an open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ of $B$ together with homeomorphisms $\varphi_\alpha : \pi^{-1}(U_\alpha)\to U_\alpha\times F$ with the property that if $\pi_1 : U_\alpha\times F\to U_\alpha$ is the projection onto the first factor, then $\pi_1\circ\varphi_\alpha = \pi$ . That is perfectly fine, but then one notices the following: if $\varphi_\alpha(p) = (\pi(p), \tilde{\varphi}_\alpha(p))$ then $\tilde{\varphi}_\alpha : \pi^{-1}(U_\alpha)\to F$ . Then for each $p \in U_\alpha$ we can consider $\tilde{\varphi}_{\alpha, p} = \tilde{\varphi}_\alpha |\pi^{-1}(p)$ and show that this mapping is an homeomorphism from $\pi^{-1}(p)$ onto $F$ . If $U_\alpha\cap U_\beta$ is then non-empty, we have $\varphi_\alpha$ and $\varphi_\beta$ , and hence for each $p\in U_\alpha\cap U_\beta$ two homeomorphism $\tilde{\varphi}_{\alpha, p}, \tilde{\varphi}_{\beta, p} : \pi^{-1}(p)\to F$ and thus we can form the mapping $$g_{\alpha\beta}(p) = \tilde{\varphi}_{\alpha, p}\circ \tilde{\varphi}_{\beta, p}$$ which is a homeomorphism of $F$ . That is all fine, but the book I'm reading says these maps are really important, in the sense that they give the structure of the fiber bundle, like the twisting of Möebius band. That's the first problem: how can I see these maps really give the structure of the fiber bundle? I really can't realize the importance of those changes of trivialization. Second, the book introduces in a little confusing way the ""Structure Group"". At first it seems that when we want to show something is a bundle, the Structure Group must come with it. Like, $TM$ the fiber bundle of $M$ comes with $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ , but then the book talks in a way that it seems that the Structure Group is really determined by those transition functions only. The book even says: ""if the structure group has one element the fiber bundle is trivial"". That's fine, but then it doesn't make sense anymore to pick something like $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ since the group will come from the trivializations themselves. So my questions really are: What is the real importance of the transition functions? How to understand them intuitively? What really is the structure group? What it is really meant to represent and where does it really comes from? Thanks very much in advance.","['general-topology', 'fiber-bundles', 'differential-geometry', 'definition']"

737886,Writing square root of square-free numbers as sum of square roots.,"Some days ago i came across a question about writing $\sqrt {2001}$ as sum of two other square roots. I managed to prove that this is not possible unless one of them is zero and the other one is $2001$. The proof was as following: $\sqrt{2001}=\sqrt a+\sqrt b$, $\sqrt{2001}-\sqrt a=\sqrt b$ so $2001+a-2\sqrt{2001a}=b$. This shows that $2\sqrt{2001a}$ is an integer so $2001*a$ is a perfect square. We also know that $2001=3*23*29$ which is a square-free number. so $a$ must divide all of $3,23,29$ which means $a\geq2001$ so$\sqrt a\geq\sqrt{2001}$ and $\sqrt{b}\leq 0$ which means $b=0$. With exact method we can prove that $\sqrt{s}=\sqrt a+\sqrt b$ does not have any natural solutions with $s$ being a square-free number. Then I tried to generalize the proof for $3$ or more square roots but i failed. The only thing I always get is $\sqrt {ab}+\sqrt {bc}+\sqrt {ac}$ is an integer which does not help at all. For what numbers can we write the square root of a square-free number as sum of three or more non-zero square roots? I would appreciate any help.","['elementary-number-theory', 'radicals', 'algebra-precalculus']"

where $\mu(n)$ is the Möbius function. What I know is that $\displaystyle\Phi_n=\prod_{d|n} (X^{\frac{n}{d}}-1)^{\mu(d)}$.","['number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials', 'cyclotomic-polynomials', 'mobius-function']"
737928,The formalism behind integration by substitution,"When you are doing an integration by substitution you do the following working.
$$\begin{align*}
u&=f(x)\\
\Rightarrow\frac{du}{dx}&=f^{\prime}(x)\\
\Rightarrow du&=f^{\prime}(x)dx&(1)\\
\Rightarrow dx&=\frac{du}{f^{\prime}(x)}\\
\end{align*}$$ My question is: what on earth is going on at line $(1)$?!? This has been bugging me for, like, forever! You see, when I was taught this in my undergrad I was told something along the lines of the following: You just treat $\frac{du}{dx}$ like a fraction. Similarly, when you are doing the chain rule $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{dv}\times\frac{dv}{dx}$ you ""cancel"" the $dv$ terms. They are just like fractions. However, never, ever say this to a pure mathematician. Now, I am a pure mathematician. And quite frankly I don't care if people think of these as fractions or not. I know that they are not fractions (but rather is the limit of the difference fractions as the difference tends to zero). But I figure I should start caring now...So, more precisely, $\frac{du}{dx}$ has a meaning, but so far as I know $du$ and $dx$ do not have a meaning. Therefore, why can we treat $\frac{du}{dx}$ as a fraction when we are doing integration by substitution? What is actually going on at line $(1)$?","['notation', 'calculus', 'integration']"
