1788967,Mario Party 3 Mini-game Probability Question,"I have a question about a mini-game in Mario Party 3. I have extracted the mathematical information from the game below. Setup : Four players $A,B,C$, and $D$ line up in some order. There are $12$ cards which are face-down on a table in front of the first person in line. The cards are as follows: $6$ blue cards, $4$ green cards, and $2$ gray cards. Gameplay : The players take turns, based on their order in line, flipping over a card. If the card is blue, the player is safe and goes to the back of the line and the card is discarded. If the card is green, the player is out, removed, and the green card is discarded. If the card is gray, the player remains in the game and the order of the remaining players (including the player that drew the gray card) in the line is randomly shuffled; the gray card is discarded. The game ends when there is only one person left. My Question : Let's say the initial order of the line-up is $A, B, C, D$. I was wondering if there was a way to determine which player has the best, second best, third best, and worst chance of winning the game. I'm not sure if this is possible since the two gray cards shuffle the line-up when they are flipped over. I would also be interested in solutions of the simplified version of the game with $10$ cards ($6$ blue and $4$ green) in which the gray cards have been removed.

1788969,Subset of separable metric space can have at most a countable amount of isolated points,"Let $(X,d)$ be a separable metric space. Prove that every subset $Y \subset X$ can have at most a countable amount of isolated points. Attempt at proof: Let $Y$ be an arbitrary (non-empty) subset of $X$. Since $(X,d)$ is separable, there exists a countable dense subset $A \subset X$ such that $\overline{A} = X$. Since $A$ is dense in $X$, we have that $A \cap Y \neq \emptyset.$ For every isolated point $x \in A \cap Y$ there exists then a $\delta_x > 0$ such that $B(x,\delta_x) \cap Y = \left\{x\right\}$. Now I don't know how to prove the isolated points are countable. Any help?","['general-topology', 'real-analysis', 'metric-spaces', 'separable-spaces']"

1789069,Connected components functor for free coproduct cocompletions,"Any extensive category admits a notion of connected object and hence a disconnected object. However, not all disconnected objects are presentable as disjoint unions of connected objects. Among extensive categories, the (free) coproduct cocompletions are characterized as those for which every object admits a presentation as a disjoint union of connected objects. Since presentation by coproduct is unique up to isomorphism in extensive categories, this suggests a notion of connected components of an object, defined up to isomorphism. Can 'connected components' be made functorial? I am not even sure what its codomain would be; $\pi_0:\mathsf{Fam}(\mathsf A)\longrightarrow \mathsf{Fam}(\mathsf A)$ does not look right to me. An example I have in mind is affine schemes. Here, disconnectedness is measured by the presence of idempotents, so we can (and do) define a functor from all affine schemes into boolean algebras (of the idempotents of their function rings). However, some affine schemes are totally disconnected, so their connected components can not reconstruct them. This example shows a case in which connected components are always defined (like the category of topological spaces), but can't always reconstruct the original object. So should a connected components functor really be defined on any extensive category? Will it be part of an adjunction? Added. I'm having trouble with understanding the unit. Here's the calculation verifying the adjunction $\pi_0\dashv H$ where $H$ is the copower functor.
$$\begin{aligned}\mathsf{Hom}_{\mathsf{C}}\left(X,HA\right) & \cong\mathsf{Hom}_{\mathsf{C}}\left(\coprod_{i\in\Pi_{0}(X)}C_{i},HA\right)\cong\prod_{i\in\Pi_{0}(X)}\mathsf{Hom}_{\mathsf{C}}\left(C_{i},HA\right)\\
 & \cong\prod_{i\in\Pi_{0}(X)}\mathsf{Hom}_{\mathsf{C}}\left(C_{i},\coprod_{A}{\bf 1}\right)\cong\prod_{i\in\Pi_{0}(X)}\left(\coprod_{A}\mathsf{Hom}_{\mathsf{C}}(C_{i},{\bf 1})\right)\\
 & \cong\prod_{i\in\Pi_{0}(X)}\mathsf{Hom}_{\mathsf{Set}}({\bf 1},A)\cong\mathsf{Hom}_{\mathsf{Set}}\left(\coprod_{i\in\Pi_{0}(X)}{\bf 1},A\right)\\
 & \cong\mathsf{Hom}_{\mathsf{Set}}(\Pi_{0}(X),A)
\end{aligned}$$ The key isomorphism seems to be $$\coprod_A\mathsf{Hom}_\mathsf{C}(C_i,\mathbf{1})\cong\mathsf{Hom}_\mathsf{Set}(\mathbf 1,A)$$
which identifies the images individual connected components along $f:\pi_0X\rightarrow A$ with the constant maps associated to each connected component. The reverse isomorphism $\Phi:\mathsf{Hom}_{\mathsf{Set}}(\Pi_{0}(X),A)\cong \mathsf{Hom}_{\mathsf{C}}\left(X,HA\right)$ is defined analogously, and the unit is defined by the corresponding $\eta _X=\Phi(1_{\pi_0X})$. I just don't understand how to think of $\eta$ outside of the spatial case. Is there some mantra for what it does, or is the formalism all there is to it, with intuition behind available in the spatial case alone?","['category-theory', 'adjoint-functors', 'algebraic-geometry', 'connectedness']"

1789111,Progressive Dice Game,"$(2019.)$ Edit: Rewriting the question to make it clear. The progressive dice game At the start, you have a fair, regular six sided dice $D=(1,2,3,4,5,6)$ . The game is played for $n$ turns. Each turn you make a roll, which will be $r\in D$ . Then to complete the turn, you make one of the following choices: Bank the rolled number: You gain $r$ points (score). Invest in (upgrade) the dice ""evenly"" : If $r\lt 6$ , choose $r$ sides and increase them by $1$ each. If $r\ge 6$ , that is, $r=6k+k_0,k_0\lt 6$ , then increase each of the six sides by $k$ , and then choose $k_0$ sides and increase them by $1$ each. Reroll the dice, effectively restarting this turn. But before rerolling, you must apply the penalty to the dice: ""Evenly"" downgrade the dice: If $S_0$ is the number of sides $\gt 0$ on the dice, then: If $r\lt S_0$ , choose $r$ sides and decrease them by $1$ each. If $r\ge S_0$ , that is, $r=S_0k+k_0,k_0\lt S_0$ , then decrease each of the $S_0$ sides by $k$ , and then choose $k_0$ sides and decrease them by $1$ each. What is the optimal way to play to maximize your expected score at the end of the game? If the dice was allowed to be upgraded/downgraded arbitrarily (not ""evenly""), then one could downgrade the first five sides until they reach $0$ . These sides now act as free rerolls. Then, keep investing the remaining points into the sixth side, which is now guaranteed to be rolled on each turn, after some amount of rerolls of that turn. Finally, bank that sixth rolled side in the last couple turns to maximize the expected value of the score. But since we must upgrade/downgrade evenly, I'm not sure what is the optimal strategy. If we ignore the ""reroll"" move: If you upgrade the first $t$ turns, then bank the rest of the turns, you will expect the following amount of points on average: $$ f(t) = 3.5\times\left(\frac{7}{6}\right)^{t}\times(n-t)$$ Which boils down to, that if you want to maximize your expected score, you should upgrade until the last $6$ (or $7$ ) turns and then bank those turns. But this approach completely ignores the third action; the rerolls. Can we do better than this strategy, if we use the rerolls somehow? Rerolls? I haven't worked out the strategy if the rerolls are considered. A reroll will on average decrease the average value of the dice, and allow you to either improve or worsen your current turn, with equal probability on average? But there seem to be exceptions? For example, rerolling a $1$ seems useful if used early (as later, if we had upgraded a lot, all sides will be much greater than $1$ ). Simply downgrade the rolled $1$ side when downgrading (rerolling). If you roll that side again, it will be $0$ , and this allows you to again reroll the dice for free (downgrading $0$ points is a free reroll). Which means, choosing to downgrade when you roll a $1$ , can only increase your expected score in that turn. But there is still a (small?) drawback: Lets say some other side is a number $\ge 6$ . Then when upgrading later, you will have to put back at least one of those upgrade points into that downgraded $0$ side. Seems to me that rerolls will decrease the expected score on average
  (as they decrease the average value of the dice), so it is always
  better not to use them (except in that early scenario of the game, if $n$ is small)? Is this true? For example, for small $n$ , rerolls can be useful to force larger values. For $n=1$ specifically, it seems we can always force the first turn (the only turn) to end up banking a $6$ , the maximal possible score for $n=1$ , by rerolling and downgrading strategically the rest of the sides if $6$ was not rolled. But for large $n$ , the rerolls seem to lower the average expected score at the end, if used anytime in previous turns, as larger upgrades will need to replenish those downgraded points inevetably at some point, as they are carried out ""evenly"".","['game-theory', 'recreational-mathematics', 'probability', 'dice']"

$$ \exp\left(-\sum_{m\geq 1}\frac{p_m}{m}x^m\right) = \sum_{r\geq 0}(-1)^r e_r\,x^r$$

I think that we could possibly have $x\in \bar M$ and not $x\in M$ if there are an infinite number of non-zero scalars in $\{\alpha_k\}$, but before pursuing this I'd like to confirm whether $x$ will always just be an element of the span or not. EDIT: The two excellent answers below indicate to me that I have asked a question with answers possibly above my needs and current ability to understand. So to hopefully aid answering I'd like to give more context to my question. The question stems from a problem in Kreyszig's introductory functional analysis textbook, which, in the terminology developed above, asks: ""For any $x\in H$ show that $x\in \bar M$ if $x=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\langle x,e_k\rangle e_k$"". If the solution to this problem is different from the general question I asked please explain why and if possible give a hint for a possible proof I could use. I should also add that I am not at all familiar with topology as that course follows functional analysis in my university.","['functional-analysis', 'fourier-series', 'sequences-and-series']"

Show that $T/I\cong \mathbb{Z}_p$. Basically I need a surjective homomorphism from $T$ to $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with kernel $I$.

I know how to show that it is not norm-Euclidean, but it still could be Euclidean with a different function. The only way I know how to prove that a domain is not Euclidean is by using Motzkin's theorem: Theorem. A domain $D$ is Euclidean if and only if
  $\bigcap\limits_{i\in\mathbb{N}} P_0^{(i)} = \emptyset$. Here $P_0^{(0)} = P_0 := D\setminus\{0\}$ and we define recursively $P^{(i+1)}_0 := (P^{(i)}_0)'$ for all $i\in\mathbb{N}$, where for any $P\subseteq D$ the derived set $P'$ of $P$ is given by $P' := \{b\in P\, ;\, \exists a\in D\text{ such that }a+bD\subseteq P\}$. It works well for imaginary quadratic fields since they have only $1$ and $-1$ as units: Considering $K := \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ for $d < -11$ it can be shown that $P_0^{(i)} = A\setminus\{0, 1, -1\}$ for all integers $i\ge 1$, where $A$ is the ring of integers of $K$, hence by Motzkin theorem $K$ is not Euclidean.

Otherwise, let $\operatorname{Perm} H$ be the group of all permutations of the set $H$ , choose three different cosets $M$ , $Mu$ and $Mv$ of $M$ , define $\sigma\in \operatorname{Perm} H$ by $\sigma(xu)=xv$ , $\sigma(xv)=xu$ for $x\in M$ , and $\sigma$ otherwise the identity.

In other words, $\varphi$ is surjective. What am I missing here?  And if this is correct, what is Maclane's intention in proving the result in a less trivial manner?

I find this quite surprising, and would like to get to the bottom of things. Essentially, a rod (black line in animation) is anchored to two sliders (in blue): One at an end, the other somewhere in the middle. The non-anchored end (black square) can move freely, tracing an ellipse, as the sliders move along perpendicular axes -- the end anchor along the minor axis, the interior anchor the major axis. If you're willing to set up shop and start giving coordinates to the end that draws the ellipse (letting $a$ be the length of the rod, $b$ the distance from interior anchor to free end), it's not too hard to see that \begin{align*}
x &= a \cos \theta \\
y &= b\sin \theta,
\end{align*} and so in turn $$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1,$$ verifying the motion is indeed elliptical. But I find this pretty unsatisfactory; until introducing coordinates, I had no reason to believe that an ellipse should be created. Even having introduced coordinates and verifying, I still find it very mysterious. What property of an ellipse am I missing that makes this device ""obviously"" draw an ellipse? To put it another way: How could someone knowing only classical geometry (i.e., someone without coordinate geometry) have designed this machine to draw an ellipse? I am assuming that, being named after Archimedes, the device at least predates Descartes and thus coordinate geometry. Although, the runners do form something of a coordinate axis... Compare this mysterious motion with the much more widely known method of putting pushpins down and tying one end of a string to each, pulling the string taut. This method is more apparent in how it generates an ellipse: the string has a fixed length which is the sum of distances from the pencil to each pushpin. This obeys the key and classically-known property that the sum of distances from foci to a point on the ellipse is a fixed distance.","['conic-sections', 'plane-geometry', 'geometry']"

1790017,Notation i.i.d sample,"I am learning measure theory and sometimes I am not sure if I am using the correct notations, especially with respect to distributions of random variables. In the following I try to formulate the estimation of a distribution from an i.i.d. sample. Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},P)$ be a probability space and $(E,\mathcal{E})$, $(E_1,\mathcal{E}_1),\dotsc,(E_n,\mathcal{E}_n)$ be measurable spaces.
The random variable $X\colon \Omega\to E$ is distributed according to $P_X$. Let $X_i\colon \Omega\to E_i$ also be random variables and define a sample as
$Z=(X_1,\dotsc,X_n)\colon \Omega\to E_1 \times \cdots \times E_n$ as a random varible with measurable space $(\times_{i=1}^n E_i, \otimes_{i=1}^n \mathcal{E}_i)$.
If the samples are independent, then $P_Z = P_{X_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes P_{X_n}$. How do I correctly say that I am interested in the estimation of $P_X$, but have only access to independent observations from this distribution? Is in this case $P_Z = P_{X} \otimes \cdots \otimes P_{X}$ $(\times_{i=1}^n E_i, \otimes_{i=1}^n \mathcal{E}_i) = (\times_{i=1}^n E, \otimes_{i=1}^n \mathcal{E})$? Furthermore, let $Z=z=(x_1,\dotsc,x_n)$ be a realization of the sample.
Given the empirical distribution $$P_n(E) = n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{1}_E \circ X_i(\omega), \quad E\in\mathcal{E}, \omega \in \Omega$$
then
$$
P_Z\bigg( \Big\{\lim_{n\to\infty} P_n(E) = P_X(E) \Big\} \bigg) = 1, \quad E \in \mathcal{E} \quad \text{or}\\
P\bigg( \Big\{\lim_{n\to\infty} P_n(E)(\omega) = P_X(E) \Big\} \bigg) = 1, \quad E \in \mathcal{E}, \omega \in \Omega

1790071,Central limit theorem for perfect matching counts,"$\require{begingroup}\begingroup
\DeclareMathOperator{\Var}{Var}$ Let $N_G$ denote the number of copies of a graph $G$ in the Erdős–Rényi random graph model $G(n,p)$ . We have the law of large numbers for the number of copies of of graph $G$ , i.e., $N_G$ is very close to the expectation $EN_G$ . This means that whenever the expectation tends to zero, $N_G$ also tends to zero and we have $$\frac{N_G - EN_G}{EN_G} \overset{p}{\rightarrow} 0.$$ Now we are interested to know whether the central limit theorem is also true: i.e., \begin{equation}
\cfrac{N_G-EN_G}{\sqrt{\Var N_G}}\overset{d}{\rightarrow}\mathcal{N}(0,1),
\end{equation} for $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ the standard normal distribution. As with the Poisson limit theorem for the number of copies of $G$ , this fact can also be proved by the method of moments. So if we can prove that if we have a sequence of random variables and for any $k$ , the $k$ th moment of the sequence tends to the $k$ th moment of a standard normal random variable, then this convergence in distribution also holds. To prove this, we need to prove that the $k$ th moment of $E(\frac{N_G - EN_G}{\sqrt{\Var N_G}})^k$ is equal to $\frac{E(N_G - EN_G)^k}{(\sqrt{\Var N_G})^k}$ when $k$ is even. To do this we use the indicator function and the collection of $k$ vertices that can be pairwise disjoint or maybe not; i.e., maybe the first collection and the second are not disjoint or the the second and third and $\dots$ and maybe all of them are not disjoint! But we can use some notation in this case that maybe will help me. We can consider a graph of relations between our collections and we can say that two collections are related to each other when they are not disjoint. So we can consider a graph on $k$ vertices such that each vertex is one of our collections and two vertices are adjacent when their collection do intersect (have nonempty intersection). And it turns out that there are three situations here for such a graph $H$ on $k$ vertices with the above-mentioned specification. In fact we have a lot of graphs here, i.e., $2^{{k \choose 2}}$ graphs, but we have only three different situations: $H$ has an isolated vertex. $H$ is a perfect matching. else. Now let me put what I said in equations to make it possible to understand the proof of the second case better: Let's drop the denominator.  We have \begin{eqnarray}
E(N_G-EN_G)^k &=& E(\sum_i(I_i-EI_i))^k\\
&=&\sum_{i_i,\ldots,i_k\in I}E((I_{i_1}-EI_{i_1})\cdots(I_{i_k}-EI_{i_k}))
\end{eqnarray} where $N_G=\sum_iI_i$ . Now $i_j\sim i_k \iff i_j\cap i_k \ne \emptyset$ so we get \begin{equation}
=\sum_{H:V(H)=k}\sum_{\overset{(i_1,\ldots,i_k)}{j\sim h \text{ in } H \iff i_j\sim i_h}}E(I_{i_1}-EI_{i_1})\cdots (I_{i_k}-EI_{i_k})
\end{equation} We can prove the first case as follows: Let $i_1$ be an isolated vertex. Then $I_{i_1}$ is independent of $(I_{i_2}, \cdots , I_{i_k})$ . Then $$E((I_{i_1} - EI_{i_1}) \cdots (I_{i_k} - EI_{i_k})) = E(I_{i_1} - EI_{i_1}) E(I_{i_2} - EI_{i_2}) \cdots E(I_{i_k} - EI_{i_k}) = 0$$ and we are done. This means that for the first case we have $o((\Var N_G)^{\frac{k}{2}})$ . Now we need to prove that the sum in the second case converges to $(k-1)!!\Var(N_G)^{k/2}$ . But to prove the second one I need help. Thanks! $\endgroup$","['combinatorics', 'graph-theory', 'random-graphs', 'discrete-mathematics']"

This is related to the problem of finding for which primes $p$ is $2$ a quadratic residue. If we can prove the above, then from the form of $p=a^2-2b^2$, it is easy to see that $p=8k \pm 1$.
I know a proof which uses quadratic fields. It shows that $p$ cannot be prime in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ and thus it is of the form $p=(a+\sqrt{2}b)(a-\sqrt{2}b)$. However, it seems (to me) like an overkill to use non-trivial results from quadratic fields for this. Surely there's got to be an elegant method which stays within $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$","['number-theory', 'finite-fields', 'prime-numbers', 'elementary-number-theory']"
1790639,"Finding an $N$, such that $\forall n \geq N$...","Ok, so I am stuck regarding the following question; Let $\epsilon > 0$ be a positive real number. Find a natural number $N \in$ $\mathbb{N}$ such that $$ |a_n| =\left|\frac{n + \frac{1}{n}}{n+1} - 1\right| < \epsilon, \forall n \geq \mathbb{N}$$ Now, my thinking when I'm posed with a question like this is to try and rearrange to get $n > f(\epsilon)$, then one can easily deduce what the value of $N$ should be, for instance by taking the integer part of $f(\epsilon)$ and adding $1$, which ensures that it is an integer and also ensures that it is greater or equal to the original $f(\epsilon)$. Now, with an expression like this, I cannot see how to possibly rearrange it to get the required expression, but I have been told that if I find an $f(n) \geq |a_n|$, then I can use the $N$ I get from this as the $N$ for the original expression. This intuitively makes sense as this $f(n)$ is larger, and so you'd need a larger $N$ for it to be smaller than $\epsilon$, and so this 'larger $N$' would also work for the original expression. But I run in to trouble with finding this 'nice $f(n)$', I mean can I take any larger $f(n)$? For example $|a_n| \leq \left|\frac{n(n+1)}{n+1} - 1\right| = |n - 1|$. Because $n^2 \geq n \enspace,    \forall n \geq 1$ and $n \geq \frac{1}{n} \enspace\forall n \geq 1$. But this then gives $n < \epsilon + 1$ which is nonsense so I'm not sure if my method is correct or not.","['sequences-and-series', 'limits']"

For Lebesgue measure in $\mathbb R^n$ , there is a known theorem that it is regular in the following way:
