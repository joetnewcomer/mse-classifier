3093675,Prime Integer Topology is $T_2$ but not $T_3$,"According to this $\pi$ -Base page , the ""Prime Integer Topology"" is an example of a topological space which is $T_2$ but not $T_3$ . The space is defined as $(\mathbb{Z}^+,\tau)$ where $\tau$ is the topology generated by a basis consisting of sets of the form: $$U_p(b)=\{b+np:n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$$ Where $p$ is prime and $b$ is a positive integer. I have managed to prove this is indeed a $T_2$ space since given positive integers $y>x$ , if we denote $d=x-y$ , and we denote by $p$ the smallest integer greater than $d$ , then $U_p(x)$ and $U_p(y)$ are disjoint open neighborhoods. However, I was unable to prove this space isn't a $T_3$ space. I managed to prove that the set of prime numbers together with $1$ is closed in this topology, but it didn't help me, and I'm not sure that's the right direction. In addition, my number theory background is somewhat limited so I may not have the right tools to solve this problem. Any hints or suggestions would be appreciated.","['general-topology', 'prime-numbers', 'separation-axioms']"

3093718,Orthogonal matrix with single $0$ entry,"To my surprise there is an orthogonal matrix dimension $3 \times 3$ with a single $0$ entry as  it was shown in this   answer . Moreover it was possible to identify the pattern for matrix entries to satisfy this condition i.e. $$Q=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -a & -b \\  a   &  -b^2 &  ab \\ b & ab & -a^2\end{bmatrix}$$ when $a,b$ are constrained by $a^2+b^2=1$ . For orthogonal matrix dimension $2 \times 2$ single $0$ entry is not possible. Here my new questions: Is it possible a single $0$ entry for orthogonal matrix dimension $4

3093762,Quadratic first integrals,"I started reading chapter II.16 of Solving Ordinary Differential Equations I in order to understand nummerical methods more. There, they state that symplectic methods don't always conserve the first integrals of the system. So for example, if a system is described by some Hamiltonian $H(p,q)$ then the nummerics don't need to conserve it. What is conserved (Theorem 16.7 of said book or Sanz-Serna 1988) is the quadratic first integral that is also a first integral of the system. Now, a quadratic first integral is a function of the shape $y^T C y$ for some symmetric $C$ and $y:=(p,q)$ . Now, for this to be the first integral we would need to have $H(y) : = y^T C y$ right? But then, the conservation of $H$ for most numerical cases wouldn't be possible! Take for example the Lennard-Jones potential. There we have: $$H(p, r) \approx \sum_ip_i^2 + \sum_{i,j} \frac{A}{r_{ij}^{12}}-\frac{B}{r_{ij}^6}$$ and we can't conserve this Hamiltonian because $y^TCy$ can only contain terms with $r$ to the power of $0,1,2$ and never negative. What is going on here? Is it only possible to (nummericly) conserve Hamiltonians of the shape: $$
H(p,q) = \sum_{i,j} a_{ij} p_i p_j + b_{ij}p_{i}q_{j} + c_{ij} q_{i}q_j
$$ with the additional constraint that the constants $a,b,c$ need to be symmetric (so $a_{ij} = a_{ji}, b_{ij} = b_{ji}, c_{ij} = c_{ji}$ )? My specific application is to show that: $$H(p,q) = \sum_i |p_i| - \sum_{ij}\frac{1}{r_{ij}}$$ doesn't need to be preserved by leapfrog algorithm and can become unstable (see related question ) What conservation laws can be derived here?

3093897,Can't understand step in LU decomposition proof,"UPDATE : The author of the linked article has updated the proof and now it's perfectly clear. I'm reading about the LU decomposition on this page and cannot understand one of the final steps in the proof to the following: Let $A$ be a $K\times K$ matrix. Then, there exists a permutation matrix $P$ such that $PA$ has an LU decomposition: $$PA=LU$$ where $L$ is a lower triangular $K\times K$ matrix and $U$ is an upper triangular $K\times K$ matrix. I'll reproduce the proof here: Through Gaussian elimination, $A$ can be reduced to a row-echelon (hence upper triangular) matrix $U$ via a series of $n$ elementary operations: $$E_n\bullet\ldots\bullet E_1\bullet A = U$$ Any elementary matrix $E_i$ used in Gaussian elimination is either a permutation matrix $P_i$ or a matrix $L_i$ used to add a multiple of one row to a row below it. Thus, $L_i$ will be lower triangular with non-zero diagonal $\implies$ invertible. Suppose that the first permutation matrix we encounter is in position $j$ , so that we have: $$E_n\bullet\ldots\bullet E_{j+1}\bullet P_j\bullet L_{j-1}\bullet\ldots\bullet L_1\bullet A = U$$ Since a permutation matrix is orthogonal, $P_j^T P_j = I$ and hence $$E_n\bullet\ldots\bullet E_{j+1}\bullet P_j\bullet L_{j-1}\bullet P_j^TP_j \bullet\ldots\bullet P_j^TP_j\bullet L_1\bullet P_j^TP_j\bullet A = U$$ or $$E_n\bullet\ldots\bullet E_{j+1}\bullet\tilde{L}_{j-1}\bullet\ldots\bullet\tilde{L}_1\bullet P_j\bullet A = U$$ for $i=1,\ldots,j-1$ . A matrix $L_i$ , used to add $\alpha$ times the $i$ -th row to the $s$ -th row (in this case $s>i$ ), can be written as a rank one update to the identity matrix: $L_i=I+M$ , where $M$ is a matrix whose entries are all zeros except $M_{si} = \alpha$ . We have that $$\tilde{L}_i = P_jL_iP_j^T = P_j(I+M)P_j^T = P_jP_j^T + P_jMP_j^T = I+P_jMP_j^T$$ So far so good. Then we have: The permutations performed on the rows and columns of $M$ by $P_j$ and $P_j^T$ can move the only non-zero element of $M$ , but that element remains below the main diagonal (because $j>i$ ). I can't understand this. $M$ is derived from $L_i$ , which means that $M_{si} = \alpha \neq 0$ and all other elements of $M$ are $0$ . Nothing has been said about $P_j$ . I'm guessing $P_j$ swaps $j$ -th row with $r$ -th row, where $r>j$ . What do the indices $s,i$ have anything to do with the indices $r,j$ ? Would be grateful if anyone could clear this up!","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
3093933,Upper bound CP tensor rank,"I have a question about CP tensor ranks. In the following, $\mathcal X \in \mathbb R^{n_1 \times n_2 \times n_3}$ is a third-order tensor of CP rank $R$ , i.e., there exist vectors $a_i$ , $b_i$ and $c_i$ for $i = 1, \ldots, R$ of appropriate dimensions such that $$\mathrm{vec}(\mathcal X) = c_1 \otimes b_1 \otimes a_1 + \ldots + c_R \otimes b_R \otimes a_R.$$ The following theorem holds. Theorem. Let $R_\mu$ be the rank of the matricization $X^{(\mu)}$ of $\mathcal X$ for $\mu = 1, 2, 3$ . Then $$ \max\{R_1,R_2, R_3\} \leq R \leq \min\{R_1R_2, R_1R_3, R_2R_3\}.$$ While I have no issues with the lower bound (i.e., left), I can neither prove nor find a reference for the proof of the upper bound. I can prove that $R \leq \min\{n_1n_2, n_1n_3, n_2n_3\}$ , but that is not enough, as $R_\mu \leq n_\mu$ for $\mu = 1, 2, 3$ . EDIT: Proof of $R \leq \min\{n_1n_2, n_1n_3, n_2n_3\}$ (w.l.o.g. prove $R \leq n_1 n_2$ .) Consider $X^{(1)} \in \mathbb R^{n_1\times n_2n_3}$ the first matricization of $\mathcal X$ , and write $$
X^{(1)} = [x_1, \ldots, x_{n_2n_3}]
$$ Then we have for the canonical basis vectors $e_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_2n_3}$ $$
X^{(1)} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n_2 n_3} x_i e_i^\top
$$ And by vectorization $$
\mathrm{vec}(\mathcal X) = \mathrm{vec}(X^{(1)}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n_2 n_3} e_i \otimes x_i,
$$ which implies that $R \leq n_2 n_3$ by constructing vectors $g_i$ and $h_i$ such that $g_i \otimes h_i = e_i$ .","['matrix-rank', 'tensor-rank', 'tensors', 'linear-algebra', 'numerical-linear-algebra']"
3093958,Quick way of solving the contour integral $\oint \frac{1}{1+z^5} dz$,"Consider the contour integral in the complex plane: $$\oint \frac{1}{1+z^5} dz$$ Here the contour is a circle with radius $3$ with centre in the origin. If we look at the poles, they need to satisfy $z^5 = -1$ . So the solutions of the poles are given by: \begin{align*}
z_0 &= \cos(\frac{\pi}{5}) + i \sin(\frac{\pi}{5})\\
z_1 &= \cos(\frac{3\pi}{5}) + i \sin(\frac{3\pi}{5})\\
z_2 &= \cos(\pi) + i \sin(\pi) = -1\\
z_3 &= \cos(\frac{7\pi}{5}) + i \sin(\frac{7\pi}{5})\\
z_4 &= \cos(\frac{9\pi}{5}) + i \sin(\frac{9\pi}{5})
\end{align*} So one can use Cauchy's formula or the residue theorem to calculate for every solution the integral and then adding them up to get the full integral. But I have the feeling that there needs to be a more simple way of calculating the full contour integral. Can one just calculate the integral for one solution $z_i$ (like the simple solution $-1$ ) and then multiply by it $5$ , suggesting that the others have the same value. This would make the calculation much efficienter. EDIT:
I now see that $4$ solutions are symmetric (the solutions except $z=-1$ ) in the complex plane. If one approximates the solutions of the poles in decimals, one finds: \begin{align*}
z_0 &= 0.81 + 0.58i\\
z_1 &= -0.31 + 0.95i\\
z_2 &= -1\\
z_3 &= -0.31 -0.95i\\
z_4 &= 0.81 -0.58i
\end{align*} So there are four symmetric solutions. For instance $z_0$ is symmetric with $z_4$ , they are mirrored around the x-axis. Could this mean they cancell each other out so we only need to calculate the integral for $z_2 = -1$ ?","['integration', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration', 'complex-integration']"

Past this circular simplification, I thought of integrating but that will just make the formula much messier. Maybe there's another approach? Edit 1: My main goal is to get a closed form of the integral, so if $\frac14$ and $\frac34$ give some cancellations, it would be great if someone pointed them out.

&=\frac{(n^2)!}{(2n+1)!} -\frac{2}{4^{n+1}n+1} {_{2}}F_{1}(n+1,-n,n+2,\frac{1}{4})

&=1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^k \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \frac{(n+1)}{4^k(n+k+1)} \\

3093995,Requirements for an integer root of cubic equation,"If we have the quadratic equation $$a x^2 + b x + c = 0$$ with $a,b,c$ integers, then a requirement for $x$ to have an integer solution is for $b^2 - 4ac$ to be a square integer. This condition is necessary, but not sufficient. However it is simple enough to sometimes be useful when solving Diophantine equations. Furthermore, note that this does not come from Vieta's formulas . While those are useful for other purposes, they do not yield a restrictive form in the integers like the condition on $b^2 - 4ac$ extracted from the general solution. So with that introduction out of the way: I would like to know if there are similar conditions for the cubic equation $$a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0.$$ In the quadratic case, if one root is integer, the other is at least rational. But in the cubic case, one root could be integer, with the others irrational or imaginary. So it looks like it would be harder to extract such a condition from the general solution ( vanderbilt.edu , wikipedia ). In particular, just like in casus irreducibilis where imaginary values will invariably show up during calculation of the roots even when all the roots are real, it seems inevitable that we could have irrationals  like $\sqrt{n}$ show up only to cancel later in the calculation of an integer root. So how can we extract from the general cubic solution some useful conditions on $a,b,c,d$ for an integer solution?  Particularly nice, in analogy to the quadratic case, is if there is some term that is required to be a perfect cube.","['cubics', 'number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'diophantine-equations']"

I think Stewart had some rules for how he made his toroids and maybe that had something to do with why they didn't really look much like a doughnut to me. Anyway I set about making my own, and I made something that looked more doughnut-like.  The driving rule I used to make it was to try and make every vertex (where faces met) as smooth as possible, which I interpreted to mean I needed to minimize the angle change between all the faces.  I think for that exact characteristic (least angle change between faces) you can't do better than this shape does (worst angle change is 36 deg) (sorry, I know those pictures are bad) So I guess my question is if any of that makes sense. Is it okay thinking one polyhedra could be more ""torus"" than another? Is there a smart way to measure that, or is this purely a subjective thing? Does the idea of smoothing out a polyhedra actually help or is that really more cosmetic? Is minimizing the angle between adjacent faces the right way to maximize smoothness? EDIT:  It seems I've attracted a number of people also interested in making more such polyhedra, which is fine, I certainly had fun making this thing.  But the question is not ""can you make these polyhedra"", it is ""how can we compare them?"" There's nothing stopping me from making a torus with a million little square faces, approximating a torus in the same fashion a bunch of pixels can approximate a circle.  The thing I want to know is if math tells us how similar two shapes are, such that there can be an official method for comparing two polyhedral doughnuts.","['polyhedra', 'geometry', '3d']"

3094131,What are the semi-direct products of $\mathbb{Z}$ with itself? (Check my work please),"I am just starting out with semi-direct products. I would like to list and describe the semi-direct products of $\mathbb{Z}$ with itself. I first need to find the automorphisms $\varphi$ from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$ . These automorphisms are determined by $\varphi(1)$ by the additive property of such morphisms : $\varphi(n+m)=\varphi(n)+\varphi(m).$ Therefore, I only need to determine the possible values of $\varphi(1)$ . But I know that an automorphism must send generators on generators, and the generators of $\mathbb{Z}$ are $\pm1$ , so there are at most two automorphisms : $Id:x \mapsto x$ and $-Id:x \mapsto -x$ (and they are automorphisms, so these are the only ones). Therefore, a semi-direct product $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes_{\psi}\mathbb{Z}$ is given by a morphism $\psi:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow Aut({\mathbb{Z}}) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ . The only possibilites, if I didn't make any mistakes, are $\psi:n \rightarrow Id$ (constant morphism) and $\psi:n\rightarrow (-1)^nId$ ( $\psi$ is determined by $\psi(1)$ which is either $Id$ yielding the constant morphism or $-Id$ which yields the second one.) So there are only two semi-direct products possible, one of which is the direct product (I guess?). $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes_{n \rightarrow id}\mathbb{Z}\cong\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes_{n \rightarrow (-1)^nId} \mathbb{Z}$ Did I miss any of them, and is there anything to say about this last semi-direct product? Is $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes_{n \rightarrow (-1)^nId} \mathbb{Z}$ isomorphic to any known groups? I'm not sure what to say now, I should give it a brief description but I don't know what else there is to say than $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes_{n \rightarrow (-1)^nId} \mathbb{Z}$ . Its multiplicative law is $(x,y)*(z,t)=(x+\psi(y)(z),z+t)=(x+(-1)^yz,z+t)$ , so it kind of ""oscillates"" and it doesn't sound familiar to me... I don't recall any groups with such a weird multiplication law.

3094155,Extension of Du-Bois-Raymond lemma to Vector Fields on a Riemannian Manifold,"Edit: Reviving this thread because I still could not prove or find a proof of this. A sketch of a proof attempt can be found in the previous edit of this post. I am trying to show the following extension of the Du Bois Raymond lemma: Let $M$ be a smooth Riemannian Manifold and $\omega: [0,1] \rightarrow M$ be a $W^{1,2}$ curve on M. Consider a tangential $L^2$ vector field along $\omega$ denoted by $v \in L^2(\omega^*TM)$ . If $$\int_{0}^{1} \langle v, \frac{Du}{\partial t} \rangle \text{ dt} = 0 \ \ \ \ \ \text{for all } u \in W ^{1,2}(\omega^*TM) \text{ with } u(0)=u(1)=0$$ Then $$v \in W^{1,2}(\omega^*TM)\ \ \text{ with   }\ \  \frac{Dv}{\partial t} = 0 \ \ a.e.$$ where $\frac{Du}{\partial t}$ denotes the covariant derivative of $u$ along the curve $\omega$ . For my purposes it would be sufficient to show this for the simplified case where $M = S^2$ and the covariant derivative becomes the projection onto the respective tangent space, i.e., $\frac{Du}{\partial t} = u' - \langle u', \omega \rangle \omega$ .

3094268,Why is the dimension of the zero subspace 0 and not 1?,"A related question: If a single non-zero vector serves as a basis for a subspace, then is the dimension of that subspace 1 or 0? I'm almost certain the answer to the above question is 1. But my confusion lies with the fact that the dimension of the zero subspace (which consists only of the zero vector) is zero. There is one vector in this subspace (namely, the zero vector), so shouldn't the dimension be 1? Is there an intuitive way to think about this, or is this just how it's been defined as this is the only way everything works? On this similar post, a commenter said: ""The zero vector itself does not have a dimension. The vector space consisting of only the zero vector has dimension 0. This is because a basis for that vector space is the empty set, and the dimension of a vector space is the cardinality of any basis for that vector space."" I don't see see how this is true, unless the empty set is not counted when counting cardinality (i.e. a set of vectors with 5 vectors as well as the empty set would be counted as having 5 vectors and not 6).

The ideal is: $\mathfrak{p}=(2,\sqrt{82})_R$ It is a prime ideal (this follows from a theorem on the splitting behaviour of ideals generated by prime integers), and it appears quite naturally in the unique factorisation $\mathfrak{p}^2=(2)_R$ , so we know that $N(\mathfrak{p})=\pm2$ .

My attempts so far have been to consider the equation $x^2-82y^2=\pm2$ reduced modulo small integers and then arriving at a contradiction, but this has been to no avail. I have therefore resorted to asking the community the following: (1) Is there any general method to proving that an ideal in the ring of integers of a number field is non-principal, or are there general methods for separate cases $\textit{e.g.}$ in the case of a quadratic number field? The case of $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ for $d<0$ square-free of course admits fairly simple solution, as it can be easily observed that $x^2-dy^2=c$ for some $c\in K$ has no solutions when this is the case. (2) If the answer to (1) is either that there is no known general method or that any known general method is impracticable, and that in the case of an ideal in the ring of integers of a quadratic number field $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ the best one can do is consider equations of the form $x^2-dy^2=c$ modulo small integers, is there any general algorithm or technique that applies here other than some wit and a keen eye?

I thought a likely solution would be a repeating (perhaps sinusoidal) function, where $f(0)=0, f'(0)=1,f'(1)=0,f'(2)=-1,f'(3)=0$ , etc. I tried to find such a function on Desmos, however I failed after realizing that for a Sin function the derivative at $0$ is always greater than the value of the maximum since between the zero and the maximum the function is strictly decreasing. In my exploration, I was able to find a solution to the similar differential equation, $f'(x)=f(x+1)*{\pi\over2}$ , with the solution $f(x)=\sin{({\pi\over2}x)}$ . This was easier to find due to the coefficient of $\pi\over2$ , which removes the obstacle of the previous inequality. Perhaps this provides hope for a solution to the other one.

I feel like I touched on a possible means of solving this, but I'm not sure it's sufficient/correct, and even if it is constructing the isomorphism is proving ... not too easy. Initial Motivation: So, we know: for two groups to be isomorphic, a necessary - but not sufficient! -condition ( as noted and proved here ) is that their underlying sets have the same cardinality. I took this as a sort of starting point to start finding such groups. So, in this problem, I now seek $A,B,C,D$ such that $$|A \times B| = |C \times D| = |A|\cdot |B| = |C| \cdot |D|$$ So it seems sufficient to think of $|A\times B|=|C \times D| = n$ for $n$ finite, and to find factors $a,b,c,d$ of $n$ such that $$n=ab=cd$$ where $a,b,c,d$ are the factors of $n$ , and the orders of groups $A,B,C,D$ .

3094843,Solving $\int_0^{\infty} \ln^m(x)\sin\left(x^n\right)\:dx$,"Spurred on by this question, I decided to investigate a more generalised form: \begin{equation}
I_{m,n} = \int_0^{\infty} \ln^m(x)\sin\left(x^n\right)\:dx
\end{equation} Where $n,m \in \mathbb{N}$ I have formed a solution in terms of the Gamma Function but I'm unsure whether it can be expressed in terms of other Non-Elementary and/or Elementary Functions. Also very interested to see other approaches (Real + Complex Analysis). To solve, we first observe that: \begin{equation}
I_{n,k} = \lim_{\phi\rightarrow 0^+} \frac{d^m}{d\phi^m}\int_0^\infty x^\phi \sin\left(x^n\right)\:dx
\end{equation} Here let: \begin{equation}
 J_{n}(\phi) = \int_0^\infty x^\phi \sin\left(x^n\right)\:dx
\end{equation} We observe that we first must solve $J_{n,k}(\phi)$ . To achieve we employ Feynman's Trick coupled with Laplace Transforms. This is allowable as the integrand conforms with both Fubini's Theorem and the Dominated Convergence Theorem . Here we introduce: \begin{equation}
H_{n}(t,\phi) = \int_0^\infty x^\phi \sin\left(tx^n\right)\:dx
\end{equation} Where \begin{equation}
J_{n}(\phi) = \lim_{t\rightarrow 1^+} H_{n}(t,\phi)
\end{equation} We now take the Laplace Transform of $H_{n}(t,\phi)$ with respect to $t$ : \begin{align}
\mathscr{L}_t\left[H_{n}(t,\phi)\right] = \int_0^\infty x^\phi \mathscr{L}_t\left[\sin\left(tx^n\right)\right]\:dx = \int_0^\infty x^\phi \frac{x^n}{s^2 + x^{2n}} \:dx = \int_0^\infty \frac{x^{\phi + n}}{s^2 + x^{2n}} \:dx
\end{align} Thankfully (and as I address here ) this integral can be evaluated easily: \begin{align}
\mathscr{L}_t\left[H_{n}(t,\phi)\right] = \int_0^\infty \frac{x^{\phi + n}}{s^2 + x^{2n}} \:dx = \frac{1}{2n} \cdot \left(s^2\right)^{ \frac{\phi + n + 1}{2n} - 1}\cdot B\left(1 - \frac{\phi + n + 1}{2n}, \frac{\phi + n + 1}{2n} \right)
\end{align} Using the relationship between the Beta Function and the Gamma Function: \begin{equation}
\mathscr{L}_t\left[H_{n}(t,\phi)\right] = \frac{1}{2n} s^{ \frac{\phi + n + 1}{n} - 2}\Gamma\left(1 - \frac{\phi + n + 1}{2n} \right)\Gamma\left(\frac{\phi + n + 1}{2n} \right)
\end{equation} We now resolve $H_{n}(t, \phi)$ by taking the Inverse Laplace Transform: \begin{align}
H_{n}(t,\phi)&=\mathscr{L}_s^{-1}\left[ \frac{1}{2n} s^{ \frac{\phi + n + 1}{n} - 2}\Gamma\left(1 - \frac{\phi + n + 1}{2n} \right)\Gamma\left(\frac{\phi + n + 1}{2n} \right)\right]\\
& = \frac{1}{2n} \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma\left(2 - \frac{\phi + n + 1}{n}\right)t^{-\left(\frac{\phi + n + 1}{n} - 2  + 1\right)} } \cdot \Gamma\left(1 - \frac{\phi + n + 1}{2n} \right)\Gamma\left(\frac{\phi + n + 1}{2n} \right)
\end{align} We can now solve $J_n(\phi)$ : \begin{equation}
J_{n}(\phi) = \lim_{t\rightarrow 1^+} H_{n}(t,\phi) =  \frac{\Gamma\left(1 - \frac{\phi + n + 1}{2n} \right)\Gamma\left(\frac{\phi + n + 1}{2n} \right) }{2n\:\Gamma\left(2 - \frac{\phi + n + 1}{n}\right) }  
\end{equation} And finally we have \begin{equation}
I_{m,n} = \int_0^{\infty} \ln^m(x)\sin\left(x^n\right)\:dx = \lim_{\phi\rightarrow 0^+} \frac{d^m}{d\phi^m} \left[\frac{\Gamma\left(1 - \frac{\phi + n + 1}{2n} \right)\Gamma\left(\frac{\phi + n + 1}{2n} \right) }{2n\:\Gamma\left(2 - \frac{\phi + n + 1}{n}\right) }  \right]
\end{equation} For example, using the example as linked above we have $m = 2$ , $n = 2$ : \begin{equation}
I_{2,2} = \int_0^{\infty} \ln^2(x)\sin\left(x^2\right)\:dx = \lim_{\phi\rightarrow 0^+} \frac{d^2}{d\phi^2} \left[\frac{\Gamma\left(1 - \frac{\phi + 2 + 1}{2\cdot 2} \right)\Gamma\left(\frac{\phi + 2 + 1}{2\cdot2} \right) }{2n\:\Gamma\left(2 - \frac{\phi + 2 + 1}{2}\right) }  \right]
\end{equation} I was too lazy to do it by hand, but evaluated through WolframAlpha we observe that: \begin{equation}
I_{2,2} = \int_0^{\infty} \ln^2(x)\sin\left(x^2\right)\:dx = \frac{1}{32}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}(2\gamma-\pi+4\ln2)^2

3094974,Boundary defining function,"I'm confused about the proof of Prop 5.43 in Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds Prop 5.43 Every smooth manifold with boundary admits a boundary defining function. A boundary defining function is defined just a few lines earlier: If $M$ is a smooth manifold with boundary, a boundary defining function for $M$ is a smooth function $f: M \to [0, \infty)$ such that $f^{-1}(0) = \partial M$ and $df_p \neq 0$ for all $p \in \partial M$ . The proof basically lets ${(U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha)}$ be a collection of smooth charts whose domains cover $M$ ; defines smooth functions $f_\alpha : U_\alpha \to [0, \infty)$ , and lets ${\psi_\alpha}$ be a partition of unity subordinate to this cover. He defines $f = \sum_\alpha \psi_\alpha f_\alpha$ , and then has the following equation: \begin{equation}
df_p(v) = \sum_\alpha (f_\alpha (p) d \phi_\alpha \rvert_p(v) + \phi_\alpha(p) d f_\alpha \rvert_p (v)),
\end{equation} My question is why does: $f = \sum_\alpha \psi_\alpha f_\alpha \Longrightarrow df_p(v) = \sum_\alpha (f_\alpha (p) d \phi_\alpha \rvert_p(v) + \phi_\alpha(p) d f_\alpha \rvert_p (v))?$ I don't have a lot of diff geo background other than the first five chapters of Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds, so if explanations could be confined to using that knowledge, it would help me out a lot. Thanks! This seems like something that should be easy to see, but here's what I am thinking and am stuck on: Let $v \in T_{p} M$ , so $v: C^\infty (M) \to \mathbb{R}$ , and $g \in C^\infty (\mathbb{R})$ . If we use the definition of a differential, we get: \begin{equation}
d f_p(v)(g) = v(g \circ f) = v (g \circ \sum_\alpha \phi_\alpha f_\alpha) = v (\sum_\alpha g \circ \phi_\alpha f_\alpha) = \sum_\alpha v \circ g \circ \phi_\alpha f_\alpha,
\end{equation} where in the third equality, we used the linearity of the derivation $v$ . From looking at the expression we want, it seems like we use the chain rule property of derivations, but that would apply if our expression were $v \circ \phi_\alpha f_\alpha$ rather than what we have, which is $v \circ g \circ \phi_\alpha f_\alpha$ .","['manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

Then its multiplicity $\mu_X$ is defined as the length of the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X,\eta}$ over itself, where $\eta$ is the generic point of $X$ . The degree $d_X$ of $X$ is defined as $\frac{c}{n!}$ , where $c$ is the leading coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial $P_X$ of $X$ , and $n$ is the degree of $P_X$ . I would like to show that $d_X = \mu_X \cdot  d_{X_{red}}$ , where $X_{red} \subset X \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ is the reduced subscheme with the same set of underlying points, but I don't see how to relate the Hilbert polynomial to the multiplicity. So any ideas or hints would be appreciated. One thought was that maybe even $P_X = \mu_X\cdot P_{X_{red}}$ holds.  But on further thought this is inplausible, because $X$ might have embedded components, which do not appear in $Y$ , but contribute a part to $P_X$ . But doing a (homogeneous) primary decomposition we can decompose $X = X_1 \cup \dots \cup X_r$ scheme theoretically , and $X_1$ corresponds to the maximal component. Because $X_2, \dots X_r$ do not contribute to the leading coefficient of $P_X$ , we might assume wlog that $X$ does not have any embedded components.

3095153,How do I prove that the second derivative of a function $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ defined on a surface $M\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is well defined?,"QUESTION. How do I prove that the second derivative of a function $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ defined on a surface $M\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is well defined? QUESTION. If, as  says the user Amitai Yuval, the second derivative of a function defined on a $ M $ surface can not be well defined in general what is the explanation for this impossibility? By a second derivative I mean an application $D^{(2)}f$ that at each point $ p \in M $ associates a well-defined bilinear aplication $$
D^{(2)}f(p):T_pM \times T_pM \to\mathbb{R}. 
$$ Let me make a background in a few steps to try to make the question more precise. Step one. Here $ M $ designates a $C^k$ surface of dimension $ m $ within the Euclidean space $ \mathbb{R}^n$ , i.e . a set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which satisfies the following properties: there is a family of open sets $\{O_i\}_{i\in I}$ such that $M\subset \bigcup_{i\in I} O_i$ for any $U=M\cap O_i$ there are a open set $U_0$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$ and a $C^k$ ( $k\geq 2$ ) parametrization $\varphi:U_0\to U$ . Step two. I'm assuming that, fixed a point $ p \in M $ , for any two parametrizations $\varphi:U_0\to U\subset M$ and $\psi:V_0\to V\subset M$ such that $p\in V\cap U$ it is proved that $$
(\varphi^{-1}\circ\psi):\psi^{-1}(U\cap V)\to \varphi^{-1}(U\cap V)
$$ and $$
( \psi^{-1}\circ \varphi):\varphi^{-1}(U\cap V)\to \psi^{-1}(U\cap V)
$$ are $C^k$ ( $k\geq 2$ ) diffeormorphisms. Step three. I am also assuming that the tangent plane $T_pM$ is the well defined vector space given by any parameterization $\varphi:U_0\to U\subset M$ such that $\varphi(a)=p$ as $$
T_pM= D\varphi(a)(\mathbb{R}^m).
$$ By well defined I mean $ D\varphi(a)(\mathbb{R}^m)=D\psi(b)(\mathbb{R}^m)$ for any other parameterization $\psi:V_0\to V\subset M$ such that $\psi(b)=p$ . Step four. A function $ f: M \to \mathbb{R}$ is $C^r$ ( $1\leq r<k$ ) differentiable at point $p$ if there is a parameterization $\varphi:U_0\to U\subset M$ with $\varphi(a)=p$ such that $f\circ\varphi$ is $C^r$ differentiable in $a$ . Once the parameter change $(\varphi^{-1}\circ\psi):\psi^{-1}(U\cap V)\to \varphi^{-1}(U\cap V)$ is differentiable it follows that the application $f\circ\psi$ is differentiable in $b$ for all parameterization $\psi:V_0\to V\subset M$ such that $\psi(b)=p$ . Step five If $ f:M\to \mathbb{R} $ is $C^r$ $(r>1)$ differentiable at point $ p \in M$ then its derivative at that point is the linear transformation $ Df(p):T_pM\to\mathbb{R} $ defined as follows. Let's take a parameterization $\varphi:U_0\to U\subset M$ with $\varphi(a)=p$ . Given a vector $u\in T_p M $ there exists unique a vector $ \mu \in \mathbb{R}^m$ such that $u=Df(a)\mu$ .The derivative of $ f $ at point $ p $ is then simply defined by $$
Df(p)\cdot u =D (f\circ \varphi)(a)\cdot\mu
$$ Step six. The linear transformation of step five is well defined. That is, if $\psi:V_0\to V$ is any other parameterization  with $\psi(b)=p$ and $u=D\psi(b)\zeta$ for some vector $\zeta\in\mathbb{R}^m$ , then $$
D (f\circ \varphi)(a)\cdot\mu= D (f\circ \psi)(b)\cdot\zeta.
$$ Indeed, $\psi=\varphi\circ(\varphi^{-1}\circ\psi)$ at where $(\varphi^{-1}\circ\psi):\psi^{-1}(U\cap V)\to \varphi^{-1}(U\cap V)$ is a $C^{k}$ diffeomorphism such that $(\varphi^{-1}\circ\psi)(b)=a$ . We have \begin{align}
     D\varphi(a)\cdot \mu=& u \\
                    =& D\psi(b)\cdot \zeta \\
                    =& D((\varphi\circ \varphi^{-1})\circ\psi )(b)\cdot \zeta\\
                    =& D(\varphi\circ(\varphi^{-1}\circ\psi))(b)\cdot \zeta\\
                    =& D\varphi(a)\cdot \Big(D(\varphi^{-1}\circ\psi)(b)\cdot\zeta\Big)
\end{align} Since $ D \varphi(a)$ is injective we have $\mu=D(\varphi^{-1}\circ\psi)(b)\cdot\zeta$ .
Therefore, \begin{align}
D(f\circ\psi)(b)\zeta =& D(f\circ(\varphi\circ\varphi^{-1})\circ\psi)(b)\cdot\zeta \\
                    =& D(f\circ \varphi\circ(\varphi^{-1}\circ\psi))(b)\cdot\zeta \\
                    =& D(f\circ \varphi)(a) \cdot\Big( D(\varphi^{-1}\circ\psi)(b)\cdot\zeta\Big) \\
                    =& D(f\circ \varphi)(a) \cdot\mu
\end{align} Let us end the background here and return to the question. Below is my attempt to answer the question. By analogy to the first order derivative the second derivative would work as follows. DEFINITION. Let $M$ a $C^k$ ( $k>2$ ) surface. Let $ f:M\to \mathbb{R} $ is $C^2$ differentiable at point $ p \in M$ . Its second derivative $D^{(2)}f$ associates each point $p$ the bilinear transformation $$ 
D^{(2)}f(p):T_pM\times T_pM\to\mathbb{R} 
$$ such that for all parameterization $\varphi:U_0\to U\subset M$ , with $\varphi(a)=p$ , and all vectors $u,v\in T_p M $ $$
D^{(2)}f(p)\cdot (u,v) \mathop{=}^{_{\rm def}}D^{(2)} (f\circ \varphi)(a)\cdot(\mu,\nu)
$$ with $ \mu,\nu \in \mathbb{R}^m$ such that $
u=D\varphi(a)\mu \quad \mbox{ and }\quad v=D\varphi(a)\nu.
$ Similarly to the case of the first derivative, the second derivative will be well defined if for any other parameterization $\psi:V_0\to V$ such that $\psi(b)=p$ , $$
D\psi(b)\eta=u \quad \mbox{ and } \quad D\psi(b)\zeta=v
$$ for some $\eta\in\mathbb{R}^m$ and for some $\zeta\in\mathbb{R}^m$ we have $$
D^{(2)} (f\circ \varphi)(a)\cdot(\mu,\nu)=D^{(2)} (f\circ \psi)(b)\cdot(\eta,\zeta)
$$ To show the above equality I tried to imitate step six. We have \begin{align}
D^{(2)} (f\circ \psi)(b)\cdot(\eta,\zeta)
=& 
D^{(2)} (f\circ(\varphi\circ\varphi^{-1})\circ \psi)(b)\cdot(\eta,\zeta)
\\
=& 
D^{(2)} (f\circ\varphi\circ(\varphi^{-1}\circ \psi))(b)\cdot(\eta,\zeta)
\end{align} But in this last equality I can not use the chain rule. On the other hand the development of the second derivative $D^{(2)} (f\circ \varphi)(a)\cdot(\mu,\nu)$ in terms of the partial derivatives $\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x_i\partial x_j}(a)$ was more productive. Look \begin{align}
D^{(2)} (f\circ \varphi)(a)\cdot(\mu,\nu)
=&
\left[
	\frac{\partial}{\partial \nu} 
	\left(
		\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} (f\circ\varphi) 
	\right)

=&

\right](a)
\\
=&
\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^{m}
\nu_i\cdot\mu_j\cdot \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} (f\circ\varphi)(a) 
\\
\end{align} By $\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} (f\circ\varphi)(a)= D(f\circ \varphi)(a) \cdot\mu =u= D(f\circ\psi)(b)\eta= \frac{\partial}{\partial \eta} (f\circ\psi)(b)$ we have \begin{align}
D^{(2)} (f\circ \varphi)(a)\cdot(\mu,\nu)
=&
\left[
	\frac{\partial}{\partial \nu} 
	\left(
		\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} (f\circ\varphi) 
	\right)
\right](a)
\\
=&
\left[
	\frac{\partial}{\partial \nu} 
	\left(
		\frac{\partial}{\partial \eta} (f\circ\psi)

	\left(
		\sum_{j=1}^{m}\eta_j\cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} (f\circ\psi)

=&
\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^{m}
\nu_i\cdot\eta_j\cdot \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} (f\circ\psi)(b) 
\\
=&
D^{(2)}(f\circ\psi)(a)\cdot(\eta,\nu) 
\end{align} By an entirely analogous calculation and applying the Schwarz theorem we have $$
D^{(2)}(f\circ\varphi)(a)\cdot(\mu,\nu)= D^{(2)}(f\circ\psi)(a)\cdot(\mu,\zeta).
$$ QUESTION. The question then becomes the following. How to use the identities below \begin{align}

3095338,Different ways we can paint the faces of a tetrahedron using $4$ colors,"Suppose we want to paint the faces of a tetrahedron using $4$ different colors, assuming that we allow different faces to be painted with the same color. By not taking the symmetries of tetrahedron into account, there are $|X|=4^4=256$ ways. Now, when its symmetries are introduced, from Burnside's orbit-counting theorem : $$
r=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G}|X_g|
$$ where $G$ is the symmetry group of the tetrahedron (considering only orientation preserving symmetries), $X_g$ are the elements fixed by $g$ and $r$ is the number of orbits of $X$ under $G$ 's action. Therefore, we need to keep track of how many elements are fixed by every $g \in G$ . $\bullet \space $ The identity element keeps everything unchanged, so $X_e=256$ $\bullet \space $ Let $\rho^j_i$ denote the rotations about the vertex $i$ by $j$ degrees. For the element to stay fixed, the adjacent faces to this vertex must be of the same color. So $$|X_{\rho^{120}_1}|=|X_{\rho_1^{240}}|=\dots=|X_{\rho^{240}_4}|=4 \cdot4=16$$ $\bullet \space $ There are $3$ more symmetries left to examine, which are the $180^o$ rotations, $m_1,m_2, m_3$ . Elements stay fixed only if they have two pairs of similarly colored adjacent faces. Thus $$
|X_{m_1}|=|X_{m_2}|=|X_{m_3}|=4 \cdot 4=16
$$ Taking all this into account, we yield: $$
r=\frac{1}{12}(256+8 \cdot 16 + 3 \cdot 16)=\frac{432}{12}=36
$$ Therefore, there are $36$ different ways to color the faces of a tetrahedron using $4$ colors.","['proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra', 'combinatorics', 'group-theory', 'group-actions']"

I want to verify my solution as part of my learning process to learn from my mistakes in case I might want to schedule a resit Consider an alphabet $A$ consisting of $6$ vowels and of $12$ consonants. Valid words consist of no two consonants in a row, so AART is not valid, nor is JUDITH, but JUDIT is fine and so is AAR, as is AIAIAIAIAIAIAIAIAI. $a_n$ denotes the amount of valid words. a) find $a_0$ , $a_1$ , $a_2$ , $a_3$ $a_0=1$ , the empty word $a_1=12+6=18$ (just one letter) For $a_2$ we considers words like $AT$ , $TA$ , $IA$ (different vowels) and $AA$ (same vowels) $a_2= 2 \times 6 \cdot 12 + 5 \cdot 6 + 6=144 +30 +6=180$ We expand to three symbols by either adding a vowel to the end of a 2-letter word or by adding a vowel and consonant to a 1-letter word $a_3=180 \cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 12 \cdot 18 =1080+1296=2376$ (b) Find a recurrence relation (c) solve it We make a case distinction for a valid word of length $n$ , it either ends in a consonant or in a vowel. If it ends in a consonant, we must have obtained it from a valid word of length $n-2$ by placing a vowel followed by a consonant behind it. In all other situations we simply place a vowel behind a word of length $n-1$ . We get for $n\geq 2$ : $$ a_n = 6 \cdot a_{n-1} +  6 \cdot 12 \cdot a_{n-2}$$ One can verify that this indeed gives $180$ for $a_2$ . We can solve this recursion via an auxiliary equation of the form: $$ r^2 = 6r + 6 \cdot 16 $$ $$ r^2 - 6r - 6 \cdot 16 =0$$ Which factorises as: $$ (r-12)(r+6)=0$$ So we get solutions $a_n = A r_1^n + B r_2^n$ : $$ a_n = A \cdot 12^n + B \cdot (-6) ^n$$ We can now plug in our initial conditions $a_0=1$ and $a_1=18$ $$1=A+B$$ $$ 18= 12A - 6B=18A -6 \implies 18A=24 \implies A=\frac{4}{3}, B=-\frac{1}{3}. $$ We get: $$ a_n =  \frac{4}{3}\cdot 12^n -\frac{1}{3} (- 6)^n$$ I feel that this is probably correct, but I am unsure.

In page number 50 while defining principle $G$ -bundle $P(M,G)$ they said that the action of the Lie group $G$ is Free and didn't specify that the action is Proper . But they stated $M=P/G$ where $P/G$ is the quotient space of $P$ by the action of $G$ .  By equality I feel that they have assumed diffeomorphism between $M$ and $P/G$ and hence must have assumed a smooth manifold structure on $P/G$ . The first thing that came to my mind is the Quotient Manifold Theorem (QMT) in order to assume the smooth manifold structure on $P/G$ . But in the hypothesis of (QMT) the action of $G$ is assumed to be Proper. So technically we can't apply (QMT) to give a differentiable structure on $P/G$ unless we prove that the the given Free action of $G$ is actually a Proper action. My questions are following: 1 Do we have to prove that the action of $G$ is Proper or it is assumed to be proper so that we can apply (QMT)? 2 Or we dont have to use (QMT) and somehow in a different way we can give  a diffrentiable structure on $P/G$ ? 3 Or they have not assumed any differentiable structure on $P/G$ and by the equality $M= P/G$ they just mean a bijection between two sets and later they gave the smooth manifold structure on $P/G$ using the differentiable structure of $M$ ?

3095781,Explicit computation of euler number of tangent bundle of sphere,"This is related to Bott-Tu Sec 11, Sphere Bundles. I would like to compute the euler characteristic of sphere bundle concretely. I have figured out the following so far. Let $S^k$ be the $k-$ sphere. Consider vector field $v$ starting from south pole to north pole by flowing. Clearly this gives a section to $T(S^k)$ . Now normalize this section by considering any riemannian metric $||\cdot||$ by $\frac{v}{||v||}$ and this gives a section on sphere bundle of $S^k$ with fiber $S^{k-1}$ away from 2 points(i.e. south and north pole). Since Euler number can be computed by sum of local degrees at south pole and north pole, I can compute the local degree at local trivializations of sphere bundle at south pole $a$ and north pole $b$ . WLOG, one can assume local trivializations look like $D(x)\times S^{k-1}$ where $D(x)$ is some open disk on sphere $S^k$ centered at $x$ . Then consider the following maps. $\partial D(x)\xrightarrow{s}D(x)\times S^{k-1}\xrightarrow{\pi_2} S^{k-1}$ and denote total map as $f_x$ . Pick volume form $\omega$ on $S^{k-1}$ where $\omega$ can be standard volume form. Since the degree is computed locally, one can consider $\int_{\partial D(x)}f_x^\star(\omega)=\int_{\partial D(x)}s^\star\psi$ where $\psi$ is the global angular form defined over $E$ and $x$ can be either south or north pole. This follows from $f_x^\star$ defines form restricts cohomology generator on each fiber and thus same cohomology class as global angular form. Hence they differ by a total differential and then one can apply stoke theorem to see the integral agrees.(Here I have already assumed the support of $\psi$ is away from $D(x)$ and one can shrink the size of disk if necessary.) If I denote $s(x)=(x,v(x))$ with $v(x)\in S^{k-1}$ , then $\pi_2\circ s(x)=v(x)$ . Hence $\int_{\partial D(x)}f_x^\star(\omega)=\int_{\partial D(x)} v^\star(\omega)$ . I can take $\omega$ to be standard volume form of $k-1$ sphere. $\textbf{Q:}$ Now I do not see an obvious way to compute this integral though I can write down the formula. How do I proceed further?

$$ where $U\in U(n)$ depends on $\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in S^3$ , $\epsilon^{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol, $i,j,k=1,2,3$ , and the duplicated indexes are summed over. It is claimed that $N$ is an integer, but why? Update 02/02/2019 I think I got an argument for $n=2$ . In this case, $U=e^{i \varphi} q$ with $q\in SU(2)$ .
Due to the trace and the Levi-Civita symbol in $N$ , $\varphi$ does not contribute to $N$ . As $Tr[q^{\dagger}\partial_i q]=0$ and $(q^{\dagger}\partial_i q)^{\dagger}=-q^{\dagger}\partial_i q$ , $q^{\dagger}\partial_i q$ in geneeral has the form $q^{\dagger}\partial_i q=i(A_i \sigma_x +B_i \sigma_y+C_i \sigma_z )$ with $A_i,B_i,C_i$ real and $\sigma$ 's being the Pauli matrices. As a result, we have $$
N=\frac{1}{2\pi^2}\int_{S^3} d^3x\ \epsilon^{ijk} A_i B_i C_i\ .
$$ Furthermore, $SU(2)$ is diffeomorphic to $S^3$ , and thus $q$ can be parametrized as the three angles $\boldsymbol{\Omega}=(\psi,\theta,\phi)$ of $S^3$ . By choosing the right convention, $N$ can be further written as $$
N=\frac{1}{2\pi^2}\int_{S^3} d^3x \left|\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{\Omega}}{\partial\boldsymbol{x}}\right| \sin(\theta)\sin^2(\phi)\ ,
$$ where $\left|\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{\Omega}}{\partial\boldsymbol{x}}\right|$ is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix. 
Clearly, $N$ indicates how many times the $\boldsymbol{x}$ - $S^3$ warps around the $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ - $S^3$ . For $n>2$ , I may guess that some $SU(2)$ subgroup of $U(n)$ accounts for $N$ , but I can be wrong.","['algebraic-topology', 'multivariable-calculus', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-topology', 'lie-groups']"

3096105,Irreducible vs. indecomposable representation,"I'm currently reading Serre's Linear Representations of Finite Groups , and I'm kind of confused regarding the concepts of irreducibility and indecomposability. If I'm understanding it correctly, an irreducible representation is a representation $(\rho, V)$ of a group $G$ which does not has a non-trivial subrepresentation (i.e. a representation $(\rho|_W, W)$ where $W\subseteq V$ is a $G$ -stable subspace). While an indecomposable representation is a representation that is not isomorphic to any direct sum of other representations. Wikipedia and other sources say that irreducibility implies indecomposability, which seems logical (not 100 % sure why though), while Serre says the following: Let $\rho:G \rightarrow GL(V) $ be a linear representation of $G$ . We say that it is irreducible or simple if $V$ is not $0$ and if no vector subspace of $V$ is stable under $G$ , except of course $0$ and $V$ . By theorem I [which says that there exists a $G$ -stable complement $W^0$ of a $G$ -stable subspace $W\subseteq V$ ], this second condition is equivalent to saying $V$ is not the direct sum of two representations. Does this not mean that irreducibility is equivalent indecomposability, and thereby going against what Wikipedia says? Thanks! P.S. I'm getting kind of annoyed at this book for being ""to concise"" and skipping a lot of details. Does anyone have any other recommendations on introductory books on representation theory?","['representation-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra']"

I see the correct solutions should be $\pm2/3\pi$ and the values when $\sin\theta = 0$ . Although I missed the early factorisation I don't know what I'm doing to actually arrive at an incorrect answer: $$\begin{align}
2\sin\theta\cos\theta + \sin\theta &= 0 \qquad\text{(square)} \tag{1} \\
4\sin^2\theta\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta &= 0 \tag{2}\\

3096330,Show that $Y_n := (\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_i)^{1/n}$ converges with probability 1,"I'm dealing with a problem about stochastic and statistics and hope some of you can help me!

I have to show: a) $Y_n := (\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_i)^{1/n}$ converges with probability $1$ . b) calculate the exact limit of $Y_n$ I've already done some calculations, but I'm really not sure, whether everything is fine. Some pre-considerations:
To get rid of the product I took the logarithm: $\ln(Y_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln(X_i)$ After taking the logarithm the sequence $\ln(X_i)$ still is equally distributed and independent. a) I found a theorem in my lecture notes, which states, that $\frac{S_n}{n}$ (the $n$ -th partial sum of a sequence) converges and has a finite limit with probability $1$ if the sequence is integrable. It seems to me, that this Theorem might fit, but my concern is, that the logarithm of $X_i = 0$ (allowed since $X_i$ is a sequence on $[0,1]$ ) isn't integrable. b) This part some kind of ""smells"" to me like Kolmogorov's law, which states that for a sequence of indempendent and identically distributed probability variables with finite expectation value it holds: $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n}X_k = \mathbb{E}(X_1) \quad \text{a.s.}$$ So the limit would be $\lim_{n} \ln(Y_n) = \mathbb{E}(\ln(X_1))$ almost sure. But I don't see, why the expectation value of $\ln(X_i)$ should be finite for $X_i = 0$ again. So due to this concerns at $X_i = 0$ I'm not sure, whether I'm on the right track, or the problem needs to be solved differently. I would be very grateful if some of you can help me!

3096455,topology induced by function from set to power set?,"tl;dr: I've tried to construct a different way to formalize ""topological spaces"" than via open sets or neighborhoods. I have not seen this approach but it may have been done before. The definition as it currently stands is not satisfactory (see discussion below). t-topologies Consider a pair $(X,t)$ where $t:X\to \mathcal P(\mathcal P(X))$ , i.e. $t(x)\subseteq \mathcal P (X)$ (which intuitively gives for every $x$ the set of subsets of $X$ that ""x touches"") satisfies the following axiom: Axiom 1 . For any $x\in X$ and any $U\subseteq S\subseteq X$ , if $U\in t(x)$ then $S\in t(x)$ . (intuitively, if $x$ ""touches"" the set $U$ , then it also touches the same set with arbitrary additions to it). Axiom 2 . For any $x\in X$ and any $U,V\subseteq X$ , if $U,V\notin t(x)$ then $U\cup V\notin t(x)$ (easily extended to infinite unions). (intuitively, if $x$ doesn't touch either of the sets $U,V$ , then it also doesn't touch the combined set). Call this pair $(X,t)$ a "" touch-topology "" or ""t-topology"" (because they're defined via ""touch-relations"" rather than open sets). Such a pair induces a topology: $(X,T)$ , where $U\in T$ iff $\forall x\in U, U^c\notin t(x)$ . (Intuitively, a set is open if none of its members touch anything outside the set). Indeed this is a topology: the empty set obviously is in $T$ . for any $U_i\in T$ , we know that for all $x\in U_i$ , $U_i^c\notin t(x)$ , therefore since $(\bigcup _j U_j)^c\subseteq U_i^c$ we have $(\bigcup _j U_j)^c \notin t(x)$ by axiom 1. (intuitively, if $x$ touches nothing outside $U_i$ , then it also doesn't touch anything outside $\bigcup_j U_j$ ). for any $U,V\in T$ , we know that for any $x\in U\cap V$ we have $U^c\notin t(x)$ and $V^c \notin t(x)$ . Hence by axiom 2, $U^c\cup V^c = (U \cap V)^c\notin t(x)$ . Hence $U \cap V\in T$ . (easily extended to infinite intersections). Definition . Let $\mathcal X=(X,t_X)$ , $\mathcal Y=(Y,t_Y)$ be t-topologies. A function $f:X\to Y$ is touch-continuous at $x$ if for all $U\in t_X(x)$ it holds that $f(U) \in t_Y(f(y))$ . (intuitively, a function is touch-continuous if it doesn't change the things that a point touches). Theorem. Let $\mathcal X= (X,t_X), \mathcal Y = (Y,t_Y)$ be touch-topologies. If a function $f:X \to Y$ is t-continuous at $x$ then it is also ""classically"" continuous at $x$ in the topologies $(X,T_X), (Y,T_Y)$ induced by $\mathcal X$ and $\mathcal Y$ . proof. Assume $U\in T_Y$ (an open set). We must show that $f^{-1}(U)\in T_X$ . Since $U\in T_Y$ , we know that for all $y\in U$ , $U^c\notin t_Y(y)$ . Hence by t-continuity, $f^{-1}(U^c)\notin t_X(x)$ for all $x\in f^{-1}(U)$ . Hence $f^{-1}(U)\in T_X$ . I don't think we can show that continuity implies t-continuity, though I'm not sure. What's missing from this approach. My intention with this was to represent a topology according to the sets that an object ""touches"", rather than according to ""open sets"" (i.e. sets whose elements don't touch the outside). This approach is similar to the ""neighborhood"" definition of topology. However, my approach is not complete, in the sense that we cannot turn any arbitrary topology into a unique t-topology. That is, for any topology, there are multiple t-topologies (non-isomorphic) that induce that topology: for example, consider the topology induced by a directed graph $(X,R)$ ( $R$ is a relation on $X$ denoting the arrows of the graph), where the t-topology is: given a node $x$ , $U\in t_X(x)$ iff $U$ contains at least one node $y$ such that $Rxy$ . It is not hard to show that the t-topology of the transitive closure of any graph induces the same topology as the t-topology of the graph itself. My questions are: Has this approach been done before? Can we add a third axiom so that there is a bijection between topologies and t-topologies? And so that t-continuity and ""classical"" continuity are equivalent? are there any problems with this approach?",['general-topology']
