Does there exist a countably generated sigma-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ on $X$ such that  $\mathcal{A}$ is a sub-$\sigma$-algebra of $\mathcal{B}$?

2048671,A problem of colours of vertices in equilateral triangle,"I have a problem with this exercise. I spent a lot of time, but I didn't figure out anything at the moment. Maybe anyone could help me? An equilateral triangle, with side lenght $n$, is divided into $n^2$ equilateral triangles. Each vertex of these triangles, which form a triangular lattice, is coloured black or white. We do a sequence of moves. In one move we change a colour of all vertices, which lie on a line containing a side of one of these $n^2$ triangles. Compute $n \geq 2$, when it's possible to undergo from state ""all vertices are white"" to state ""accurately one is black"". I find a procedure for $n=2$ and $n=3$, so it's possible for this numbers. For $n=4$ - I spent a lot of time and I don't figure anything, so I think it's impossible for $n \geq4$ and I was trying to prove that - i tried to find invariants, semivariants, but I don't have any idea now... I will be very, very pleased, if anyone could help me, because I'm depressed, I spent a few days thinking about it and I don't know, what I should do now...","['contest-math', 'combinatorics', 'recreational-mathematics', 'coloring', 'discrete-mathematics']"

2048786,Do Contour Integrals and Infinite Series Commute? Fubini's Theorem,"I ask this question because similar questions don't address contour integrals and infinite series specifically, only evaluating a contour integral by converting it into an infinite series. I'm trying to take the contour integral of an infinite series.  My understanding is that under Fubini's theorem that under certain conditions, integrals can commute with each other, summations can commute with each other, and integrals can commute with summations. However, the requirement (as I understand it) is that the summation must converge for the summation and integral to commute; but if I knew whether or not the summation converges, I would not need to integrate first. Here's an example: $$\oint_C  \sum_{n=0}^ \infty  a_{n} \cdot f_{n}  \big(x\big) \stackrel{?}{=} \sum_{n=0}^ \infty  \oint_C  a_{n} \cdot f_{n}  \big(x\big)$$ EDIT: I'd like to further explain my question and perhaps why it's confusing.  I want to find an analytical solution to the area of a simply-connected space.  I found that I could conveniently describe this space using parametric equations, and therefore could use Green's Theorem and integrate around the boundary to obtain the area.  The parametric equations are: $$x[\theta] =  a \cdot Cos[\theta]$$ $$y[\theta] =  \sum_{n=0}^ \infty \frac{b_{n}}{n} \cdot Sin[(2n+1) \cdot \theta] + \frac{c_{n}}{n} \cdot Cos[(2n+1) \cdot  \theta ]$$ From there you can calculate $dx/d\theta$ and $dy/d\theta$ and from there $ A = \frac{1}{2} \oint_C x \cdot dy-y \cdot dx$. However, summing the integral means summing the individual areas of each term's space, while integrating the sum means integrating the area from the sum of the contribution of each term to the coordinates at a given point on the contour. These seem to be different operations to me and therefore I'm confused as to under what circumstances contour integral's and infinite series commute. EDIT 2:  I'm asking this question because I can do the integral on the right hand side (the sum of the contour integrals) in the example, but not the other (the contour integral of the sum), and need to know (1) how to test to see if both expressions are equivalent.  The suggestions so far have been to integrate both sides and see if they are equivalent, but I can't do that, hence the need for Fubini's Theorem.","['integration', 'contour-integration', 'sequences-and-series']"

2048875,"Vanishing of $H^0(X,\mathcal{L})$ and $H^0(X,\mathcal{L}^{-1})$","We have this fact: If $X$ is a smooth projective variety, and $\mathcal{L}$ is a line bundle, and $\mathcal{L}^{-1}$ its dual, then $H^0(X,\mathcal{L})$ and $H^0(X,\mathcal{L}^{-1})$ cannot both be nontrivial (except $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{O}_X)$. This can be seen by looking at the linear system. My question is: is the above statement true if one takes away the projectivity assumption? My guess is this is not true. I believe one can cook up some example on the blow up of $\mathbb{A}^2$ at a point.

2049092,Clarification about Hasse's Theorem for Elliptic Curve over Finite Fields,"In the proof of Hasse's Theorem over finite fields, one considers the Frobenous endomorphism $\phi(x,y) \rightarrow (x^q,y^q) \in E(\bar{F_q})$ and then notes that this endomorphism fixes the elements of $F_q\times F_q$ but permutes the rest of the element of ($\bar{F_q}\times \bar{F_q})\setminus (F_q\times F_q)$. Therefore, $$\#E(F_q) = \#ker(\phi - 1) = deg(\phi - 1)$$ In both Silverman's book as well as Washington's book, they go to extreme lengths (requiring Weil's pairing) in calculating the degree of this endomorphism. My question is, why can't we directly calculate the degree of this endomorphism? In other words, what's wrong with the following argument? Let's pick a point $(\bar{x},\bar{y}) \in E(\bar{F_q})\setminus E(F_q)$ which will not be fixed by Frobenous. Then $(\bar{x}^q,\bar{y}^q)$ and $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ cannot be equal. Therefore the explicit formula for the X-coordinate of $(\phi - 1)(\bar{x},\bar{y}) = (\bar{x}^q,\bar{y}^q) \oplus (\bar{x},-\bar{y})$ can be calculated using explicit point addition formula as $$\left(\frac{\bar{y}^q + \bar{y}}{\bar{x}^q - \bar{x}}\right)^2-\bar{x}^q - \bar{x} = \beta$$ for some $\beta \in \bar{F_q}\setminus F_q$ which is the the x-coordiate of some point.

In general, this not a very difficult task, however, in this case it bothers me to see $k$ both in the definition of the set with $\exists$ and in the sum index.

Since $A_n$ is a set of divisors of $n$, $A_0 = \mathbb{N}, A_1 = \{1\}, A_2 = \{1, 2\}, A_3 = \{1, 3\}$ and so on. Moreover, $a \in A_ab$ for $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$.

\end{align}
My hope is that $S_{n}\leq n!n^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha$ independant of $n$. BACKGROUND. In order to build an analytic extension from a given real-analytic function, I had to use the Faà di Bruno's formula for a composition (see for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faà_di_Bruno%27s_formula ). After some elementary computations, my problem boils down to show the convergence of
\begin{align}
\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\sum_{m\in\mathfrak{M}_{n}}\frac{\left(n+\left|m\right|\right)!}{m!}\ \prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(k+1\right)^{-m_{k}}
\end{align}
where $x\in\mathbb{C}$ is such that the complex modulus $|x|$ can be taken as small as desired (in particular, we can choose $|x|<\mathrm{e}^{-1}$ to kill any $n^{\alpha}$ term from the bound on $S_{n}$). SOME WORK. It is clear that we have to to understand the sets $\mathfrak{M}_{n}$ in order to go on (whence the tag ""combinatorics""). So I tried to see what were these sets: for $n=2$ :
\begin{array}{cc}
2&0\\
0&1
\end{array} for $n=3$ :
\begin{array}{ccc}
3&0&0\\
1&1&0\\
0&0&1
\end{array} for $n=4$ :
\begin{array}{cccc}
4&0&0&0\\
2&1&0&0\\
1&0&1&0\\
0&2&0&0\\
0&0&0&1\\
\end{array} for $n=5$ :
\begin{array}{ccccc}
5&0&0&0&0\\

1&0&0&1&0\\
1&2&0&0&0\\
0&0&0&0&1\\
0&1&1&0&0\\

We see for example that the cardinal of $\mathfrak{M}_{n}$ becomes strictly greater than $n$ if $n\geq5$. Also, because I wanted to reorder the set of summation in $S_{n}$ into a the set of all multiindices $m$ such that $|m|=j$ for $1\leq j\leq n$, I tried to count given $j$ the number of $m$ such that $|m|=j$; when $n=10$, I counted $8$ multiindices $m$ with length $|m|=4$, so that this number can be greater than $n/2$. Another remark is that the number of multiindices $m$ such that $|m|=j$ becomes larger if $j$ is ""about"" $n/2$ - don't ask me what ""about"" means here, I just tried some example and saw this phenomenon.","['combinatorics', 'summation', 'sequences-and-series']"

Note: It is a known theorem, that for any Lipschitz path $\ga$, the speed $\nu_{\ga}(t)$ exists for almost all $t$, and $L(\ga)=\int \nu_{\ga}(t) dt$ (See ""A course in metric geometry"" by Burago,Burago and Ivanov, theorem 2.7.6). In fact, the proof actually shows that for almost all $t$, $g'(t),\nu_{\ga}(t)$ exist and are equal. I am asking about their equality at a single point (assuming existence). Partial Results: $$g'(t)=\frac{d}{dt}L(\ga|_{[0,t]})=\lim_{\Delta t \to 0+} \frac{L(\ga|_{[0,t+\Delta t]})-L(\ga|_{[0,t]})}{\Delta t}=\lim_{\Delta t \to 0+} \frac{L(\ga|_{[t,t+\Delta t]})}{\Delta t} $$ $$ \ge  \lim_{\Delta t \to 0+} \frac{d\left( \ga(t),\ga(t+\Delta t) \right)}{\Delta t} = \nu_{\ga}(t)$$ So, we established $g'(t) \ge \nu_{\ga}(t) $. The question about the other direction still remains. In the special case, where $X$ is a length space, and $\gamma$ is a geodesic (i.e locally a shortest path), we have that $d\left( \ga(t),\ga(t+\Delta t) \right)=L(\ga|_{[t,t+\Delta t]})$ (for small enough $\Delta t$), so the equality obviously holds. Perhaps it will be easier to prove this for length spaces, but without the assumption that $\ga$ is a geodesic, I do not see how it helps.","['real-analysis', 'curves', 'measure-theory', 'lipschitz-functions', 'metric-spaces']"

\end{equation}
and also we can consider the space
\begin{equation}
c_{0 0} = \{{\{a_n\}}_{n = 1}^{\infty} : \mbox{ exists } n_0 \in \mathbb{N} \mbox{ such that } a_n = 0 \mbox{ for all } n \in \mathbb{N} \mbox{ with } n \geq n_0\}\mbox{.}
\end{equation}
Now, let $(X , \mathcal{M} , \mu)$ a measure space. Equally, by definition, we know that
\begin{equation}
L^p = \left\{f : X \to \mathbb{R} \mbox{ (or } \mathbb{C}\mbox{)}, \int_X {|f|}^p d \mu < \infty\right\} \mbox{ and } L^{\infty} = \{f : X \to \mathbb{R} \mbox{ (or } \mathbb{C}\mbox{)}, f \mbox{ is esentially bounded}\}

Then, without much difficulty, we can show that ${\ell}^p = L^p$, ${\ell}^{\infty} = L^{\infty}$ and $c_{0 0} = \mathscr{S}$ if we consider the measure space $(\mathbb{N} , \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) , \mu)$, where $\mu$ is the counter measure on $(\mathbb{N} , \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}))$, instead of an other abstract measure space $(X , \mathcal{M} , \mu)$.

Example. We consider the measure space $(\mathbb{N} , \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) , \mu)$, where $\mu : \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \to [0 , + \infty]$ is the counter measure on $(\mathbb{N} , \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}))$. Let ${\{a_n\}}_{n = 1}^{\infty}$ a sequence of real (or complex) numbers. One hand, let $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$) a non-negative function, which implies, considering the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$, that $f$ is a measurable function and we suppose that $f(n) = a_n$ for all $n = 1 , 2 , \ldots$. Let $p \in [1 , \infty)$. Then
$$
\int_{\mathbb{N}} {|f|}^p d \mu = \int_{\bigcup_{n = 1}^{\infty} \{n\}} {|f|}^p d \mu = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\int_{\{n\}} {|f|}^p d \mu = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \int_{\mathbb{N}} \left({|f|}^p {\chi}_{\{n\}}\right) d \mu\mbox{.}
$$
The other hand, given $n \in \mathbb{N}$, ${|f|}^p {\chi}_{\{n\}} : \mathbb{N} \to [0 , \infty)$ is
$$
({|f|}^p {\chi}_{\{n\}})(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{rcl}
{|f(x)|}^p & \mbox{si} & x \in \{n\}\mbox{;}
\\
0 & \mbox{si} & x \notin \{n\}\mbox{;}
\end{array}
\right\} = \left\{
\begin{array}{rcl}
{|f(n)|}^p & \mbox{si} & x = n\mbox{;}
\\
0 & \mbox{si} & x \neq n\mbox{,}
\end{array}
\right.
$$
because of this
$$
\int_{\mathbb{N}} \left({|f|}^p {\chi}_{\{n\}}\right) d \mu = {|f(n)|}^p \mu(\{n\}) + 0 \cdot \mu({\{n\}}^c) = {|f(n)|}^p \mu(\{n\}) + 0 = {|f(n)|}^p \mu(\{n\}) = {|f(n)|}^p\mbox{.}
$$
Then
$$
\int_{\mathbb{N}} {|f|}^p d \mu = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \int_{\mathbb{N}} \left({|f|}^p {\chi}_{\{n\}}\right) d \mu = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} {|f(n)|}^p = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} {|a_n|}^p\mbox{.}

Finally,
$$
L^p = \left\{f : X \to \mathbb{R} \mbox{ (or } \mathbb{C}\mbox{)}, \int_X {|f|}^p d \mu < \infty\right\} = \left\{{\{a_n\}}_{n = 1}^{\infty} : \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} {|a_n|}^p < \infty\right\} = {\ell}^p\mbox{.}

2050362,"Are Random Step Functions random elements of $L_2([0,1])$?","Let $(\Omega,\Sigma,\mathbb{P})$ be a probability space, and define $(L_2[0,1],\mathcal{B}(L_2[0,1])$ be the Borel measure space of $L_2([0,1])$ with respect to the standard $L_2$ norm. Define a sequence of random variables $c_k$ for $1\leq k \leq M$ for some fixed $M>0$. Then if $\{x_1,...,x_m\}$ are equally spaced points on $[0,1]$, then the random variables $(c_k)$ define a random step function $g$, such that $g(\omega,x) = c_k(\omega)$ for $x\in[x_{k},x_{k+1})$, $\omega\in\Omega$ (basically, for every $\omega \in \Omega$, we define a sample path in $L_2[0,1]$). We now define a random element: $X: \Omega \mapsto L_2([0,1])$ is a random element if for all $B\in \mathcal{B}(L_2([0,1]))$, then $X^{-1}(B) \in \Sigma$. Question: Is my random step function $g$ a random element from $(\Omega,\Sigma,\mathbb{P})$ to $(L_2[0,1], \mathcal{B}(L_2[0,1]))$? My intuition believes that I am correct, since $L_2[0,1]$ is a Banach space with respect to the $L_2$ norm, and so Wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_element ) says that so long as every linear bounded functional applied to $X$ is a random variable (which it is for our function g) then $X$ is a random element, although I am not convinced by this statement. Would anyone happen to know how to show that for every closed ball $B$ in $L_2[0,1]$, then $\{\omega\in\Omega | g(\omega)\in L_2[0,1]\} \in \Sigma$? EDIT 1: I forgot to mention that here, we assume that $\sup_{1\leq k\leq m}|c_k| \leq C_0$ almost surely, for some constant $0<C_0<\infty$, and so $g$ is square integrable almost surely. EDIT 2: I think the proof would have to do with the fact that each $c_k$ is a Random Variable with respect to $(\Omega,\Sigma,\mathbb{P})$, and there are only finitely many $c_k$, but that is as far as my intuition extends.","['probability-theory', 'random-functions', 'measure-theory', 'random-variables']"

2050467,Deciding whether Galois group is $C_6$ or $S_3$,"I'm stuck between two possibilities for a Galois group of an extension, and I could use a hint on how to decide. First we consider the Galois group of the splitting field of $h(X) = X^3 + 3X + \sqrt 3\in \mathbb Q(\sqrt3)[X]$ over $\mathbb Q(\sqrt 3)$ (that $h$ is prime and seperable is easy to see). Observe that if $\alpha$ is a root of $h$ then the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ is $f(X) = X^6 - 6X^4 + 9X^2 - 3$, meaning that $[\mathbb Q(\alpha):\mathbb Q] = 6$. The discriminant of $h$ is $\Delta(h) = 27 = (3\sqrt3)^2$ i.e. it is a square in $\mathbb Q(\sqrt3)$. By multiplicativity of degree, this forces $\operatorname{Gal}(h/\mathbb Q(\sqrt 3))\simeq C_3$. The last part in fact means that $\mathbb Q(\alpha)/\mathbb Q(\sqrt 3)$ is Galois, which in this case (not in general) implies that $\mathbb Q(\alpha)/\mathbb Q$ is Galois (in both cases the condition that needs checking is normality). The goal is to calculate $\operatorname{Gal}(\mathbb Q(\alpha)/\mathbb Q)$ . A further observation is that the Galois group of the Galoisian closure of $\mathbb Q(\alpha^2)/\mathbb Q$ is also $C_3$, which, since we already know $[\mathbb Q(\alpha) : \mathbb Q] = 6$, means that $\operatorname{Gal}(\mathbb Q(\alpha)/\mathbb Q(\alpha^2))\simeq C_2$. So there is a subgroup of order $2$, and a subgroup of order $3$. If there are more subgroups of order $2$, the group we're trying to calculate is $S_3$. If not, it is $C_6$. This is a practice exam question, which means there should be something I can do that isn't just loading up Maple and calculating roots (which I could do since $X^6 - 6X^4 + 9X^2 - 3 = (X^3 + 3X + \sqrt 3)(X^3 + 3X - \sqrt 3)$).

\begin{equation}
    \sin(v+w)+\sin(u+v)+\sin(u+w)=-\sin(v+w)\sin(u+v)\sin(u+w)

2050543,How did the author take this derivative?,"From Taylor's Classical Mechanics, pg. 220: Given: $f(y+\eta (x)\alpha,y'+\eta (x) '\alpha,x)$ Derivative: $\frac{\partial f(y+\eta (x)\alpha,y'+\eta (x) '\alpha,x)}{\partial \alpha}=\eta \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}+\eta' \frac{\partial f}{\partial y'}$ I guess I can see how the derivative is a summation of 2 terms - it's because there are 2 terms in the argument for the function that depend on $\alpha$ . However, I don't see where the $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ and the $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y'}$ come from. I would have just said that the derivative with respect to $\alpha$ is $\eta + \eta '$ . Update: My main question is just this now: why does the author take the derivative of $f$ w.r.t $y$ ? He wanted to find the derivative with respect to a parameter that introduced, which is $\alpha$ .","['derivatives', 'calculus-of-variations', 'partial-derivative', 'calculus']"

Suppose that $E$ is totally bounded. That is: for all $\varepsilon > 0$, there exist finitely many points $x_1, \ldots , x_n \in X$ such that: $E \subset \bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} B(x_i, \varepsilon)$. So : given $\varepsilon > 0$, we have $D \subset E$ and $E \subset \bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} B(x_i, \varepsilon)$ with $x_1, \ldots , x_n \in X$. But then, by the transitive property (applied to subsets), it follows that $D \subset \bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} B(x_i, \varepsilon)$, where $x_1, \ldots , x_n \in X$.

2050793,Proof of the Wirtinger inequality,"This is an exercise from the book ""Complex Geometry, An Introduction"" by Huybrechts. The statement involves to prove that the restriction of the fundamental form $\omega$ of a vector space $V, I, \langle, \rangle$ (with real dimension $2n$ and an almost complex structure $I$ compatible with the inner product $\langle, \rangle$), to a sub-space $W$ of real dimension $2m$, is not greater than $m! vol$ where $vol$ is the volume form of $W$. $$\omega^m|_W\le m!\cdot vol$$
The book has a hint: There exists an orthonomal basis $\{u_i, v_i:i=1,2,\cdots, m\}$ of $W$ such that $$\omega|_W=\sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i u^i\wedge v^i$$ Where $u^i, v^i, i=1, 2, \cdots, m$ are the dual basis. From this one is easy to prove the conclusion. I did find a proof without using the hint from the book ""Complex Analytic Sets"" by E.M. Chirka and I understood the proof well. My question is how to prove the expression in the hint. Let $P: V\rightarrow W$ be the orthogonal projection and $J=P\circ I$ then I was led to the conclusion that the existence of the above expression depends on a fact that $J^2: W\rightarrow W$ has a real eigenvalue whose eigenspace is of dimension (at least) $2$. Then I don't know how to prove this. Any hints are appreciated.

2050837,Name the generalization of regular tetrahedron in higher dimension,"By a regular tetrahedron, I’m referring to the tetrahedron formed by connecting the vertices of the $3$-simplex with the “far corner” $(1, 1, 1)$.
That is, the four vertices of this regular tetrahedron are $(1, 0, 0) ,\, (0, 1, 0) ,\, (0, 0, 1)$, and $(1, 1, 1)$, shown as blue edges one on the right. My question is this: What do you call the counterpart (generalization) of such tetrahedron in higher dimensions? That is, connect the vertices of the $n$-simplex with the ""far corner"" $(1, 1, 1,\ldots 1)$ so that one gets a shape which vertices are the unit vectors $e_i$ and $\sum e_i$, and the sides have the same length $\sqrt{n-1}$. If there's not a name for such construction , how about alternatively connect the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ with $(0, 1, 1) ,\, (1, 0, 1) ,\, (1, 1, 0)$? This alternative tetrahedron is shown below with orange edges. One can compare it with the previous one involving the simplex with blue edges. The higher dimension counterpart of the orange tetrahedron has vertices being the complement (binary flip) of that from the blue one, e.g. $(0,1,0,\ldots, 0) \to (1,0,1,\ldots, 1)$. It is congruent to the previous one, also with side length $\sqrt{n-1}$.","['terminology', '3d', 'geometry']"

Hence I believe my question is not a duplicate. This question is related (I think). Question: To what extent can we extend the notion of equivalence relation, or of a relation in general, to classes from sets (i.e. including proper classes)? If it is a meaningful restriction, I am interested primarily in the case when the class is the objects of a category. A reference will suffice for an answer and would be preferred as well -- this seems like it must be a standard topic of set theory, but since I am completely unfamiliar with the set theory literature, I do not know where to begin to look for clarification about (equivalence) relations for classes. Motivation: Consider a category $\mathscr{C}$. We get transitivity and reflexivity of the objects for free from the axioms of a category. To force symmetry I believe we can just restrict to the subcategory with the same objects but which contains only the invertible morphisms. This subcategory is a groupoid or setoid if I'm not mistaken. However, the definition on Wikipedia says that a groupoid has to be a small category, which is more restricitive than what I have in mind. If I'm not mistaken, what I am describing above is just classifying the objects in a category up to equivalence.","['category-theory', 'reference-request', 'equivalence-relations', 'elementary-set-theory']"

$$\ln[L(\beta;x)]=\sum_{i=1}^n\left[-\ln(2\beta)-\frac{|x_i|}{\beta}\right]

$$\frac{\partial \ln[L(\beta;x)]}{\partial\beta}=-n\beta+\frac{1}{\beta^2}\sum_{i=1}^n|x_i|=0.$$
