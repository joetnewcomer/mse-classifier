1316591,Logic and proof,"I had an assignment from class, to proof for all real numbers $R$, $x$ is subsets of $R$, if $x^2 - 2x\ne -1$,
then $x\ne 1$. in contrapositive proof and contradiction. So far with my knowledge, I should construct a direct proof, and show that it is not possible. I have no idea how to start with. Ironically, I could construct a proof by contraposition which assume $x=1$, and 
'$x^2 - 2x = -1$'.
As we apply $x=1$ in to '$x^2 - 2x$', we get $-1$ which is a negation of the hypothesis of the original theorem - we proved it with proof by contraposition. I have no idea about proof by contradiction by the way. p.s. Sorry I don't know how to write words into mathematical symbols, but I think this should still work.",['discrete-mathematics']
1316594,Determinant of the Kronecker Product of Two Matrices,"I'd like to know how can be shown that $\det(A \otimes B) = \det(A)^m \det(B)^n$ when $A$ and $B$ are square matrices of size $n$ and $m$ respectively and $\otimes$ represents the Kronecker product of $A$ and $B$. I've seen some proofs using eigenvalues of $A$ and $B$, but since not every matrix has eigenvalues (at least not in all rings), I'd like a more intrinsic proof, maybe using the fact that $M_{(nm)^2} \cong M_{n^2} \otimes M_{m^2}$. It all comes down to showing that $\det(A \otimes I) = \det(A)^m$ and using some smart property (e.g. $(A\otimes B)(C\otimes D) = (AC) \otimes (BD)$), but I wasn't able to do even that.","['kronecker-product', 'matrices', 'determinant', 'tensor-products', 'linear-algebra']"
1316599,Dimensions of Grassmannians?,"I'm trying to work out the dimensions of some examples of Grassmannians but I can't seem to do it. Here is what I understand: The Grassmanian $G(k,n)$ is the set of all $k$ planes in $\mathbb R^n$. One can construct the Grassmanian as the quotient space of the set of $k$-frames with two $k$-frames $x,y$ equivalent if and only if there is an invertible matrix $m$ such that $y = mx$. The whole set has dimension $kn$. The cardinality of one equivalence class is $k^2$. So I guess the dimension of the Grassmanian $Gr(k,n)$ should be $nk - k^2$. Assuming this the dimension of $Gr(n, T\mathbb R^m) = \bigcup_{x \in \mathbb R^m} Gr(n. T_x \mathbb R^m)$ should be $2m n - n^2$ since the tangent bundle has dimension $2m$. Now I found an example with $n=2, m=3$ that I don't understand: Consider the map $$ f(t,s) := (t^2 + 2s, t^3 + 3st, t^4 4 t^2 s)$$ The goal is to find an immersion $\widetilde{f}$ such that $\pi \circ \widetilde{f} = f$ (where $\pi$ is the canonical projection). In the example, $\widetilde{f}$ turns out to be $$ \widetilde{f} = (f,-2t^2, {8 \over 3}t)$$ so this is a map into $\mathbb R^5$ (but it's actually supposed to be an immersion into $Gr(n,T\mathbb R^m)$). But if I use my formula above for the dimension of the Grassmannnian I get $(2m) n - n^2 = 12 - 4 = 8$ since in this example, $n=2$ and $m=3$. Please could someone help me understand the dimenions of this example of Grassmanian/immersion?","['differential-geometry', 'grassmannian']"

1316691,"Smallest graph with automorphism group the quaternion $8$-group, $Q_8$","Frucht's Theorem states that for any finite group $G$ there is a finite (undirected) graph $\Gamma$ for which the automorphism group $\text{Aut}(\Gamma)$ of $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $G$ , and for many small groups $G$ it is not hard to construct a small graph $\Gamma$ whose automorphism group $\text{Aut}(\Gamma)$ is isomorphic to $G$ . For example, $\Bbb Z_1$ , $\Bbb Z_2$ , and $S_3$ are the automorphism groups of the complete graphs $K_1, K_2$ , $K_3$ , respectively, $\Bbb Z_2 \times \Bbb Z_2$ is the automorphism group of , $\Bbb Z_3$ is the automorphism group of the $9$ -vertex graph , $\Bbb Z_4$ and $\Bbb Z_5$ are respectively the automorphism groups of the $12$ - and $15$ -vertex analogues of that graph given (informally) by replacing the central triangle with a square or pentagon, $\Bbb Z_6$ is the automorphism group of the $12$ -vertex graph , and $\Bbb Z_7$ , $\Bbb Z_8$ , and $\Bbb Z_9$ are the respectively the automorphism groups of the $14$ -, $16$ -, and $18$ -vertex analogues of that graph given by replacing the hexagons with heptagons, octagons, and nonagons. This accounts for all groups of order $< 10$ (in fact, except for the example for $\Bbb Z_4$ , these examples are all minimal w.r.t. vertex count, at least among connected graphs) except $\Bbb Z_2 \times \Bbb Z_2 \times \Bbb Z_2$ , $\Bbb Z_3 \times \Bbb Z_3$ , and the quaternion $8$ -group, $Q_8$ . One can modify without much fuss the above examples to produce graphs with automorphism groups the abelian groups in this list, but it is not so clear (to me) to see how to construct a reasonably small graph with automorphism group $Q_8$ : What is the minimal number of vertices of a graph $\Gamma$ for which $\text{Aut}(\Gamma) \cong Q_8$ ? What is an example of such a graph that achieves this minimum? Among such graphs, which has (have) the minimal number of edges? We can given an upper bound for the vertex count: A theorem of Babai says for all groups $G \not\cong \Bbb Z_3, \Bbb Z_4, \Bbb Z_5$ there is a graph $\Gamma$ with $\text{Aut}(\Gamma) \cong G$ such that the action of $\text{Aut}(G)$ has only two orbits, and so in particular has vertex count $V(\Gamma)$ no larger than $2|G|$ ; thus, there is a graph $\Gamma$ with $\text{Aut}(\Gamma) \cong Q_8$ and $V(\Gamma) \leq 16$ . (I expect that $16$ is also the minimum achievable.) One can attempt to solve this by exploiting a constructive proof of Frucht's Theorem: Roughly, one starts with a Cayley graph of $G$ (which is directed and colored according to generator), which has automorphism group (of directed, colored graphs) $G$ . Then, one replaces each edge with a suitable (undirected) graph, choosing a different replacement graph for each generator, to avoid introducing new symmetries. It is not clear, however, that this approach can produce a graph with $\leq 16$ vertices and automorphism group $Q_8$ . The simplest Cayley graph of $Q_8$ is , but this already has $16$ edges, and it's hard to see how one could suitably replace them without added more than $8$ new vertices in total. This answer , by the way, gives a graph with $32$ vertices with automorphism group $Q_8$ (acting with $4$ orbits on the graph): . Incidentally, one can use the above approach to improve upon this result, i.e., construct a graph $\Gamma$ with $< 32$ vertices and automorphism group $Q_8$ : Let $S(p, q)$ denote the graph with three vertices $a, b, c$ , $p$ edges between $a$ and $b$ , and $q$ edges between $b$ and $c$ . Then, we can replace the red arrows in the above Cayley graph with $S(p, q)$ (appropriately oriented) and the green arrows with $S(p', q')$ , where $p, q, p', q'$ are chosen to avoid introducing new automorphisms. Each replacement adds one vertex, so the resulting graph has $24$ vertices. (This graph is, however, not simple, and so is less than entirely satisfying.)

These equations may be solved for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $z$ to give a parametric representation of $C$ with $z$ as a parameter. (a) Find a unit tangent vector $T$ to $C$ at the point $P$ without using an explicit knowledge of the parametric representation. (b) Check the result in part (a) by determining a parametric representation of $C$ with $z$ as a parameter. For (b), I solved the two equations for the surfaces given to get $y^2=25-z^2$ and $x^2=2z^2-25$. Since we're looking for the curve that contains $P$, $x$, $y$ should be positive so we get $y=\sqrt{25-z^2}$ and $x=\sqrt{2z^2-25}$. So from this I get the parametric representation $(\sqrt{2z^2-25}, \sqrt{25-z^2},z)$ for the curve $C$. Is this the correct way of finding the parametrization?

1316942,Definition by degree and intersection number are equivalent (linking number). [repost],"I will here restate a question I asked earlier. It did not have much succes (probably by an incomplete introduction of the problem on my part). I am reading a paper by Ricca ( http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/ricca.pdf p.1338 on the bottom) on the linking number. I would like to see that its definition as the degree of the map $\Psi$ is equal to that by intersection number. A link $L$ has two component knots $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$, these denote embeddings of $S^1$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Consider
$$\Psi: \mathbb{T} \,\,(= C_1\times C_2)\to S^2: (s,t)\mapsto \textbf{n}(s,t) = \frac{\gamma_1(s) - \gamma_2(t)}{\bigl|\gamma_1(s) - \gamma_2(t)\bigr|}
$$ 
Then $\text{deg} \Psi$ is one definition of the linking number. Taking a Seifert Surface $M$ of $\gamma_1$  (i.e. an orientable surface with boundary $\gamma_1$) then its intersection number with $\gamma_2$ will also give the linking number. Now I would like to prove that these are equivalent. Therefore consider the orientable manifold $$N = (M\times\gamma_2) \,\, \bigm\backslash \,\bigcup_{m\in M\cap \gamma_2} \mathcal{B}(m,\epsilon)
$$ 
with boundary 
$$\partial N = (\gamma_1\times\gamma_2) \cup \bigl(\bigcup_{m\in M\cap\gamma_2}\mathcal{S}(m,\epsilon)\bigr)
$$
Also consider $\overline{\Psi}:N\to S^2: (x,y)\mapsto \frac{y-x}{|y-x|}$. Its restriction to $\gamma_1\times\gamma_2$ is now $\Psi$. The degree of $\overline{\Psi}$ restricted to $\partial N$ is now zero. So we get 
$$\text{deg}\biggl(\overline{\Psi}\biggm| {\gamma_1\times \gamma_2}\biggr) + \text{deg}\biggl(\overline{\Psi}\biggm|{\bigcup_{m\in M\cap \gamma_2}  \mathcal{S}(m,\epsilon)}    \biggr) =0 \text{.}
$$
The first term gives the linking number defined by degree. How do I see that the second term gives the intersection number? I know this has to do with the orientations, but I don't have enough feeling for this yet, to write this down rigorously. I really hope that someone could explain how this works or at least give me hint. Thanks in advance.","['differential-topology', 'knot-theory', 'knot-invariants', 'general-topology']"
1316999,How to use Laplace method to get the asymptotic expansion of multiple integral,"I meet difficulty when I try to get the asymptotic behaviour of multiple integral as x tends to plus infinity. And $-1<$p$<1$
$$\int_x^{+\infty}\int_x^{+\infty}e^{-{\frac{1}{2\sigma^2(1-p^2)}\ \ (u^2+2puv+v^2)}}dudv$$First, I can transform the variable to move x into integrant.$$\int_0^{+\infty}\int_0^{+\infty}e^{-{\frac{1}{2\sigma^2(1-p^2)}\ \ (u^2+2puv+v^2+(2+2p)x^2+(2+2p)(u+v)x)}}dudv$$
Then,apply transform:
$$
\
  \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
      &a=u+v\\

To apply Laplace method, I have to  view the first part of the integrant as a function g(a), and show that g is not too bad. But it seems that I cannot prove that. Or maybe I have made things worse. We can try another transform: $$
\
  \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
      &a=u+pv\\
      &b=v

$$
Then get $$\int_x^{+\infty}\int_{pb+x}^{+\infty}e^{-{\frac{1}{2\sigma^2(1-p^2)}\ \ (a^2+(1-p^2)b^2)}}dadb$$
The asymototic behavior of the error function may be inappropriate here, since pb+x may fail to tend to infinity. But when $p\ge0$, we have $pb+x\ge x$, thus the integral can be controled by $$\int_x^{+\infty}\int_{x}^{+\infty}e^{-{\frac{1}{2\sigma^2(1-p^2)}\ \ (a^2+(1-p^2)b^2)}}dadb$$, then we can apply the asymptotic expension of error function. When $p<0$, it is a problem. However, the spirit of Laplace method is to calculate the integral near the extremum point of the integrant. So I think the first way to deal with the problem is clear. Any suggestion would be appreciated.","['asymptotics', 'probability', 'statistical-inference', 'integration']"

However, If I use something like 3622 where the numbers form closed loop with less separation the visibility is less and hence the code is strong. This was the longest running code that I had, because it was hard to crack open. I then sat down and classified these 4 digit codes into something called as 'strengthful numbers' (I could not find any other name for them) The classification is : Numbers form closed loop with less separation- $1$ unit adjacent Numbers can repeat but at max 2 times. eg. 2452 Common patterns, need be ignored like 1234,2345.

1317159,How can I find this recurrence relation? My approach seem to be wrong.,"QUESTION: A string that contains only 0s, 1s, and 2s is called a ternary string.
  Find a recurrence relation for the number of ternary strings of length
  n that do not contain two consecutive 0s or two consecutive 1s. -- My approach: Let's define a in-valid string, as the ternary string that contain two consecutive 0's or 1's, $b_n$. Now, let $a_n$ be the number of valid strings. We need to substract the number of in-valid ($b_n$) strings from the number of ternary strings, $3^n$. To count $b_n$, use the sum rule: partition the set of strings, depending on what digits start the string: The string that starts with a 2: $b_{n-1}$ ways to finish the string. The string that starts with a 1: The remaining strings that start with a 0: $b_{n-2}$ ways to end the string. The remaining strings that start with a 1: $3^{n-2}$ ways to finish the string. The remaining strings that start with a 2: $b_{n-2}$ ways to finish the string. The string that starts with a 0: The remaining strings that start with a 0: $3^{n-2}$ ways to end the string. The remaining strings that start with a 1: $b_{n-2}$ ways to finish the string. The remaining strings that start with a 2: $b_{n-2}$ ways to finish the string. Summing it up, $b_n = b_{n-1} + 4b_{n-2} + 2\cdot(3^{n-2})$. Note that the initial conditions are: $b_0 = b_1 = 0$. Also note that this recurrence relation counts the number of in-valid strings; that is the ternary strings that contain two consecutive 0's or 1's. In order to obtain the number of valid ternary strings we would need to substract this from the total number of ternary strings, $3^n$. Hence we could use $a_n = 3^n - b_n$ where $a_n$ is the number of ( valid ) ternary strings that do not contain two consecutive 1's or 0's. I tried for $b_2$ and $b_3$ but it does not give the right answers.

Improve this question I'm an aspiring software engineer and currenly in college for computer science. For some reason, no matter what I try, math is so unbearably difficult and indecipherable until I design a program for it. Yes, you read that right. I can break down a math problem step by step and write a program to solve it, but when it comes to doing it by hand, its a nightmare and I make it nowhere depending on the concept. I'm not talking about basic math like addition/subtraction. I'm talking about more algebraic concepts like functions, rationalization, parabolas, square root operations, etc. It looks dauntingly difficult written out in math notation, and the math book is no help. Programming makes math much easier to understand for me, but depending on the concept it can get very time consuming and overwhelming to build a program around it. Something as simple as $2^2$ is easier to understand if I write pow$(2,2)$. I want to understand it, its just difficult and seems impossible to understand it all. No matter how much I practice and research its tedious to gain an understanding of it. $f(g(x))$ only makes sense to me because it can be written out and visualized as 2 program functions. $g(x)$ ""returns"" a value, which is given to $f(x)$ as a ""parameter"". I've tried watching tutorials on YouTube, getting extra help, and even using Wolfram Alpha to walk me through problems. I just can't seem to overcome this obstacle.

However, to further continue, I analyzed the nature of y in different domains and obtained the values, by observation(that is, by observing how $x$, $x^x$, $x^{x^x}$, $x^{x^{x^x}}$, and so on would behave to draw a conclusion): for $x<1,$ $y$ becomes 0 for $x=1,$ $y$ becomes 1 for $x>1,$ $y$ becomes infinite These 3 points is where the first problem lies. Are these true? If so, how do we reach to the conclusion? Secondly, considering this to be true,

Now knowing that for matrix $$ A = \begin{bmatrix} i & 0 \\ 0 & -i \end{bmatrix} $$  we have that $A^4 = I_2$ and also knowing that $$ B = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} $$  we have that $B  ^2 = A^2$.  And we know that both $A,B \in GL(2,C)$ where $C$ is the field of complex numbers , we can define a representation $\phi:Q_8 \to GL(2,C)$ as follows $$\phi:a^ib^j \to A^iB^j \space \space(0 \leq i \leq 3,0 \leq j \leq 1)$$. Now I want to show that this representation is irreducible by just observing the two matrices $A$ and $B$. Is it possible ?

0 & 0 & . &..... & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 &. &  0  \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  t_n  \\

I just want to get why $\phi$ is irreducible first and then possibly attempt to generalise it. Here is my attempt. Since we are not interested in trivial vector subspaces  $W$ so we disregard $\{0\}$ and $C^2$, so if a subspace was to be found then it should be of dimension $1$ and now the only possibility for a basis of $W$ is $u=(0,1)$ and $v=(1,0)$ and so we take $W = span(u)$ or $W = span(v)$ Now  $ B = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} 0  \\ 1  \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1  \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ which $\not\in W$ if we take $W = span(u)$ However we can check that $Av = \begin{bmatrix} 0  \\ -i \end{bmatrix}$ which $\in W$ and so as we can see it is variant under one matrix but not variant under the other and so the representation is irreducible because the same thing happen if we take $W = span(v)$ , it is true what I did ?","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'representation-theory']"

Background: I'm getting this result from a numerical scan Also, it makes sense intuitively, since by drawing two cosines and trying to align them, this seems like a good configuration to get a high minimum However, I cannot find a way to prove this. You can also easily show that the required points are not saddle points of the function $f(x,r)=\cos(x)+\cos(rx)$ (the only extremum points are on $x=\pi k$, $r$ integer, and they are all maxima), and instead they must occur for the values of $r$ for which you get two equal global minima.

Theorem 4.9 states that if a function g has the limit a at $x_{0}$ , and a function f has the limit A at a and g(x)$\neq$a in some deleted neighborhood of $x_{0}$ , then the composite function f(g(x)) has the limit A at $x_{0}$ . Show that the theorem fails if we drop the condition that g(x)$\neq$a in some deleted neighborhood of $x_{0}$ . When reading the statement of the theorem before I even got to this exercise, I didn't understand why this condition was necessary. If g(x)=a in some deleted neighborhood of $x_{0}$ , how does this affect the limit of f(g(x)) at $x_{0}$ ? For example, say g is just a constant function taking the value a for every x in it's domain. If g is constant then f(g) would be constant as well, say with a value of A. Certainly g(x)=a in some deleted neighborhood of $x_{0}$. I don't see why f(g($x_{0}$))=f(a)=A wouldn't imply a limit of A at $x_{0}$ I'm guessing that while the theorem seems to hold for the example above, there are certain other cases where it does not hold. If so, could you please provide an example? More generally, is there a way to know that the theorem may not hold without this condition without the need to find a counterexample?","['calculus', 'limits']"

I'm hoping someone here can help. In functional analysis, one defines the Schwartz space (on $\mathbb{R}^n$, say) as the collection of all smooth functions whose derivatives decay ""rapidly"" (in the very precise sense given, e.g., on Wikipedia). Over at the nLab ( http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Schwartz+space ), they have what appears to be a more general definition: In functional analysis, a Schwartz space is a locally convex topological vector space $E$ with the property that whenever $U$ is an absolutely convex neighbourhood of $0$ then it contains another, say $V$, such that $U$ maps to a precompact set in the normed vector space $E_V$. For the record, I'm an expert on neither of these spaces; however, my naive intuition seems to suggest that the nLab space is somehow ""less concrete"" than the typical definition involving rapidly-decreasing derivatives. I am unable to seek out more understanding on this, however, because no reference is given at nLab. So are these notions of Schwartz spaces related? Are they the same? Is there any literature that mentions the nLab definition? Any insight would be much appreciated.","['functional-analysis', 'schwartz-space', 'general-topology', 'topological-vector-spaces']"

$$P(\text{confidence interval for } \beta) = 0.99$$ There exists test statistics $A = A(X_1,\dots,X_{20})$ and $B = B(X_1,\dots,X_{20})$  such that $$P(A \leq \beta \leq B) = 0.99$$ I have found that the MLE of $\beta$ is $\hat \beta = \bar{X}$. This can be involved into the confidence interval as functions of $X_i's$. That is, there exists $a_1,a_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $$P(a_1 \bar{X} \leq \beta  \leq \bar{X} a_2) = 0.99$$ Since $\hat \beta = \bar{X}$,
$$P(a_1 \leq \frac{\beta}{\hat \beta} \leq a_2) = 0.99$$ Now we assign $a_1 = x_{0.001}$ and $a_2 = x_{0.99}$ because finding the probability of such bounds yields $0.99$, $$P(x_{0.001} \leq \frac{\beta}{\hat \beta} \leq x_{0.99}) = 0.99$$ Now we compute the CDF of $\dfrac{\beta}{\hat \beta}$ by finding the CDF of $\hat \beta$ then applying the transform, $ Y = \frac{1}{X}$.

He then says the only real number that is infinitesimal is zero. I really don't get that. What I understand is that in order for a number to be considered infinitely small it has to be bigger then $-a$ and smaller then $a$. Well if I take $a$ to be $-2$ that means that $-1$ would be infinitesimal since it is bigger than $-2$ but smaller then $2$.

$$f(S^\circ) \subset f(S)^\circ \iff f\text{ open} \qquad f^{-1}(T^\circ) \subset f^{-1}(T)^\circ \iff f\text{ continuous}$$
$$f(S^\circ) \supset f(S)^\circ \quad (\text{relation?}) \qquad f^{-1}(T^\circ) \supset f^{-1}(T)^\circ \iff f\text{ open}$$

For the sake of enhancing my understanding, I would like a more direct proof, one that proceeds directly from the mathematical form of $\psi$ as defined above, without considering a probability distribution.

1318360,Geometry: What is being calculated here?,"Context: I am a computer graphics programmer looking at a code-implementation. I need help understanding a function that has neither been documented properly nor commented. Given a circle with circumference $c$ in a Cartesian coordinate space. Now each point on this circle is defined by Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. I need some explanations as to what the following calculations achieve, please excuse the improper use of symbols: $$
\begin{align}
nX = \frac {x}{c}\\
nY = \frac {y}{c}
\end{align}
$$ I believe $n$ stands for 'normal' or vector. then... $$
\begin{align}
rdX = nX \cdot 2\pi\\
rdY = nY \cdot \pi
\end{align}
$$ I assume 'rd' stands for radians. What really puzzles me here is why nX is multiplied with $2\pi$, while $nY$ is only multiplied by $\pi$. $$
\begin{align}
\sin Y = \sin(rdY + \pi)
\end{align}
$$ At this point I'm completely lost... now finally:
$$
\begin{align}
a = 2\pi\cdot\sin(rdX)\cdot\sin Y\\
b = 2\pi\cdot\cos(rdX)\cdot\sin Y\\
d = 2\pi\cdot\cos(rdy)
\end{align}
$$ Very simple question; What is being calculated here? What do a,b and d represent? At first i figured that this was a conversion from Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates. But given a closer look, this is not at all how I would calculate them. What am I looking at here? EDIT: I will include the source of these calculations to clarify their context. They are part of a library that provides functions for working with Simplex Noise . They appear in functions that sample a generated noise field. This noise field can be sampled in n-dimensions. This sampling means that I provide a set of parameters (usually coordinates) to the noise functions, which return a noise value, eg: var noiseValue = simplexNoise.get2DNoise( x, y )
var noiseValue = simplexNoise.get3DNoise( x, y, z )
var noiseValue = simplexNoise.get4DNoise( x, y, z, w ) An example: If I generate a grid of points in a plane dimension (two dimensions), and then sample noise values of those points using their coordinates: z = simplexNoise.get2DNoise( x, y ) Then now I suddenly have a third dimension. This to say i started with this , and ended up sampling my z values to result in this . The noise function assures me that I do not have completely random values. Now however, I want to sample noise on a spherical surface. And I encounter these two functions: FastSimplexNoise.prototype.getSpherical2DNoise = function (c, x, y) {
  var nx = x / c;
  var ny = y / c;
  var rdx = nx * 2 * Math.PI;
  var rdy = ny * Math.PI;
  var sinY = Math.sin(rdy + Math.PI);
  var sinRds = 2 * Math.PI;
  var a = sinRds * Math.sin(rdx) * sinY;
  var b = sinRds * Math.cos(rdx) * sinY;
  var d = sinRds * Math.cos(rdy);

  return this.get3DNoise(a, b, d);
};

FastSimplexNoise.prototype.getSpherical3DNoise = function (c, x, y, z) {
  var nx = x / c;
  var ny = y / c;
  var rdx = nx * 2 * Math.PI;
  var rdy = ny * Math.PI;
  var sinY = Math.sin(rdy + Math.PI);
  var sinRds = 2 * Math.PI;
  var a = sinRds * Math.sin(rdx) * sinY;
  var b = sinRds * Math.cos(rdx) * sinY;
  var d = sinRds * Math.cos(rdy);

  return this.get4DNoise(a, b, d, z);
}; Note in particular that getSpherical3DNoise(c, x, y) ends up sampling the three-dimensional pointvector $(a, b, d)$, given only an $( x,y )$ coordinate and circumference $c$ The second function, getSpherical3DNoise(c, x, y, z) seems like an incomprehensible follow-up to the previous function by sampling a four -dimensional vector $(a, b, d, z)$, $z$ being the Cartesian coordinate along the $z$-axis These functions behave strangely to say the least. So they are either incomprehansably cleverly written. Or they warrant a rewrite.","['vector-spaces', 'coordinate-systems', 'spherical-coordinates', 'geometry', 'trigonometry']"

0 \leq x_3 \leq 8, 5 \leq x_4 \leq 9.$ Firstly, I defined $y_i = x_i - lower bound$ so for example $y_1 = x_1 - 1$

1318469,Manifolds with 'bad metrics' (reference request),"While studying some differential geometry, a thought crossed my mind that I am sure has been considered before, but I cannot find a reference for it. What can be said about spaces for which the metric has pathological behaviour? I know that this is playing fast and loose with the terminology, but bear with me. In particular I am curious about generalised metrics that change signature. My rough idea of an example is $\mathbb{R}^2$ where we have a notion of length that is asymptotically Minkowskian, but near to the origin is Euclidean.
For a vector $v$ with components $(v_x, v_y)$, let 
$$
||v||^2 = f(v_x^2 + v_y^2) v_x^2 + v_y^2 = f(v \cdot v) v_x^2 + v_y^2
$$
where the $\cdot$ is the ordinary Euclidean dot product, and $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is some nice function with 
$$
\lim_{r \to 0^+} f(r) = 1\\
\lim_{r \to \infty} f(r) = -1
$$ Examples of such an $f$ include
$$
2e^{-r^2} - 1
$$
and
$$
\frac{1-r}{r+1}
$$ Of course it no longer makes sense to call this a metric as it's not a symmetric bilinear form. I guess we could define
$$
\left<u, v\right> = f(u \cdot v) u_xv_x + u_yv_y
$$
but the notation would not be appropriate. Does anyone know if such signature-changing spaces have a name? Where can I learn more about them?","['differential-geometry', 'manifolds', 'reference-request']"

Also any inner product space can be put in a dual pairing with itself via the inner product on it. What I want to know is if $V$ is its own dual (that is $V^* = V$) then is this natural pairing the same as the inner product on $V$?

1318537,Proving infintely many primes of the form 6k-1,"I have seen the past threads but I think I have another proof, though am not entirely convinced. Suppose there are only finitely many primes $p_1, ..., p_n$ of the form $6k-1$ and then consider the number $N = (p_1.p_2. ... .p_n)^2 - 1$ If all of the primes dividing N are of the form $6k+1$ then $N$ leaves remainder $1$ upon division by $6$. However, the RHS has remainder $1-1 = 0$ or $-1-1 = -2$ upon division by $6$, depending on whether $n$ is even or odd. Therefore there must be at least one prime of the form $6k-1$ dividing $N$, and thus some $p_j$ divides N, and so divides $(p_1.p_2. ... .p_n)^2 - N$ which is $1$, a contradiction.
