1436678,The wreath product $K ~\mbox{wr}_{\Gamma} ~ H$ acts faithful on $\Delta \times \Gamma$ iff $K$ acts faithful on $\Delta$,"Let $K$ and $H$ be groups, and let $H$ act on $\Gamma$. Also let $\operatorname{Fun}(\Gamma, K) = \{ f : f : \Gamma \to K \}$ be the set of all functions from $\Gamma$ to $K$. This set is a group under pointwise multiplication
$$
 (fg)(\gamma) := f(\gamma)g(\gamma)
$$
and $H$ acts on $\operatorname{Fun}(\Gamma, K)$ by setting for $f : \Gamma \to K$ and $x \in H$ the function $f^x$ to be
$$
 f^x(\gamma) := f(\gamma^{x^{-1}})
$$
for all $\gamma\in \Gamma$. Now the semidirect product
$$
 \operatorname{Fun}(\Gamma, K) \rtimes H
$$
is called the wreath product of $K$ and $H$ and denoted by $K ~\mbox{wr}_{\Gamma} ~ H$. Its elements are tupels $(f, x)$ of functions and elements from $H$. If $K$ also acts on some set $\Delta$, then the wreath product acts in a natural way on $\Delta \times \Gamma$, by setting for $(\delta, \gamma)$
$$
 (\delta, \gamma)^{(f,x)} := (\delta^{f(\gamma)}, \gamma^x).
$$
(This action is called the imprimitive action of the wreath product on wikipedia ). Now I want to prove, in the case we have an action of $K$ on $\Delta$ and $H$ on $\Gamma$, and therefore an action of the wreath product on $\Delta \times \Gamma$, that: The wreath product group $G = K ~\mbox{wr}_{\Gamma}~ H$ acts faithfully on $\Delta \times \Gamma$ if and only if $K$ acts faithfully on $\Delta$. (This is exercise 2.6.6. from the book Permutation Groups by Dixon & Mortimer). My Attempt: Let $G$ act faithfully on $\Delta \times \Gamma$ and suppose for each $\delta \in \Delta$ we have $\delta^k = \delta$. Denote by $\overline k : \Gamma \to K$ the constant function with $\overline k(\gamma) = k$. The we have for each $(\delta, \gamma)$ that
$$
 (\delta, \gamma)^{(\overline k, 1)} = (\delta^{\overline k(\gamma)}, \gamma^1)
  = (\delta^k, \gamma) = (\delta, \gamma).
$$
Hence as $G$ acts faithful $(\overline k, 1) = (\overline 1, 1)$ as
$(\overline 1, 1)$ is the identity in $G$, but this shows that $\overline k = \overline 1$ or $k = 1$. Now conversely let $K$ act faithfully on $\Delta$ and suppose we have
$$
 (\delta, \gamma)^{(f,x)} = (\delta, \gamma)
$$
for each $(\delta, \gamma) \in \Delta \times \Gamma$. By this for each $\delta \in \Delta$ and each $\gamma \in \Gamma$ we have
$$
 \delta^{f(\gamma)} = \delta \quad \mbox{ and } \quad
 \gamma^{x} = \gamma.
$$
As $K$ acts faithful we have $f(\gamma) = 1$ for each $\gamma$, i.e. $f$ is the constant function which equals $1$ (denoted $\overline 1$ above). Now we just need that $x = 1$ and we are done, but I do not see that this is implied by the above (it would follow if also $H$ acts faithful, but this is not part of the exercise, nor is it included in the general definition of the wreath product)? So is there any way to show that $(f, x) = (\overline 1, 1)$? Maybe the exercise is wrong and it should read: The wreath product acts faithful on $\Delta \times \Gamma$ if and only if $K$ and $H$ act both faithful on $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$. but the errata does not mentions this, so I am not sure?","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'group-actions', 'permutations']"

1436853,"$f$ an entire function, $|f(1/n)|\leq n^{-n}$ for $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Show that $f$ is constant.","I'm working on old qualifying exam problems and this one came up. Suppose $f$ is an entire function on $\mathbb{C}$, and that $|f(\frac{1}{n})| \leq n^{-n}$ for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. Prove that $f$ is constant. My approaches: One obvious thing to do is to try and show that $f$ is bounded and appeal to Liouville's theorem. However, our bounds are for small values of $z$, so this did not yield much success. One can see that $f(0)=0$ from this condition. Also,
$$
 f'(0) = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{f(\frac{1}{n}) - f(0)}{\frac{1}{n}} = \lim_{n\to \infty} n f\left(\frac{1}{n}\right).
$$
Note that
$$
 \left|nf\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right| \leq n^{-n+1} \to 0 \text{ as } n\to \infty.
$$
Thus, $f'(0)=0$. I would like to keep trying to show that $f^{(n)}(0)=0$ and use the fact that $f$ is entire to get that $f=0$ identically on $\mathbb{C}$. But I get stuck because I don't have an estimate for $f'(1/n)$. I think what makes this problem harder is that we only have an estimate on $f$ at a countable set, instead of the usual problem where we know some kind of bound on $f$ everywhere.

1436856,Showing that $f^{(n)}(0)=0$ for $f(x)=e^{-1/x^2}$ if $x\neq 0$ and $f(0)=0$.,"Define $f$ as follows: $f(x)=e^{-1/x^2}$ if $x\neq 0$ and $f(0)=0$. Show that $f^{(n)}(0)$ is continuous for all $x$ and $f^{(n)}(0)=0$. $n=1,2,\dots$. To show this, I have shown that for $x\neq 0$, we have $f^{(n)}(x)=e^{-1/x^2}P_{3n}(1/x),$ where $P_{3n}(t)$ is a real polynomial of degree $3n$. Hence, to show that $f^{(n)}(0)=0,$ I will use induction. $n=1$ case is trivial. So suppose that $n=k$ holds. Then as $n=k+1$, we have $\frac{f^{(k)}(x)-f^{(k)}(0)}{x-0}=\frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{x}=\frac{e^{-1/x^2}P_{3k}(1/x)}{x}$. Now I need to show that the limit of the above fraction as $x\to 0$ tends to $0$. For the case $x\to 0^{+}$, I can argue as follows. Replace $t=1/x$ in the above fraction, then we get $\frac{e^{-1/x^2}P_{3k}(1/x)}{x}=\frac{tP_{3k}(t)}{e^{t^2}}=(\frac{tP_{3k}(t)}{e^t})(\frac{e^t}{e^{t^2}})\to 0$ as $t\to \infty$, since we have $\lim_{x\to \infty}\frac{P(x)}{e^x}=0$. However, I have trouble showing the case for $x\to 0^{-}$, since $\lim_{\to -\infty}\frac{P(x)}{e^x}$ does not exist for all polynomials. How can I solve this problem? I would greatly appreciate any help. (added) My attempt: $\lim_{x\to 0^{-}}\frac{e^{-1/x^2}P_{3k}(1/x)}{x}=\lim_{x\to 0^{-}}e^{-1/x^2}P_{3k+1}(1/x)=\lim_{x\to 0^{+}}e^{-1/x^2}P_{3k+1}(-1/x)=\lim_{t\to \infty}e^{-t^2}P_{3k+1}(-t)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{P_{3k+1}(-t)}{e^t}\cdot \frac{e^t}{e^{t^2}}=0\cdot 0=0$ $\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{P_{3k+1}(-t)}{e^t}=0$, since $|\frac{P_{3k+1}(-t)}{e^t}|\le\frac{P_{3k+1}(|-t|)}{e^t} \to 0$ as $t\to \infty$.","['analysis', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"

For solving this problem I'm trying to use following exercise from Atiyah and Macdonald book: Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unit, $X = \mathrm{Spec}(A) $ with the Zariski topology.

Hence by above exercise for finding irreducible components of $\mathrm{Spec}(R/\mathbb I)$ we just need to find minimal prime ideals of $\mathbb Z/ 6 \mathbb Z$.

\begin{align*}\mathscr{A}= \bigg \{ &\varnothing,\,[1,2),\,[2,3],\,(3,4],\,(-\infty,1)\cup (4,+\infty),\,[1,3],\, [1,2)\cup (3,4],\,(-\infty,2)\cup (4,+\infty),\\
&[2,4],\,(-\infty,1)\cup [2,3]\cup (4,+\infty),\,(-\infty,1)\cup (3,+\infty), [1,4],\,(-\infty,3]\cup (4,+\infty),\\
& (-\infty,2)\cup (3,+\infty),\,(-\infty,1)\cup [2,+\infty),\, \mathbb{R} \bigg\} \end{align*} Now clearly $\mathscr{A}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra (it is closed under countable unions, complementation and also $\mathbb{R}$ belongs to it). On the other hand, the function $f$ can be written by elements in $\mathscr{D}$ (which are a partition of the reals) in the following way $$f(x)=3 \cdot \mathbb{1}_{[1,2)}(x)+5\cdot \mathbb{1}_{[2,3]}(x)+2 \cdot \mathbb{1}_{(3,4]} (x)$$ Therefore, in the above expression of $f$ it is clear that $\mathscr{A}$ makes $f$ measurable.The minimum sigma algebra $\mathscr{S}$ that makes $f$ measurable, must contain $[1,2),\,[2,3],\,(3,4]$. Then $\mathscr{D}$ belongs to $\mathscr{S}$, since $(-\infty,1)\cup (4,+\infty)=[1,4]^c$, and so $\mathscr{A}\subset \mathscr{S}$. The other inclusion is easy by minimality of $\mathscr{S}$. Then $\mathscr{S} =\mathscr{A}$ as desired.","['self-learning', 'measure-theory']"
1437274,"What is happening to a curve in space at a point where it has small curvature, but high torsion","Can anyone give me an intuitive explanation for the kind of twisting or bending that a curve in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ undergoes when it's at a point of small curvature, but high torsion? I understand that torsion measures the failure for a curve to be planar i.e. be contained in a plane. So a curve with a high torsion in some region must be twisting in various directions through various planes in 3-space. Curvature on the other hand measures how rapidly the tangent vectors are changing with respect to the arc length of the curve. So it seems like my intuition wants to think that high torsion implies high curvature, but that's certainly not the case.

1437392,Question about $\alpha-$plane in twistor theory,"In twistor theory, given the complexified Minkowski space $CM$ and the projective twistor space $PT$, an $\alpha-$plane is defined as the correspondence in $CM$ wit a point $Z \in PT$. But I found two versions of it. (a) One in ""Twistor geometry and field theory"" by Ward and Wells, where $\alpha-$plane is a projective complex plane in $CM$ corresponding to a point $Z \in PT$ without mentioning if it's self-dual or not. (b) Another is by Penrose that $\alpha-$plane is a two-complex-dimensional locus of points in $CM$ which is incident to $Z$ and also it's self-dual. I am confused if the two versions are different. (1) Are the two definitions mean the same thing? i.e., every point of the projective complex plane in (a) is incident to $Z$ as defined in (b)? (2) Is the definition by Penrose in (b) a subset of the former in (a), so that only a subset of the points of the $\alpha-$plane in (a) is self-dual? Since according to (a), the $\alpha-$plane is a PROJECTIVE complex plane for any point $Z \in PT$. It seems that any point in $CM$ must fall on at least one $\alpha-$plane corresponding to some point $Z' \in PT$. Then the self-duality of Penrose should not hold for the definition (a) since not every point in $CM$ leads to self-duality property. (3) If (b) is really a subset of (a), then not every point in $CM$ falls on an $\alpha-$plane and the union of all $\alpha-$planes is just a subset of $CM$, this sounds reasonable . To explain my question, I put the definitions (a)(b) in figures. 
For definition (a), $P$ is in fact just $PT$ and the $\alpha-$plane is given by $\tilde{p}$ as given in Figure 1. Figure 2 and 3 show the schemes of (a) and (b). I am new on this topic.

Could someone help? EDIT: Progress so far. After reading Eric Wofsey's response, I have the following. Since a projective variety is determined by its homogeneous coordinate ring, it suffices to determine the homogeneous coordinate ring of $(\mathbb{CP}^1)^m/S_m$. For $(\mathbb{CP}^1)^m$, the coordinate ring is the graded ring $\mathcal{S}$ whose $d$th degree part is the $m$-fold tensor product (over $\mathbb{C}$) of $\mathbb{C}[s, t]_{d}$. That is, $S_d$ consists of polynomials in $s^1, t^1, s^2, t^2, \dots, s^m, t^m$ of multidegree ($d, d, \dots, d$). And $S_m$ acts in the obvious way, i.e. if $\sigma(i) = j$, then $\sigma$ sends $s^i$ to $s^j$ and $t^i$ to $t^j$. The homogeneous coordinate ring of $(\mathbb{CP}^1)^m/S_m$ is just the ring of invariants of the $S_m$ action on $\mathcal{S}$. But I still have two questions. Which polynomials are invariant under this action? I still don't see how to conclude that Eric Wofsey's map is a homeomorphism.

1437874,Confusing probability question,"I have got a task, which seems a quite confusing for me. It is simple: In a market, they sell eggs in egg holders, they store $10$ of them in each.

We buy an egg holder, and after we grab our first egg, we are sad, because it is broken. What is the probability, that there is one more broken egg in our holder? The ""logical"" way would be: $30$% of them have $1$ broken egg, $10$% of them have $2$, so, to have $2$ broken, the chance must be $\frac14$. But I am not really sure if that is the correct approach, since the broken egg can be anywhere, getting a broken one for first may be not that easy, or is that independent?(Maybe, I could use Bayes Theorem somehow)?

1437926,Asymptotics for incomplete $\Gamma$ with equal arguments,"On the digital library of mathematical functions, there is a uniform asymptotic expansion of the incomplete gamma function of equal arguments $\Gamma(z,z)$ for large $z$ ( http://dlmf.nist.gov/8.11#v -- formula 8.11.12). The lowest order terms are $$\Gamma(z,z) \sim z^{z-1}e^{-z} \left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} z^{\frac{1}{2}} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{\sqrt{2 \pi} }{24 z^{\frac{1}{2}}} + \ldots \right)$$ The digital library unfortunately cites no sources. Anybody has any idea how this was derived? I have tried to derive it with Laplace's approximation. In the integral that defines the incomplete $\Gamma$ , the maximum of the integrand is at $t=z-1$ while the lower limit of integration is $z$ . So the maximum lies outside the integration range. You must therefore approximate the integrand for small positive values of $t -z$ , and this gives something completely different from the digital-library formula. Moreover: the function I am really interested in is $\Gamma(z,z-a)$ , calculated for large $z$ . Here $a >1$ is a fixed real number, so the maximum is outside the integration range. But the Laplace method may not be sufficient because I need corrections from the $t=z-a$ too. Does anybody have any hint on how to calculate this?","['asymptotics', 'analysis']"

1437993,Differentiability of a 2-variable function,"In this morning's Mathematical Analysis 2 exam, students were asked to study the continuity and differentiability of: $$f(x,y)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} \dfrac{xye^{-\frac{1}{(x+y)^2}}}{x^2+2e^{-\frac{2}{(x+y)^2}}} & x\neq-y \\ {} \\ 0 & x=-y \end{array}\right.$$ This question answered the continuity problem. However, I feel if I try the same things I tried there for the differentiability, I will get stuck on the limit involved. Now, it is easy to verify that the partial derivatives in the origin are both zero, since the function is always 0 on the axes. So to prove differentiability, I would have to prove: $$\lim_{(h,k)\to(0,0)}\frac{f(h,k)}{\sqrt{h^2+k^2}}=0,$$ which is the limit proved zero for continuity except for the denominator, which makes it impossible to use the trick the answer to the linked question used. Polar coordinates give all the same problem as continuity. I can try substituting $k=m|h|^\alpha$, so for $\alpha<\frac12$ I can use the asymptotic in the comments to the linked question, and I'm left with $\frac{m|h|^{\alpha-2}\operatorname{sgn}h}{\sqrt{1+m^2|h|^{2\alpha-2}}}e^{-\frac{1}{m^2|h|^{2\alpha}}}$, and I'm not all too sure that tends to 0. And anyway I would still find problems with $\alpha>\frac12$, and L'Hospital, in this case, is just terrible. Any suggestions?

Remark I: Under the assumption of existence of a solution, my initial angle of attack was to rewrite the equation as
$$i \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = L\,f$$

where $\lambda_k$ and $\varphi_k$ are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions corresponding to the operator $L$. I am thus led to considering the equations 
$$L(\varphi_k) = \lambda_k\,\varphi_k$$
and swap the solutions $\varphi_k$ and $\lambda_k$ back the into the formal solution. But I have not been able to find the eigenfunctions, perhaps my patience was too short.

If $\mathbf{r_d}$ intersects the rectangle then naturally $\mathbf{r_d'}=\mathbf{r_d}$ and otherwise $\mathbf{r_d'}$ points towards the rectangle edge. I have tried couple of solutions which unfortunately do not give correct results: 1) Calculate $p$ and $q$ at the intersection between the ray and the plane of the rectangle, and clamp $p$ and $q$ to the rectangle domain. Then calculate $\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{p_o}+p*\mathbf{p_x} + q*\mathbf{p_y} - \mathbf{r_o}$ and $\mathbf{r'_d}=\mathbf{v}/||\mathbf{v}||$. This works ""mostly right"", but breaks down when the ray points away from the rectangle (i.e. there's no intersection). Even if the ray points towards the rectangle, clamping $p$ and $q$ between $-rectWidth/2 < p < rectWidth/2$, and $-rectHeight/2 < q < rectHeight/2$ doesn't give correct result in all cases. 2) Project the ray to the rectangle plane and calculate intersection of the infinite line going along the projected ray and the rectangle. If the line intersects the rectangle, test which of the two intersection point gives the smallest angle. If the line doesn't intersect the rectangle, test which of the 4 corners of the rectangle gives the smallest angle. This seems to be quite wrong result and worse than option 1) I don't need the exact solution for my application, so if there are some approximations that doesn't have too large errors I'm happy to try those out.

1438516,Can I derive the formula for expected value of continuous random variables from the discrete case?,"I've previously asked the question on Stats SE, but I guess it fits the Math SE better. Is it possible to rigorously derive the formula for expected value of continuous random variable starting with expected variable in discrete case, i.e. $$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i x_i$$ to obtain $$E[X]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xf(x)dx$$ When formulating the definition for continuous case, the intention was, I believe, to make it 'equivalent' to the discrete case. So for example, I'd like $E[X]$ of a continuous random variable $X$ to be equal to the sum of every possible value of $X$ times probability of that particular value. The problem is that the probability of any particular value of $X$ is $0$, and the expected value calculated that way would always be $0$. But some people tried to convince me that it's possible overcome these issues with help of Lebesgue integral. Could anyone explain intuitively how is that possible? I'm convinced that no matter what integration we use, we cannot somehow magically assign non-zero probabilities to single values the random variable $X$ might take. They will always be $0$! Or maybe there's no magic involved and best we can do is work with infinitely thin intervals of $X$? From what I've managed to find out (I don't have time to study all measure theory and Lebesgue integration at the moment to figure it out on my own) it's about approximating the original continuous random variable $X$ with step function, and the more steps there are, the better is the approximation. But still, all we have is calculating probability of intervals (they are infinitely thin though, but they are intervals anyway). The fact that something gets closer and closer to original function in the limit doesn't mean it behaves the same as the original function (check the very popular example here ). In the 'very popular example' above, even though the curve approaches the circle, its length will never be the same as the perimeter of that circle. 
Similarly, here , in 'The Riemann-Stieltjes integral: intuition' part. they say the discrete r.v. $X_n$ converges to continuous r.v. $X$, as $n \to \infty$, in the limit it becomes the same variable. So it's important to ask whether it's reasonable to expect the approximation of the cont. r.v. $X$ to behave the same as the original random variable $X$, even if in the limit the are 'indistinguishable' in the limit, whatever that word means in mathematics. The curve and circle are indistinguishable too, but still have different properties. So apparently it's that the continuous case is not derived from discrete case, but is a generalization of the discrete case. I guess in every mathematical theory, there is no such thing as 'the only correct' generalization, so the contunous formula could look different. If you claim this is the only 'valid one', then shouldn't we call it a derivation of the formula?","['probability', 'calculus', 'lebesgue-integral']"
1438549,The affine special linear group acts doubly transitive,"Let $F$ be a field and $d \ge 2$. Denote by $ASL_d(F)$ the affine special linear group , i.e. the group of all transformation on $F^d$ with $t_{A,v}(u) = Au + v$ and $\det A = 1$. I want to show that this group is $2$-transitive (also called doubly transitive) on the points from $F^d$. For this I have to show that for $x,y, x', y'$ with $x \ne y$ and $x' \ne y'$ I can find an element $t_{A,v} \in ASL_d(F)$ such that
$$
 x' = t_{A,v}(x) = Ax + v \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad

1438567,Questions concerning the Integration of Integer Tetration,"I've been interested in finding the antiderivative of integer tetration, a function defined as iterative exponentiation. Integer tetration is written as $^n$$x$ where $^1$$x =x$, $^2$$x =x^x$, $^3$$x =$ $x^{\scriptscriptstyle x^{x}}$ and so forth where $n=1,2,3\ldots$ (Further info can be found on Wikipedia . One solution to the problem is found on the MathWorld page (see equation #10), but the given solution is difficult to evaluate; accordingly, I am searching for an simpler representation than the result given. (Note that my questions are located at the bottom of this post, and number theorists are encouraged to skip to that point... everything leading up to the questions is background and context.) Using Wolfram Alpha I found the Puiseux series of $x^x$ to be the following:$$1+ x\log(x)+\frac{1}{2}x^2\log^2(x) + \frac{1}{6}x^3\log^3(x)\ldots$$ $$ = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n \log^n(x)}{n!} \qquad 1.$$ 
As such, the antiderivative can be found simply by integrating the series:
$$\int x^xdx = \int \bigg(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n \log^n(x)}{n!}\bigg)dx = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{1}{n!}\int x^n \log^n(x)dx\bigg)$$
We then note the following: (again, pulled from Wolfram Alpha)
$$\int x^n \log^n(x)dx = \frac{\Gamma(n+1,-(n+1)\log(x))(-n-1)^{-n} }{(n+1)} \qquad 2. $$
All that is left is to substitute in Equation 2 and convert the denominator the gamma function.
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{1}{n!}\int x^n \log^n(x)dx\bigg) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1,-(n+1)\log(x))(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg)$$
This solution can be checked by substituting in x=1, yielding the Sophomore's Dream :
$$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1,-(n+1)\log(1))(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1,0)(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg)$$
$$= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1)(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigg((-1)^n(n+1)^{n+1}\bigg)$$
$$= 1-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{27}-\frac{1}{64}\,\ldots \, = -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-n)^{-n} = \int_{0}^{1}x^xdx$$
Further, any other definite integral of $x^x$ can be calculated the same way. (Note that $F'(x)$ is $x^x$)
$$\int_{0}^{r}x^xdx = F(r) - \lim_{a\to 0}F(a)$$
$$= F(r) - \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lim_{a\to 0}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma(n+1,-(n+1)\log(a))(-n-1)^{-n} }{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg) = F(r)$$ No standard Puiseux series can be found for $^n$$x$ when $n>2$, although Wolfram Alpha tells me that ""Generalized Puiseux series"" exists for these functions. For $^3$$x$ the series is as such:
$$x + x^2\log^2(x) + \frac{1}{2}x^3\log^3(x)[1+\log(x)] + \frac{1}{6}x^4\log^4(x)[1+3\log(x)+\log^2(x)]\ldots$$
Notice that this series closely resembles Equation 1, except for the additional powers of $\log(x)$. If we temporarily exclude the coefficients on these additional terms we find that the $n^{th}$ term of the series is multiplied by $\sum_{n=0}^{n-2}\log^n(x)$ (except for the first term). As a result, we can represent the series as follow, where the additional coefficients are represented as $C_{kn}$
$$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\bigg[\frac{x^n\log^n(x)}{\Gamma(n)}\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\bigg(C_{kn}\log^k(x)\bigg)\bigg] = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\bigg(\frac{C_{kn}\log^{k+n}(x)x^n}{\Gamma(n)}\bigg)  \qquad 3. $$
Listing the coefficients generated, we get $[1],[1,1],[1,3,1],[1,7,6,1]\ldots$ A quick search on the OEIS revealed that these are in fact the Stirling numbers of the second kind, written as $S_n^k$ or $S(n,k)$. Substituting this into the series representation above, we get the following series for $^3$$x$:
$$x + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\bigg(\frac{S_{n-1}^{k+1}\log^{k+n}(x)x^n}{\Gamma(n)}\bigg) = x + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\bigg(\frac{S_{n+1}^{k+1}\log^{k+n+2}(x)x^{n+2}}{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg)$$ Going through a similar process to the one outlined for $x^x$, $\int$ $^3$$xdx$ can be shown to be the following equation:
$$\frac{x^2}{2} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma[n+3+k,-(n+3)\log(x)]S_{n+1}^{k+1}}{\Gamma(n+2)(-(n+3))^{n+3+k}}\bigg)$$ Likewise, we find that
$$\int_{0}^{r} {^3x}dx = \frac{r^2}{2} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\bigg(\frac{\Gamma[n+3+k,-(n+3)\log(r)]S_{n+1}^{k+1}}{\Gamma(n+2)(-(n+3))^{n+3+k}}\bigg)$$
The hard part is when we get to the generalized Puiseux series for $^4x$, which is:
$$1+x\log(x)+\frac{1}{2}x^2\log^2(x)[1+2\log(x)]+\frac{1}{6}x^3 \log^3(x) [1+9 \log(x)+3\log^2(x)]+\ldots$$
$$***$$
Here is where the real questions start. This series has the first few powers of $x\log(x)$ as $x^x$, namely $1+x\log(x)$. I wonder if this is related to the fact that the function $y = (x^x)^y$ is the same as $y = (^{2n}x)^y$? Equivalently, $y=x^y$ is the same as $y = (^{2n-1}x)^y$. We can see this same symmetry in that for all $^{2n-1}x$ I checked (up to $^7x$) the first two terms are $x+x^2\log^2(x)$, while for all $^{2n}x$ I checked the first two terms are $1+x\log(x)$. Thus, my first question is somewhat broad... Is there any simple explanation for this symmetry ? My next question concerns the series for $^4x$. We can represent this in a very similar form to Equation 1 , except for the additional powers of $\log(x)$, reminiscent of the additions to Equation 1 . Thus, we get the form
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \bigg[\frac{x^n \log^n(x)}{n!}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\bigg(C_{kn}\log^k(x)\bigg)\bigg] = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigg[\frac{x^n \log^n(x)}{n!}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\bigg(C_{kn}\log^k(x)\bigg)\bigg]$$
$$= 1 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\bigg(\frac{x^n \log^{n+k}(x)C_{kn}}{n!}\bigg) = 1 + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\bigg(\frac{x^{n+1} \log^{n+1+k}(x)C_{kn}}{\Gamma(n+2)}\bigg)$$
Having already worked with $^2x$ and $^3x$ integrating this series would not be difficult, but I can't figure out what the constants are. Thus, my main question is: What is the pattern for the numbers $[1,2],[1,9,3],[1,28,36,4],[1,75,245,110,5],[1,186,1290,1410,300,6]...$ where each number is some $C_{kn}$? I have noticed that the first member of each set is 1, and the second term in each set is $nS_n^2$ (where the first set is n=2, the second is n=3, and so forth and $S_n^k$ are the Stirling numbers of the second kind). The nth set also contains n members (using the definition of n above), and the final member of each set is n. Other than these observations, I can't find a way to represent these numbers. My final question is ""How do we calculate a generalized Puiseux series, specifically for $^nx$ where $n>2$? I feel that if I had more knowledge on how these series are calculated I could gain insight into my other questions, but I cannot find much literature on finding generalized Puiseux series, let alone literature elementary enough for me to understand and apply to tetration.

  is a homeomorphism, where $\varphi (t,x_0)$ is a unique solution defined in $\mathbb R$ for the IPV $$x' = f(x) ,\,\, x(0) = x_0 \tag{*}$$ Attempt: $\varphi_t$ is injective As $\varphi (t,x_0)$ is unique for each $x_0$, if $x_0 \neq y_0$ then $\varphi_t (x_0) = \varphi (t,x_0) \neq \varphi (t,y_0) = \varphi_t (y_0) $. $\varphi_t$ is surjective $\varphi_t$ is injective and defined from $\mathbb R^n$ to $\mathbb R^n$ $\varphi_t$ is continuous Suppose it isn't. Then there exists a sequence of points $x_n$ in $\mathbb R^n$ such that $x_n \to x_0$ and $\varphi (t,x_n)\not\to \varphi(t,x_0)$. Consider $\varphi_n(\tau) = \varphi(\tau,x_n)$, where, $\tau \in [0,t]$. Then $$|\varphi'_n(\tau)| = |\varphi'(\tau, x_n)| = |f(\tau, \varphi(\tau, x_n))| \leq M$$ Then the set $E =\{\varphi_n : [0,1] \to \mathbb R^n\}$ is equicontinous. Plus, by the Mean Value Theorem $$|\varphi_n(\tau) - \varphi_n (\sigma)| \leq \sup_{\theta \in [0,1]} |\varphi'(\theta)| |\tau - \sigma| \leq M |\tau - \sigma|$$ Thus $(\varphi_n)$ is uniformly bounded.
