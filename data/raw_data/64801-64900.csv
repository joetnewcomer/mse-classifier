Then I think, where is the function $0$ for rational $x$? That's at $x=0$ and where $\sin(\pi |x|)^2=0$, i.e. for all integer multiples of $\pi$. Therefore where the euclidean length $|x|$ is an integer. This gives a bunch of concentric circles where the function is continuous. Now I just need to write this set of points and prove it is differentiable at these points (I know it can't be differentiable anywhere else because it needs to be continuous in order to be differentiable). Can anyone help me prove that the function is differentiable at these circles where it is continuous? Thanks! Edit: To prove $f$ is differentiable where it is continuous, that means showing either showing there exists a linear map $A$ such that $\displaystyle\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{|f(x+h)-f(x)-Ah|}{|h|}=0$, or else showing all of the partial derivatives exist and are continuous...

755780,Is a matrix $A$ with an eigenvalue of $0$ invertible?,"Just wanted some input to see if my proof is satisfactory or if it needs some cleaning up. Here is what I have. Proof Suppose $A$ is square matrix and invertible and, for the sake of contradiction, let $0$ be an eigenvalue.  Consider, $(A-\lambda I)\cdot v = 0$ with $\lambda=0 $ 
  $$\Rightarrow (A- 0\cdot I)v=0$$ $$\Rightarrow(A-0)v=0$$ $$\Rightarrow Av=0$$ We know $A$ is an invertible and in order for $Av = 0$, $v = 0$, but $v$ must be non-trivial such that $\det(A-\lambda I) = 0$. Here lies our contradiction. Hence, $0$ cannot be an eigenvalue. Revised Proof Suppose $A$ is square matrix and has an eigenvalue of $0$.  For the sake of contradiction, lets assume $A$ is invertible. Consider, $Av = \lambda v$, with $\lambda = 0$ means there exists a non-zero $v$ such that $Av = 0$. This implies $Av = 0v \Rightarrow Av = 0$ For an invertible matrix $A$, $Av = 0$ implies $v = 0$.  So, $Av = 0 = A\cdot 0$. Since $v$  cannot be $0$,this means $A$ must not have been one-to-one.  Hence, our contradiction, $A$ must not be invertible.","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'solution-verification', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"

756067,Cardinality of $\lim_{k\to\infty}\mathbb N^k$ vs. $\mathbb N^\infty$,"My friend and I are having a disagreement over whether the number of terms in the following series is countable or uncountable:
$$\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i + \sum_{i=1}^\infty\sum_{j=1}^\infty a_{ij}+ \sum_{i=1}^\infty\sum_{j=1}^\infty\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_{ijk} + \ldots$$ i.e. the sum goes to have an infinite number of ""sigmas"". My argument is that each of the sums has a countable number of terms, and there are a countable number of sums (indexed by the number of ""sigmas"") in the total sum, and hence the total number of terms is the cardinality of a countable union of countable sets, which is countable. My friend's argument is that given any irrational number in $[0,1]$, he can find a corresponding term in the sum with the subscripts $i, j, k, \ldots$ coming from the decimal expansion of the irrational number, and vice versa (though not all irrational number won't be mapped and vice versa, the subset being mapped to is still uncountable). So the number of terms is uncountable. We think that the answer to the question boils down to whether the cardinality of $\lim_{k\to\infty}\mathbb N^k$ is equal to $\mathbb N^\infty$ (i.e. an infinite Cartesian product) or not. Is this statement true, and is it applicable to the bigger question of the cardinality of the number of terms in the series?","['cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"
756115,Axiomatizing topology through continuous maps,"Suppose we have some topological space $X$ and we somehow forgot about the topology. A friend of ours knows the topology and offers to tell us for any map $X\to Y$ into any topological space $Y$ whether it is continuous or not. As it turns out, we can use this to recover the topology on $X$ the following way: Let $Z = \{0,1\}$ with topology $\{\varnothing, \{1\}, Z\}$. For a subset $A\subseteq X$ we have a map
\begin{align}
f_A : X &\longrightarrow Z\\
x &\longmapsto \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if $x\in A$,}\\ 0 &\text{if $x\notin A$.}\end{cases}
\end{align}
Now $f_A$ is continuous if and only if the preimages of open sets are open, since $f^{-1}(\varnothing)=\varnothing$ and $f^{-1}(Z)=X$ are open in any topology, we know that $f_A$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(\{1\}) = A$ is open in $X$. Thus, given any subset $A$ in $X$ we ask our friend if $f_A$ is continous and we know if $A$ is open or not, so we recovered the topology as
$$
\{\, A\subseteq X \mid \text{$f_A\colon X\to Z$ is continuous}\,\}.
$$ We conclude that knowing the topology (i.e. the collection of open sets) of $X$ and being able to tell for any map $X\to Y$ if it is continuous are equivalent. Is it somehow possible to define a topological space as a set $X$ together with some class of maps from $X$ satisfying certain properties so they turn out to be the continuous maps? One problem here is that thinking of the class
$$\{\, f:X\to Y \mid \text{$Y$ a topological space, $f$ continuous}\,\}$$
already implies we know what the topological spaces $Y$ are, so it seems we cannot use this class to define what a topological space is. Can we do something similar though?","['general-topology', 'axioms', 'continuity']"

756266,Calculating the center of mass in spherical coordinates,"So normally, to calculate the center of mass you would use a triple integral. In my particular problem, I need to calculate the center of mass of an eight of a sphere where it's density is proportional to the distance from origin. Say we want to get the x coordinate of the center of mass. The formula is something like $\frac{1}{M}\int\int\int (r^2\sin\phi)(\lambda r)(r\sin\phi\cos\theta)$ where the groups in that product are the jacobian of the spherical transformation, the density function of r and the x coordinate expressed with spherical variables. Now, I'm thinking if this is really necessary. Could I just multiply with $r$ instead of $(r\sin\phi\cos\theta)$ to get the radius of the center of mass, then do the same for $\phi$ and $\theta$, and then transform them back to $x, y, z$? This makes sense to me since what I'm basically doing it summing up all the coordinates for each point in the body with each point having different influence on the result. The way I see it, the jacobian is there to account for the fact that the transformation is much more dense around the origin, the $\lambda r$ is there to give denser areas more influence on the final center of mass. I don't really see any reason why I couldn't sum up their coordinates in spherical form. The potential problem I could see here is that if I tried to calculate the center of mass of a whole sphere, the $x,y,z$ would all be 0, but in spherical coordinates I might get unexpected results due to angles not being defined.","['multivariable-calculus', 'integration']"

$$ It makes sense, for any partition $P$ there will be a $t_i$ and $t_{i+1}$ where there will exist a rational and an irrational between the two, hence $M_{i}$ and $m_i$ (the ""supremum partition"" and ""infimum partition"") are always going to to be 1 and 0 respectively. Hence if you take the sum of these different partitions and subtract them from each other (as Spivak writes: $U(F, P) - L(F, P)$) you will always get a $b-a$ where $b$ and $a$ are the upper and lower bounds of the integral respectively. Therefore, I can define a $\epsilon < a - b$ and I will never be able to make a partition that results in $U(F, P) - L(F, P) < \epsilon$ hence it fails. It makes sense, but my alternative reasoning comes to the complete opposite conclusion. First of all, Spivak proves the following two properties: Let $f$ be a function where for every point $x$, $f(x) = 0$ except for exactly one point $a$ where $f(a) = 1$ then $f$ is integrable. Let this kind of function be referred to as a ""point function"". Let $f$ and $g$ be 2 integrable functions, then $f + g$ is integrable. After that I decide to generalize the second theorem: Lemma: Let $f, g, h \ldots n$ all be integrable function with signatures of $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, then $f + g + h + \ldots + n$ is integrable. Proof: Base case: $f + g$ is integrable by the theorem above, now assume it holds true for $f + g + \ldots + m$ then to show it is true, it must work for $f + g + \ldots + m + n$. $$ f + g + \ldots + m + n $$ Let the integrable function $j$ denote $f + g + \ldots + m$ then we have: $$ j + n $$ Since $j$ and $n$ are both integrable functions, by Theorem 2 we have shown this works for an arbitrary amount of functions. Now, let $A$ be the set of all point functions with a rational number. Then: $\sum{A}$ is integrable since we know that all the functions in $A$ are integrable and by the above lemma the some of them all must result in an integrable function. And since: $$ \sum{A} = F $$ I have shown $F$ is integrable, which it is clearly not. (Also, using my logic you can argue the same for any arbitrary function.)

Here is my work: $f:[0,1] \rightarrow (0,1)$ Let $n\in N$ Let $A=\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}....\}\cup \{0\}$ On $[0,1]\in A: f(x)=x$ On $A: f(0)=\frac{1}{3}$ $f(1)=\frac{1}{2}$ $f(\frac{1}{n})=\frac{1}{n+2}, n>2$ Now I will prove that $f$ is a bijective function.
Let $f(n)=f(m)$ for $n,m \in N$ and $n,m>2$. Then $\frac{1}{n+2}=\frac{1}{m+2}$. We multiply both sides of the equation by $(n+2)(m+2)$ and obtain $m+2=n+2 \rightarrow m=n$. Thus $f$ is injective. From here on out, I am kind of shakey. I know the gist of this proof, but I don't know how to set up the sequencing correctly.

Let $C_{c}(X)$ be the continuous functions on $f$ from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$ with compact support. Is $C_{c}(X)$ separable? My work so far: If $X$ is a compact metric space, then by Urysohn's Lemma and Stone-Weierstrass, the continuous functions $C(X)$ on $X$ are separable and hence the result follows as $C_{c}(X) = C(X)$. Suppose $X = \mathbb{R}$. Write $\mathbb{R} = \bigcup_{N  = 1}^{\infty}[-N, N]$. Let $f \in C_{c}(\mathbb{R})$. Then $f$ is supported on a compact set $K \subset [-N, N]$ for some $N$. Thus $C_{c}(\mathbb{R}) =\bigcup_{N = 1}^{\infty}C([-N, N])$. Each $C([-N, N])$ has a countable dense subset $\{\psi_{N, n}\}_{n = 1}^{\infty}$ and so $\bigcup_{N, n = 1}^{\infty}\{\psi_{N, n}\}$ is a countable dense subset of $C_{c}(\mathbb{R})$. In the general case, $X = \bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty}X_{i}$ where each $X_{i}$ is compact and $X_{1} \subset X_{2} \subset \cdots$. Let $f \in C_{c}(X)$. Then $f$ is supported on a compact set $K = \bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty}K \cap X_{i}$.

Now for $f(x) = 41$ we have $(x-r_1)(x-r_2)(x-r_3)(x-r_4)(x-r_5)g(x) = 4$, so the factors can be $\pm 1, \pm2$ or $\pm 4$. Given $r_i$ are distinct at most two of them will give $\pm1$, then there can be both of $\pm 2$ or one of $\pm 4$. This is where I get lost, since even if I use all of $\pm1, \pm2$, I will be still be left with one $x-r_i$ factor. What about that?

I am trying to prove the next statement. Is there any mistake or error? $f$ is a homeomorphism. Show that $f(\bar A) \subset \overline{f(A)}$. Since $f$ is continuous $x\in \bar A \implies f(x)\in f(\bar A)$. (Is this right? or trivial?) I want to show $f(x)\in f(\bar A) \implies f(x)\in \overline{f(A)}$. Consider any open ball $V = B(f(x);r)$. Since $f$ is continuous, $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open subset of $X$ and $x\in f^{-1}(V)$. Because $x\in \bar A$, there exists an element in the intersection of $A$ and any open set. i.e. $f^{-1}(V)\cap A \neq \emptyset$. Take $y\in f^{-1}(V)\cap A$, then
 $$ f(y)\in f(f^{-1}(V)\cap A) \subset V\cap f(A).$$
