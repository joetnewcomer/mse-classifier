998532,What can we say about the rate of growth of a function growing faster than all polynomials?,Suppose $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfies the following: $$ \forall k \in \mathbb{N} \hspace{5pt} \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{t^k}{f(t)} = 0.$$ Can we deduce a stronger growth rate for $f$? For instance (I know this is very hopeful - I am just giving an example of the sort of thing I mean) can we say $$ \limsup_{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{e^t}{f(t)} < \infty \hspace{5pt}?$$ Many thanks for your help.,"['asymptotics', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
998535,A question from the dreams realm,"Let $\phi:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a function (not necessarily continuous). Let $\phi_0(x)=\phi(x)$ and $\forall k\in\mathbb{N},\phi_{k+1}(x)=\phi(x\cdot\phi_k(x))$. 1. Let $k\in\mathbb{N}^*$. What can be said of the set of functions $\phi$ verifying $\forall x\in\mathbb{R},\phi(x)=\phi_k(x)$ ? 2. What can be said of the set of functions $\phi$ verifying $\forall x\in\mathbb{R},\exists k\in\mathbb{N}^*,\phi(x)=\phi_k(x)$ ? 3. Let $x_1,\dots,x_n\in\mathbb{R}$. . Can we build non-trivial (as in, not mapping the $x_i$ to $0$ or terms that, added, make $0$) functions $\phi$ such that $\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty\sum_{i=1}^n\phi_k(x_i)$ is convergent ? 4. For what functions $\phi$ is the sum $\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty\phi_k(x)$ convergent for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$? Absolutely convergent ? Context : In a dream I had this morning, I was passing an oral exam and the examiner handed me the exercise sheet, on which I could read a line : $\phi(x_1)+\phi(x_2)+...+\phi(x_1\phi(x_1))+\phi(x_2\phi(x_2)+\dots$. Unfortunately, I woke up right after and hence didn't have time to read the rest of the paper. However, as I found it interesting , I wrote that line down to remember it. Thinking back about it during the day, the questions above arose, and I'd be very interested in having them solved.","['summation', 'convergence-divergence', 'functions']"

998633,How is Fubini's theorem used in the following proof?,"I'm having trouble to understand exactly how we are using Fubini's theorem in the following proof involving the distribution function, since it newer explicitly involves an integral with product measure. The proof is given to show that we can calculate an integral over some measure space $X $ as an integral over $[0, \infty ]$
$$\int _X (\phi \circ f ) d \mu= \int _0 ^{\infty } \mu \{f > t \} \phi '(t) dt$$ Where $(X, \mu ) $ is a $\sigma $-finite measure space, and $\phi :[0, \infty ] \mapsto [0, \infty ]$ is monotonic and absolutely continuous on $[0, T ]$ The proof consits of constructing a set $E $ consisting of all points $(x,t) $ where $f> t $. It is easily shown that this set is measurable with respect to the product measure on $X \times [0, \infty ] $. Further the t-section $E^t $ is measurable with respect ot $\mu $. The distribution function of $f $ is $\mu(E^t )= \int _X \chi _E (x,t) d \mu (x) $ And the right side of the top equality is equal to $\int _0 ^{\infty } \mu (E^t) \phi '(t) dt= \int _X d \mu \int \chi _E (x,t) \phi '(t) d t  $ By Fubini's theorem? Exactly how are we using Fubini's theorem as there is no explicit use of an  integral with respect to the product measure. I can see that a part of the conclusion in Fubini's theorem is used to conclude that $\mu (E^t) $ is measurable with respect to the measure on $[0, \infty ]$. Is that all?

998999,Connected unbounded sets $S\subset \Bbb{R}^n$ such that $x\mapsto ||x||^t$ is uniformly continuous on $S$?,"Spending the night perusing my old answers, and this question left me wondering about the following. Let's equip $\Bbb{R}^n$ with the usual Euclidean metric, and let us consider the map $N_t:\Bbb{R}^n\to \Bbb{R}$ , $N_t(\vec{x})=||\vec{x}||^t$ . The parameter $t$ is a positive constant, and the question I want to ask is: For which pairs $(n,t)$ does there exist an unbounded path-connected set $S\subset \Bbb{R}^n$ such that the restriction $N_t\vert_S$ is uniformly continuous? ""Clearly"" with $n=1$ we need $t\le1$ . Path-connected + unbounded leaves no wiggle room for choice of $S$ . The answers to the linked question give sets such that $N_2\vert_S$ is uniformly continuous, but those sets are not connected - hence this question. With $n\ge2$ the game is more interesting. I'm thinking of a $S$ as a path slowly spiralling outwards. With $n=2$ something like $S$ = Archimedean spiral, with the distance from the origin growing at the constant rate of one unit per each full revolution, looks good for showing that all $t\le2$ are ok. Here the length of the path in the $n$ th loop is about $2\pi n$ meaning that if $\vec{x}$ moves by $<\delta$ the distance from the origin will change by approximately a constant times $\delta/n$ . In that case $N_2(\vec{x})$ will grow from $n^2$ to $(n+K\delta/n)^2\approx n^2+2K\delta$ , which is ok, just barely, for the purposes of uniform continuity. It doesn't look nearly as promising for $t>2$ . If we are spiralling out any slower, then further out the distance between consecutive rounds of the spiral will tend to zero. Looks like that makes uniform continuity an unrealistic goal, and The argument by user147263 from the comments under the question shows that the exponent $t$ cannot exceed the dimension of the ambient space. I haven't really thought about $n\ge3$ . We can use the extra wiggle room by spending more time at about the same distance, like ""nearly cover"" the sphere at radius $n$ while gradually moving on to the sphere of radius $n+1$ and repeating ever after. But I don't know any good 3D-spirals, not forgetting $n$ D. Any thoughts? Ideas? Suitable higher dimensional spirals? Known work?","['analytic-geometry', 'parametric', 'real-analysis', 'uniform-continuity']"
999018,"How many different paths to reach $(p,q,r)$ from $(0,0,0)$ without intersection","Problem: In $\mathbb{Z}^3$ starting from $(0,0,0)$ we try to reach $(p,q,r)$ with a sequence of moves. In each step we make a move from a point to another point under following conditions: You can only move to a point with integer coordinates. You can only move to a point $(a,b,c)$ such that $0\leq a \leq p, \ 0 \leq b \leq q,\ 0 \leq c \leq r$. i.e. you have to stay in the ""$p,q,r$"" prism. You can't move to a point that you have already moved. From a point $(a,b,c)$ you can move to one of the points $(a+1,b,c),(a-1,b,c),(a,b+1,c),(a,b-1,c),(a,b,c+1),(a,b,c-1)$ which satisfy above conditions i.e. you can move 1 unit step in one of the three coordinates. We denote $f(p,q,r)$ as different ways of reaching $(p,q,r)$ from $(0,0,0)$ as described above. Is there a closed formula or a recurrence relation for $f(p,q,r)$? Ideas: I know that if we change the 4th restriction with ""you can only move in the positive directions"" then the answer is $\frac{(p+q+r)!}{p!q!r!}$. So $f(p,q,r)$ is larger than this number.

999045,Proof of (MV Calculus) Chain Rule,"Ok, so I'm trying to understand the proof of the Chain Rule from Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds, so I (hopefully correctly) opened up the entire proof to try to understand all the algebra and the roles of the epsilons and deltas in the proof. I'd like to get feedback on if what I did looks fine (even though it looks horrible): Theorem (Chain Rule): If $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ is differentiable at $a$, and $g:\mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^p$ is differentiable at $f(a)$, then the 
composition $g \circ f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^p$ is differentiable at $a$, and $$D(g \circ f)(a)=Dg(f(a)) \circ Df(a).$$ Proof: Suppose $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ is differentiable at $a$, and $g:\mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^p$ is differentiable at $f(a)$. This means that $$(1) \ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\lvert f(a+h)-f(a)-Df(a)(h) \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}=0,$$ and that $$(2) \ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\lvert g(f(a)+h)-g(f(a))-[Dg(f(a))](h) \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}=0.$$ Note then that 
$$\frac{\lvert (g \circ f)(a+h)-(g \circ f)(a)-[Dg(f(a)) \circ Df(a)](h) \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}=$$ $$\frac{\lvert g(f(a+h))-g(f(a))-Dg(f(a))[Df(a)(h)] \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}=$$
$$\frac{\lvert g(f(a+h))-g(f(a))-Dg(f(a))[f(a+h)-f(a)-f(a+h)+f(a)+Df(a)(h)] \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert} \leq$$
$$\frac{\lvert g(f(a+h))-g(f(a))-Dg(f(a))[f(a+h)-f(a)] \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}+\frac{\lvert Dg(f(a))[f(a+h)-f(a)-Df(a)(h)] \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}.$$ But by (2), for every $\epsilon >0$, we can find $\delta >0$ such that $0<\lvert k \rvert<\delta$ implies that $\lvert g(f(a)+k)-g(f(a))-[Dg(f(a))](k) \rvert<\epsilon \lvert k \rvert$; in particular, if $0<\lvert f(a+h)-f(a) \rvert<\delta$ for any $h$ satisfying $0<\lvert h \rvert<\rho$ for a suitable $\rho>0$, then 
$$\frac{\lvert g(f(a+h))-g(f(a))-Dg(f(a))[f(a+h)-f(a)] \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}<$$
$$\frac{\epsilon \lvert f(a+h)-f(a) \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}=$$
$$\frac{\epsilon \lvert f(a+h)-f(a)-Df(a)(h)+Df(a)(h) \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert} \leq$$
$$\frac{\epsilon \lvert f(a+h)-f(a)-Df(a)(h) \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert} + \frac{\epsilon \lvert Df(a)(h) \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}.$$ Now, since $Df(a)$ and $Dg(f(a))$ are linear transformations, we also have that for certain $M,N \in \mathbb{R}$,
$$\lvert Df(a)(h) \rvert<M\lvert h \rvert$$ and 
$$\lvert Dg(f(a))[f(a+h)-f(a)-Df(a)(h)] \rvert<N\lvert f(a+h)-f(a)-Df(a)(h) \rvert.$$ This in turn gives first that
$$\frac{\epsilon \lvert Df(a)(h) \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}<M \epsilon,$$
and also, by using (1), that for every $\epsilon >0$ we can find $\delta >0$ such that $\lvert h \rvert<\delta$ implies that $\lvert f(a+h)-f(a)-Df(a)(h) \rvert<\epsilon \lvert h \rvert$, from which we also obtain 
$$\frac{\lvert f(a+h)-f(a)-Df(a)(h) \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}<\epsilon$$ and
$$\frac{\lvert Dg(f(a))[f(a+h)-f(a)-Df(a)(h)] \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}<$$
$$\frac{N\lvert f(a+h)-f(a)-Df(a)(h) \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}<$$
$$\frac{N \epsilon \lvert h \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}=N \epsilon.$$ Finally, piecing all of the above together (from the last three inequalities we can conclude that both terms on the right hand side of the original inequality are arbitrarily small) gives the conclusion: $$\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\lvert (g \circ f)(a+h)-(g \circ f)(a)-[Dg(f(a)) \circ Df(a)](h) \rvert}{\lvert h \rvert}=0.$$ Thanks in advance.","['multivariable-calculus', 'proof-verification']"

999229,Verification of Proof that if $G$ is not abelian $G/Z(G)$ is not cyclic,"I will prove this by the contrapositive: If $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic then $G$ is abelian. Proof: We assume that $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic.  This means it is generated by a left coset $(aZ(G))^n=e$ for some integer $n$.  By defined operation $a^n Z(G)=e$. Let $x,y \in G$ and $z_0, z_1 \in Z(G)$, so this leads to $$a^n z_0=x,\ a^m z_1=y.$$. This implies: $$xy=a^n z_0,\ a^m z_1 = a^{nm}(z_0 z_1)=a^m z_1,\ a^n z_0=yx.$$ This what I've been told is the write answer but I am wondering however, why is it necessary to let $x,y \in G$ and set our two elements $a^n z_0$ and $a^m z_1$ to elements $x, y \in G$?

Recall that convolution of $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ is defined as: $(\mu_1 \star \mu_2)(g)=\sum\limits_{h \in G}\mu_1(gh^{-1})\mu_2(h)$. Now, it's a fact that $H(\mu_1 \star \mu_2) \leq H(\mu_1)+H(\mu_2)$. The usual proof goes by showing that entropy decreases under factor maps.

999307,"Use $C^\infty$ function to approximate $W^{1,\infty}$ function in finite domain","This is exercise 10.21 from Leoni's book. The exercise asks me to prove that for any $u\in W^{1,\infty}(\Omega)$ where $\Omega$ is open FINITE, there exists a sequence $(u_n)\subset C^\infty(\Omega)$ such that 
$$\|u_n-u\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\to 0 \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(1)$$
and
$$\|\nabla u_n\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\to \|\nabla u\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\,\,\text{with }\,\,\nabla u_n\to\nabla u \,\,\text{a.e.} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(2)$$
The exercise gives a hint that I should try to modify the prove of Meyers-Serrin theorem that shows every $W^{1,p}$ function can be approximated by $C^\infty$ function in $W^{1,p}$ norm. This is what I did so far: I first make a claim. Assume $U\subset R^n$ is open and $U'\subset\subset U$. Hence, for $\epsilon>0$ small enough we can define $u_\epsilon:=\eta_\epsilon \ast u$ inside $U'$ where $\eta_\epsilon$ is the standard mollifier. Then I claim that there is a subsequence of $u_\epsilon$, still denote as $u_\epsilon$, such that $u_\epsilon$ satisfies $(1)$ and $(2)$ in $U'$ (with $\Omega$ replaced by $U'$). To show $u_\epsilon\to u$ uniformly in $U'$, I use ascoli-arzela theorem. Clearly, from the definition of mollification, we have $$\sup_{\epsilon>0}\|u_\epsilon\|_{L^{\infty}(U')}\leq \|u\|_{L^{\infty}(U)},\,\sup_{\epsilon>0}\|\nabla u_\epsilon\|_{L^{\infty}(U')}\leq \|\nabla u\|_{L^{\infty}(U)} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(3)$$
Hence, ascoli-arzela theorem states that, up to a subsequence, that $u_\epsilon\to u$ uniformly, i.e., in $L^\infty(U')$ because $U'$ is compact. This gives $(1)$ in $U'$. To show $(2)$, we deduce from $(3)$ that, up to a subsequence,$\nabla u_\epsilon\to \nabla u$ in weak star sense, and hence we have $\liminf \|\nabla u_\epsilon\|\geq \|\nabla u\|$, together with $(3)$ again, we have $\lim \|\nabla u_\epsilon\|=\|\nabla u\|$. In the end, we also have $\nabla u_\epsilon\to \nabla u$ a.e., because $u_\epsilon\to u$ in $W^{1,p}$ on any compact domain. Now go back to our original question. We will use partition of unity as it be used in the prove of Meyers-Serrin theorem. The prove is on page 285. It is too long I can not type everything here. We use the same partition of unity $\phi_i$ as it used in the book. Briefly, spt$\phi_i\subset\subset \Omega_{i+1}\setminus\Omega_{i-1}$ and $\Omega=\cup \Omega_i$ for $\Omega_i\subset\subset \Omega_{i+1}$. Then by my claim I could choose $\epsilon_i$ for each $i$ such that, for arbitrary $\eta>0$,
$$\|(\phi_iu)_{\epsilon_i}-\phi_iu\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}< \frac{\eta}{2^i} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(4)$$
and
$$\left|\|\nabla (\phi_iu)_{\epsilon_i}\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}- \|\nabla (\phi_iu)\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\right|<\frac{\eta}{2^i} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(5)$$ So far I am comfortable and confident with my proof. But the rest I am NOT sure at all. Now we define $v:=\sum_{i=1}^\infty (\phi_iu)_{\epsilon_i}$ and by $u=\sum_{i=1}^\infty (\phi_iu)$ I want to conclude 
$$\|v-u\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\leq \eta \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(6)$$
and
$$\left|\|\nabla v\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}- \|\nabla u\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\right|<\eta\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(7)$$ And here is my CONCERN. 1: I am NOT sure at all about my conclusion of $(6)$ and $(7)$. It should go like this way but I can not prove it formally. After all, $L^\infty$ norm is so different then $L^p$ norm. I never have monotone convergence thm in $L^\infty$ nor LDCT. Thx for @sanjab's answer, but my concern is still remain. More specific, we never have
$$\lim_{n\to \infty}\|\chi_{\Omega_n}u\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} = \|u\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}$$
That is, I accept @sanjab's answer that $$\|v_l-u_l\|_{L^\infty(\Omega_l)} \leq \sum_{i=1}^l \|(\phi_iu)_{\epsilon_i}-\phi_iu\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}<
 \sum_{i=1}^l \frac{\eta}{2^i} \leq \eta$$ and hence 
$$\limsup_{l\to\infty}\|v_l-u_l\|_{L^\infty(\Omega_l)} \leq \eta$$ However, it may happen that 
$$\limsup_{l\to\infty}\|v_l-u_l\|_{L^\infty(\Omega_l)}<\|v-u\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}$$
but not
$$\limsup_{l\to\infty}\|v_l-u_l\|_{L^\infty(\Omega_l)}=\|v-u\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}$$
so we lose the upper bound. I understand this case won't happen if $u$ is continuous. But as we have no control of domain, we can not use embedding theorem to conclude that $u$ is actually Lipschitz. 2: So far I NEVER use the fact the $\Omega$ is finite. So either I prove a stronger version then this exercise, or I make some mistake in my prove. (I think the second assumption will hold :)) Please help!

Another example would be How many pairs of distinct non-negative integers are there that add to $6$?

1000044,Maps between direct limits and functoriality of $f^{-1}:Shv(Y) \rightarrow Shv(X)$ and $f_{*}:Shv(X) \rightarrow Shv(Y)$,"My question rises from exercise 1.18 in chapter 2 of Hartshorne. Given a continuous function $f:X \rightarrow Y$, one has to show there is a natural bijection between $\mathrm{Hom}_X(f^{-1}\mathcal{G},\mathcal{F})$ and $\mathrm{Hom}_Y(\mathcal{G},f_*\mathcal{F})$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is a sheaf over $Y$ and $\mathcal{F}$ a sheaf over $X$. So far I have shown that we have natural maps $f^{-1}f_* \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}$ and $G \rightarrow f_* f^{-1} G$. I am not completely sure what is meant about naturality. My guess is that given a diagram $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD}
f^{-1}\mathcal{G}_1 @>{}>> \mathcal{F}_1\\
@VVV @VVV \\
f^{-1}\mathcal{G}_2 @>{}>> \mathcal{F}_2
\end{CD} one should get a diagram \begin{CD}
\mathcal{G}_1 @>{}>> f_*\mathcal{F}_1\\
@VVV @VVV \\
\mathcal{G}_2 @>{}>> f_*\mathcal{F}_2
\end{CD} and analogously interchanging the roles of $f^{-1}$ and $f_*$. A first question is ""am I right?"". If so, now applying $f_*$ to the first diagram and using the natural maps mentioned above, I would have a diagram \begin{CD}
\mathcal{G}_1 @>{}>> f_* f^{-1} \mathcal{G}_1 @>>> \ f_*\mathcal{F}_1\\
& @VVV @VVV \\
\mathcal{G}_2 @>{}>> f_* f^{-1} \mathcal{G}_2 @>>> f_*\mathcal{F}_2
\end{CD} and I would have to build the first arrow. By simplicity, instead of the sheaves given by $f^{-1}$, I argue using the presheaves whose associated sheaf is the inverse image. Then given $U$ open in $Y$, I want a map $\mathcal{G}_1 (U) \rightarrow \mathcal{G}_2(U)$, given one between
\begin{equation}
\lim_{f(f^{-1}(U)) \subset V} \mathcal{G}_1(V) \rightarrow \lim_{f(f^{-1}(U)) \subset V} \mathcal{G}_2(V)
\end{equation} Now, in general a map between direct limits does not come from a map between the direct systems, right? Hence I was wondering how to build the map I want. In know that $U$ is in the set where I do the direct limit, and then my guess was: given a section in $\mathcal{G}_1(U)$, I send it to its class $\overline{s}$ in the direct limit. Then, for this precise section (not for the whole homomorphism), the map between the direct limits is given by assigning a section $t \in \mathcal{G}_2(V)$, with $f(f^{-1}(U))\subset V \subset U$. Now my idea was: I cannot ask for $V$ to be $U$, but if I manage to do something like this around each point $P \in U$ (i.e. I take $s_{|U_P}$ with $P \in U_P \subset U$ with the property that if I do the procedure described for $U$, I find a $V_P$ with $P \in V_P$), then I can glue the sections each point give me, since they come from the map of direct limits restricted to smaller sets. Now I have two doubts: I know that the sections I pick for points $P$ and $Q$ agree eventually in come intersection,  since both have to describe the image of $\overline{s}_{|V_p \cap V_Q}$, but I don't know anything about $V_P \cap V_Q$. Also, I am not sure that for any point $P$ I can pick the $V_P$ I want. Are my ideas in teh right direction or am I completely lost? Also, am I in trouble defining the images I want since I am not usinge the sheaves $f^{-1}\mathcal{G}_i$ but the presheaves defining them?","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'abstract-algebra', 'category-theory']"

1000256,Finding patterns in differential equation coefficients,"Suppose I have a function, $b_N(x)$ which satisfies the following differential equations:
$$-Nb_N(x)^2=xb_N'(x)+\color{blue}{(N-x)}b_N(x)$$
$$2N^2b_N(x)^3=x^2b_N''(x)-\left\{x\left[(N-1)-x\right]+2x(N-x)\right\}b_N'+x\left[x+2\color{blue}{(N-x)^2}\right]b_N(x)$$
$$-6N^3b_N(x)^4=\alpha_1b_N'''(x)+\alpha_2b_N''(x)+\alpha_3b_N'(x)+\alpha_4b_N(x)$$
where
$$\alpha_1=x^3$$
$$\alpha_2=3x^2(N-x)+\left\{x^2\left[(N-1)-x\right]+2x^2(N-x)-2x^2\right\}$$
$$\alpha_3=\left\{3x(N-x)\left[(N-1)-x\right]+6x(N-x)^2\right\}+\left\{5x^2+2x(N-x)^2+x(N-1)+2x(N-x)\right\}$$
$$\alpha_4=x-7x(N-x)-6\color{blue}{(N-x)^3}$$ I'm trying to connect the coefficients of the third differential equation to the coefficients of the first and second order equations above.  It is clear that in each case the term of highest order (highest derivative) will have degree $m-1$ if $m$ is the power of the term on the LHS.  And the LHS will be $m!N^mb_N(x)^{(m+1)}$.  Now there seem to be a number of ways to go about finding a pattern in the coefficients of the higher order differential equation coefficients.  Looking at the differential equations above, all three involve successive powers of $(N-x)$.  For example, the $b_N$ terms in all three are in order
$$\color{blue}{(N-x)}$$
$$x\left[x+2\color{blue}{(N-x)^2}\right]$$
$$x-7x(N-x)-6\color{blue}{(N-x)^3}$$
Clearly a pattern that might repeat with successive iterations.  However, my first instinct when I began this problem was to simply distribute out and write each coefficient as a polynomial in standard form.  For example, the first and second order differential equations would then look like
$$-Nb_N(x)^2=xb_N'(x)+(x-N)b_N(x)$$
$$2N^2b_N(x)^3=\color{red}{1}x^2b_N''(x)+\left[\color{red}{3}x^2+(1-3N)x\right]b_N'(x)+\left[\color{red}{2}x^2+(1-4N)x+2N^2\right]b_N(x)$$
This also looks like there could be some pattern if we continued on to the third order and took the derivative of both sides.  For example, the leading coefficients from each polynomial coefficients in the second order equation are the coefficients of the terms from the expression
$$(x+1)(x+2)=\color{red}{1}x^2+\color{red}{3}x+\color{red}{2}$$
where 1 is the leading coefficient from $b_N''(x), 3$ is the leading coefficient from $b_N'(x),$ etc.  This is also true for the third order differential equation generated by $6N^3b_N(x)^4$ and the coefficents are generated by $(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)$.  My question is this.  Does it seem more advantageous to keep the original form where the coefficients are in terms of $(N-x)$, or $[(N-1)-x]$ or would it be easier to put all coefficients in standard polynomial form?  I've got a number of calculations for coefficients $\alpha_i$ but none really look like the first and second order equations.  Perhaps I'm also missing something.","['polynomials', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus', 'combinatorics']"
1000276,How do we know we have all subsets of a set?,"The axiom schema of comprehension basically says that every definable subclass of a set is also a set. However, we know there are only countably many formulas in the language of set theory. So, this axiom seems to only give us countably many subsets of a set. Intuitively, this seems like a very bad result since we know there should be way more subsets of large cardinalities than this. Intuitively, I want ALL subsets of a set to exist, regardless of whether or not they are nameable by some formula. So, my main first question is how to alleviate the worry that we are missing on lots of different subsets of a set, and therefore our math may think the power set of a set is way smaller than it should be. My second side question is that given that the axiom of comprehension only seems to give us countably many subsets of a set, where do all the other subsets come from? We can prove that the powerset of the natural numbers is not countable, and of course I understand that formal proof. Maybe there is nothing more to say about this than just pointing at the proof, but some explanation as to what generates these subsets, given that the real thing that we want generating these subsets (namely their mere existence rather than definability) is not generating these subsets.","['elementary-set-theory', 'soft-question']"

Now for $E \subset \Sigma$ define $m(E) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{|E \cap \{ q_1, q_2, ..., q_n \}|}{n}$ where $(q_j)_{j=1}^\infty$ is an enumeration of the rationals and $|A|$ denotes the cardinality of a finite set $A$.
