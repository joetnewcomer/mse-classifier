301685,Prove that if $|A|=|B|$ and $|B|=|C|$ then $|A|=|C|$,"Let $A,B$ and $C$ be sets. Prove that if $|A|=|B|$ and $|B|=|C|$ then $|A|=|C|$.
Let $A,B$ and $C$ be sets. Solution $|A|=|B|$ means there exists a bijection $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $|B|=|C|$  means there exists a bijection $g:B\rightarrow C$ we need to show that $|A|=|C|$ meaning we have to prove that there also exist a bijection $h:A\rightarrow C$. In other words we have to show that the function $h$ is injective and surjective For that we use the existing functions $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:B\rightarrow C$. Now we will consider the element in the domain of $h$ and we define it as $h(a)=f(a)$. Since we have defined $h$ we will show that it is injective and surjective . To show surjective consider an element $x$ in the codomain of $h$. It is $c\in C$. For $x=c$ we use the fact that $g:B\rightarrow C$ is surjective and so there exists some $b\in B$ such that $f(b)=c$. but then by definition of $h$, holds $h(b)=c=x$. To show that $h$ is injective , suppose that $x,y$ are in the domain of $h$ and that $h(x)=h(y)$. Call this common value $z$. It is $z=a$ then by definition of $h$, $x=a$ and $y=a'$ and moreover $f(a)=f(a')=b$. But since $f$ is injective it follows that $a=a'$ and so that $x=y$ Can anyone correct me please!!",['elementary-set-theory']

301745,"An explicit construction for a ""doubly weak"" topology","Let $(X,s)$ be a topological vector space over $\mathbb{F}$ with linear topology $s$, which we will henceforth refer to as the strong topology . Then, as usual we can construct the continuous dual space $(X,s)'$, which consists of all linear maps $X \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ which are continuous with respect to the strong topology. Now, we can construct the weak topology $w$, the smallest topology on $X$ such that every map $\Lambda \in (X,s)'$ remains continuous. So now here's my question. The weak topology on $X$ yields a new topological vector space $(X,w)$, so we can construct a continuous dual for that too. So what does $(X,w)'$ look like? It must at the very least contain $(X,s)'$, of course. Other possible questions: For what types of TVS's can we infer something about the structure of $(X,w)'$ with respect to $(X,s)'$? What happens in a normed vector space? Can somebody give me an explicit construction indicating that there exists a linear map $X \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ which is not continuous in the strong topology but is continuous in the weak topology? I suppose we can repeat this process to produce a ""doubly weak"" topology $ww$ on $X$ that is the weakest topology such that every $\Lambda \in (X,w)'$ remains continuous. Then we can produce yet another continuous dual space $(X,ww)'$. Does this process repeat forever? Does it terminate?","['topological-vector-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

301778,What are some measures of connectedness in graphs?,"I am not a mathematician (I am an engineer who is working on improving his mathematics), so I apologize in advance if my question is trivial. Consider a graph of $N$ nodes, with some defined criterion as to whether two nodes are connected or not. What are some measures of the graph's connectedness? I can think of several such measures, but I'm not sure which ones make the most mathematical sense: Whether the entire graph is connected or not. This is, however, a binary measure, and does not capture much information. The size of the largest intra-connected sub graph ($0 \leq n \leq N$). This, however, tells you nothing about what's happening in the rest of the graph. The number of intra-connected (but not inter-connected) sub-graphs in the graph ($0 \leq n \leq N$). Each node $i\in \{1,2,\dots,N\}$ is assigned a 'score' $s_i\in\{1,2,\dots,N\}$, which measures how many other nodes it is connected to. The graphs' connectedness is then measured as the average of these scores, i.e. $\sum_i s_i / N$, such that it lies in the interval $[0,N]$. The kind of questions I am interested in are ones like: Is 4. a mathematically sound measure? Can it give rise to anomalies? Are there better measures that are more robust? Please forgive me if I am not rigorous enough in my explanations. As an engineer, I have been trained to think in 'intuitive' (rather than formal) terms, which can often be a huge help, but at other times a hindrance.","['connectedness', 'graph-theory', 'soft-question', 'combinatorics']"

301852,Determine the number of irreducible monic polynomials of degree 3 in $\mathbb F_p[x]$,"Determine the number of irreducible monic polynomials of degree 3 in $\mathbb F_p[x]$ where $p$ is a prime. I'd like to start off by acknowledging that I know there are many posts relating to similar problems both on here and mathoverflow, however none address my problem. In class, my professor went over the monic polynomials of degree 2 by reasoning that there are $p^2$ distinct polynomials, the reducible ones look like $(x - a)^2$ and $(x - a)(x - b)$ for the first one there are $p$ of them and for the second one there are $p(p-1)/2$ of them, subtracting the reducible ones from the total ones gives $$p^2 - p - \frac{p(p - 1)}{2} = \frac{2p^2 - 2p - p(p-1)}{2} = \frac{2p^2 - 2p - p^2 + p}{2} = \frac{p^2 - p}{2}.$$ I'm trying to use similar reasoning for polynomials of degree three using the fact that there are $p$ irreducible monic linear polynomials and $p(p-1)/2$ irreducible monic quadratic polynomials. But I can never get the result shown here and here . My reasoning is as follows: Observe that reducible polynomials would look like $(x - a)(x - b)(x - c)$, $(x - a)^2(x - b)$, $(x - c)^3$ and $(x^2 + ax + b)(x - c)$ formed from irreducible linear and quadratic monic polynomials. For the first type where all three are distinct we can surmise that there are $p$ choices for the first, $p-1$ choices for the second and $p - 2$ choices for the third. So we have $p(p-1)(p-2)$. (is it $p$ choose $3$? Do I have to account for order not mattering?) For the second type there are $p$ choices for the square, and $p-1$ choices for the linear polynomial, so we have $p(p-1)/2$. For the third type, we have shown that there are $p(p-1)/2$ choices for the quadratic polynomials and there are $p$ choices for the linear polynomial. So we have $p^2(p-1)/2$. Subtracting these values from $p^3$ should give me what I'm looking for, which is $p(p^2 - 1)/3$. But I'm not getting that. Can someone tell me where my reasoning is wrong? Or tell me how to go about counting the number of irreducibles? (I know there are other methods of getting the answer, even more general ones, but I'm looking for a simple counting method that can help me better understand where my reasoning is wrong and help me correct it.)","['finite-fields', 'polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'combinatorics']"

301929,Plotting a Function of a Complex Variable,"I've been teaching myself complex analysis using ""Introductory Complex Analysis"" by Richard A.

302132,Thoughts about sectional curvature,"I'm currently trying to understand the sectional curvature of riemannian manifolds and I don't know if I'm thinking correctly. So, say we have a riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with constant sectional curvature $k$. As far as i know the curvature at any given point is completely determined by the metric $g$. After doing some calculations it seems true to me, that if we equip $M$ with a new metric 
$$
\tilde{g} = \lambda \cdot g,
$$
where $\lambda$ is just some strictly positive scalar, the curvature of the manifold $(M,\tilde{g})$ is scaled in the same way, i.e. $(M,\tilde{g})$ has constant sectional curvature $\lambda \cdot k$. Now, I know that the sectional curvature of the sphere with radius $1$ is equal to $1$ and the curvature of the sphere with radius $2$ is equal to $\frac{1}{4}$. I'm wondering if, from a riemannian geometry viewpoint, it's somehow the same to look at the radius $2$ sphere, embedded in euclidean space OR the radius $1$ sphere, equipped with the ""compressed"" metric $\frac{1}{4}g$, where $g$ is the usual scalar product of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is probably a rather soft question, but maybe someone has something to add or can correct my reasoning :)","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

302199,Is there a way to relate convexity to Gaussian curvature?,"This is a vague question because I'm not sure what I want to ask. An ellipsoid has positive curvature everywhere, and bounds a convex subset of $\mathbb R^3$. What I want to say now is ""It seems as though a surface with negative curvature can't be convex"" but this isn't right, because the ellipsoid itself is not convex, and I could only get at what I was thinking of by observing that it bounds a subset of  $\mathbb R^3$. But this isn't quite what I want, because the ellipsoid is also the boundary of a non-convex subset of $\mathbb R^3$, namely the complement of the convex region.  Well, the convex region is bounded, okay, so I can pick out the convex region I want that way, and say that if a surface is the boundary of a bounded subset $S$ of $\mathbb R^3$, and has positive curvature everywhere, then $S$ is convex.  But this is not as general as what I want, because a paraboloid also has positive curvature everywhere, and it is the boundary of a convex  subset of $\mathbb R^3$, but the claim of the previous sentence doesn't apply to it. Maybe what I want is something like: let $P$ be a point on a surface, and let $C$ be a small closed curve on the surface that bounds a region $R$ of the surface that contains $P$. Then the subset of $\mathbb R^3$ bounded by $R$ and by (something?) is convex if and only if the Gaussian curvature at $P$ is positive. Or perhaps the condition is that the curvature at every point of $R$ must be non-negative.  Or something. It seems like there are some theorems here, but I don't know quite where to look for them.  Are there theorems relating Gaussian curvature of a surface to the convexity of the region of which it is the boundary? Is it at least true that the boundary surface of a convex subset of $\mathbb R^3$ has non-negative curvature everywhere that its curvature is well-defined?

302508,Choosing an advanced group theory text: concerns,"In this question, An Introduction to the Theory of Groups by Rotman is recommended twice as a good second-course group theory text.  However, after reading the reviews here , and seeing this pdf of what seems to be corrections to Rotman, I am pretty concerned about the apparently many errors in the text.  While some errors and their corrections may be pretty self-evident, I would hate to constantly be worrying about developing some misconception as a result of some fact that isn't presented quite as it should be. To those who have read An Introduction to the Theory of Groups by Rotman: do you feel the errors are a serious concern/disruption to the flow of the text, or is the book still pretty navigable? Also recommended in the question linked to above was A Course in the Theory of Groups by Robinson.  I really like the look of this text, based on the table of contents and the group-theoretic concepts that really interest me. The Robinson text is said (in the linked-to question) to 'move pretty quickly into deeper waters.'  My background consists of basic group theory, ring theory, field theory, a little Galois theory, linear algebra, topology, real analysis, and graph theory (I have seen a decent amount of material and have been self-studying for a few years now). Do you think that I can reasonably wade into these deeper waters without going in over my head and drowning?  I realize this is a little subjective since no one knows my exact abilities, but I love group theory and am definitely willing to put some real effort into it.

302509,Schwarz Reflection Prinnciple for (Real) Harmonic Functions,"Assume $u$ is harmonic in $U^{+}$, $u\equiv0$ on $\partial U^{+}\cap\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}$, and $u\in\mathscr{C}^{2}(\bar{U}^{+})$, where $U$ is the open ball $B_{1}(0)$ of radius $1$ about the origin in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $U^{+}$ being the upper half-ball: $U^{+}:=U\cap\partial\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}.$ (This is problem #2.5.-something in Evans PDE text). We want to show (under the assumed regularity of $u$) that the odd extension of $u$ into $U^{-}$ provides us a with a harmonic function on all of $U$.  That is, if $v=u$ in $U^{+}$, $v=0$ on $\partial U\cap\mathbb{R}^{n}_{\pm}$, and $v=-u(-x)$ in $U^{-}$, then $v$ is harmonic and $\mathscr{C}^{2}$ in all of $U$. Okay, it is obvious $v$ is $\mathscr{C}^{2}$ in the separated sets $U^{+}$ and $U^{-}$.  Since $u$ is $\mathscr{C}^{2}$ upto the boundary of $U^{+}$ (in particular upto $\bar{U}\cap\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}$), then it is also clear that $v$ is $\mathscr{C}^{2}$ in all of $\bar{U}$.  We also see that $v$ satisfies the mean-value-properties in $U^{+}$ and $U^{-}$, and also on $U\cap\mathbb{R}^{n}_{\pm}$ because of the odd symmetry. Here's my problem, and of all the proofs I have seen, this is overlooked.  The mean-value properties of $u$ are satisfied on $U^{+}$, $U^{-}$ and $\partial U\cap\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}$, yes.  But only when viewed individually.  How do you use the fact that $v\in\mathscr{C}^{2}(\bar{U})$ to then show that the mean-value property is satisfied in all of $U$ (not just the three aforementioned sets when the spherical averages are restricted to the individuals sets).  In other words, how do you justify the extending of a spherical average across the three sets (say at a point $x\in U^{+}$ with radius sufficiently large to intersect all three sets, but sufficiently small to remain in $U$). I will reiterate this: every proof I have seen does not make explicit reference to the $\mathscr{C}^{2}$ regularity of $v$.  If the mean-value property can be demonstrated without $\mathscr{C}^{2}$ regularity, then all one needs is $\mathscr{C}$ regularity (not even differentiability) of $v$ in order to conclude $v$ is harmonic (it is easy to prove that a continuous function which satisfies the mean-value property at every point in an open set is harmonic there).  But if this were the case, then why would Evans (and other texts where the problem is posed) be insistent on requiring $u$ being $\mathscr{C}^{2}$ in $\bar{U}^{+}$, and thus $v$ $\mathscr{C}^{2}$ in $\bar{U}$? NOTE: In part (b) of this problem, Evans drops the hypothesis that $u$ is $\mathscr{C}^{2}$ upto the boundary, only that $u\in\mathscr{C}^{2}(U^{+})\cap\mathscr{C}(\bar{U})$.  But the suggested proof is entirely different: apply the Poisson integral formula for harmonic functions on a disc.  Indeed, one solves the problem
$$\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
\Delta w=0&\text{in}\;U\\
w=g&\text{on}\;\partial U,\end{array}\right.$$
where $g(x)=u(x)$ on the upper boundary and $g(x)=-u(-x)$ on the lower boundary.  The solution is given by the Poisson integral formula, and computing $w(x^{+})$ where $x^{+}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}\cap U$, we find $w(x^{+})=0$.  From uniqueness, we conclude that $w(x)=v$ as above (the odd extension of $u$), and the theorem is proved. Anyway, if anyone could help me fill in the details of the mean-value property argument in the first part, I would appreciate it!","['partial-differential-equations', 'real-analysis']"

302551,"Removing a card while preserving ""shuffled-ness""","Suppose you have a deck of numbered cards (possibly with multiple copies of each number), perfectly shuffled, and you want to extract certain cards without disturbing the ""shuffled-ness"" of the remaining cards.  This is easy to do in some cases.  For instance, if you want to remove a unique card (the only $10$, say), or all cards with a particular number (all the $5$'s), then you can simply pull out the target cards while keeping the remaining cards in the same order.  If all $n!$ permutations of the full deck were equally likely before, then all $(n-k)!$ permutations of the remaining $n-k$ cards are equally likely now; that is, the remaining cards are still shuffled.  Similarly, if you remove the card in a pre-specified position (the topmost card, say) or set of positions (the bottom ten cards), then the remaining cards (whatever they are) will still be shuffled. My question is about the cases where the simple approach doesn't work.  For example, say you want to remove three of the four $7$'s (you don't care which ones).  If you just pull out the topmost three $7$'s, then the remaining cards will clearly not be shuffled: the fourth $7$ isn't equally likely to be at any position, but rather is much more likely to be near the bottom of the deck.  (The same problem occurs if you remove just one of the four $7$'s, but the bias is less extreme.)  If you instead move cards from the top of the deck to the bottom, removing $7$'s as you find them until only one is left, then you have the opposite problem: the remaining $7$ is now likely to be near the top. Is there any deterministic way to remove a single copy of a particular number without introducing a bias to the remaining cards? (Note: Clearly there can't be one in general .  For instance, if your cards are $\{1,2,2\}$, then there are three equiprobable deck configurations, and any mapping of these to the two target deck configurations $[1,2]$ and $[2,1]$ is going to have a bias.  But are there non-trivial cases where it's possible?)","['card-games', 'probability']"

In Harthorne book, Lemma (II.4,4) is to prove that given a scheme $X$ , to a morphism of $T$ to $X$ is equivalent to giving two points $x_0,x_1$ in $X$ , with $x_0 \in \bar{\{x_1\}}$ and an inclusion $k(x_1)\subseteq K$ ,such that $R$ dominates the local ring $\mathcal{O}$ of $x_0$ on the subscheme $Z= \bar{\{x_1\}}$ of $X$ with its reduced induced structure.
In proof, I don't understand following statement: $k(x_1)$ is the function field of $Z$ . So we have a homomorphism of $\mathcal{O}=\mathcal{O}_{x_0,Z}$ to $R$ compatible with the inclusion $k(x_1) \subseteq K$ .","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
303865,A question on metric spaces,Let $X$ and $Y$ be two metric space and $f:X\to Y$ a function. Let $f:K\to Y$ be continuous for every compact set $K$ of $X$. Is $f$ continuous?,"['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"
303869,Are the right derived functors of the inclusion sheaf cohomology?,"In the answer to the question "" Mathematically mature way to think about Mayer–Vietoris "" given by Angelo, he claims that the right derived functors $R^k(j)$ of the left-exact embedding $$j:Sh~X\subseteq PreSh~X$$
are given for a sheaf $F$ by the presheaf $R^k(j)(F)$ sending an open set $V\subseteq X$ to $H^k(U,F)=H^k(U,F|_U)$. The latter should be sheaf cohomology, I think. How can I see that the right derived functors $R^k(j)$ are actually sheaf cohomology?","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"
303870,Proving $\sum \limits_{i=1}^k n_i^2 \le n^2 -(k-1)(2n-k) $,"Given, $\sum \limits_{i=1}^k n_i = n$ and $n_i \ge 1$. Prove that $$\sum \limits_{i=1}^k n_i^2 \le n^2 -(k-1)(2n-k) $$ I am facing some problems in understanding the following step of this proof: $$ \left(\sum \limits_{i=1}^k (n_i-1)\right)^2 =  \sum \limits_{i=1}^k (n_i^2-2n_i)+k+ \text{ non-negative cross terms } $$ I am not getting this transformation, could anybody explain this in a lucid manner?
