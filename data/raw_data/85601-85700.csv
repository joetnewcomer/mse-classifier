1129712,Range of A and null space of the transpose of A,"So I'm complete stuck with something. I know it the following statements are true (or at least the seem to be from the results that I got from messing around with it a bit on MATLAB), but I don't understand why they are true or how to show so.
Let $A$ be and $m$X$n$ matrix. Show that: a) if $x \in N(A^TA)$ then $Ax$ is in both $R(A)$ and $N(A^T)$. For this one I messed around with it with my own examples and I got $Ax=0$, therefore satisfing the statement, but I don't understand what's actually going on. b) $N(A^TA)=N(A)$ again, makes sense when I see the results in MATLAB, but don't undestand why it works. c) $A$ and $A^TA$ have the same rank d) If $A$ has linearly independent columns, the $A^TA$ is nonsingular. For the last two I have no idea on how to even start showing the relationship. I feel like I'm missing some crucial relationship between $A$ and $A^TA$, but I'm just not seeing it. I would greatly appreciate any help of sugestions on how to show that these statements are true. Thank you very much.","['linear-algebra', 'orthogonality']"

Still really new to LaTeX as well$$\int \frac{1}{x^3 -1}dx $$ I first used partial fractions to decompose this integral into two parts$$\int \frac{1}{3(x-1)}dx -\frac{1}{3} \int \frac{x+2}{x^2 + x + 1}dx$$ I definitely can solve the first part as $\frac{\ln(x-1)}{3}$ but I'm stuck with the second part as I don't know what to do since the denominator is not easily factor-able. Thanks in advance to anybody taking the time to read this.

1129741,Proving the sample variance has a chi squared critical value,"Let $X_1, . . . , X_n$ be independent normal observations with means $µ = 0$ and variances $σ^2$. For testing the null hypothesis $H_0 : σ^2 = 1$ versus the alternative $H_a : σ^2 > 1$ show that the likelihood ratio test is $$\dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2>\dfrac{k}{n}$$ where the critical value $k$ is the $\alpha$ critical value for the $\chi^2_n$ distribution. You can use the fact that $$\hat{\sigma^2}=\dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2$$ Basically I found the likelihood ratio which I got was $$T=2[\dfrac{-n}{2}ln(\hat{\sigma^2})-\dfrac{n}{2}+\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2]$$ Let $k\in\mathbb{R}$ such that 
$$T=2[\dfrac{-n}{2}ln(\hat{\sigma^2})-\dfrac{n}{2}+\dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2]>k\geq 0$$ since we know $T\geq 0$. From here I get $$\dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2-ln(\hat{\sigma^2})-1>\dfrac{k}{n}$$. The only way I can establish this relationship is by seeing that since $T\geq 0$ then it follows that $$\dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2>ln(\hat{\sigma^2})+1\implies\dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2>\dfrac{k}{n}\implies \sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2>k $$. Now under the null hypothesis it follows $X_1,..,X_n$~$N(0,1)$ and iid (Cochrans Theorem). Therefore it follows $\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2$~$\chi_n^2$. We can let $k=\chi_{\alpha,n}^2$ for any specified $\alpha$. Would this be correct? Thanks. This was the only way I could see doing this problem.","['statistics', 'probability-theory', 'proof-verification', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"
1129775,Conditioning on a continuous random variable,"I have a random variable $N(a)$, which depends on a number $a$, having the property that for all $a \in \mathbb{R}$,
$$P(N(a) \geq 1) = p $$ The example I have in mind is $N(a)$ is $T-a$ where $T$ the time of first arrival in a Poisson process after $a$, which is why there is no dependence of $P(N(a) \geq 1)$ on $a$. However, let us not assume anything like this - $N(a)$ is just a random variable for each $a$. Let $Z$ be a continuous random variable independent of all $N(a)$. I would like to assert that 
$$P(N(Z) \geq 1) = p.$$ 
My question is how I might justify this. It is natural to try to justify it by writing $$P(N(Z) \geq 1) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} P(N(a) \geq 1) f_Z(a) ~ da = p$$

1129867,Lemma on locally finite open covers,"I came across this lemma in Lee's 'Introduction to Smooth Manifolds'. The lemma seems simple enough to prove, but I just can't seem to prove it. It's frustrating me because I know it must be simple. The lemma is: An open cover $\{U_{\alpha}\}$ of a topological space $X$ is locally finite if and only if each $U_{\alpha}$ intersects $U_{\beta}$ for only finitely many $\beta$. Lee then asks to Give a counterexample if the sets of the cover are not assumed to be open. Does anyone have any glaringly obvious things to point out I'm missing? I have thought about trying to prove the necessary statement via contradiction. Ie suppose the open cover is locally finite but assume there exists a $U_{\alpha}$ such that $U_{\alpha}$ intersects infinitely many $U_{\beta}$-s. The required result would follow easily (I think) if I was able to show that there is a common point $p$ in this infinite intersection' - but I'm not sure if I can conclude this.","['general-topology', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

1129902,Clarification on unit normal vector to a graph of a function,"In solving for the unit normal vector $\hat{n}$ of a surface $z=h(x,y)$, the unit normal vector is defined as follows: $$\hat{n}=\frac{\nabla f}{|\nabla f|}$$ with $f=f(x,y,z)=z-h(x,y)$ and $|\nabla f|\neq 0$. My question is, is it also correct to define $f$ as $f=h(x,y)-z$? I think they are the same since $f=z-h(x,y)=0$ and $f=h(x,y)-z=0$ but the following example shows they yield different answers. Suppose $z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. Case 1: $f=z-\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. Then $\nabla f=-\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\vec{i}-\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\vec{j}+\vec{k}$ and $|\nabla f|=\sqrt{2}$. Thus $$\hat{n}=-\frac{x}{\sqrt{2(x^2+y^2)}}\vec{i}-\frac{y}{\sqrt{2(x^2+y^2)}}\vec{j}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\vec{k}$$ 
Case 2: $f=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-z$. Then $\nabla f=\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\vec{i}+\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\vec{j}-\vec{k}$ and $|\nabla f|=\sqrt{2}$. Thus $$\hat{n}=\frac{x}{\sqrt{2(x^2+y^2)}}\vec{i}+\frac{y}{\sqrt{2(x^2+y^2)}}\vec{j}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\vec{k}$$ This shows that the $\vec{i}$, $\vec{j}$ and $\vec{k}$ components are of opposite sign to which I am confused.","['multivariable-calculus', 'vectors']"

1130005,"Cone splitting questions in Perelman's paper ""Elements on Morse theory on Alexandrov spaces""","I am reading Perelman's paper ""Elements on Morse theory on Alexandrov spaces"".
It is an important paper about the local structure of finite dimensional Alexandrov spaces. Perelman in this paper prove that Alexandrov space is a MCS-space , hence it has a conic structure locally.
But I find it hard to understand some of Perelman's comments in so called ""MCS-space"". Def . A metrizable space $M_n$ is a MCS-space of dimension $n$ if, for each $x\in M_n$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ and an compact MCS-space $M_{n-1}$ of dimension $n − 1$, such that there exists a homeomorphism from the cone of $M_{n-1}$ to $U$ such that it sends the cone point to $x$. Here, we regard the case of -1 dimension as the empty set and its cone as a single point. Perelman remarked under this definition that (a) Under the definition of MCS-space that the $l$-dimensional stratum consists of those points $x\in M_n$ whose conic  nbhd admits a topological splitting $\mathbb{R}^m\times C(M_{n-m-1})$ (here $C(M_{n-m-1})$ is a cone over an $n-1$ dimensional MCS-space) for all $m\leq l$. (b) The $l$-dimensional stratum is an $l$-manifold. First question, It seems that every point in a $n$-dim MCS-space has a neighborhood homeomorphic to  $\mathbb{R}^m\times C(M_{n-m-1})$ for some $m\leq n$. But I don't know why. Second question, I can not understand that why $l$-dimensional stratum is an $l$-manifold. In fact,
$A_l=$($l$-dimensional stratum$)\setminus$(($l-1$)-dimensional stratum) is an $l$-manifold, since any point in $\mathbb{R}^l\times \{v\}$ is contained in $A_l$, where $v$ is the cone vertex of $C(M_{n-m-1})$. Am I wrong? Can anyone helps me? Thanks!","['general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

X &= x^TE & d_x(X) = E\\
Y &= Ax & d_x(Y) = A\\

What does a generic rule look like for the Hadamard product $[a\odot b]_i=[a]_i\cdot [b]_i$? The Matrix-Cookbook states:
$$d(X\odot Y)=d(X)\odot Y+X\odot d(Y).$$ For example, the derivative of
$$ (x\odot y)^TA(x\odot y)$$

\begin{align*}
X &= (x\odot y)^TE & d_x(X) &= \left(d(x\odot y)\right)^TE\\

1130624,A question on the definition of tangent vectors as equivalence classes and directional derivatives,"I understand that a tangent vector, tangent to some point $p$ on some $n$-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M}$ can defined in terms of an equivalence class of curves $[\gamma]$ (where the curves are defined as $\gamma:(a,b)\rightarrow U\subset\mathcal{M}$, passing through said point, such that $\gamma (0)= p$), under the equivalence relation $$\gamma_{1} \sim \gamma_{2} \iff \left(\varphi\circ\gamma_{1}\right)'(0)= \left(\varphi\circ\gamma_{2}\right)'(0)$$
where $(U,\varphi )$ is some coordinate chart such that $\varphi :U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$, with $\varphi (p)= x= \lbrace x^{\mu}\rbrace$. Am I correct in assuming that this definition relies on the fact that the directional derivative of a function is independent of the curve one chooses to parametrise it by? If so, is this the correct way to prove it? Let $f:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a differential function of class $C^{k}$ and let $\gamma_{1}:(a,b)\rightarrow U$ and $\gamma_{2}:(a,b)\rightarrow U$ be two curves, parametrised by $t$ and $s$, respectively, both passing through the point $p\in U\subset\mathcal{M}$ such that $\gamma_{1} (0)=p= \gamma_{2} (0)$. Furthermore, suppose that $$\left(\varphi\circ\gamma_{1}\right)'(0)= \left(\varphi\circ\gamma_{2}\right)'(0)$$ (via the coordinate chart as defined above). We have then, that the directional derivative of the function $f$ through the point $p\in U\subset\mathcal{M}$ is given by $$\frac{df}{dt}\Biggr\vert_{t=0}= \frac{d(f\circ\gamma_{1})}{dt}\Biggr\vert_{t=0} = \frac{\partial f (p)}{\partial x^{\mu}}\left(\varphi\circ\gamma_{1}\right)'(0) = \frac{\partial f (p)}{\partial x^{\mu}}\left(\varphi\circ\gamma_{2}\right)'(0) = \frac{d(f\circ\gamma_{2})}{ds}\Biggr\vert_{s=0}$$
As such, the directional derivative of $f$ at $p\in U\subset\mathcal{M}$ is independent of the curve it's parametrised by. Given this we can define the a tangent vector $\dot{q}$ at a point $q\in\mathcal{M}$ as the equivalence class of curves passing though the point $q\in\mathcal{M}$ (as defined earlier). The tangent space to $\mathcal{M}$ at the point $q\in\mathcal{M}$ is then defined in the following manner $$\lbrace\dot{q}\rbrace = \lbrace [\gamma] \;\vert \quad\gamma (0)=q\rbrace$$ $\dot{q}$ then acts on functions $f$ (as defined earlier) to produce the directional derivative of $f$ at the point $q$ in the direction of $\dot{q}$ as follows $$\dot{q}[f] =\frac{d(f\circ\gamma)}{dt}\Biggr\vert_{t=0}$$
Would this be correct? (I'm deliberately using the notation $\dot{q}$ for the tangent vectors as I'm approaching it from a physicist's point of view, with the aim of motivating the phase space for Lagrangian dynamics, and explicitly showing why $q$ and $\dot{q}$ can be treated as independent variables in the Lagrangian). From this, can one then prove that the definition of a tangent vector as an equivalence class of curves is independent of coordinate chart. Suppose that $(U,\varphi )$ and $(V, \psi )$ are two coordinate charts such that $U \cap V \neq\emptyset$ and let $p\in U \cap V$. Let $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$ be two coordinate curves (as defined previously) such that $\gamma_{1} (0)=p=\gamma_{2} (0)$. It follows from the chain rule, that $$\left(\psi\circ\gamma_{1}\right)^{\prime}(0)=\left((\psi\circ\varphi^{-1})\circ (\varphi\circ\gamma_{1})\right)^{\prime}(0) \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \\ = \left(\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}\right)^{\prime}(\varphi (p))\left(\varphi\circ\gamma_{1}\right)^{\prime} (0) \qquad \\ = \left(\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}\right) ^{\prime}(\varphi (p))\left(\varphi\circ\gamma_{2}\right)^{\prime} (0) \qquad \\ = \left((\psi\circ\varphi^{-1})\circ (\varphi\circ\gamma_{2})\right)^{\prime}(0) \qquad\quad \\ = \left(\psi\circ\gamma_{2}\right)^{\prime}(0)\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad$$
As such, if the equivalence relation holds in one coordinate chart $(U,\varphi )$ then it holds in any other (as $(V, \psi )$ was chosen arbitrarily, other than it overlap with $(U, \varphi )$ in the neighbourhood of $p\in \mathcal{M}$). Would this be correct? Apologies in advance for the long-windedness of this post, just keen to check my understanding.","['vector-analysis', 'proof-verification', 'differential-geometry']"

In the general situation, $X$ only has finite mean, and in this case this approach does not work. I like this property because it makes conditional expectation relatively concrete, even in a relatively general situation: the conditional expectation of $X$ is just the orthogonal projection onto an appropriate subspace of the Hilbert space of random variables with finite variance. So I would like to try to extend a weaker version of it to the most general situation. My idea is as follows. Suppose $X$ has only finite mean, and take a sequence of random variables $X_n$ which converge in mean to $X$, such that each $X_n$ has finite variance. Of course they do not converge in mean square, but I do not require this here. Now consider the sequence $\mathbb{E}[X_n | \mathcal{A}]$. Does this sequence converge to $\mathbb{E}[X|\mathcal{A}]$?

Hence, the theta we find with $\theta = \tan^{-1}(\frac{b}{a})$ is the angle closes to the real axis on the left-side. However, we measure angle going counter-clockwise. Shouldn't we do the following computation to get the angle going clock-wise: $\pi - \tan^{-1}(\frac{b}{a})$?","['trigonometry', 'complex-numbers', 'algebra-precalculus']"

1130931,Variation of a signed measure,"This is Exercise 3.P in Bartle's The Elements of Integration and Lebesgue Measure . I think I have a proof but would appreciate it if anyone can spot any mistakes or suggest any improvements. If $\mu$ is a charge [Bartle's term for a finite signed measure] on a sigma-algebra $\Sigma$ , let $\nu$ be defined for $E \in \Sigma$ by $$\nu(E) = \sup \sum_{j=1}^{n}|\mu(A_j)|$$ where the supremum is taken over all finite disjoint collections $\{A_j\}$ in $\Sigma$ with $E = \cup_{j=1}^{n} A_j$ . Show that $\nu$ is a measure on $\Sigma$ . (It is called the **variation** of $\mu$ .) It is clear that $\nu(\emptyset) = 0$ and $\nu(E) \geq 0$ for all $E \in \Sigma$ , so we need to show that $\nu$ is countably additive. Suppose that $(E_k)$ is a disjoint sequence of sets in $\Sigma$ whose union is $E$ . For each $k$ , let $\{A_{jk}\}_{j=1}^{n_k}$ be a finite disjoint collection of sets in $\Sigma$ such that $E_k = \cup_{j=1}^{n_k}A_{jk}$ . Then $$\{A_{jk} : k=1,\ldots,N\ \text{and}\ j=1,\ldots,n_k\}\ \text{and}\ E\setminus(\cup_{k=1}^{N}E_k)$$ is a finite disjoint collection of sets in $\Sigma$ whose union is $E$ . Therefore, $$\sum_{k=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{n_k}|\mu(A_{jk})| \leq \sum_{k=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{n_k}|\mu(A_{jk})| + |\mu(E\setminus(\cup_{k=1}^{N}E_k))| \leq \nu(E)$$ Taking the supremum for each fixed $k$ , we obtain $$\sum_{k=1}^{N}\nu(E_k) \leq \nu(E)$$ Taking the limit as $N \to \infty$ , it follows that $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\nu(E_k) \leq \nu(E)$$ For the reverse inequality, fix $\epsilon > 0$ and let $\{B_m\}_{m=1}^{M}$ be a finite disjoint collection of sets in $\Sigma$ whose union is $E$ , such that $$\nu(E) \leq \sum_{m=1}^{M}|\mu(B_m)| + \epsilon$$ Note that $\{B_m \cap E_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a countable disjoint collection of sets in $\Sigma$ whose union is $B_m$ . Since $\mu$ is a charge, it is countably additive, so $$\mu(B_m) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mu(B_m \cap E_k)$$ Therefore, $$\begin{aligned}
\nu(E) &\leq \sum_{m=1}^{M}\left|\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mu(B_m \cap E_k)\right| + \epsilon \\
&\leq \sum_{m=1}^{M}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|\mu(B_m \cap E_k)| + \epsilon \\
&= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=1}^{M}|\mu(B_m \cap E_k)| + \epsilon \\
\end{aligned}$$ Changing the order of the summation is valid because of Tonneli’s Theorem, that is, the summands are nonnegative, so the double sum can be performed in any order without changing the result, even if it is infinite. Now $E_k$ is the disjoint union of $\{B_m \cap E_k : m = 1,\ldots,M\}$ , so $$\sum_{m=1}^{M}|\mu(B_m \cap E_k)| \leq \nu(E_k)$$ Therefore, $$\nu(E) \leq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\nu(E_k) + \epsilon$$ Since this inequality holds for any $\epsilon > 0$ , we conclude that $$\nu(E) \leq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\nu(E_k)$$","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'solution-verification']"

This is what I understand the first polar curve of a given algebraic curve to be (and of course it depends on my chosen arbitrary point). Like much of my recent education, this has been presented and I can do it, and now I have two curves, one of them being the polar curve of the other, and I have no idea why I've done this. The best I have so far is from Wiki, which tells me ""It is used to investigate the relationship between the curve and its dual, for example in the derivation of the Plücker formulas.""

 My idea is to use Kato-Rellich theorem; so for $f\in D(-\Delta)=H^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ we have
$$\Vert Vf\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)}\leq\Vert V\Vert_{L^3(\mathbb{R}^3)}\Vert f\Vert_{L^6(\mathbb{R}^3)}$$
Now I can use Gagliardo-Niremberg-Sobolev inequality to get
$$\Vert f\Vert_{L^6(\mathbb{R}^3)}\leq C\Vert\Delta f\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\Vert f\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)}^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
Now I can use Young inequality
$$\Vert f\Vert_{L^6(\mathbb{R}^3)}\leq C(\epsilon\Vert\Delta f\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)}+\frac{1}{\epsilon}\Vert f\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)})$$

equal to $g(n)\sim2C_{2}\frac{n}{ln^{2}(n)}$ where $C_{2}$is the twin prime constant. I was surprised with this

First of all I have to decide to make a $U$ substitution either for $\csc(x)$ or for $\cot(x)$, both of them are acceptable substitutions, I believe. Now, when I solve the integral after doing a $U$ substitution for $\csc(x)$ I get a different answer than when I do a $U$ substitution for $\cot(x)$. After observing that the answers were not matching I decided to rely on technology. I used my TI-89 calculator that gave me a different answer than when I do it on wolfram-alpha.

1131461,"If $f_n$ are measurable and $f_n\to f$ almost everywhere, then $f$ is measurable (values on a topological space)","In Folland's Real Analysis book, it's an exercise to prove: Given a complete measure $\mu$, if $f_0, f_1, f_2, \ldots$ are measurable, and $f_n \to f$ almost everywhere, then $f$ is measurable. I can prove it using other propositions from the book in the simple case that the functions take values on the reals (or complex plane): $$ f_0,f_1,f_2,\ldots,f:X\to\mathbb R\text{ or }\mathbb C$$ Also, I think that the point of the exercise is indeed to prove it just to these cases. But I'm curious if it's possible to generalize this result for functions $$f_0,f_1,f_2,\ldots,f:X\to Y$$ where $Y$ is a generic measure space. Of course, we need some structure on $Y$ to talk about convergence, so $Y$ should be a topological space, with a measure defined on its Borel $\sigma$-algebra. Or maybe we need $Y$ to be a metric space? I think it must be easy when $Y=\mathbb R^n$ or $\mathbb C^n$, using the fact that a function is measurable iff its coordinate-functions are measurable. To be precise, my question is: is it true that Folland's proposition above holds for functions takings values on arbitrary topological spaces with Borel measures? If not, is it true for functions taking values on arbitrary metric spaces with Borel measures? If not, what kind of property do we need on the range space of the functions to be able to prove the quoted proposition above? P.S.: The proof that Folland's book leads to is based on $\sup$s and $\inf$s; that's why I'm having a hard time generalizing it to arbitrary spaces.","['general-topology', 'measure-theory', 'convergence-divergence']"
